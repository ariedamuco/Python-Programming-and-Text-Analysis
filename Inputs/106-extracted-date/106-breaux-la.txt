   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague from Nevada for expressing his thoughts and concerns with S. 2792, and I want to express my thoughts on this matter as we pass this legislation. 
   I agree that it was never the intent of S. 2792 to circumvent regulation of gaming. This bill simply provides for the Coushatta Tribe to lease or transfer land without further approval. This bill in no way provides for any gaming regulatory loopholes.

   Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding me some time to make some comments on this very important legislation. 
   The Older Americans Act is a piece of legislation that is incredibly important, not only to the 14 percent of all Americans who are legally classified as being elderly--those who are over the age of 65--but it is a piece of legislation that is incredibly important, not only to them but also to their children, to their grandchildren, and to other members of their family and friends who are concerned that, while we make great strides in technology in this country in keeping people living longer, it is also extremely important we recognize that just having medical technology to allow people to live longer is not as important as also making sure we allow them to live better. 
   It is one thing to live longer, but if you are living longer in conditions that are not what we, as Americans, think are ideal, sometimes people wonder whether, in fact, it is really worth it. 
   So the Older Americans Act clearly addresses some of these types of issues and questions about how do we, with medical science, as a society, allow our citizens to enjoy living longer lives but also living better, more fruitful lives in their golden years. 
   Part of that is the Older Americans Act, which provides, in many cases, some of the services that allow people to live better lives. It really is a wonder that this act is supported not only by seniors in this country but, I think, by most Americans by a very large margin. It has not been reauthorized in over 5 years. People would say: What is the matter, Congress? Don't you realize the importance and the numbers of older Americans who depend on this particular piece of legislation? 
   In many cases, they depend on it for their transportation because many seniors are homebound and have no way of getting around. It is a program that provides hot meals delivered to the homes of seniors who do not have the ability to go outside their home for meals. That is extremely important. It is a program that encourages the employment of more and more seniors in the workforce, which is incredibly important at a time when we actually have a labor shortage in this country. It has been shown, very clearly, that the shortfall can be made up, in many cases, by talented, experienced, learned seniors who can contribute to the workforce past their normal retirement years. 
   It is a program that provides assistance for adult day 
   care, which is extremely important now, as more and more of the traditional caregivers are working themselves. It is a program that helps provide adult day care for seniors in this country, which is incredibly important. 
   It is a program that addresses the question of abuse prevention, and helps elders in this country to know what their civil rights are to make sure they are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous telemarketers, for instance. 
   All of those things are done by the Older Americans Act, which expired 5 years ago. 
   Finally, today, this body--and the House did a couple days ago, I think--will be able to reauthorize this very important program. 
   I am delighted that part of the program contains legislation that I have introduced called the National Caregiver Program. I introduced it along with Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY and other distinguished Members of the Senate. This is now going to be part of the Older Americans Act. 
   If I may take a moment to say what the National Caregiver Program does, I think it addresses something that is an incredibly serious problem, and one that is growing every day, of the so-called ``sandwich generation''--those adults in this country who are trying to raise small children but also are having to divide up their time by helping to take care of their senior parents. That is a very serious problem for many Americans--making sure I am taking care of my children, that I am raising them properly, but that I am also taking care of my parents who have given me so much and it is now time for me to help them in their golden years. 
   The National Caregiver Program will provide $125 million a year. It is an authorization to provide assistance for all of those who are caring for an aging parent or an aging spouse, for instance, in their home. I think this is very important and something that this legislation, for the first time, will make available. 
   We have had hearings in Louisiana by the aging committee, of which I serve as the ranking Democratic member, with Chairman CHUCK GRASSLEY. We are told there are about 22 million families in America who are struggling every day in their lives to provide care for their children and at the same time trying to balance that with caring for a senior parent or a senior spouse. 
   The National Caregiver Program that is now part of this legislation will provide information to these families about available services of which many of them are not aware. This program will offer individual counseling to these family caregivers about support groups and how you go about making caregiving work more efficiently and better. 
   It will provide respite care, which is so incredibly important. Sometimes families who are providing 24-hour-a-day care, 7 days a week, 12 months out of the year for their children, and are trying to do it for their parents as well--in the same home--quite frankly,  need a break. They need a rest from this 24-hour-a-day burden, which they are happy to do. It is a joy to be able to be in a position to provide this type of service. But every now and then you simply need a break. 
   The National Caregiver Program will be able to provide what we call respite care, to give someone a break, to get out of the house, to go out with their family and enjoy a meal outside of the home, or to take a child to a school function, knowing that 
   someone will be there to take care of their adult family member who still resides in their home. Also, it can provide some other supplemental services, which I happen to think is incredibly important. 
   So I say to my colleagues--both on the Republican side as well as on our side of the aisle--this is good legislation. It is important legislation. Everywhere I went in Louisiana over the past couple days, I spoke with senior groups and aging councils, and they all asked the same question: Senator, when is Congress going to get around to passing the Older Americans Act? For the life of me, I never had a good reason to tell them why we have not done it before. 
   Is this a program that has some things that are not run 100 percent correctly? We have had examples of that in the past, but you cannot tell me a Federal program that can't be improved upon.

   Mr. BREAUX. Let me conclude by saying there were problems in the program back in the early 1990s that are being corrected--have been corrected. I think the fact is, Congress is showing that we are going to provide careful and adequate oversight to this program. I think it is very important. We, on the aging committee, have spent an incredible amount of time, under Chairman GRASSLEY's leadership, looking at programs that benefit seniors. We are making sure we have GAO looking at these programs, and making sure they are run properly. I can tell you, they are getting a great deal more scrutiny than they have had in the past. The end result is that we have a better program than we had back in the early 1990s. 
   It is essential. It is important. It is necessary. It has widespread, across-the-board support. I commend Senator JEFFORDS and Senator KENNEDY for at last being able to bring this to the floor of the Senate. They eliminated all the roadblocks. I think this is well on its way to passing as a clean bill. I strongly support it and strongly oppose any amendments which would probably result in the bill not passing because of the lateness of the hour. I add my strong voice to the support of those who know this is the right thing to do and the right time to do it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to send to the desk a bill that is called the Freedom to Fish Act. The legislation cosponsored by Senator HUTCHISON addresses an unsettling situation arising over access to our nation's public coastal resources. I understand that it is very late in the session to be introducing new legislation, but I believe this matter is significantly important to require immediate recognition. There is a growing movement to limit the use and enjoyment of America's coastal and ocean waters. This restriction of public access is occurring under the guise of the establishment of marine protected areas. Many in the environmental community are lauding the creation of these undersea national parks as the silver bullet solution to our over-exploited fisheries and degraded habitat. The bill I am introducing today aims to correct a system that would unfairly penalize our nation's approximately ten million marine recreational anglers. For while I support the goal of healthy marine fisheries, I disagree strongly with any method that unnecessarily limits our citizens' access to public waters. 
   I believe that my record clearly indicates my dedication to protecting and improving the health of our oceans and coasts. However, I believe that restricting public access to those waters is not the appropriate vehicle for accomplishing that goal in most cases. The notion of a marine park is certainly not new, having its origins in successful land management practices. The establishment of wildlife refuges, national parks and forests has shown clear benefits to the natural species living on those lands and fresh waters. However, in the transfer from the land to the marine waters one very important aspect of the protected area has been neglected. While sport fishing is nearly universally accepted throughout this nation's terrestrial parks, and wilderness areas, those advocating the use of marine parks take pains to specifically restrict the access of recreational anglers. This seems ironic to me, as an increasing number of recreational anglers practice catch and release fishing and all contribute money to their state's fish and game departments through the payment of license fees and taxes. I believe these anglers to be among this nation's first conservationists and their contributions to the resource need to be recognized. 
   In response to criticism and attacks against our Nation's sportsmen and women, I introduce the Freedom to Fish Act. The act establishes guidelines and safeguards by which the public's right to use and enjoy these resources is preserved in all but the most serious cases. It provides assurances that the angling public will have a place at the table when decisions are made regarding their use of the resource. Second, the Freedom to Fish Act will ensure that recreational anglers will be prohibited from an area only when they have been shown to be causing significant adverse effects on that fishery resource. Further, should prohibitions be justified, this bill prevents areas larger than scientifically necessary from being closed. In those cases, criteria will be established so that once certain goals have been reached, the area will reopen to the public immediately. Restricting public admission to our coastal waters should not be our first course of action, but rather our last resort. Open access to fishing is the single most important element of recreational fishing. We must defend public access against those that would try to restrict it under the cloak of marine resource protection. With that, I submit the Freedom to Fish Act for your review and discussion.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, congratulations to the chairman and Senator KOHL for the work they have done on this Agriculture appropriations bill. It indeed has been a very difficult endeavor. I plan to vote for final passage of this Agriculture appropriations bill because I think it is very important and there are many very important things in it dealing with agriculture, which is with what we would think an Agriculture appropriations conference report should deal. 
   I highlight, however, one thing that I think is very bad public policy; that is, the question of an amendment to this bill allowing for the importation of foreign drugs manufactured in foreign countries, under foreign standards, to be imported into the United States under the guise of ``this is the solution'' or even a partial solution to the high costs of prescription drugs and the unavailability of prescription drugs under our Medicare program for the 40 million senior citizens in this country who need prescription drugs. 
   Many people said when the bill left the Senate that this provision that was added was a sham. I thought it was a sham when it left and it has come back and it is a worse sham than when it left. This is ``Son of Sham,'' 
   or a double sham, in the sense that this makes absolutely no sense. 
   Members of both sides of the aisle have said: We are against drug price controls because that is un-American; that is not the way we encourage businesses to operate; we want businesses to compete against each other and the companies that can do the best job for the best price get the business. That is what the American system is all about. 
   Instead, we have in this bill a provision that says, we might not like price controls in this country, but we are going to import not only the drugs from other countries but their price control systems--as if that somehow makes it all right. The concept is other countries have price controls; therefore, it is cheaper. The fact is, in Canada, to which so many of our people point, there are some drugs that are cheaper because of price controls, but there are many other drugs that, in fact, cost more in Canada than they do here. In many cases, the drugs we have here are simply not available in Canada at all, or maybe a year or two after they are available in the United States, because of the adverse impact of a price control system we are now trying to import into this country. 
   In addition to that reason that this is bad policy, there are about 10 former Food and Drug Administration agencies that said: Wait a minute; hold on, Congress. What in the world are you doing? This is not a safe process you are legislating into law. We are not going to be able to determine the safety of these drugs. Maybe in Canada it would be all right, but what about Pakistan or what about a Third World country or what about a country we have very little to do with? Are we going to let the drugs come in from those countries as well, which this bill allows? How are we going to be able to guarantee that the same safety or precautions that are in effect in a Third World nation are in effect here in the United States in order to protect the consuming public? How are we going to know that the little pill that is the same color and approximately the same size has in it the same material that it has in this country, that has been approved by our Food and Drug Administration? 
   This may give some of our colleagues a feeling we have done something to solve the prescription drug cost problem for our seniors. It does not. It does not come close. This is not even a fig leaf of coverage for those who reply to: What have you done on the issue of prescription drugs? The answer is, we probably made the system worse by bringing in drugs the quality of which we cannot guarantee. We cannot guarantee where they came from, how they were produced, or who has been protecting them since they left the factory and ultimately found their way into the United States. The answer is not that complicated. What it takes is a lot of political courage to do what is right and to tell our seniors there are no real easy answers to this problem. 
   What we need to provide to America's seniors is the same thing that I have as a Member of the Senate, that every one of my colleagues has and every one of the Members of the other body has and the other 9 million Federal employees have; that is, coverage under their health insurance plans that cover prescription drugs. When I walk into a drugstore, I do not pay full retail price, not one of us does. We get a discount because we do volume purchasing under our Federal insurance plan. In addition to the volume purchasing, we also have a very small copay, which allows us, instead of having to pay full 
   price, to pay only a fraction of the price. That is the same type of system we should put into effect for our Nation's seniors.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BREAUX. I don't want to belabor the point, but when I walk into a drugstore, the retail price may be $100. But because of volume purchasing, it may only cost me $70, and because I have coverage, I don't pay $70. I pay a small copayment of maybe $30. I walk out of the drugstore with $100 worth of drugs paying only $30 because I am covered. A Medicare recipient who has no coverage pays the full retail price of $100. That is what is wrong with the system as it is currently constructed. 
   The answer clearly is not to say we are going to allow people to import drugs from Bangladesh or Pakistan or other countries around the world where we cannot guarantee the quality. That is not the way to do it. It was a sham when it left the Senate. It is a sham as it is being presented to the Senate today. We should have the political courage to address this in a very serious way. 
   To those of our two colleagues who have worked so hard on this, I thank them for their understanding and their participation. I do not fault them for what has happened. It passed the House by a huge margin. It passed the Senate by a huge margin. It is not the right policy and doesn't solve the problem. I  wanted to bring it to the attention of my colleagues. 
   Having said that, I intend to vote for the overall product because of the many good things it has in it for American agriculture and American farmers. I think our two leaders are to be congratulated for that product they bring before the Senate.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 1654, the NASA Authorization bill. First, I thank Chairman MCCAIN and the other Senate conferees. We have come to a bi-partisan agreement after many months of conference and now we have the opportunity to pass a NASA Authorization bill for the first time since fiscal year 1993. 
   As you know, NASA is one of the agencies of government that captures the spirit of the American people. Who can fail to be awed by the liftoff of a Space Shuttle, a walk in space, or the discovery of water on Mars? Because NASA is such a treasure, it is important that we in Congress exercise our duty to oversee and authorize its programs. 
   And that is just what this conference report does. H.R. 1654 would authorize funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at the appropriated level of $13.6 billion in FY 2000. It provides $14.2 billion in FY 2001 and $14.6 billion in FY 2002, slightly more than the President's requested level. 
   The bill fully funds the Space Shuttle program, the International Space Station, and the Space Launch Initiative. It provides authorizations above the requested levels for the Space Grant College program, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, EPSCoR, and NASA's research into aircraft noise reduction and cleaner, more energy-efficient aircraft engine technology--research that can improve the quality of life of Americans who live near airports. 
   When we were nearing the finish line with this bill, the Administration contacted us about several key concerns they had with the bill. We have resolved their concerns, and now I would like to run through these issues: our interaction with International Space Station partners, commercialization of the Space Station, Trans-Hab, Shuttle Safety, and Triana. 
   International partners and the space station: We successfully altered House-proposed lauguage which was overly punitive. The provision contained in H.R. 1654 encourages NASA to provide for equitable use of the Space Station by seeking reduction in utilization rights (like crew allocation) for International Partners that willfully violate any of their commitments to the program. 
   Space station commercialization: The conferees agreed to leave in place the Space Station Commercial Development program and did not agree to the House's proposal to eliminate the program. We did, however, shorten the period of time for which the program is authorized from 2004 to 2002. The program will be up for reauthorization at the same time that NASA itself is due for reauthorization. 
   Trans-hab: NASA has considered replacing the ``hard'' habitation module for the Space Station with an inflatable ``Trans-Hab.'' The House had sought to prohibit NASA from using its funds to develop an inflatable habitation module. The conference agreement clarifies that NASA is permitted to lease or use a commercially-developed Trans-Hab. It is my understanding that NASA is currently evaluating a very serious commercial proposal for an inflatable space structure capable of accommodating humans in space, and this language should allow them to participate in such an agreement. 
   Shuttle safety: The Administration was concerned that the Senate-passed cost cap on the International Space Station and Shuttle flights to assemble the Station might send the wrong message about Shuttle and Station crew safety. That concern sent up a red flag to the conferees--no cost limitation proposed in this legislation should make NASA hesitate for one moment in launching the Shuttle if a life was at stake. No one wants to jeopardize the life and safety of the crew of the Space Station. We inserted language to ensure that the cap would not apply to costs incurred to ensure or enhance the safety or reliability of the Space Shuttle and another provision to allow the Administrator to use monies provided beyond the cap to improve safety or to launch a shuttle to protect the Station and its crew. 
   Triana: Finally, the House agreed to take out its provision to terminate the Triana program. Triana will be the world's first Earth-observing mission to L1, the gravitational mid-point between the sun and the Earth. From this vantage point, the satellite has a continuous view of the Sun-lit portion of the Earth. Over 90 percent of the instrument development has already taken place, and we've already spent about $40 million. 
   NASA highlighted several legislative provisions which they feel would be beneficial, yet are not included in the bill. While I would not support all of those provisions, I am disappointed we could not include some of the provisions that represent their greatest needs in this Conference Report. 
   I would also like to highlight a few of H.R. 1654's other major provisions. The Conference Report imposes a $25.0 billion cost cap for International Space Station development and a $17.7 billion cost cap for Space Shuttle launch costs in connection with Station assembly. The cap would not apply to operations, research, or crew return activities after the Station is complete. An additional contingency fund of $5 billion for Station development and $3.5 billion for Space Shuttle is authorized to provide flexibility in case of an emergency or other unusual circumstance. 
   As you know, I am a strong supporter of the International Space Station Program. The Space Shuttle Discovery is currently on the 100th Space Shuttle mission, putting cargo and other items in place so that the Station is ready to be occupied by its permanent crew next month. 
   The cap on Station development in the bill does not seek to alter or impede that program in any way. It merely seeks to limit the development costs so we stick to the plan and put a fully-operational Space Station on orbit in a timely manner. 
   The bill also directs NASA, after Congressional review of their plan, to establish a non-governmental organization (NGO) to manage Space Station research and commercial activities upon completion of the Station. I understand that some members are concerned about this provision. I will simply note: (1) NASA is already in the process of evaluating and establishing an NGO to manage station research; and (2) our bill allows Congress nearly 4 months to react to NASA's proposal before it can be implemented. If we don't like what they come back with, we can tell them not to do it. 
   H.R. 1654 represents the culmination of several years of hard work, and it is a good piece of legislation. I don't like every provision in the bill, but it represents a fine compromise--and one it looked like we might never reach. Again, I would like to thank Chairman MCCAIN and Senator FRIST for their hard work and to thank our staffs, in particular Floyd DesChamps, Elizabeth Prostic, and Jean Toal Eisen. 
   I urge the swift adoption of the conference report.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, on the evening of Friday, November 3, the people of Shreveport will gather to pay tribute to one of the most exceptional people the State of Louisiana has ever produced, Virginia Shehee. The tribute to Virginia is organized by the Biomedical Research Foundation of northwest Louisiana, whose establishment is but one of the remarkable achievements in the life of this remarkable woman. 
   It is my pleasure and honor to tell my colleagues in the United States Senate about my friend Virginia Shehee. She is a superb model for everything she has done: wife, mother, businesswoman, political leader, community activist and economic visionary. My former colleague, Senator Bennett Johnston, once said, ``In a state that is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, Virginia Shehee may be Louisiana's single greatest natural resource.'' I certainly know that is a view shared by many of those who know Virginia best and who have benefited from her lifetime of dedication to improve lives in Shreveport and northwest Louisiana. 
   Nothing better exemplifies her accomplishments than the creation of the Biomedical Research Foundation, and the construction of the Biomedical Research Institute that today stands proudly adjacent to the LSU Medical Center in Shreveport. It is an understatement to say that none of this would have been possible without the foresight, determination and hard work of Virginia, and other community leaders nearly 20 years ago. 
   Like so many advances in today's new economy, Shreveport's move into the world of biomedicine and biotechnology emerged from the difficulties caused by the decline of the old economy. In northwest Louisiana, where the steadily declining price in oil in the early 1980's caused community leaders to conclude that efforts had to be undertaken quickly to produce other economic sustenance for the area, they of course turned to Virginia Shehee. 
   In a matter of a few short years, Virginia had formed the Biomedical Research Foundation and gathered several million dollars in local support. She leveraged local dollars into a much larger state support and then converted that into significant support by the Congress and the Department of Energy. As a result, a 10-story, $40 million, state-of-the-art wet-lab research facility was built that today houses world-class researchers and serves as a growing economic engine, producing knowledge-based jobs for northwest Louisiana. 
   Beyond the work taking place in its own facilities, Biomed can point with great pride to the growing number of companies it has attracted to Shreveport's own technology park, InterTech, with technologies ranging from manufacturing and diagnostics to telemedicine and orthopedic devices. We in the Louisiana delegation often point to the success of Biomed as a textbook model of partnerships between Washington and local communities looking to build a better future for their citizens. 
   It is true, Mr. President, that Biomed has become a success because it has merit on its side. But all of us who have played some small part in this effort know that a big reason for the success is Virginia Shehee is someone who long ago learned not to take no for an answer. Her efforts have led to a mighty legacy in science and economic development in Shreveport. It is fitting the facility is now the ``Virginia K. Shehee Biomedical Research Institute,'' and it is fitting the community  is gathering next month to say thanks. It is my pleasure to join so many in saying how blessed Louisiana is to have Virginia Shehee's generous service and how fortunate I am to have her friendship.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today as ranking member of the Special Committee on Aging and am proud to inform you that after the culmination of years of investigation and attention to the relationship between nursing home staff levels and quality of care, today Senator GRASSLEY--my colleague on the Committee--and I are introducing legislation on this important issue. Our ``Nursing Facility Staff Improvement Act of 2000'' would encourage increased quantities of staff but also would improve the quality of those caring for our loved ones in nursing homes. 
   Chairman GRASSLEY and I have been committed to ensuring that our seniors are getting the best quality care possible in our nation's nursing homes, and the Aging Committee has held numerous hearings regarding the best way to reach this goal. We have been working with HCFA to determine the best way to ensure state surveyors are appropriately monitoring the quality of care their residents receive. Additionally, we held a hearing to learn from industry representatives about the links between nursing home bankruptcies and quality care. And we have continually and consistently sent the message that we will remain involved and committed to improvement for as long as it takes. 
   The bill we introduce today--the Nursing Facility Staff Improvement Act of 2000--is the result of bipartisan efforts to put something on the books that will not only provide real incentives for nursing home staff to strive to do their jobs well but will also be a huge step toward defining what optional nursing home care should entail. I commend President Clinton for building on the Aging Committee's findings and making this very important issue one of his priorities. 
   More specifically, this bill will: 
   Call for the Secretary of HHS to establish a competitive grant program to the states to increase or improve the recruitment and retention of direct care nursing staff. Provide for $1 billion over two years. Require that HCFA complete Phase II of their Nursing Home Staffing study and report back not later than July 1, 2001. Appropriate use of grant monies would include: establishing career ladders for nurse aides; improving nursing management; providing additional training programs for staff. 
   In conclusion, it is exciting for me to put forth a piece of legislation that offers tangible incentives to current and future staff and also directly encourages appropriate nursing home care for our loved ones. This effort has truly been one of joint cooperation between my Republican colleague on the Aging Committee and myself and I am proud to introduce it to you today.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Mother Katharine Drexel. Born into one of the wealthiest families in America in 1858, Mother Katharine turned down a life of privilege to start the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament in 1891. She dedicated her life to building a brighter future for underprivileged African-American and Native American children. 
   In honor of her hard work and dedication to the disadvantaged and disenfranchised, on October 1--just 45 years after her death--Pope John Paul II canonized Mother Katharine into sainthood, the highest recognition a Catholic can receive. She is the fifth American to reach this honor, and only the second who was born in America. 
   The prestigious Xavier University of Louisiana owes its entire existence to Mother Katharine Drexel. When founded in New Orleans in 1925, Xavier's mission was to prepare its students for positions of leadership. Today, Xavier is widely recognized for sending more African-Americans to medical school than any college in America. Its 70 percent medical and dental school acceptance rate is almost twice the national average, and 93 percent of those who enter these programs earn their degree. 
   Xavier also ranks first nationally in the number of African-American students who earn degrees in biology, physics, pharmacy and the physical sciences. In fact, since 1927 Xavier has graduated nearly 25 percent of the black pharmacists practicing in the United States. 
   Thousands of Xavier's graduates are prominent scientists, scholars, musicians, and community leaders in Louisiana and across the country. Notable graduates include Department of Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, and retired, four-star Air Force General Bernard Randolph, former head of the Space and Defense Systems Command. 
   Proof of Mother Katharine's superior works lies in the achievements of three of her former students. One of Mother Katharine's students at Xavier was a young man who shined shoes, but wanted an education. Today, Dr. Norman Francis is president of Xavier University and a nationally recognized leader in higher education. 
   Another of her former students, Lionel Hampton, found his gift for music under Mother Katharine's tutelage at Xavier. Hampton later earned platinum and gold records, and became the first African-American to play in the Benny Goodman Band. Hampton joined another jazz great and New Orleanian, Louis Armstrong, to play for Pope Pius XII. 
   Mother Katharine also spread her goodwill elsewhere across the country. When Marie Allen entered Mother Katharine's St. Michael's Indian School in Window Rock, Arizona, she was an impoverished young child who spoke no English. Today, Dr. Marie Allen heads the Navaho Nation Special Diabetes Program to educate Native Americans about diabetes, a deadly disease that plagues American Indian reservations. Even more, over the past 10 years, 90 percent of students graduating from St. Michael's Indian School have gone to college. 
   These are just three examples of the multitude of students who have been inspired to greatness by Mother Katharine Drexel. In the midst of a hostile  culture, she used kindness and compassion to fight injustice and indignities, and in the process forged a brighter future for America's poor and underprivileged. 
   When Katharine Drexel died at the age of 97 in 1955, more than 500 of her disciples were teaching in 63 schools on American Indian reservations and in African-American communities. This is a true testament to her ability to inspire and lead. 
   History is full of truly remarkable people whose individual acts of kindness have left an indelible mark on our hearts, our souls and our conscience. Mother Katharine Drexel is no different. Her actions are a true testament to the power of strong religious faith and a moral obligation to those less fortunate. 
   On behalf of the thousands of people around the world who have been touched by her work, I pay tribute to the life and work of Mother Katharine Drexel. She may have been a teacher to some, but Mother Katharine is a saint to many.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak to my colleagues in this body as well as to our colleagues in the other body regarding the subject on which the Senate has spent a considerable amount of time; that is, pipeline safety, legislation which passed the Senate by a unanimous vote, with Republicans and Democrats supporting a unanimous consent request to pass this legislation without any dissent and without any arguments against it whatsoever. 
   On September 9, that bill passed the Senate and is now pending over in the other body where our House colleagues are taking a look at this legislation, trying to figure out what course they should take. 
   This legislation passed this body by unanimous consent because of the good work for over a year by colleagues in both parties. I particularly commend and thank the chairman, who I understand is coming over from the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, for his good work and for working with me as a member of the committee but also taking the rather unusual step of inviting other interested Senators to actually participate in the markup in the Commerce Committee. 
   I credit Senator MCCAIN for making it possible for Senator MURRAY of Washington to come over and actually sit in on the hearings, which is unusual for a Member, to take the time not only to attend to her duties in her own committee but to take time to listen to witnesses in another committee, which she did sitting at the podium with those of us on the Commerce Committee and also participating in asking questions. 
   It was a good combination between what Senator MCCAIN allowed, which was a little unusual, and what Senator MURRAY was able to participate in because of her strong interest and because of what has happened in her State with the recent tragic accident involving a pipeline which exploded, resulting in the tragic death of individuals from her State. 
   The result of those hearings was a compromise piece of legislation, which is a 100-percent improvement over the current situation with regard to how we look at the issue of pipeline safety. This is an issue that is extremely important to my State. We have over 40,000 miles of buried natural gas pipelines in the State of Louisiana. 
   If you look at a map of our State, it shows all of the buried pipelines. It looks like a map of spaghetti in an Italian restaurant because we have pipelines all over our State transporting the largest amount of natural gas coming from the offshore Gulf of Mexico as well as onshore pipelines that distribute gas not just to the constituents of my State but to constituents throughout the United States who depend upon Louisiana for a dependable source of natural gas. Pipelines in Louisiana are important not just to Louisianians but also to people from throughout this Nation. 
   The bill we have is one that requires periodic pipeline testing. It says if we can do it from an internal inspection, we will do it that way. If that is not possible, we have to do it with what we call a ``direct assessment'' of the lines, which actually means companies would have to dig them up and physically inspect the lines. 
   We require enhanced operator qualifications to make sure the people who are doing the work are trained and have a background in this particular area. We call for investments in technology to look at better ways of doing what is necessary to ensure their safety. 
   States would be given an increased role. But I have to say that the primary role would be the Federal Government's because these are interstate pipelines we are talking about under the pipeline safety area. 
   Communities would also be given increased involvement. I think it is important to let them know where the  lines are and that they are being inspected and also to hear their suggestions. They don't regulate the pipeline safety requirements, but they should be involved by being heard. 
   I think to the credit of everybody, particularly Senator MURRAY, this type of feature involving local community involvement is 100 percent better than it used to be because in the past there was very little involvement whatsoever. 
   The problem we take to the floor today to talk about is time. This is not rocket science. We don't have a lot of time to complete this bill. We hope our colleagues in the House who use this Senate vehicle will bring it to the floor in the other body and handle it in an expeditious fashion. 
   I repeat, this bill passed the Senate by a unanimous vote. It should not be controversial. It should be something that our friends and colleagues in the other body, Republican or Democrat, would be able to say we worked together with our Senate colleagues in an equal fashion and came to an agreement that this is good legislation. 
   It increases the safety of pipelines that are buried throughout the United States to help assure that we will not have some of the tragic events we have had in the past. The companies we have dealt with in my State support this measure. They want some improvements. They have been very helpful in making suggestions, as well as individuals and groups of concerned citizens who have made recommendations. We have taken all of them into consideration. We have a good piece of legislation that we hope our colleagues will be able to take up. Let's get it signed. If we let some of the details guide the actions in the other body, unfortunately, we may end up with nothing instead of a good bill. 
   I think we should recommend this to our colleagues and do so today.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues support the National Recording Preservation Act, legislation that maintains and preserves America's most significant recordings during the first century of recorded sound for future generations to enjoy. This legislation is especially important to my state of Louisiana, which has its own rich and distinct musical tradition. 
   Louisiana is known around the world for having a culture all its own. We are best known for our good music, good food and good times. We especially celebrate our cultural heritage through our music. 
   The Storyville district in New Orleans is said to be the birthplace of jazz--America's only indigenous musical genre. Louis Armstrong, perhaps the most influential jazz artist of all time, grew up orphaned in New Orleans when jazz music was coming of age. 
   Acadiana is the home of great cajun and zydeco artists like the late Beau Jocque, the late Clifton Chenier, Michael Doucet and Beausoleil, and Zachary Richard, all of whom communicate to the rest of the world what life is like on the bayou. 
   In the northern part of our state, Shreveport's Municipal Auditorium was the home of the Louisiana Hayride, where Elvis Presley got his first break after being turned down by the Grand Ole Opry in Tennessee. The Louisiana Hayride shaped the country music scene in the 1940's and 50's by showcasing artists like Hank Williams, Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson in its weekly Saturday night radio broadcasts. 
   Bluesmen like Tabby Thomas and Snooks Eaglin have kept the Delta blues tradition alive and well in Louisiana. The Neville Brothers, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, all the talented members of the Marsalis family, and many others, continue to keep us connected to our culture and help us celebrate it. 
   According to the Louisiana Music Commission, the overall economic impact of the music industry in Louisiana is about $2.2 billion as of 1996, up from $1.4 billion in 1990. So music isn't just important to my state's culture, it is important to its economy. Unfortunately, since many recordings are captured only on perishable materials like tape, we are in danger of losing these priceless artifacts to time and decay. 
   Recognizing the importance of preserving Louisiana's musical heritage, I have sponsored The National Recording Preservation Act. This legislation, which is modeled after a similar law to preserve America's disappearing film recordings, creates a National Recording Registry within the Library of Congress 
   The registry will identify the most historically, aesthetically and culturally significant recordings of the first century of recorded sound and maintains these for future generations to enjoy. The registry will include works as diverse as slave songs, opera, world music and heavy metal. I hope Louisiana's many and varied contributions to the field of music would be well represented in this national registry. 
   The National Recording Preservation Act directs the Librarian of Congress to select up to 25 recordings or groups of recordings for the registry each year. Nominations will be taken from the general public, as well as from industry representatives. Recordings will be eligible for selection 10 years after their creation. 
   To help the Librarian of Congress implement a comprehensive recording preservation program, this legislation establishes a National Recording Preservation Board. The board will work with artists, archivists, educators, historians, copyright owners, recording industry representatives and others to establish the program. 
   The bill also charters a National Recording Preservation Foundation to raise funds to promote the preservation of recordings and ensure the public's access to the registry. 
   To maintain the success of the music industry in Louisiana, we must strive to inspire our youth by exposing them to their musical heritage. This legislation helps us take steps to cultivate our traditions and our young artists, and will allow us to continue to attract tourists to the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and the Zydeco Festival in Plaisance, Louisiana. 
   Congress should enact the National Recording Preservation Act so future generations can fully appreciate Louisiana's contributions to the history of recorded music in our country.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Missing Children Tax Fairness Act. 
   As a father and grandfather, I know there is no greater fear than having a child taken from you. No family should have to go through such a horrible tragedy, yet in 1999 alone, approximately 750,000 children were reported missing. The parents of these missing children must face the daily reality that they may never find their children or even know their fate, yet most never lose hope or give up the search for any clue. It seems unfathomable that families in such a tragic predicament would be faced with the added burden of higher taxation, but that is exactly what is happening under current tax policy. 
   Recently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued an advisory opinion which stated that the families of missing children may claim their child as a dependent only in the year of the kidnapping. However, in the following years, no such deduction may be taken, regardless of if the child's room is still being maintained and money is still being spent on the search. The IRS Chief Counsel admitted that this issue is ``not free from doubt'' but concluded that, in the absence of legal authority to the contrary, denying the dependency exemption was consistent with the intent of the law. I believe this issue should be decided differently and that Congress must remedy this unjust situation. 
   The Missing Children Tax Fairness Act will clarify the treatment of missing children with respect to certain basic tax benefits and ensure that the families of these children will not be penalized by the tax code. It makes certain that families will not lose the dependency exemption, child credit, or earned income credit because their child was taken from them. I believe this a fair and equitable solution to a tax situation faced by families who are victims of one of the most heinous crimes imaginable--child abduction. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to address a long-standing problem which adversely affects the safe and reliable maritime transport of oil products. The legislation I am introducing today will eliminate the application and use of strict criminal liability statutes, statutes that do not require a showing of criminal intent or even the slightest degree of negligence, for maritime transportation-related oil spill incidents. 
   Through comprehensive Congressional action that led to the enactment and implementation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, commonly referred to as ``OPA90'', the United States has successfully reduced the number of oil spills in the maritime environment and has established a cooperative public/private partnership to respond effectively in the diminishing number of situations when an oil spill occurs. Nonetheless, over the past decade, the use of the unrelated strict criminal liability statutes that I referred to above has undermined the spill prevention and response objectives of OPA90, the very objectives that were established by the Congress to preserve the environment, safeguard the public welfare, and promote the safe transportation of oil. The legislation I am introducing today will restore the delicate balance of interests reached in OPA90, and will reaffirm OPA90's preeminent role as the statute providing the exclusive criminal penalties for oil spill incidents. 
   As stated in the Coast Guard's own environmental enforcement directive, a company, its officers, employees, and mariners, in the event of an oil spill ``could be convicted and sentenced to a criminal fine even where [they] took all reasonable precautions to avoid the discharge''. Accordingly, responsible operators in my home state of Louisiana and elsewhere in the United States who transport oil are unavoidably exposed to potentially immeasurable criminal fines and, in the worst case scenario, jail time. Not only is this situation unfairly targeting an industry that plays an extremely important role in our national economy, but it also works contrary to the public welfare. 
   Most liquid cargo transportation companies on the coastal and inland waterway system of the United States have embraced safe operation and risk management as two of their most important and fundamental values. For example, members of the American Waterways Operators (AWO) from Louisiana and other states have implemented stronger safety programs that have significantly reduced personal injuries to mariners. Tank barge fleets have been upgraded through construction of new state-of-the-art double hulled tank barges while obsolete single skin barges are being retired far in advance of the OPA90 timetable. Additionally, AWO members have dedicated significant time and financial resources to provide continuous and comprehensive education and training for vessel captains, crews and shoreside staff, not only in the operation of vessels but also in preparation for all contingencies that could occur in the transportation of oil products. This commitment to marine safety and environmental protection by responsible members of the oil transportation industry is real. The industry continues to work closely with the Coast Guard to upgrade regulatory standards in such key areas as towing vessel operator qualifications and navigation equipment on towing vessels. 
   Through the efforts of AWO and other organizations, the maritime transportation industry has achieved an outstanding compliance record with the numerous laws and regulations enforced by the Coast Guard. Let me be clear: responsible carriers, and frankly their customers, have a ``zero tolerance'' policy for oil spills. Additionally, the industry is taking spill response preparedness seriously. Industry representatives and operators routinely participate in Coast Guard oil spill crisis management courses, PREP Drills, and regional spill response drills. Yet despite all of the modernization, safety, and training efforts of the marine transportation industry, their mariners and shoreside employees cannot escape the threat of criminal liability in the event of an oil spill, even where it is shown that they ``took all reasonable precautions to avoid [a] discharge''. 
   As you know, in response to the tragic Exxon Valdez spill, Congress enacted OPA90. OPA90 mandated new, comprehensive, and complex regulatory and enforcement requirements for the transportation of oil products and for oil spill response. Both the federal government and maritime industry have worked hard to accomplish the legislation's primary objective--to provide greater environmental safeguards in oil transportation by creating a comprehensive prevention, response, liability, and compensation regime to deal with vessel and facility oil pollution. And OPA90 is working in a truly meaningful sense. To prevent oil spill incidents from occurring in the first place, OPA90 provides an enormously powerful deterrent, through both its criminal and civil liability provisions. Moreover, OPA90 mandates prompt reporting of spills, contingency planning, and both cooperation and coordination with federal, state, and local authorities in connection with managing the spill response. Failure to report and cooperate as required by OPA90 may impose automatic civil penalties, criminal liability and unlimited civil liability. As a result, the number of domestic oil spills has been dramatically reduced over the past decade since OPA90 was enacted. In those limited situations in which oil spills unfortunately occurred, intensive efforts commenced immediately with federal, state and local officials working in a joint, unified manner with the industry, as contemplated by OPA90, to clean up and report spills as quickly as possible and to mitigate to the greatest extent any impact on the environment. OPA90 has provided a comprehensive and cohesive ``blueprint'' for proper planning, training, and resource identification to respond to an oil spill incident, and to ensure that such a response is properly and cooperatively managed. 
   OPA90 also provides a complete statutory framework for proceeding against individuals for civil and/or criminal penalties arising out of oil spills in the marine environment. When Congress crafted this Act, it carefully balanced the imposition of stronger criminal and civil penalties with the need to promote enhanced cooperation 
   among all of the parties involved in the spill prevention and response effort. In so doing, the Congress clearly enumerated the circumstances in which criminal penalties could be imposed for actions related to maritime oil spills, and added and/or substantially increased criminal penalties under the related laws which comprehensively govern the maritime transportation of oil and other petroleum products. 
   The legislation we are introducing today will not change in any way the tough criminal sanctions that were imposed in OPA90. However, responsible, law-abiding members of the maritime industry in Louisiana and elsewhere are concerned by the willingness of the Department of Justice and other federal agencies in the post-OPA90 environment to use strict criminal liability statutes in oil spill incidents. As you know, strict liability imposes criminal sanctions without requiring a showing of criminal knowledge, intent or even negligence. These federal actions imposing strict liability have created an atmosphere of extreme uncertainty for the maritime transportation industry about how to respond to and cooperate with the Coast Guard and other federal  agencies in cleaning up an oil spill. Criminal culpability in this country, both historically and as reflected in the comprehensive OPA90 legislation itself, typically requires wrongful actions or omissions by individuals through some degree of criminal intent or through the failure to use the required standard of care. However, Federal prosecutors have been employing other antiquated, seemingly unrelated ``strict liability'' statutes that do not require a showing of ``knowledge'' or ``intent'' as a basis for criminal prosecution for oil spill incidents. Such strict criminal liability statutes as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act, statutes that were enacted at the turn of the century to serve other purposes, have been used to harass and intimidate the maritime industry, and, in effect, have turned every oil spill into a potential crime scene without regard to the fault or intent of companies, corporate officers and employees, and mariners. 
   The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) provides that ``it shall be unlawful at any time, by any means or in any manner, to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture, or kill, ..... any migratory bird .....'', a violation of which is punishable by imprisonment and/or fines. Prior to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, the MBTA was primarily used to prosecute the illegal activities of hunters and capturers of migratory birds, as the Congress originally intended when it enacted the MBTA in 1918. In the Exxon Valdez case itself, and prior to the enactment of OPA90, the MBTA was first used to support a criminal prosecution against a vessel owner in relation to a maritime oil spill, and this ``hunting statute'' has been used ever since against the maritime industry. The ``Refuse Act'' (33 U.S.C. 407, 411) was enacted over 100 years ago at a time well before subsequent federal legislation essentially replaced it with comprehensive requirements and regulations specifically directed to the maritime transportation of oil and other petroleum products. Such strict liability statutes are unrelated to the regulation and enforcement of oil transportation activities, and in fact were not included within the comprehensive OPA90 legislation as statutes in which criminal liability could be found. With the prosecutorial use of strict liability statutes, owners and mariners engaged in the transportation of oil cannot avoid exposure to criminal liability, regardless of how diligently they adhere to prudent practice and safe environmental standards. Although conscientious safety and training programs, state-of-the-art equipment, proper operational procedures, preventative maintenance programs, and the employment of qualified and experienced personnel will collectively prevent most oil spills from occurring, unfortunately spills will still occur on occasion. 
   To illustrate this point, please permit me to present a scenario that highlights the dilemma faced by the maritime oil transportation industry in Louisiana. Imagine, if you will, that a company is operating a towing vessel in compliance with Coast Guard regulations on the Mississippi River on a calm, clear day with several fully laden tank barges in tow. Suddenly, in what was charted and previously identified to be a clear portion of the waterway, one of the tank barges strikes an unknown submerged object which shears through its hull and causes a significant oil spill in the river. Unfortunately, in addition to any other environmental damage that may occur, the oil spill kills one or more migratory birds. As you know, under OPA90 the operator must immediately undertake coordinated spill response actions with the Coast Guard and other federal, state, and local agencies to safeguard the vessel and its crew, clean up the oil spill, and otherwise mitigate any damage to the surrounding environment. The overriding objectives at this critical moment are to assure personnel and public safety and to clean up the oil spill as quickly as possible without constraint. However, in the current atmosphere the operator must take into consideration the threat of strict criminal liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act, together with their attendant imprisonment and fines, despite the reasonable care and precautions taken in the operation and navigation of the tow and in the spill response effort. Indeed, in the Coast Guard's own environmental enforcement directive, the statement is made that ``[t]he decision to commit the necessary Coast Guard resources to obtain the evidence that will support a criminal prosecution must often be made in the very early stages of a pollution incident.'' Any prudent operator will quickly recognize the dilemma in complying with the mandate to act cooperatively with all appropriate public agencies in cleaning up the oil spill, while at the same time those very agencies may be conducting a criminal investigation of that operator. Vessel owners and their employees who have complied with federal laws and regulations and have exercised all reasonable care should not continue to face a substantial risk of imprisonment and criminal fines under such strict liability statutes. Criminal liability, when appropriately imposed under OPA90, should be employed only where a discharge is caused by conduct which is truly ``criminal'' in nature, i.e., where a discharge is caused by reckless, intentional or other conduct deemed criminal by OPA90. 
   As this scenario demonstrates, the unjustified use of strict liability statutes is plainly undermining the very objectives which OPA90 sought to achieve, namely to enhance the 
   prevention of and response to oil spills in Louisiana and elsewhere in the United States. As we are well aware, tremendous time, effort, and resources have been expended by both the federal government and the maritime industry to eliminate oil spills to the maximum extent possible, and to plan for and undertake an immediate and effective response to mitigate any environmental damage from spills that do occur. Clearly unwarranted and improper prosecutorial use of strict liability statutes is having a ``chilling'' effect on these cooperative spill prevention and response efforts. Indeed, even if we were to believe that criminal prosecution only follows intentional criminal conduct, the mere fact that strict criminal liability statutes are available at the prosecutor's discretion will intimidate even the most innocent and careful operator. With strict liability criminal enforcement, responsible members of the maritime transportation industry are faced with an extreme dilemma in the event of an oil spill--provide less than full cooperation and response as criminal defense attorneys will certainly direct, or cooperate fully despite the risk of criminal prosecution that could result from any additional actions or statements made during the course of the spill response. Consequently, increased criminalization of oil spill incidents introduces uncertainty into the response effort by discouraging full and open communication and cooperation, and leaves vessel owners and operators criminally vulnerable for response actions taken in an effort to ``do the right thing''. 
   In the maritime industry's continuing effort to improve its risk management process, it seeks to identify and address all foreseeable risks associated with the operation of its business. Through fleet modernization, personnel training, and all other reasonable steps to address identified risks in its business, the industry still cannot manage or avoid the increased risks of strict criminal liability (again, a liability that has no regard to fault or intent). The only method available to companies and their officers to avoid the risk of criminal liability completely is to divest themselves from the maritime business of transporting oil and other petroleum products, in effect to get out of the business altogether. Furthermore, strict liability criminal laws provide a strong disincentive for trained, highly experienced mariners to continue the operation of tank vessels, and for talented and capable individuals from even entering into that maritime trade. An earlier editorial highlighted the fact that tugboat captains ``are reporting feelings of intense relief and lightening of their spirits when they are ordered to push a cargo of grain or other dry cargo, as compared to the apprehension they feel when they are staring out of their wheelhouses at tank barges'', and ``that the reason for this is very obvious in the way that they find themselves instantly facing criminal charges.......in the event of a collision or grounding and oil or chemicals end up in the water''. Certainly, the federal government does not want to create a situation where the least experienced  mariners are the only available crew to handle the most hazardous cargoes, or the least responsible operators are the only available carriers. Thus, the unavoidable risk of such criminal liability directly and adversely affects the safe transportation of oil products, an activity essential for the public, the economy, and the nation. 
   Therefore, despite the commitment and effort to provide trained and experienced vessel operators and employees, to comply with all safety and operational mandates of Coast Guard laws and regulations, and to provide for the safe transportation of oil as required by OPA90, maritime transportation companies in Louisiana, and elsewhere still cannot avoid criminal liability in the event of an oil spill. Responsible, law-abiding companies have unfortunately been forced to undertake the only prudent action that they could under the circumstances, namely the development of criminal liability action plans and retention of criminal counsel in an attempt to prepare for the unavoidable risks of such liability. 
   These are only preliminary steps and do not begin to address the many implications of the increasing criminalization of oil spills. The industry is now asking what responsibility does it have to educate its mariners and shoreside staff about the potential personal exposure they may face and wonder how to do this without creating many undesirable consequences? How should the industry organize spill management teams and educate them on how to cooperate openly and avoid unwitting exposure to criminal liability? Mr. President, I have thought about these issues a great deal and simply do not know how to resolve these dilemmas under current, strict liability law. In the event of an oil spill, a responsible party not only must manage the cleanup of the oil and the civil liability resulting from the spill itself, but also must protect itself from the criminal liability that now exists due to the available and willing use of strict liability criminal laws by the federal government. Managing the pervasive threat of strict criminal liability, by its very nature, prevents a responsible party from cooperating fully and completely in response to an oil spill situation. The OPA90 ``blueprint'' is no longer clear. Is this serving the objectives of OPA90? Does this really serve the public welfare of our nation? Is this what Congress had in mind when it mandated its spill response regime? Is this in the interest of the most immediate, most effective oil spill cleanup in the unfortunate event of a spill? We think not. 
   To restore the delicate balance of interests reached in the enactment of OPA90 a decade ago, we intend to work with the Congress to reaffirm the OPA90 framework for criminal prosecutions in oil spill incidents. The enactment of the legislation we are introducing today will ensure increased cooperation and responsiveness desired by all those interested in oil spill response issues without diluting the deterrent effect and stringent criminal penalties imposed by OPA90 itself.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as the Ranking Democratic Member of the Commerce Committee's Science, Technology, and Space Supcommittee, I am joining my Chairman, Senator FRIST, in introducing legislation to establish a National Space Commission. 
   If past experience holds true, NASA will be a catalyst for scientific discovery in this new century. In the past year, NASA has worked on a variety of valuable projects from finding a value for the Hubble Constant which measures how fast the universe is expanding to docking with the International Space Station for the very first time. Earlier this week, NASA and the Russian Space Agency completed the docking of the Service Module to the International Space Station, setting the stage for the first permanent crew to occupy the station. 
   Now, our space exploration agency is poised at a crossroads. After several failures, management has made some changes and reinvested in the work force and in project oversight. During the next year, NASA will try to meet a very aggressive schedule for the assembly of the Space Station, and we will finally have our orbiting laboratory in space. At the same time, a new Administration will be entering the White House. It seems to be an appropriate moment to stand back and ask where our space program is going in the next twenty years. 
   Now is the time to look to the future. The Millennium National Space Commission will build on the work of the 1985 National Space Commission and help us formulate an agenda for the civilian space program. In doing so, it will help keep this nation in the forefront of scientific exploration of ``the final frontier.''

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues who have engaged in the debate so far. 
   It is summertime in Washington so I guess that means it is sugar amendment time. The Senate essentially voted on this once before. It seems we do it every July and August, during the summer months. The exact same amendment was voted on last August 4. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 66-33, a 2-to-1 margin. I think the reason it was rejected by such a large margin is that Members are finally beginning to understand the sugar program and what it really involves and why it has worked for so many years as a benefit both to producers and also to the consumers of sugar and sugar products. It is not a perfect program, but it is one that has improved over the years. I will make a couple of comments about it. 
   Before that, I want to mention the fact that not too far back, this Congress was really involved in the crisis involving the increase in gasoline prices. We talked about gasoline prices going up 25 cents a gallon, 30 cents a gallon, 50 cents a gallon, and everybody being in an uproar about it. 
   The sugar program has been at a loan rate of 18 cents since 1985. It hasn't gone up one-half cent since 1985. What I want to do is take a moment to try to explain, as briefly as I can, how the program works. We have had talk on the floor this afternoon about these ``huge'' subsidies being given to some wealthy family, I heard, somewhere in Florida. I have almost 700 sugar cane farms in Louisiana and the growers would be very surprised to learn there is a big subsidy program out there, because the sugar program is not a direct subsidy from the taxpayer by any stretch of the imagination. 
   What sugar farmers get is a loan, as other commodities also get, such as rice, cotton, and other farm products. The loan is 18 cents per pound for sugar. It is a non-recourse loan. What that means, simply, to people not in the agriculture business, is it gives farmers the option of putting their crop under loan at harvest time. They have the option to either pay back the loan in dollars or, if the market price falls so low they cannot do that, they can forfeit their sugar to the Government as payment for the loan. 
   The interesting thing is that, since 1985, there has not been one single forfeiture under the loan program. Not one. Farmers have put their crop under loan and they have paid back the loan when the loan was due to the Federal Government. That is how the program works. There is no direct subsidy to make up the difference in a price, where taxpayers have to dip into their pockets to give to a sugar farmer. It is a non-recourse loan, which means they can either pay it back in dollars or forfeit the amount of sugar that they have put under loan. 
   Some would say, well, the sugar program protects domestic sugar by preventing sugar imports from coming into this country. That is not true. In fact, the sugar we are importing varies between 15 and 20 percent. It comes from 40 countries around the world. It is GATT legal. It comes into this country, under the program, from 40 different countries around the world. 
   Here is the thing that I think is really interesting, because I guess in addition to saying it is a huge subsidy program--which it is not; it is simply a loan program--is that somehow consumers are being harmed by this program. This chart, I think, is consistent with what Senator CONRAD from North Dakota was pointing out. We have a bar chart; I think he had a graph. It is essentially the same thing. This is data from the Department of Agriculture. It is not from the sugar industry; it is from the USDA. It indicates that it has been 3 1/2 years since the start of the 1996 farm program when we put the new and improved program into effect. 
   The chart from USDA indicates that the prices for producers have fallen, and the consumer prices for sugar and sweetened products have risen. This shows sugarcane farmers in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Hawaii, which produce the bulk of the sugarcane used for sugar. Since 1996, when we put the program into place, the price of sugarcane to the producer, to the farmer, has fallen 14.6 percent. These are USDA numbers. The prices for wholesale refined sugar, beet sugar, USDA tells us, have fallen 31.9 percent. These are USDA numbers. They show prices falling to the producers, the farmers of cane sugar, and prices falling to the producers of sugar from sugar beets. 
   You would think that if the price to the farmer is falling by 31.9 percent, in one case, and 14.6 percent for sugarcane farmers, my goodness, that must be great for consumers, right? Everything that uses sugar should have a corresponding fall in its price, right? Wrong. 
   Look at what happened to the price of sugar on the shelf. The price of sugar on the shelf has risen a very small amount, while the price for the people producing sugar cane and sugar beets has been drastically falling. But the price of sugar on the shelf has been on the increase when you would expect that it would be going 
   down. Look at what happened. Here is where the complainers were. How many Members of Congress have gotten letters from people saying gas prices are too high? Probably quite a few of us. ``Do something, Senator. Gas prices are too high.'' How many people have gotten a letter from a housewife, or somebody running a home, saying, ``You know, my biggest problem is that I went to buy 5 pounds of sugar and it is so high I have to choose between clothes and shoes and sugar.'' Nobody is writing about that and complaining about the price for 5 pounds of sugar going through the roof. Do you know why? Because it is not. 
   Here is what has been happening. The people who use it--the large manufacturers who make candy--and I can name them, but I will spare them the  embarrassment--have had their prices go up 6.4 percent, while a main ingredient, sugar, has been plummeting over here. Not the price of candy. A main ingredient's price has been going down, but the price of their product has been going up. 
   Cookies and cakes are big users of sugar. The most important thing in these products is probably sugar. Their prices have gone up 6.6 percent, according to the USDA, while the price of sugar, a main ingredient, has plummeted. Cereal? Big users. There are a lot of sugar-coated flakes for kids. Cereal prices have gone up 8.3 percent. The price of sugar to the farmer has plummeted. 
   The last one is ice cream. I love it. I would buy it no matter what it costs. It has gone up 9.8 percent. There is a lot of sugar in ice cream. What they are paying for the sugar is a lot lower than it used to be. Boy, their product price doesn't reflect that. If there are problems here, they are candy, cookies, cereal, and ice cream. It used to be the soft drink industry, but they got out and quit using sugar. Today the price of their product is more than it was when they were using sugar. And then look at the cans of artificially sweetened soft drink products and the cans of the naturally sweetened soft drinks; the price of an artificially sweetened soft drink is no less than the price of the one that is using the natural sweetener. Try to explain that when they say the real problem is sugar prices. 
   These are USDA figures, not mine and not sugar producers. Their prices have plummeted under the program. There is no direct Government subsidy. It is a loan. Sugar farmers have never forfeited one single loan since 1985. They have paid it back, and paid it back in dollars, and it has been the same loan rate since 1985. It has been 18 cents. That program, designed to help everybody, has seemingly not helped the farmer very much. But it is the only thing we have. Like every other product and commodity that we try to help in a balanced fashion, it has done that. 
   I will conclude by saying that this is the same vote we had last August. The Senate spoke very clearly then, 66-33. I hope that we will do the same thing today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise, as have some of our colleagues today, to express my deepest sympathy to Senator PAUL COVERDELL's friends, family, and to his wife Nancy, as others throughout the State of Georgia as well as throughout this country mourn the passing of one of our colleagues who, indeed, was a very special person. 
   I think when we reflect on the times we had and the opportunity we had to spend with PAUL COVERDELL, we will certainly remember him as a Senator's Senator; by that I mean a person who was really interested not so much in the message of the day but, rather, in actually working together to bring to this floor and to the American people legislative products that were appropriate to get the job done. 
   I think all of us, when we see our legislative branches becoming more and more partisan and more and more separated by imaginary aisles that separate us, can think back and remember PAUL COVERDELL as a person who was willing to work with anyone who was willing to work with him in order to accomplish legislation that was in the interest of this whole country.  
   I had the opportunity, as so many of our colleagues did, to work with him on education. I think his approach to that major legislative effort was one from which we can all learn a great deal--how he handled the product he was trying to get passed into law. 
   What I mean by that was he was willing to sit and talk with Democrats as well as his Republican colleagues to try to fashion 
   a compromise that could accomplish the reform of our legislative system. Far too often, that is sort of unique and different in the way things are done--both in this body and in the other body across the Capitol. 
   I think as we remember the experiences and good times we had with him, we can take with us the admiration and respect all of us have expressed of him, but also, at the same time, the lesson he taught us by his actions. That lesson, in my mind, was how we work together to accomplish good things for the American people. He did that. We can remember and we can learn from his actions. That is how I want to remember the good times I had and the privilege of experiencing it with him during the legislative process. 
   He will be missed, of course, by his family and close friends back home. He will be missed by the people of Georgia. He will, indeed, be missed by the people of America--those Americans who think that the function of this body and our Congress in general is to do whatever we can, working together, to make lives better for all American citizens. That is what PAUL COVERDELL attempted to do as he was able to accomplish so many things in that fashion. 
   He will be particularly missed by this institution and by everyone who wants to make government work better for the American people. PAUL COVERDELL represented that type of Senator. He, indeed, was a Senator's Senator. He will be sorely missed but very fondly remembered. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for yielding. 
   I was thinking about the argument that we had on the Senate floor about importing medical supplies in terms of prescription drugs from foreign countries into the United States because they might be cheaper. I could get open-heart surgery in Mexico for a lot cheaper than at Oschners in New Orleans or at the Mayo Clinic or at Johns Hopkins or any other fine institution in the United States. It would be half as expensive. I doubt many Americans want to put their lives in the hands of people they know are not regulated. 
   I could buy many items in countries around the world, and many Third World countries, which would be a lot cheaper. I remember one time going to Hong Kong. I saw some of the Lacoste shirts with the little alligator. My wife and I were shopping in Hong Kong and they had all these Lacoste shirts. They were $5. I said: That is incredible, a heck of a deal. I will buy a Lacoste alligator shirt for everyone I know for gifts for Christmas. We bought one  after another. I bought one or two myself. We came home and the first time I washed the shirt, the alligator fell off. The alligator fell off because it was a counterfeit shirt. The shirt nearly dissolved after the first washing and the alligator drowned in the washer. The product was totally worthless. It was a counterfeit product. 
   It is one thing when you are buying a knit shirt. When someone is sending me drugs that have been either manufactured in a foreign country or even manufactured here and sent to a Third World country and stored in a warehouse, God knows where, under conditions that may be totally contrary to the safety of that drug, who knows who deals with those products in that country in the privacy of that warehouse. Who knows how many times somebody might go into that warehouse and take the product, and instead of saying we will have 100 pills, if I cut it in half, I could have 200 pills. If I could cut it into fourths and end up not with 100 pills but 400 pills, look how much money I can make if I do it that way. 
   If I can take that type of quality control, which is nonexistent in a foreign country, and say that is how I will make my money, what kind of products will we be giving to the American consumer? This is not a Lacoste shirt that an alligator might fall off of. This is medicine that is important to the safety and the life of our constituents. 
   Why do we have a ban on the importation of foreign drugs passed by Congress in 1987? In order to protect U.S. consumers, to make sure that the drugs were not improperly stored, or improperly handled, or improperly shipped, or perhaps made to be like my Lacoste shirt, totally, absolutely counterfeit. 
   How many Federal bureaucrats are we going to put in 150 countries around the world to ensure those products in those countries are safely stored, safely handled, and not diluted? And how many more bureaucracies are we going to create to make sure those problems don't develop? 
   We can get a lot of things cheaper in a lot of other countries. How about buying cheaper wheat from China? They have a controlled economy where the Government runs everything and sets the prices. Could we not buy a lot of wheat from China and give it to our constituents a lot cheaper? We don't do that because it is not a level playing field. In that sense, we are competing with a micromanaged economy overseas that the Government participates in and helps their farmers. Our people can't compete against that. It is not a good idea. 
   This is the bottom line--actually two things. No. 1, there is no guarantee we are not going to create a boondoggle with this for all the wholesalers. There is no guarantee, without the Cochran amendment, that anybody who is a consumer is going to have any of the benefit of any of what we are trying to do by importing cheap Third World drugs into this country. Nobody has a guarantee the savings would be passed on to the consumer. I can see a wholesaler who wants to get the drug for $20 selling it for $40 over here and making one heck of a profit. There is no guarantee without the Cochran amendment. 
   The final point is that this is not the answer to the problem. The answer to the problem is to find a way to guarantee to Medicare beneficiaries that they get the best deal, that we have some ability to provide them with the coverage they need at the price they can afford. That is the real answer. 
   People say we do not want price controls in this country; that is anti-American. But we are going to buy the price controls from other countries around the world. We will let them impose price controls, and then we will buy from them. Why don't we just put on price controls in this country and call it what it is? We are saying essentially we don't like price controls but we like other countries' price controls and so we will buy it from them with absolutely no ability to guarantee the product coming over here is the product that left this country. 
   Here is the problem. If a Medicare beneficiary walks into the drugstore and has no insurance because Medicare doesn't cover him, the pharmacist tells him: It is $100 for your prescription. That Medicare beneficiary has to take it out of his pocket or gets his children to pay for it, or, if they are very destitute and poor, Medicare pays for it and they pay $100. If you don't have any coverage, you pay $100 for the prescription. 
   If, however, you work for the Federal Government, if you are a Senator or one of the staff people here who happens to have the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, and you go into the drugstore and buy the same prescription, you don't pay $100, No. 1, because there is volume purchasing because they are purchasing for all the FEHBP people who are covered by FEHBP. The discount by volume purchasers for the insurers gets it down to about $70, a 25-plus-percent discount. That is the average by volume purchasing. But none of us or our staff even pays the $70. We will probably pay a coinsurance of about $35, for some plans even a copayment which could be $15 or $20. 
   So that is the answer to the problem. The answer is not to import Third World countries' price controls. Talking about Canada is one thing. I guarantee if this passes, we are not going to be importing a lot from Canada. We are going to be buying from countries whose handling of these drugs we have no ability to control. If it were coming from Canada, it would not be a bad deal. We know how they operate. But this amendment is not limited to Canada. Any Third World country will be able to handle the drugs, dilute them, do anything they want, store them where they want, and we will not be able to guarantee the validity of that drug. 
   This is the answer to the problem: Not importing from other countries, but to try to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries have some type of coverage that allows them to get the benefits of volume purchasing and also to have some type of insurance where the Federal Government assumes part of the responsibility, part of the risk, and the providers compete and also assume some of the risk to get the price to the Medicare beneficiary down to half or less. That is what we should be working on. 
   This is a Band-Aid type approach. Really, it is worse than a Band-Aid approach because Band-Aids help; this doesn't help. It puts the American consumer at risk. We passed this law to prevent all the things that are likely to happen if this amendment passes. We should not go back to our constituents and say: We are letting you get cheap drugs from foreign countries because they have price controls. It is the wrong approach, and we should recognize it as such. 
   I yield the floor.

   I just make the point, we have a Food and Drug Administration and Health and Human Services Department that already is overburdened. The amendment as is currently pending is going to require them to set up a program in 150 countries around the world to ensure that every warehouse, every manufacturer, every person who handles every drug in their country that is coming to this country be certified as healthy. They cannot do that. That is an impossible burden.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Ecole Classique Academic Games team from Metairie, Louisiana, which is one of the most successful Academic Games teams in America. 
   For the past seven years, Ecole Classique has competed in the National Academic Games in Eatonton, Georgia. Over these years, the team has won hundreds of first, second and third  place honors, more than 100 national titles, and seven sweepstakes championships as the finest team in the country. They have also won national titles in all four divisions, something no other school in the country has ever achieved. 
   The Ecole Classique team undergoes an intense year of preparation and hard work to prepare for the Academic Games. At the tournament they divide into fuor divisions and use creative problem solving skills and strategies to compete against other students from across America in the areas of Social Studies, Language Skills, Mathematics and Logic. 
   Once again, their hard work has paid off. At this year's competition, the Ecole Classique students won more than 100 trophies, 16 national championships and two sweepstakes titles--far outpacing their nearest competitors. 
   Making Ecole Classique's accomplishment even more remarkable is the fact that while other teams are comprised of all-star students pooled from multiple schools, Ecole Classique's team only consists of students who attend this small school in Metairie, Louisiana. 
   I must also salute the team's coach, Don Shannon. An extraordinary leader and mentor, Mr. Shannon has distinguished himself by becoming the only Academic Games coach in the nation to lead multiple sweepstakes champions in all four divisions. 
   I congratulate the remarkable students of Ecole Classique's Academic Games team who continue to make their family, school and community proud, and extend my very best wishes for their continued success.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chairman. I want to commend the gentleman from Washington and the distinguished ranking member for the great leadership they have demonstrated in crafting the FY2001 Interior Appropriations bill. Gentlemen, last year you were both instrumental in securing funds for a project of great personal interest to Senator LOTT and myself, the Kemp's ridley sea turtle project. The project, funded in part through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is a twenty-year-old on-going success story in the recovery of a highly endangered species. Since 1978, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has spearheaded the sea turtle conservation work at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. This collaborative conservation project with the Mexican government and the U.S. shrimp industry, through the National Fisheries Institute, protects Kemp's ridley sea turtle nests and females from predation and other hazards, and ensures that young turtles make it into the sea. I am pleased to report that this Spring, the project has reached an all time success level with some 750 turtles laying eggs in over 5,000 nests, a record in the past 40 years. However, this year, despite the demonstrable success of the project, the Fish and Wildlife Service did not request funds for the Kemp's ridley sea turtle project. I am extremely concerned and want to express my strong support for continued funding for this valuable conservation effort.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator DORGAN, in introducing legislation designated to address the issue of Internet sales taxation. 
   As a consumer, I know first-hand how popular, simple and easy it is to buy items over the Internet. In fact, the Internet saved me at Christmas when I bought last-minute gifts for my wife, four children and our two little granddaughters. 
   But, as a member of both the Senate Finance and Commerce committees, I also know Congress has an obligation to examine how these same, tax-free Internet sales can financially harm businesses and state governments. 
   Senator DORGAN's bill balances the concerns of state and local governments with the importance of maintaining easy access to Internet services. It allows state and localities to enter into an interstate compact for the purpose of simplifying their sales tax systems for remote sales. Once 20 states have joined the compact, Congress can disapprove of their efforts. If Congress does not act, those states that have joined the compact and simplified their sales tax systems, will be authorized to collect sales tax on the purchases their citizens make over the Internet. 
   Our proposal, recognizing that collecting taxes must not be overly burdensome for online retailers, also provides a collection fee for all Internet retailers who collect these taxes. It ensures Internet purchases are not singled out for special tax treatment at the expense of neighborhood businesses, and state and local governments. This restores equality, a key aspect of any good tax system, without placing an unfair burden on anyone. I believe that this is a fair and equitable bill that takes reasonable steps to address the concerns of both online retailers and state and local governments. 
   We all agree Internet access should not be taxed, and that states and localities should not be allowed to impose discriminatory taxes on the Internet. In fact, Senator DORGAN's bill extends the moratorium on these types of sales for another four years. 
   But, I ask, is it fair to levy sales taxes on a person who buys a book from his local bookstore, but not his neighbor who buys that same book over the Internet? 
   I do not think it is fair. It isn't fair to residents who must pay the local  sales tax because they don't own a computer. It isn't fair to local retailers collecting the tax who must compete with Internet retailers who don't. And, it isn't fair to the states and their local governments that are losing money they need to fight crime and fires, and to give their children a quality education. 
   In Louisiana, sales taxes make up 33 percent of all revenues. Economists estimate that Louisiana could lose up to $172 million in state revenues by 2002 because Internet sales are not taxed. Other states are confronted with similar difficulties. When faced with these facts, it's no wonder two-thirds of Americans support Internet sales taxes. 
   The sales tax is not a new tax. It has been collected by states from their citizens for more than 100 years. It should be collected on all sales, regardless of whether they occur on Main Street or the information superhighway. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. BREAUX. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of Finance Committee for yielding me time to make a couple of brief comments on the issue that is before the Senate. 
   Let me suggest, first of all, that the issue in the Congress is not whether or not this Congress should be for providing prescription drugs under the Medicare program to seniors. There is no difference in that. I don't know of any Member of Congress to whom I have talked--either in the House or in the Senate--who is opposed to saying to the Nation's 39 million Medicare beneficiaries that they should be covered for prescription drugs. That is a given. The question is not whether they should be covered; the question is, How are we going to do it? 
   I suggest that this is a baby who is not ready yet to be born. What do I mean by that? What I mean is that we are taking 30 minutes to debate an attempt to pass a prescription drug proposal on which a national Medicare bipartisan commission spent a year and a half working. We are, in 30 minutes, trying to pass a bill which has never come through the appropriate committee of jurisdiction--the Finance Committee. 
   We have had 14 days of bipartisan hearings on this issue. This afternoon, in a bipartisan fashion in the Senate Finance Committee meeting room, we sat and discussed this same issue--this identical issue--on how to construct a Medicare prescription drug plan that can work. We met additionally another time this week on the same subject. 
   It is not the proper process to yank that work product out of the responsible committee and say we are going to have 15 minutes on this side to debate a new entitlement program being added to a Medicare program which is in danger of default. It is in danger of going bankrupt. And yet we are going to add a new entitlement program with 15 minutes of debate on this side, and 15 minutes of debate on that side, and say we have done what is right and proper for the Medicare beneficiaries of this country? I suggest that is not the right way to do it. 
   I commend Senator CHUCK ROBB, who is a member of our Finance Committee, and Senator BOB GRAHAM, who has spent a great deal of time crafting this amendment. This may be the right way to go, but it is not yet ready to get there. We need more analysis. We need to consider if you can do it through an insurance program. 
   Finally, I think it is incredibly important that, whatever we do, we do not just add an entitlement program without doing some real basic reform to the Medicare program. 
   We have a Medicare+Choice Program under Medicare right now. Does anyone in this body think it is working correctly? It is being micromanaged by HCFA with 4,000 employees, and it is a disaster. We should not be looking backward and doing things the old way. We are moving into the 21st century. We should not be acting as if it is the 19th century. We should be crafting new ways of solving these problems, and not going back to policies that have failed. 
   Medicare was a wonderful program in 1965. But it is frozen in the 1990s. The challenge we have is not to debate a political issue, but to come together to find a way to solve the problem. 
   There are interesting ideas that are being discussed by the Senator from Florida, by the Senator from Virginia,  by myself, 
   and others on the Democratic side, working with Members on the Republican side to come up with something that is creative. Are we not capable of thinking outside of the old style box of just adding another entitlement program to the Medicare program without reforming anything? I suggest we should not make that mistake. 
   If we want to put ourselves on the Record on prescription drugs, why not pass a Senate concurrent resolution that says, yes, we all think it is important that prescription drugs today are as important as a hospital bed was in the 1960s, and have a resolution that says that and says we are going to work in a bipartisan fashion to work out an agreement instead of debating an issue. I suggest that what we have is a very narrow opportunity to do that. 
   We are not going to be able to reform the whole program in the 30 days left in this session in a Presidential election year. That is not going to happen. But if we do prescription drugs, should we not do some reform attached to it? I think the suggestion and the answer is absolutely yes. Let the Finance Committee do our work, and bring something to the floor that is doable and passable. I suggest it is the right way to proceed.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the baseball teams at Louisiana State University, LSU, and the University of Louisiana-Lafayette, ULL, the LSU women's track team and all Louisiana student-athletes. 
   If there is one thing Louisianians take as seriously as our politics and cooking, it is our athletics. In fact, Louisiana has an excellent tradition when it comes to producing great athletes. This is easily demonstrated in the number of athletes from Louisiana who have played or currently play professional sports. 
   Sports teaches us the importance of teamwork, goal-setting and determination. It also teaches us to never give up, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. 
   No one has to tell the University of Louisiana-Lafayette's baseball team about perseverance and defying the odds. They had to defeat the nation's number one ranked team twice in one day to get to the College World Series. But once there, they defied expectations by posting a respectable two wins and two losses, and etched the mascot ``Ragin' Cajuns'' into the vocabulary of every college baseball fan. 
   Teams at LSU have also applied the lessons taught in athletics, as well as Yogi Berra's oft-repeated truism ``it ain't over till it's over,'' to become one of the finest athletic programs in the country. 
   The LSU baseball team, after starting the season 6-0, struggled to a 6-5 record in their first 11 games. But, with the help of tremendous senior leadership, self-confidence and the will to win, LSU finished strong by ending the season with an outstanding 52-17 record and their fifth national championship in nine years. 
   And the LSU women's track team is no stranger to dramatic finishes, either. Down 46 points on the final day of competition, they scored just enough points on a winning performance in the final event to win their 12th NCAA outdoor championship in 14 years. 
   In all, LSU had one of its finest athletic years ever during the 1999-2000 season. Outside of these two national titles, a total of 11 teams finished in the nation's top 10 in their respective sports. 
   This year's two national championships gives LSU a total of 35 national championships, the most of any school in the Southeastern Conference. And of the 20 sports LSU sponsors on the varsity level, 14 finished the year in the nation's top 25 and participated in NCAA championship events. 
   I salute the student-athletes who have helped make Louisiana one of the finest states for collegiate athletics in the country. And I especially congratulate the LSU baseball and women's track teams who have proved once again it isn't how you start the game that matters, but how you finish. It is this value that will transcend the playing field to make Louisiana's student-athletes champions in the biggest game of all--the game of life.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I start by commending the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his important observations about this legislation; also, to commend the principal sponsors of this legislation, Senator KENNEDY and Senator SMITH, for bringing this matter to the attention of our colleagues and seeking our support for this legislation. 
   I do not think this is that complicated an issue, quite frankly. I do not think the issues are so complex that they call for an extended psychological discourse on the makeup of the American population. Quite frankly, the issues are fairly simple. America stands for the constitutional principle that all men and women are created equal and that we are all guaranteed the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness regardless of who we are or where we are from or what we think, what our political views are, or what is the essence of our makeup as a  human being. That is a right that is guaranteed to all Americans in the Constitution. I think no one really questions that. 
   That principle does not mean everyone in America has to agree with everybody else. In fact, I think that, far from it, we are a nation that certainly encourages diversity of thinking, differences among competing ideas, and differences among the respected beliefs of all the people who make up our great Nation. 
   That constitutional principle does not even mean that we have to like each other. Certainly there are instances when Catholics do not like Protestants, and Protestants do not like Jews, and Jews do not like Muslims, and Cajun Americans may have differences with British Americans. For that reason alone they do not particularly care for each other; they do not like each other; they do not want to associate with each other. That also is their constitutional right, I suggest, in this country to take that opinion of people with whom they disagree. But our constitutional principles do, in fact, guarantee clearly that we as Americans cannot do violence or do harm to other people in our country, especially when that violence or harm is based solely on whom these other people might be. 
   To do violence solely because of someone's religious beliefs, their personal ideas, or concepts about what is right and what is wrong, or because of their religion or where they are from is especially repugnant to all of us as Americans. You do not have to like everybody, but you certainly cannot harm anybody, and especially you cannot harm anybody solely for whom they happen to be or who they are. 
   This legislation then is aimed at adding crimes that are motivated by a bias against people solely because of their gender or solely because of their sexual preference or perhaps because of some disability they might have. I, therefore, think this legislation which the authors bring to the Senate is appropriate and should be supported. It will send a clear message throughout this country that these types of activities in this country will not be tolerated. 
   Again, in America, our right to not embrace or befriend someone with whom we do not want to be associated, for whatever reason, is guaranteed. But what is also guaranteed is their right under the Constitution of the United States to be protected against violence and harm that others might do unto them solely because of who they are. 
   As Americans, we certainly should be proud of our multicultural and multiethnic heritage. We are a diverse nation and when we look at other nations that are having problems because of their heritage or their diversity, we can be proud in this country that we, in fact, are a different nation than many others. Therefore, this legislation sends a strong and clear message that domestic terrorism and violence against people in our country based merely on who they are or what they believe is something that deserves national protection, and Federal legislation is, in fact, important. 
   A hate crime against any American is a crime against all Americans, and this legislation saying that is a Federal right upon which we will insist is appropriate and proper and deserves our support.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, we are excited in Louisiana that the ``enterprise strategy'' we are developing for human resources systems is recognized by the Appropriations Committee as a model for other service and DOD wide information systems. All of these legacy systems need to be modernized to become cost effective and interoperable. The committee's support for our efforts, and for other information technology additions to this bill, confirm the need to restructure and coordinate all of our service and DOD wide information systems. Only by doing so can we provide real-time information to our warfighters that improves both readiness and effectiveness of our troops. 
   The ITC in New Orleans was just recently chartered as part of the Navy's year old Program Executive Office for Information Technology and Enterprise Management (PEO/IT). Specifically, the ITC is designated by the Navy's PEO/IT as the ``primary support command for enterprise software development.'' 
   The PEO/IT is the Navy's only PEO for Information Technology and has been delegated authority for the Navy Marine Corps Intranet, Enterprise Acquisition Management, the ITC, the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS), and other information technology programs. The PEO/IT's authority over these programs was chartered in November 1999, well after the FY 2001 DOD budget process had commenced. 
   Interim and additional funding for the ITC in New Orleans is critical in FY 2001. This funding will ensure that the ITC can continue to provide the Navy and DOD's unique enterprise strategy integration efforts. Only by pursuing this strategy can we guarantee that current human resources information systems and future systems are developed, integrated and managed in accordance with the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and other OMB initiatives based on the Government Performance Results Act. This enterprise strategy develops and integrates new and current legacy information systems so that they will all be interoperable and provide our service personnel and commanders in the field real-time, usable, human resource data about training, experience, and other human resource data from which our commanders can make deployment decisions, fulfill combat mission requirements, and improve readiness. 
   Again Mr. President, I thank the chairman, and our ranking member, the senior Senator from Hawaii, for recognizing the importance of this effort. I look forward to working with them in future years to provide for its continued success.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Joseph Nastasi, who has been an advocate for the seniors of Monroe, Louisiana, for 18 years as executive director of the Ouachita Parish Council on Aging. 
   A veteran of World War II, and the wars in Korea and Vietnam, Joe honorably served his country in the Marine Corps from 1943 until he retired in 1979. After his long and distinguished service, Joe shifted his focus to serving older Louisianians as he began work with the Ouachita Council on Aging in 1982. 
   Under his leadership, the Ouachita Council on Aging has significantly increased its senior services. Eighteen years ago, daily meals were delivered to 80 seniors. Today, that number has expanded to approximately 500. And, in large part to Joe's efforts to enhance senior transportation, more seniors in Ouachita Parish now have access to essential services such as heart and cancer centers. 
   In addition to his work with the Council on Aging, Joe has also served as President of the Louisiana Council on Aging Directors Association, on the boards of the Louisiana Public Transportation Association and Louisiana State University Monroe Medical Center, and as a member of the Louisiana Elderly Health Care Council. 
   As ranking Democrat of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I can tell you that Joe has been an invaluable resource to me and my Aging Committee staff. Last November, he testified at an Aging Committee field hearing in Monroe and provided excellent insight into the challenges faced by family caregivers. Joe's experience and insight have enriched our work time and again. 
   After many years of loyal service, Joe recently retired from the Ouachita Council on Aging. I want to thank him for his hard work and dedication, and wish him well in his retirement.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator LANDRIEU in offering legislation to establish the Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. 
   The Mississippi River has provided for the commerce, transportation, and nourishment that has sustained Louisianians for over 300 years. Over time, communities have adapted to the unique environment that exists near the River. Today marks a milestone in the effort to preserve one of the last remaining tracts in the lower Mississippi Valley that is still influenced by the natural dynamics of the great River. 
   The area known as Cat Island is the southernmost unleveed portion of the Mississippi River. It is actually a peninsula of bottomland hardwood forest adjacent to the River and located thirty miles north of our state capital at Baton Rouge. It supports one of the highest densities of virgin bald cypress trees in the entire Mississippi River Valley, including the nation's champion cypress tree, which is 17 feet wide and 53 feet in circumference. By designating this area as a National Wildlife Refuge, we aim to protect the habitat of several declining species of forest songbirds, thousands of wintering waterfowl, and breeding ground for Wood Ducks. The area also supports high populations of deer, squirrel, turkey, and furbearers such as bobcat and mink. 
   The Cat Island Project represents a collaborative effort among several entities who have remained committed to its conservation. The Nature Conservancy spearheaded the effort, marshaled public support from Louisianians of all stripes, and worked diligently to secure the necessary funding for the initial acquisition of land from commercial and private landowners in the area. In fact, the Migratory Bird Commission provided the seed money to begin the acquisition process. Senator LANDRIEU and I have worked hard to find appropriate sources of federal funding to contribute to the cause, and we are delighted that the President has included $4 million for the Cat Island Project in his budget request for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We have enjoyed the support of officials from the Department of the Interior as well. Assistant Secretary David Hayes visited the site of the planned refuge along with Senator LANDRIEU and me in February. As I said, this project is the result of the good faith, dedication and continued cooperation of many players. I express my sincere gratitude and congratulations to all who have been involved. 
   The final piece in the completion of this project is the designation of the land as a National Wildlife Refuge. I am proud to offer legislation that will ensure the conservation of wild Louisiana for future generations to experience.

   Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding me 5 minutes. 
   It is interesting to hear discussion and debate in the Congress on the question of prescription drugs for seniors and the Medicare program. There is no one in this Congress I know who is going to come to the floor of the Senate and say: I am opposed to giving seniors prescription drugs. That is not the issue. I think there is almost unanimous agreement by everyone in the Congress that prescription drugs today are as important as a hospital bed was in 1965 when the Medicare program was first established. 
   In that period of time, Members of Congress said: We have to pay for seniors' hospital stays, and we have to pay for their doctors' treatment. But at that time, prescription drugs was not that big of a deal in the sense of being something that helped people, in fact, stay out of hospitals and be cured of what ailed them in medical terms. 
   Today, it is quite different. Today, prescription drugs keep people out of hospitals as well as cure them from diseases that formerly were thought to be incurable. The question today is not whether Medicare, which serves almost 40 million seniors, should cover prescription drugs. The answer is, of course, it should. The question is, How do we go about doing it and when do we do it? That is what the subject of this debate is all about. 
   There are some on the Democratic side who make the point with the Robb amendment today that we should add prescription drugs to Medicare before we do tax cuts that are excessive. Excessive tax cuts? What is excessive? One hundred fifty billion over 10 years? 
   How about $25 billion over 10 years? Is that excessive? The point made by many of my Democratic colleagues is, do prescription drugs before you do excessive tax cuts. 
   On the other hand, Republican colleagues take the approach, let's do prescription drugs but make sure we do reform of the program at the same time. In other words, don't put the cart before the horse, as so many of my Republican colleagues have said. 
   I share the concern that just adding prescription drugs to a program that last year spent $7 billion more than we took in is certainly not helping the solvency of the Medicare plan. Does it make people feel good about adding prescription drugs? Yes? But does it do anything to fix a program that spent $7 billion more than it took in? It doesn't do that at all. In fact, it makes it more difficult for the program to provide the benefits that are necessary for our seniors. 
   The latest analysis by the Medicare trustees says the program is OK until the year 2023. Tell that to the nursing homes. Tell them it is all right that they are being cut and put into bankruptcy and put out of business. Tell the rural hospitals of America the program is in great shape, when many of them, in fact, do not get enough money to stay open and treat the Medicare patients we are talking about. Tell the home nursing facilities that are going bankrupt and being put out of business: The program is fine; don't worry. 
   The truth is, the trustees looked only at Part A. They did not look at Part B, which is growing at almost 40 percent annually and is expected to increase even further. 
   It is absolutely clear that we make a serious mistake if we do one without the other. As Senator MOYNIHAN, ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee said:  
   Medicare reform is the price you must pay for adding prescription drugs to the program.  
   That makes a lot of sense. If we do the dessert before we do the spinach, no one is going to be around to eat the spinach. We are all going to issue a press release and say: We added prescription drugs; isn't that a great thing? 
   It is the right thing to do, if we do it in the context of reforming the program and taking it out of the 1960s and bringing it into the 21st century. 
   Some say: Just add more money to the program and we will fix it. I have drawn the analogy that it is like adding more gasoline to a 1965 automobile. It is still going to run like an old car. 
   The fundamental problem we have is to reform the program, the delivery system. We cannot continue to micromanage Medicare with 133,000 pages of regulations, three times more than the IRS, where every time someone wants to do something differently, they have to come to Washington and get an act of Congress to add a treatment or to subtract a treatment. 
   I conclude by saying, yes, I am for prescription drugs. Yes, we agree on the amount that needs to be spent. But, yes, we should also do it in the context of reforming the program.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, because an amendment is pending, rather than ask it be set aside to offer another amendment, I will make a few comments about something I intend to do. I am glad the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee is here, so he has a chance to listen to some of the comments and maybe have a dialog on what I am attempting to do. 
   First, I congratulate the chairman of the Banking Committee and the Senator from South Dakota and all those on the Banking Committee who have worked so hard to bring this legislation to the floor. It truly addresses a very important need for rural America, and that is the guarantee that people in rural America are not going to be treated as second-class citizens when it comes to their access to the information age. 
   This legislation addresses a problem of allowing companies that provide satellite television and broadcast signals getting into rural parts of America and providing them the same type of quality information services that someone in the city of Washington, DC, or any of the large metropolitan areas of our country are already receiving because that is where the people happen to live. 
   The people in rural Texas or in rural South Dakota or the people in rural Louisiana are no less important than people in the large cities of America. Without this legislation, it is very clear that people in these areas will not have access to this information because, in many cases, it is not economically feasible to spend large sums of money to provide information to sparsely populated areas of our country. That is unfortunate, but that is recognizing the way things are. 
   The purpose of the legislation, as I understand it, is to lower the overall cost of bringing satellite and television broadcast to rural America, something that has almost unanimous agreement and is in the national interest. Without this legislation, people in rural areas would simply not have the same advantages as we do in urban areas. Clearly, this is very important. 
   One of my concerns, I say to the distinguished managers of the bill, is that when you look at what it costs to bring broadcast signals to rural America, it is not only a question of building satellites for rural areas and moving into these areas. 
   That represents about 45 percent of the cost of the actual satellite. But getting the satellite, obviously, launched into space represents about 37 percent of the total cost of bringing broadcast signals, through satellites, to any part of this country. 
   I think you have to agree that a significant cost associated with all of what we are trying to do today is actually launching the satellite into space in order to bring the broadcast signals to all parts of the United States. Forty-five percent is the actual satellite cost; insurance is 12 percent; the ground costs are another 6 percent. But a very significant portion of the cost of bringing a satellite into working condition is the cost of launching it. More than one-third, as I have said, of the cost of the satellite is expended when the actual satellite is launched into space. 
   Clearly, it would further our goal of lowering the cost of bringing these services to rural America if we could also lower the cost of transportation, which is a very significant cost throughout our country. 
   Launch costs, obviously, are a very significant component of the overall satellite costs, but I think they can be reduced. That is why I take the floor this afternoon to make a suggestion. 
   The authors of the legislation, again, who are to be commended for their vision, have clearly indicated that launch costs were on their mind when they crafted the bill. 
   I was looking at the legislation, and clearly the legislation, on page 30 of the actual bill that is pending before the Senate, talks about the type of loans this bill envisions. It says:  
   ......a loan may not be guaranteed under this Act unless--  
   It spells out what the ``unless'' is. But what it actually says is that, in other words, it will be allowed if it does the following. In other words, a loan  can be guaranteed under the legislation pending before the Senate if:  
   the loan is made to finance the acquisition, improvement, enhancement, construction, deployment, launch, or rehabilitation of the means by which local television broadcast signals will be delivered to an unserved area or underserved area......  
   Therefore, the bill, as it is currently pending before the Senate, talks about trying to make loans available to cover a number of things, one of which specifically mentioned in the bill is the launch of satellites designed to bring broadcast signals to rural parts of America. 
   As I tried to point out initially, 37 percent of the whole cost of this project is in the launching of the satellite. Obviously, without the launching of the satellite into space, you, in fact, are not going to ever complete the rest of the project. I think it is very relevant, when the bill talks about a loan guarantee program, that the launch is listed as one of the means by which broadcast signals are ultimately brought to all parts of America. 
   I think, for that portion of the industry that launches the satellites into space, the loan guarantee is very important. An interesting thing that I would point out is, when you are in the launch satellite business, when you are in the business of building a spaceship to, in fact, launch a vehicle, you have been competing against other countries where their governments do it. You are competing against industries that are totally 
   financed by their respective governments because it has been in their national interest to do so. 
   In the past, that is also what we have done in this country through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, where NASA has used the shuttle to launch the satellites into space, and the taxpayer has been paying for the cost of those vehicles. But, clearly, NASA is getting out of the business. We are trying to say to the private sector: We want you to move into this business. We want you to build the launch vehicles. We want to create a new industry in the private sector, get the Government out of the business of launching broadcast satellites, and let the private sector do it. 
   But one of the disadvantages our private sector has is that they are competing against other countries that are involved in doing this, and they cannot compete on a level playing field. What we are suggesting is that we help the U.S. industries become involved in this in a competitive fashion, which I think is very important. 
   U.S. companies that are having to compete against other countries are not able to compete on a level playing field. Therefore, when the country of China or the country of France--highly subsidized by their Governments--is trying to sell their launch vehicles to the United States, obviously, they can do it at a price that makes our companies not able to compete. 
   I think the authors of the bill are right on target. Some might say: The Government should not be in the business of loan guarantees. It is not a function of our Government. The exact opposite is true. 
   Historically, the U.S. Government has sought to assist the private sector by saying, we are going to help--we are not going to monopolize it; we are not going to do it, but we are going to help the private sector do it. One way we can help certain activities that are important to our country is by loan guarantee programs. 
   I point out, for the commercial shipbuilding industry--very important to my State and to the State of the Senator from Texas, as well as all the States along the coast that have the shipbuilding industry--we have had a title 11 shipbuilding guarantee program, in which companies have been able to go into the private market, borrow money from the private sector, from private banks, from private insurance companies, and having a certain portion of that loan guaranteed by the Federal Government. It allows them to get a better interest rate and allows them to get financing for something that may not be able to be financed otherwise. 
   Where we have tried it before, in the area of shipbuilding, it has worked very well. It has worked at a profit to the U.S. Government because the loans have been paid back. The Government has made money. The work was done. The ships were built. The Loan Guarantee Program was an integral portion of it. 
   Currently, when you look at whether financial assistance is available in this area in the private sector, without any help from the Government, it is interesting to see what the comments are from those in the financial markets. 
   We have had hearings on this legislation before the Senate Commerce Committee. One of the companies that does the bulk of financing these launch vehicles is Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. When they testified before the Senate Commerce 
   Committee, as the largest group of investment bankers in the country, they talked about the problem of being hampered by the inability to find the necessary private financing for these types of ventures, particularly when they are, in fact, competing against other countries that are government-financed 100 percent. 
   They pointed out in their testimony that in some cases the cost of the launch vehicles, and the insurance that goes with it, almost equals the entire cost of the satellite itself. So if we want to help bring broadcast signals to rural areas, we cannot just look at the satellite itself that needs to be constructed, you also need to look at the vehicles that would be built in order to launch those satellites into the sky. 
   It was really interesting, colleagues, that last week we had the head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, before our committee. Dan Goldin was testifying. I asked him a question about this concept. He said the provision was very innovative. He said this provision:  
   ......would help small and big rocket companies to overcome critical barriers so that we have technology that will allow us to improve the reliability ten times and cut their cost by a factor of ten. This will enable us to have private launch services not involving the Government. This bill makes sense to me.  
   This is the person who is the head of NASA saying that this idea of having a loan guarantee for the launch vehicles is something that makes sense to him, that it would allow us to increase the reliability by 10 times, and that it would allow us to decrease the cost by a factor of 10, which is very significant. 
   Obviously, we should be looking for more reliable launch vehicles. We should be looking at vehicles that cost a lot less. The Government should not be in the business of building the launch vehicles, but we can assist companies--small companies and large companies--by making it easier for them to get adequate private sector financing for these very important ventures. 
   I have not offered an amendment, I say to the distinguished Banking Committee chairman, because there is an amendment pending at the current time, I did want to outline the concept of an amendment I am prepared to offer, and will offer, as to the feasibility of saying that if you are going to have a loan guarantee program for the actual satellite, there is a desperate need for a loan guarantee program for the vehicles that will be required in order to launch the satellites. 
   We have in the past used foreign launch vehicles from France, China, and the Ukraine, using Ukraine launch vehicles because there is not an adequate supply of launch vehicles in this country. Those rockets and launch vehicles have been inadequate. They have been imperfect. They have had failures and at a great expense to the satellite industry in this country. How much better would it be if we were to have a viable, growing private industry in this country that were assisted by a loan guarantee program to enable them to get adequate financing in the private sector in order to launch the satellites for the purpose of bringing broadcast signals to rural areas as well as to urban areas in the country. 
   Due to the fact that an amendment is pending, I will not be able to offer my amendment at this time. I yield the floor until such time as it is appropriate for me to offer an amendment. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will address my remarks to some of the points the Banking Committee chairman made, if he will give me his attention, regarding some of the concerns he raised in his comments about the amendment I outlined but have not yet offered. 
   On the point the chairman raised, that we do not have a scoring on the amendment, the scoring is very simple. It is $250 million. That is what is authorized. We don't authorize a nickel more or a nickel less. It is not difficult to figure out the scoring and the cost of an amendment that authorizes $250 million. It is $250 million, if that amount is in fact appropriated. 
   He also said we needed to have hearings on this amendment. The Congress has had hearings on the amendment. We had hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee. We had people from industry testify. We had large and small companies testify. We had the head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration testify. We had a sufficient number of people testifying about the pros and cons. 
   He raised the point that we should hear from NASA as to their opinion. I provided the opinion of NASA when I quoted from the statement of the distinguished Administrator of NASA, Dan Goldin, in which he said this amendment could conceivably increase launch vehicle reliability by 10 times and decrease the cost by a factor of 10. 
   So there could not be a clearer statement. He concluded by saying: ``This bill makes sense to me.'' You can't get a clearer statement from NASA as to what they think about the amendment. There could not be a clearer statement about the cost of the amendment other than the fact that we authorize $250 million, not a nickel more, not a dime less but $250 million. 
   So it is very clear. One, we know what the costs are; two, we have in fact had hearings in the Senate on this question; three, we have heard from industry, both large companies and small companies; and finally, we have heard from NASA, which said that it makes a great deal of sense to them, including the fact of reducing the cost of launching vehicles by a factor of 10. I don't know who else we can possibly ask to come before the Congress and address this question. 
   The final point--and I will not prejudge the ruling of the Chair--is on the question of the relevancy. It is clear that the bill before the Senate right now covers the cost of launching satellites to bring broadcast signals to rural America. It is in the bill. The bill clearly says that the loan guarantees are for the acquisition, improvement, enhancement, construction, deployment, and launch of satellites--the means by which local television broadcast signals will be delivered. Well, launching a satellite is absolutely essential and totally relevant to putting satellite broadcast signals into rural America. It could not possibly even be more relevant to the bill before the Senate. The bill itself talks about launching satellites. 
   My amendment provides a loan guarantee to launch satellites. If that is not relevant, I am not sure what would ever be relevant. We are not talking about germaneness. We are 
   talking about relevant to the bill before the Senate, and this is a loan guarantee for launching satellites to bring broadcast signals to rural areas. My amendment creates a loan guarantee program to launch satellites to bring broadcast signals to rural America. It does it through a different department, but obviously it has to be relevant. You don't have to have exactly the same language in an amendment as the bill for it to be relevant. It has to be relevant to what the bill does that is pending before the Senate. I think the question of relevancy is very clear. 
   The fact that we have had hearings in this Congress on this specific amendment, and the fact that we have had  NASA testify in favor of this amendment and say it would reduce the cost by 10 times, reduce the liability by a factor of 10, and the fact that we have had industry, both small and large companies, appear before Congress and testify as to their opinions on this means that we have had hearings, we have the support, and it is certainly relevant, and I think it is the right public policy. 
   While I can't offer the amendment at this time because another one is pending, we will do it at the appropriate time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I made remarks earlier about the intent to offer this amendment. I will not repeat the arguments in favor of it. I will only summarize by saying the Senate Commerce Committee had a complete and full hearing. The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee is on the floor today. We had the privilege of hearing NASA Administrator Dan Goldin testify on this amendment, saying it would save as much as 10 times the cost of a launch vehicle and improve the reliability of those by a factor of 10. We are hearing from big launch companies and also small launch companies that are interested in this industry, 
   and trying to improve it. 
   We had testimony from people in the finance business who speak to the difficulty of getting adequate financing in the private sector because of the questionable nature of the launch vehicle industry and testifying to the fact that a loan guarantee program would be very helpful. 
   The final point is that when you talk about bringing satellite broadcast signals to rural America, you cannot just talk about the ``big ball'' that, in fact, is the satellite. You also have to talk about how you get the satellite into orbit around the country. Thirty-seven percent of the cost of bringing that broadcast signal to rural America involves the cost of the launch vehicle. 
   Currently, the United States relies on China, France, Ukraine, and other countries that are not market-based countries but, rather, are countries in which their industry is financed 100 percent by the government. Our companies cannot compete unless we have a level playing field. 
   Therefore, the concept of providing a loan guarantee program of a definitive amount of money we know will cost $250 million. That is the money authorized. It would have to go through the Appropriations Committee to get the appropriations, but it could not be any more than $250 million to create a loan guarantee where they could go to the private sector and get a loan from the banks. Having a percentage of it guaranteed by the Federal Government is good, sound economic policy. It is good broadcast industry policy. It is a policy this country should embrace. In areas where we have done it before, as in shipbuilding, it has worked very successfully. 
   I suggest this amendment is very relevant because the bill itself is clear that the Loan Guarantee Program ``is for the acquisition, improvement, enhancement, construction, deployment and launch''--emphasizing launch--``rehabilitation or the means from which local TV broadcast signals will be delivered to an unserved area or underserved area.'' 
   It is clearly relevant, and both amendments are an effort to try to help through loan programs the delivering of broadcast signals to rural America. 
   This is not a germaneness question. It is a relevancy question. If this is not relevant, I don't know what would be relevant on an amendment on the floor of the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor with my distinguished colleague, Senator ROTH, a bill that will repeal the federal excise on telephone service. This tax is outdated, highly regressive and has lasted entirely too long. 
   The ``tax on talking'' was originally levied as a luxury tax to fund the Spanish-American War. At the time, only a small number of wealthy individuals had access to telephone service. Telephones are no longer luxuries that only the very wealthy can afford. They are basic fixtures in every American household. And with the creation of the Internet, telephone service has become the lifeline of the new economy. This expansion of telephone service and its many uses has revealed the regressive nature of the ``tax on talking.'' Today, it is low-income families who are hit the hardest by this excise tax, since they pay a higher percentage of their income on telephone service than higher income families. 
   Mr. President, with the almost universal subscription to telephone service, the repeal of this telephone tax would provide tax relief to virtually every family in the United States. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece of legislation. It is time we ended over 100 years of Americans paying this regressive and unnecessary tax on telephone service.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Thomas D. Brasher, a native of my home state of Louisiana, who will be retiring at month's end after a thirty-five-year career in law enforcement, including thirty years as a postal inspector with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. At the time of his retirement, he will be sixth in seniority among the nation's 2,115 postal inspectors. Although a native of Alexandria, Louisiana, Mr. Brasher has worked with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in California. 
   Tom Brasher began his law enforcement career in Lafayette, Louisiana, in 1964, when he joined that city's auxiliary police force while attending the University of Southwestern Louisiana. He became a regular officer in 1965 and worked in patrol. He joined the Louisiana State Police in 1966, where he worked until 1970 when he was recruited by the Postal Inspection Service. 
   Mr. Brasher's Inspection Service career was in the San Francisco Division, now the Northern California Division. Except for a four-year stint in San Francisco, he worked his entire career in San Jose. Mr. Brasher was primarily involved in investigating external crimes and was the first External Crimes Prevention Specialist for the division. He covered all of seven states and the Pacific Islands in that assignment. He also had assignments in child pornography, embezzlements, and the monitoring of the design and construction of post offices. He also served as an ad-hoc EEO counselor for a four-division area. His last assignments have been on the San Jose External Crimes Team, the San Francisco Bay Area Violent Crimes Team, the Northern California Workplace Violence Team and a detail to the Postal Service's robbery task force. 
   While Mr. Brasher will retire, his wife, Gay Ann, an award-winning school teacher in San Jose, will continue her teaching career. Together they will continue their travels, which so far have taken them to 94 countries around the world. 
   I know I speak for my Senate colleagues when I wish Tom and Gay Ann Brasher all the best in this new phase of their lives and thank him for thirty years of distinguished service to the United States of America.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to honor longtime Baton Rouge business and community leader Bill Rainey, site manager of ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge Chemical Plant. Bill is retiring at the end of this month after a 33-year Exxon career that began at the company's Baton Rouge Refinery in 1966. 
   Those of us in government who spent parts of our careers in Baton Rouge recognize Bill Rainey as one of the most tireless community leaders and effective problem solvers in the Louisiana capital. Bill's leadership in the community and direction of ExxonMobil's philanthropic works will be hard to replace and the company's more than 4,000 employees in Baton Rouge will miss his steady hand on the ExxonMobil rudder. 
   A native of Auburn, Alabama, Bill earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Auburn University in 1966 before embarking on his Exxon career. He left Baton Rouge in 1973 for a three-year stint in Exxon USA's Houston headquarters but returned to the Refinery in 1976 to accept the first of many management positions in Baton Rouge. In 1985, he became manager of the Exxon Research and Development Laboratories (ERDL) in Baton Rouge before returning to the Refinery as mechanical manager in 1988. 
   Like many of Exxon's top performers around the world, he was called to Valdez, Alaska in 1989 where he served as operations manager for Exxon's oil spill recovery and cleanup operations. In 1992, he was named manager of the Baton Rouge Refinery, where he served with distinction until moving up Scenic Highway to the adjacent Baton Rouge Chemical Plant as site manager in 1996. 
   While moving up the ranks to ExxonMobil's two top positions in Baton Rouge, Bill also moved up the ranks in almost every industry and charitable organization in which he was involved. He is a member of the board of directors and the executive committee of the Louisiana Chemical Association and has served with distinction as chairman of the board of directors of the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance since 1996. While refinery manager he served on the board of directors of the Louisiana MidContinent Oil and Gas Association and provided outstanding leadership to that organization's initiatives and responses to various legislative proposals over the years. 
   One of the organizations that will miss Bill the most is the Capital Area United Way, which he served as board chair in 1996-97. ExxonMobil's annual combined corporate and employee and annuitant contribution of more than $1 million makes it the largest United Way supporter in the state and says volumes about his leadership of that essential and worthwhile effort. 
   Bill also serves currently as a member of the board of directors of the Greater Baton Rouge Chamber of Commerce and the Partnership for Excellence Board of LSU's E.J. Ourso College of Business Administration and as co-chair of Community Action for Children. 
   Among Bill's many awards are the 1998 Alumni Recognition Award for Community Services from the LSU School of Social Work and the 1998 Volunteer CEO of the Year Award from the Volunteer Baton Rouge Corporate Volunteer Council. 
   Probably Bill's most notable accomplishment since arriving in Baton Rouge 33 years ago, though, was discovering his lovely wife, the former Emilie Steffek of Baton Rouge, and with her raising their three sons--Will, 29; Chase, 27; and Kyle, 25--all of whom make their homes in Baton Rouge. 
   I know that Bill and Emilie will continue to be active in their efforts to help others and I hope to be able to call on Bill from time to time as oil and gas or petrochemical industry issues critical to our state arise. 
   Bill is a frequent visitor to Washington and I know the entire Louisiana delegation joins me in wishing both him and Emilie a long and happy retirement.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to express my personal thanks and deep appreciation for adoption of an amendment to the Senate's crop insurance bill which would authorize crop insurance coverage for the 2001 and future rice crops for losses due to drought and saltwater intrusion. 
   The rice language was included in the Chairman's floor amendment which the Senate approved yesterday. 
   I want to thank Senator LUGAR and Senator HARKIN sincerely for agreeing to the amendment. My sincere appreciation also goes to Senator KERREY and to Senator ROBERTS for accepting the provision. 
   Senator LANDRIEU, Senator LINCOLN and I have been working together for several weeks to help our rice growers who have been experiencing a prolonged drought. It has been my privilege to work with Senator LANDRIEU and Senator LINCOLN in addressing the absence of rice crop insurance coverage for the drought and saltwater intrusion perils. 
   Currently, the rice crop insurance policy does not include coverage for losses due to drought and saltwater intrusion. A meeting about the current policy and how to address the absence of coverage was held with our staff, grower representatives and USDA's Risk Management Agency. The willingness to meet and the attention given to the situation at the meeting and subsequent to it by Mr. Ken Ackerman, the RMA's Administrator, and his staff are also sincerely appreciated. 
   To ensure that drought and saltwater intrusion coverage are provided in time for the 2001 rice crop and prior to the USDA policy change deadline, legislation was prepared which is now in the Senate's crop insurance bill. In order for a crop insurance policy change to become effective, it must be adopted by November 30, which is USDA's annual deadline for such changes. 
   With the rice crop insurance language being only in the Senate bill, it is my hope that it will be retained in conference with the House. I take this opportunity to urge the Senate's conferees to keep the rice crop insurance provision in the final conference bill. 
   Insurance coverage for rice crop losses due to drought and saltwater intrusion is an important risk management tool for rice growers to have available to them. Again, I express deep personal appreciation for the Senate approving inclusion of the bill language which Senator LANDRIEU, Senator LINCOLN and I have worked on, which we strongly support and which we submitted for the Senate's consideration. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, it is hard to pick up a newspaper or turn on a television set or read any kind of political commentary or watch one of the Sunday morning talk shows without having the subject very quickly turn to the high price that we in this country are paying for gasoline. There is a certain amount of deja vu when you look at some of these situations: Here we go again. Many Members remember quite well the problems this country faced in the 1970s when we had the long lines at our gas stations around this country. People were screaming and hollering about the lack of gas for their automobiles and were also complaining about the price of that gas if they were lucky enough to get it. 
   Here we are in the year 2000, and basically the problem is very similar to what it was back in 1973. It is interesting to me to see so many people wringing their hands, struggling to find out exactly what is causing this problem. It is not, indeed, a mystery at all. The problem is one of supply and demand. We are using far more gas and oil in this country than we were in the past decade, than in the past 5 years, in fact, more than we used last year. Yet we are producing substantially less than we are using. 
   During the 1970s oil embargo, many of us, particularly those from oil-producing States, were saying the problem would only get worse unless we did something to become energy self-sufficient. In those days, the 1970s, we were importing about 36 percent of the oil we consumed in the United States. When the OPEC nations just slightly tightened their valves and started producing a little bit less, that 36 percent brought this Nation to its knees and created the long lines at the gas stations. 
   Many of us at that time said it was only going to get worse unless we concentrated on trying to be more energy self-sufficient in this country; we would have to concentrate on making sure we were producing, in an environmentally safe manner, the necessary energy to run this Nation. 
   I wonder what people would say if we imported 50 percent of all the food we needed to feed the citizens of our country. I bet that if we were 50-percent dependent on foreign countries for food in this country, there would be long lines marching in Washington, people clamoring for our Nation to get its act together and become more self-sufficient, producing the food we need. I wonder why it is any different when it comes  to producing the energy this country needs. 
   If food is important to our Nation and to our Nation's economy, to our Nation's well-being, to our security, certainly energy, which runs this country, is important to the security of this Nation. Yet in the year 2000 we are not importing 36 percent of the energy we use, as we were in the last major crisis back in the 1970s. Today we are importing 55 percent; 55 percent of all of the energy from oil and gas that we use in this country is coming from other countries. We cannot depend on many of these countries to give us the supply of energy we need in this country. 
   So I question why there is so much difficulty in figuring out why we have this problem. In the last 13 years, our domestic oil production has fallen by 2.7 million barrels a day. In the past 2 years, domestic production has fallen about half a million barrels per day. In the last decade, there has been a 
   17-percent decline in the domestic production of oil and gas in this country, while at the same time our domestic oil consumption has increased by 14 percent. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that we have a huge problem. We are producing less and less and we are consuming more and more. We are depending more and more on foreign sources for the energy we need to run America. 
   Whether you are a farmer in Louisiana or in Kansas or any other part of the United States, or whether you are a housewife taking the children to school, whether you are a small businessman who is dependent on deliveries, or whether you are an independent trucker anywhere in America, you are starting to feel serious economic pressure because of the dramatic and rapid increase in the price of oil, in the price of gas at the pump. 
   The reason I bring this to my colleagues' attention is not any mystery. I have outlined why I think the problem is as it is. When you become over 50-percent dependent on other countries for something that is so important to your domestic survival and economic security, as we are dependent on oil, our country is facing very difficult times. 
   Some may ask: Senator, that is all fine and good. I understand what you are saying. But is there any oil for us to produce in this country? 
   The answer is: Absolutely. The problem, however, is that so many of our Nation's most valuable energy areas have been arbitrarily shut off from any potential exploration and development by actions of Government, actions by the Congress, actions by the previous President, actions by this President. They have all said: There are certain areas we are not even going to look for oil and gas. We would rather depend on OPEC to be generous and give us all the oil we need at the price we want. 
   In fact, that is not happening. On the chart I have here on the floor, the orange shows the areas in the Outer Continental Shelf around the United States where we have said, by Presidential edict or by acts of Congress: You cannot even look for oil and gas. 
   From Maine to Florida, from Washington State to the Mexican border, we have said we are not going to look or explore or even offer for lease these areas where there are known quantities of oil and gas. 
   The distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. MURKOWSKI, talked about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the fact that it has been closed to any kind of production. An interesting fact is, our own Department of the Interior has estimated we have enough oil in that area to replace the amount of oil we are getting from the country of Saudi Arabia. Yet that area has been closed to even looking to see if oil might be there and in recoverable quantities. 
   I remember the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge issue very well. I was in the House of Representatives when Congress made a decision as to how to handle that area, which is located right next to Prudhoe Bay, which arguably has been one of the largest oil deposits anywhere in North America. 
   I remember when we were doing the National Alaskan Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980. We were not sure about what to do with that area because not enough was known at that time, some said, to make a decision on whether or not we should explore for oil in that area. 
   The House of Representatives--and it was also adopted in the Senate--said: All right, we are going to take this area and set it aside, and we are going to study it. 
   A lot of times, when Congress does not know what to do, it studies something and delays it by having a study. 
   We required the Department, working with industry, to do a study about whether, No. 1, there were resources there, and, No. 2, whether they could be environmentally, safely produced by actions of industry if we allowed them to do it. That was in 1980. 
   In 1987, the studies were completed and the results were in. The Department of the Interior looked at the results of that study and recommended the area be leased for exploration and development. But Congress would not let them do that. The administration would not let them do that. Even though the Department of the Interior, based on the study we required them to do in this area, recommended the area be leased for exploration and development, there has been no exploration. We will not even look to see whether there is any oil in that area for use by the people of this country. Yet the estimate is that there could be as many as 16 billion barrels of oil sitting there. By governmental action, by Presidential order, we are saying we are not even going to look there. 
   Some say: Senator, are you advocating we have oil production in a refuge? I only point out, we have oil production in my State of Louisiana in practically every wildlife refuge. In the congressional district I represented, which is on the coast of Louisiana, we had oil and gas production on every single one of the wildlife refuges. 
   The test is whether it is compatible with the purpose of the refuge. The question is whether they can be done together in an environmentally safe manner. The answer has clearly been shown to be yes, it can, in most circumstances. The wildlife refuge benefits from some of the royalties from that oil and gas production, and the country benefits because we are producing oil where it is found. We can do both at the same time. 
   The Department of the Interior said that in 1987 after this 
   extensive study Congress required. People in Congress said: We will study it because we think the answer will come back no. But when the answer came back, yes, it can be done, Congress said: We are going to say no anyway. 
   If one looks at the map on the chart, they will notice that from Maine, up to the Canadian border, down to the middle of Florida, we have 25 leases. That is it--25 leases. In the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana and Texas, we have over 10,000 leases--oil that is being produced on the Outer Continental Shelf that is being used by everybody in the United States. About 75 percent of our Federal oil comes from off my State and the States of Texas and Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico. Over 10,000 leases are producing oil every day, ensuring economic security for this country. 
   We cannot do it by ourselves. Selfishly, I could say: Look, I hope they do not do it anywhere else. It is great for Louisiana if we have all the production and we get all the benefits, all of the jobs, all of the construction; that is fine for my State. But it is not good national policy to say we are only going to do it off one State. 
   On the other hand, look at the west coast. There are a lot of cars on the west coast. There are a lot of SUVs on the west coast. There are a lot of people hurting who want prices to be lower on the west coast. Yet the entire coastline from Canada to Mexico is off limits. There are only 83 leases from Canada to Mexico, and these are old leases which have been there for years and years. 
   With regard to this orange area on this map, we are saying: No, don't look at it; don't touch it; don't consider it. Are they saying that because we do not need it when we import 55 percent of our oil, or are they saying things have to be done perfectly to proceed and, unless things are done perfectly, we are never going to proceed? 
   It seems to me we have to have a balanced approach to energy development in this country. We cannot continue to send our Secretary of Energy--which is where I understand he is this week--to meet with OPEC hat in hand, saying to these foreign countries, please, please, give us more oil, when at the same  time we are not doing nearly enough to develop the legitimate resources in our own country. 
   If we had an aggressive development and production program in our country, we would not be importing 55 percent of the oil we need to run America. Yet when we say we are not going to do anything between Canada and Mexico and between Canada and Florida and we are only going to do it off Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, that is not a balanced approach to energy development in the United States. 
   Some say: We don't want to have it off our coast because it may pollute the environment; we may have an oil spill from an offshore platform. The truth is, it is far more dangerous to import oil in tankers every day than it is to produce in offshore waters. There was a study done by the National Academy of Sciences--and it is on the minerals management web site--which talks about where oil is coming from that is polluting the waters of the world. Does it come from offshore production? No. Offshore oil and gas development is actually 2 percent of the oil that is found in offshore waters around the world. A little less than 2 percent comes from offshore development. 
   Where does it come from? It is no surprise: Importing oil and moving oil around the oceans of the world in ships. Marine transportation accounts for 45 percent of all the oil that is found in the ocean waters that is not supposed to be there. Municipal and industrial waste and runoff, which comes from when it rains and the rain runs off the streets and works its way ultimately to the oceans of the world, accounts for another 36 percent. Atmospheric fallout is about 9 percent, and natural seepage, which comes up from the ocean floor, is about another 9 percent. But less than 2 percent of the oil that is found in oceans comes from drilling for oil and gas off the coast of the countries where oil can be found. 
   I do not know what the answer is. There is no simple answer. I know the President made some proposals in a radio address this week. I encourage the administration to continue to seek solutions to the problem. 
   I have a suggestion, and one of the suggestions is right from the minerals management office. They have a chart that talks about the undiscovered resources in areas that are currently under moratorium. 
   They make an estimate of how much oil is in areas of the country that we cannot even enter. Their estimate is probably the most accurate in the world. 
   For areas under moratorium--either congressional or Presidential moratorium--they estimate there are 15.2 billion barrels of oil sitting out there in areas where we are saying: Don't even go look. And there is an additional 61.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that could be found in these areas. But you know what. If we don't look, we will never know. It would seem to me that as long as we have these huge areas where we have x'd out any ability to take a look to see what energy is there, we are not on very solid ground when we blame OPEC for the problems we are facing today. 
   With 55 percent of the oil used in the United States being imported, OPEC has the ability, by turning that faucet off just a little bit, to bring this country to its knees. Can you imagine what it would do if they turned a full turn and really reduced it? 
   No nation should ever allow itself--certainly not a nation as strong as the United States--to become dependent on foreign sources for things that are critical to our economic well-being and our national security and, indeed, our survival. Yet over the years we have allowed just that to happen with regard to energy. 
   We would not allow it to happen in the area of food. We would not allow it to happen in the area of planes or tanks or warships or anything else that we depend on for our national security--except in this one area. We have made a conscious decision to say: It is all right to import over half of the energy we use. 
   It is unacceptable. It is bad public policy. It needs to be changed; otherwise, every so often we will be faced with what we are faced with today. 
   In his radio address, the President has made some suggestions which I have noted. One was the creation of an environmentally sound home heating oil reserve for the Northeast. My question is, Where does the oil for that reserve come from? Are we just going to buy it from OPEC at $30 a barrel? That is not going to solve the problem of high energy prices for the Northeast if we are filling up their oil reserve with oil coming from OPEC at $30 a barrel. It would come out of the reserve at the same price. 
   The second suggestion is to immediately reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is located in Louisiana and Texas, where we have oil underground. I am all for doing that, but we are going to be putting oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at $30 a barrel because of what OPEC has done to us. 
   Neither one of these two suggestions domestically produce any additional oil. It will continue to be filled with 55 percent of oil coming from foreign sources at $30 a barrel or at whatever price OPEC determines. 
   The President has some other suggestions on promoting energy efficiency. We are all for that. He has some suggestions for tax incentives for energy efficiency. I am for that. He has some suggestions on promoting the use of alternative fuels--I am for that--and also support for domestic oil production, which I think is very positive. 
   But if you have all of these areas that are roped off, if you will, and you say, ``Don't go here,'' when we know some of these areas have as much as Saudi Arabia exports to us--such as, in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge--I suggest that as long as we have huge areas, thousands of miles of areas where we are saying don't even look for energy, then we are never going to address the heart of the problem, which is a lack of energy self-sufficiency for the United States of America. We cannot ever say we are going to be energy self-sufficient just by producing energy off the coast of one or two States. 
   Certainly, the Congress in the past has accepted the fact that we would let these areas be roped off. I guess the thought is always: Let's produce it somewhere else. 
   That is what we are doing. We are producing it somewhere else. It is called OPEC. Its nations have formed a cartel. They have done very well in controlling the price. They know they can bring this country--indeed, the world--to its knees simply by turning the valve off just a little bit. They will continue to do that. 
   I hope they open up the spigot just a little bit, but as long as we are importing 55 percent of the energy for the United States of America, they will always have the ability to bring us to our knees. That is something that should be unacceptable for the United States of America. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BREAUX. I wish to enter into a colloquy with the Senator from South Carolina. The Department of Professional Aviation at Louisiana Tech is one of the University's most successful departments. With the expansion of the aviation industry in this nation, the University has been in the process of expanding the physical infrastructure for the Department of professional Aviation. 
   A new $6 million instructional facility has recently been constructed on the campus and the University will also construct a new flight operations facility at Ruston Regional Airport. While the State of Louisiana and the University have financed the cost of building these new facilities, the University is hopeful that it can receive federal assistance for the purchase of newer and safer equipment, such as new single-engine aircraft, a multiengine training aircraft, and a multiengine turbine simulator. 
   As we consider this FAA reauthorization bill, I would like to know whether this is something that would be appropriate for receiving financial support from the FAA in the form of competitive grant funding as part of its university research and air safety programs? I hope that grant funding for this project can be obtained from the FAA.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I'm pleased to rise today to call to the attention of my colleagues and all of our constituents across the nation that March is National Eye Donor Month. For more than 55 years now thousands of Americans have participated in this selfless exercise of helping others. 
   The purpose of National Eye Donor Month is not only to honor the past donors who have played a pivotal role in restoring the sight of over half a million individuals, but also to raise public awareness of the continuing need for donors. When people decide to become a donor all they need to do is sign a card and announce their intent to their family. 
   The many recipients of this ``gift of sight'' represent the great diversity of our nation's population. For instance, Judrita Billiot is a young Houma Indian who lives in a small community about 50 miles from New Orleans, Louisiana. This young girl was born with a condition known as congenital opacity, in which the corneas neither transmit nor allow the passage of light. When she was still less than a year old Judrita received corneal transplants in both of her eyes. I'm happy to say that today she is a healthy young girl with normal vision thanks not only to the transplant procedure, but also to the donors who were thoughtful enough to leave behind this extraordinary gift. 
   The success of Judrita's transplants is not uncommon. The current success rate of corneal transplantation is nearly 90% thanks to a rigorous screening process and the dedication of our nation's eye banks, working in conjunction with the Eye Bank Association of America. 
   I appreciate this opportunity to highlight National Eye Donor Month and I encourage all of my colleagues to work with their local eye banks to increase public awareness of corneal transplantation and the continuous need for donors.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I wish to note the departure from public life of one of our state's most gifted public servants. Michael Skinner, who has served for the past six years as U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana, the largest geographical district in my home state, left office on January 15 and has returned to the private practice of law in Lafayette. 
   It is no exaggeration to say that Michael Skinner will be remembered as the most effective and successful U.S. Attorney in the history of the Western District of Louisiana. From almost his first day in office, he set about to make it clear to the people of his district that the U.S. Attorney's office was their office, administering justice on their behalf and for their benefit. In short order, he threw open the doors of his office, demystified the work of the U.S. Attorney and instilled a renewed sense of confidence and enthusiasm for the administration of justice in the Western District of Louisiana. Judges, attorneys, citizens and scores of public officials from Lafayette to Lake Charles to Alexandria to Shreveport to Monroe agreed that Michael Skinner's appointment was a true breath of fresh air. 
   Mr. Skinner's record as U.S. Attorney is an impressive one. He successfully prosecuted scores of cases involving public corruption, violent crime, drugs, health care and other types of program fraud, environmental crime and civil rights violations. Some of his most successful cases included: Food stamp and Medicaid/Medicare indictments and convictions that uncovered millions in fraud; a child pornography investigation that broke a child prostitution ring in South Louisiana; an environmental investigation that resulted in the cleanups of several south Louisiana toxic waste dumps; and the prosecution of literally hundreds of drug dealers who admitted or were convicted of selling drugs in Louisiana. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to have recommended Michael Skinner's nomination to President Clinton in 1993. In the years since his confirmation by this body, I have watched with a mixture of pride and admiration as he performed the duties of his office with a rare combination of skill, integrity, compassion and determination. Mike Skinner represents the best that our country has to offer in its public servants and I believe that he will serve as the model for every person who follows him in that office. I know that I speak for the citizens of Louisiana and for every member of this body in thanking him for a job well done and in wishing he and his family all the best in this new phase of their lives.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, in 1996 and 1997, I supported the creation of S corporation ESOPs, which--while they may sound a bit obscure to some--are an innovative way of giving employees an ownership stake in their companies and providing for their retirement. 
   The design of these programs was quite deliberate, and intended to accomplish very specific policy objectives. We sought to create not only an administrable structure for these plans, but also a program that encouraged private businesses to give their workers a ``piece of the rock'' and help them save for their retirement. The law therefore allows some deferral of tax liability on current-year revenues of a participating S corporation, but of course only for that portion of the company's revenues that are put into the ESOP accounts of employees. That is to say, the deferral only exists so long as the monies are not realized by employee-owners; when they withdraw the funds for their retirement benefit, they also pay a tax, and in this case, at a much higher rate than standard capital gains. 
   Recently, some have questioned whether this incentive should be eliminated. I am delighted that a strong bipartisan majority of the members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee have indicated they want to preserve the fundamental attributes of S corporation ESOPs. We have carefully scrutinized this matter in recent months, particularly in the context of the tax extenders legislation. We have determined that Treasury's proposal to eliminate the deferral aspect of S corporation ESOPs is a serious threat to the vitality of S corporation ESOPs. In rejecting this proposal, Congress has affirmed that--at a time when national savings rates are abysmally low, when Americans worry how they will fund their retirement, and when we in Congress worry about the future of Social Security--we cannot afford to undo such important programs. 
   In response to Treasury's concerns with possible abuse of the system, we included a revenue raising provision in the extenders package to strengthen the 1996 law. However, the Treasury Department objected to the provision and it was dropped during the last minute negotiations on the bill. Secretary Summers has agreed to work with me over the coming months on a provision to strengthen and preserve broad-based employee ownership of S corporations through ESOPs in the future. 
   Today, there are 100,000 or more workers in America who are using and benefiting from the S corporation ESOP rules that we designed. We have reason to be proud of this accomplishment, and to point to it as an example of how we are helping Americans build wealth for their futures and their families through private ownership. I believe more workers stand to benefit from this great opportunity, which is working as Congress intended. I believe, along with a strong bipartisan group of my colleagues, that we must do all we can to sustain and promote S corporation ESOPs. I appreciate the strong support of Chairman ROTH and other members of the Finance Committee in particular to achieve this objective, and look forward to working with them on an ongoing basis for this very important cause.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from the Senate Finance Committee, Senator MACK, in introducing legislation designated to address past problems with  the allocation of the generation-skipping transfer (GST) exemption, and to provide for automatic allocations going forward. 
   Under current law, taxpayers must make affirmative allocations of the GST exemption for transfers to a trust. As a result, many taxpayers have not made timely allocations and face the prospect of losing a significant portion of the exemption's benefit. This legislation is designed to assure that taxpayers get the full benefit of the law by making GST exemption allocations automatic for transfers to a trust and to give taxpayers the opportunity to cure past allocations which were not made on a timely basis. 
   This legislation was included in the tax bill that was sent to the President earlier this summer. It enjoys Republican and Democratic support on both sides of the hill. I urge its inclusion in the next tax bill sent to the White House.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to send to the desk a bill that is called the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Act of 1999. The legislation cosponsored by Senators SNOWE, HOLLINGS, SHELBY, KERRY, SESSIONS and LANDRIEU results from a far reaching conservation agreement among four key recreational and commercial fishing organizations. These organizations include the Billfish Foundation, the Coastal Conservation Association, the American Sportfishing Association and the Blue Water Fishermen's Association. 
   The legislation will prohibit pelagic long line fishing for designated months each year in U.S. waters determined to be swordfish nursery and billfish bycatch areas based on extensive analyses of the best available science. Based upon the effectiveness of this type of management strategy in other U.S. fisheries, I am optimistic about the benefits that can come from the legislation. 
   Mr. President, the legislation has three major components that I would like to briefly outline. 
   First, the bill would prohibit pelagic longline fishing for certain months each year in U.S. waters where swordfish and billfish are caught with other fish. Essentially, more than 160,000 square nautical miles in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico would become a conservation area to rebuild populations of swordfish, sailfish, tuna, marlin and sharks. 
   Recognizing the economic impact on commercial fishermen, the legislation provides a fair and equitable program for longline vessel owners who are adversely impacted by the fishing prohibition. Funding of the permit buyback program would come through a partnership of the recreational and commercial fishing industries and federal funds. 
   The bill also directs the National Marine Fisheries Service to conduct a comprehensive research program in cooperation with the U.S. longline fleet to identify and test a variety of longline gear configurations to determine which are the most effective at reducing billfish bycatch in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. 
   I believe that a true solution to the bycatch issue will require international cooperation. Ironically, next week the U.S. Commissioners to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) will be meeting in Brazil to consider many challenging issues, including a rebuilding plan for the north Atlantic stock of swordfish. 
   Under the bill we introduce today, we are taking a bold first step to address the problems in our own coastal waters. I am confident that this first step will serve as an example to the international community on focusing much needed attention to this important issue.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take this time with my distinguished colleague, Senator FRIST from Tennessee, and our distinguished colleague, Senator BOB KERREY, who served with me on the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, to offer what I think is the first ever comprehensive Medicare reform bill to be introduced since the advent of Medicare back in 1965. 
   We introduced a bill today. It is available for consideration by our colleagues. I hope this legislative effort becomes the marker for future discussions and debate on the question of what we do with Medicare. We introduced the bill today because we think it is absolutely essential that the Congress in this session take up the question of how to reform the Medicare Program that is currently serving 40 million Americans. 
   We did it essentially for two reasons. First of all, the program that the seniors now benefit from is not nearly as good as it should be nor nearly as good as it can be. Medicare today is noted more for what it does not cover than for what it actually covers. As an example, it does not cover prescription drugs; it does not cover eyeglasses; it does not cover hearing aids--three examples of things our seniors need and need very desperately. 
   So in addition to not covering these items, it does not cover a number of other expenses, including about 47 percent of the expenses for seniors who are not covered by Medicare insurance. They have to go out and buy supplemental insurance. So the program is not nearly as good as it should be, nor as good as we could make it. 
   The second reason we have introduced it is because, as bad as the program is, it is going broke. By the year 2020, one-half of all the revenues to fund the Medicare program are going to have to come out of general revenues. It was never intended to come out of general revenues. It was supposed to be paid from the payroll tax. But, by 2020, over half the costs of the program are going to have to come from general revenues. In addition, by the year 2015, the program is going to be insolvent. It is going to be broke. There is not going to be enough money to pay for the benefits the seniors currently get. 
   For those two reasons, we have built on what the Medicare Commission recommended, expanded on it, and improved upon it, to present to our colleagues the first ever comprehensive Medicare reform bill. 
   Basically, building on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, we are saying about the plan that I, as a Senator, have, and what all of our colleagues and all the House Members and the other 10 million Federal employees have, is if it is good enough for them, it should also be good enough for our Nation's seniors. 
   What we have suggested is we pattern a new Medicare program based on the Federal employees plan. We would create a Medicare board, which would be appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, for 7-year terms. They would guarantee all the plans being submitted to serve our seniors would ensure quality standards. They would negotiate the premiums. They would approve the benefits package. They would make sure there are safeguards against adverse selection of only healthy seniors. They would provide information to our seniors. 
   This Medicare board would call upon the existing health care financing authority and all private groups such as insurance companies--whether it is an Aetna or a Blue Cross--all of these who want the privilege of serving the Medicare beneficiaries would have to compete for the right to do so. They do not do that today. 
   We would say to all these people who want to serve Medicare beneficiaries, they have to offer at least as much as what Medicare pays for today, at least as much but hopefully a lot more. We would require every group that wants to sell health insurance to Medicare beneficiaries to have to compete for the right to do so, compete on the price they request seniors to pay, and compete on the quality of service they make available to seniors. 
   In addition, every one of these plans would have to offer a high option plan which would contain a prescription drug plan. Prescription drugs today are as important as a hospital bed was in 1965, and maybe even more so because prescription drugs keep people out of hospitals. They keep people out of nursing homes. They make their lives better and the quality of their lives better than it would be, were they not getting prescription drugs. 
   So every one of these single plans would have to offer a high option plan and they would have to make that a prescription drug plan with an actuarial value of at least $800 per year, which would be indexed to the increase of costs of prescription drugs annually. 
   They would also have a stop-loss guarantee which simply means no senior would ever have to pay more than $2,000 out of their pocket. 
   We think, in essence, what this plan would do is bring about substantive, real reform to a 1965 model program which simply is not working as we move to the 21st century. We cannot continue to tinker around the edges. We need complete, total reform of the Medicare program. If we do that, then we can start talking about adding other benefits such as prescription drugs, which I think are 
   very important and I strongly support. But you cannot add prescription drugs to a broken program. You have to fundamentally restructure it and reform it; bring about real competition where all these plans will compete for the right to serve. 
   That is what I have as a Senator. That is what 9 million other Federal employees have. I think we would see substantial savings brought about by companies having to compete for who can offer the best package at the best price. If they want to stay in a current fee-for-service plan offered by Medicare, they can stay right where they are. They don't have to make a change. But if they see one of these other plans offer them a better deal, they should take that better deal. 
   We hope our colleagues take a look at what we have offered. We think it is where we are ultimately going to end up. My colleagues, Senators KERREY and FRIST, have done a terrific job. We think this is where we should go as a nation.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce tax reform legislation that is long overdue in the effort to revitalize the nation's fourth arm of defense, the United States flag merchant marine. My bill, the National Security Sealift Enhancement Act of 1999, would provide targeted tax relief to enable the United States-flag oceangoing commercial fleet to better compete with foreign-flag commercial fleets registered in nations that have exempted companies from taxes. 
   Currently, United States companies operating U.S.-flag vessels, and foreign-flag vessels operating under the application of national laws such as Japan or France, are forced to compete against companies that operate vessels under flag-of-convenience registries. Flag-of-convenience shipping registries operate under the legal authority of nations such as Panama, Liberia, Vanuatu, or the Marshall Islands, and attract shipping companies because of the deminimus regulatory costs they impose on companies operating under their flag. All of these nations exempt companies from taxes on income, and employees operating on the vessels do not pay tax on income they earn working aboard. The owners can employ foreign laborers, usually from third world nations, for very little pay, often working in unacceptable conditions. Additionally, the vessel operations are not required to comply with rigorous United States Coast Guard safety and environmental standards, and these operators use private companies to inspect their vessels to ensure that they are in compliance with international safety laws. 
   Mr. President, we are all well aware of the critical role played by the American maritime industry in the economy of Louisiana and our nation. In my home state alone, the total economic impact of that industry was estimated in 1997 to be over $28 billion, supporting approximately 230,000 jobs throughout Louisiana. That economic impact constitutes almost 30 percent of the total gross state product for Louisiana. Louisiana companies were among the first to respond to the nation's call to provide for the rapid transport of critical equipment, munitions, and supplies to the Persian Gulf in those critical days following the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. However, the very existence of the American flag fleet, and thus the related economic and national defense benefits that flow from that fleet, are severely threatened by U.S. tax rules that unfairly hamper and restrict American shipping. 
   I have worked from the first days of my arrival in the Congress to strengthen the U.S.-flag maritime industry and level the playing field in international shipping. Despite the well-intentioned efforts of the Congress, the Maritime Administration and other federal agencies to support the U.S.-flag commercial fleet, unfavorable and clearly noncompetitive U.S. tax policies have led  to the continuing decline of that fleet. In fact, according to statistics maintained by the Maritime Administration, the commercial fleet of the United States has fallen into 11th place internationally, in total carrying capacity, ranking behind those fleets of Panama, Liberia, Malta, the Bahamas, and other nations who offer significant economic and tax advantages to their commercial vessels and crews. 
   These same issues have also plagued other industrialized nations that operate shipping under the application of national laws and policies. For instance, between the period of 1975 and 1992, the national flag fleet operations in terms of deadweight carrying capacity decreased by 94% in the United Kingdom, 98% in Norway, 73% in France, 53% in Germany, 73% in Sweden, 98% in Denmark, and 47% in Japan. 
   In order to combat decreases in the operation of shipping under national registries, nations have taken steps to provide direct subsidies or indirect support schemes that help owners offset the higher costs of operating under national laws. Other nations, such as Denmark and Norway, have created what are called international registries, or open registries, and have reduced taxes and societal costs to help offset the costs as compared to flag-of convenience vessels. Out of the eleven largest shipping registries, by carrying capacity, seven operate as flag-of-convenience registries or open registries. The other four nations are Greece, Japan, the People's Republic of China (which operates it's fleet as a governmentally controlled entity), and the United States. 
   Mr. President, what is even more astounding is that the percentage of cargoes carried by U.S.-flag vessels in the foreign trades has also declined precipitously. At the end of World War II, after we had been forced to rebuild our shipping fleet in order to satisfy our defense logistic needs, almost 60 percent of the U.S. oceanborne commerce in international trade was carried aboard U.S.-flag vessels. Today, that figure is a mere 3 percent. To state this another way, 97 out of every 100 tons of cargo imported into or exported from the United States is carried aboard foreign-flagged ships. Through a wide variety of favorable tax incentives, including in most cases a total exemption from taxation, many foreign jurisdictions have succeeded in developing commercial maritime fleets that far exceed the capacity of that in the U.S. 
   What truly concerns me is that the United States is rapidly undermining its very national security through its failure to enable the U.S.-flag commercial fleet to compete on an equal footing with foreign-flagged shipping. I recognize the strategic importance of the U.S.-flag merchant marine and American merchant mariners, and share the views of other senior political and military leaders that the ability of the U.S. to move its military personnel and supplies overseas quickly and effectively is critical to its national security. The United States cannot 
   rely on foreign allies to achieve our national security objectives. We must be able to act decisively, and to act unilaterally, when our strategic interests are jeopardized. To ensure the maritime industry's ability to accomplish this crucial task, the military utilizes privately-owned U.S.-flagged commercial vessels to supplement the military's own transportation systems in both times of war and peace. Without such capability, the military would have to build and operate, at a significantly greater expense to the government and ultimately the U.S. taxpayers, many more military transport vessels to ensure it can effectively respond to military contingencies in a timely manner. 
   As General Colin Powell so accurately observed following the Persian Gulf War in 1991:  
   Our [nation's] strategy requires us to be able to project power quickly and effectively across the oceans to deal with the crisis we couldn't avoid or predict. Sealift will be critical to fulfilling this strategic requirement. ..... [The military] also acknowledges that the merchant marine and our maritime industry will be vital to our national security for many years to come .....  
   We simply cannot stand idly by while this vital national security asset is undercut through counter productive tax policies that do not allow the U.S.-flag commercial fleet to operate competitively, in the most competitive of all markets--that of international shipping. 
   Mr. President, to preserve that vital national security asset, I believe it is essential to provide a tax environment for U.S.-flag carriers that more closely approaches the favorable tax treatment provided by other maritime nations to their own merchant fleets, while also creating incentives for the construction of new vessels in U.S. shipyards. Foreign tax incentives have significantly undermined the ability of the U.S. to retain a viable commercial fleet for defense purposes and to enhance the balance of trade. By way of example, U.S.-flag commercial vessel operators must pay a 34 percent tax on corporate income and a 50 percent duty on vessel repairs made in foreign countries; they are subject to far more restrictive (and expensive) Coast Guard and other federal operational and safety requirements; and their crewmembers engaged in the foreign trade do not share in the tax relief otherwise provided to U.S. citizens working abroad. On the other hand, owners of foreign-flagged vessels of the Bahamas, Liberia, Malta, Panama and many other countries are totally exempt from any taxation. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that the Bahamas, Liberia, Malta, and Panama have four of the top five commercial fleets in the world, and that vessel owners from around the world regularly register their ships with these countries to avoid taxation. 
   Mr. President, I am not proposing to exempt U.S.-flag vessel owners from U.S. income taxes. Rather, I have developed a comprehensive yet narrowly focused bill that provides the necessary relief to alleviate the tax burden on the U.S.-flag fleet. This legislation is designed to provide a tax environment for U.S.-flag carriers that more closely approaches the favorable tax treatment provided by other maritime nations to their own merchant fleets. The Act includes the following provisions: 
   Capital Construction Fund (CCF) Reform. Title I of the Act would expand the CCF to allow deposits of earnings from U.S. flag, foreign-built ships to be contributed to a CCF for the construction of vessels in the United States. Qualified withdrawals from a CCF would continue to apply only to U.S. built vessels and would be expanded to include vessels that operate between coastwise points of the United States. Contributions to a CCF would no longer be treated as preference items under the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, and owners of U.S. flag ships would also be allowed to deposit into a CCF the duty arising from foreign ship repairs. 
   Election to Expense U.S. Flag Vessels. Significantly, for the majority of the foreign flag commercial fleet, there is no applicable depreciation schedule for commercial vessels because those vessels and their corporate owners and operators are totally exempt from income taxation. Other maritime nations that impose income taxes on commercial vessel operations still have depreciation schedules far more lenient than the anti-competitive 10-year schedule applicable to U.S.-flagged vessels. Therefore, in order to be internationally competitive, Title II of the Act would enable the owner of any U.S. flag vessel engaged in the international trade of the U.S. to fully deduct that vessel in the year in which the vessel is acquired and documented under the U.S. flag. 
   Seaman's Wage Exclusion. Consistent with the current policies and objectives of Section 911 of the Internal Revenue Code, Title III of the Act would extend the foreign earned income exclusion to American merchant mariners by changing the definition of ``foreign country'' to include a principal place of employment aboard a commercial vessel operating outside the United States, and amending the foreign residence test to include work aboard a vessel. 
   Alternative Minimum Tax Relief. In order to be internationally competitive, Title IV of the Act repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) with respect to shipping income. No such tax exists on commercial vessels of any other foreign country, and the changes proposed elsewhere in this Act will essentially be meaningless if the AMT continues to apply to shipping income. 
   Deduction of Expenses. The existing tax provision which permits the deduction of expenses with respect to conventions, seminars or other meetings on U.S.-flag cruise vessels traveling between U.S. ports would be expanded by  Title V of the Act to include U.S.-flag cruises between the United States and foreign ports. 
   Mr. President, absent the tax reforms in the attached proposal, U.S.-flag carriers in Louisiana and elsewhere will continue to face a formidable tax cost disadvantage against foreign flag carriers, who pay little or no tax to their home countries. This cost differential impedes the ability of U.S.-flag carriers to compete in the global marketplace, as evidenced by the ever growing share of non-U.S. flag carriers currently carrying this nation's imports and exports. It is universally recognized that key components of a strong national economy are a strong national merchant marine and shipyard industrial base, and it is now appropriate to alleviate the tax burden on the U.S.-flag fleet and simultaneously promote construction in U.S. shipyards. I urge my colleagues to strongly support this legislation for the good of our American flag fleet and the security of our nation.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, in introducing the Private Wireless Spectrum Use Act. This legislation will help the more than 300,000 U.S. companies, both large and small, that have invested $25 billion in internally owned and operated wireless communications systems. It will provide these companies with critically needed spectrum and will do so through an equitable lease fee system. 
   The private wireless communications community includes industrial, land transportation, business, educational, and philanthropic organizations that own and operate communications systems for their internal use. The top 10 U.S. industrial companies have more than 6,000 private wireless licenses. Private wireless systems also serve America's small businesses in the utility, contracting, taxi, and livery industries. 
   These internal-use communications facilities greatly enhance the quality of American life. They also support global competitiveness for American firms. For example, private wireless systems support: the efficient production of goods and services; the safe transportation of passengers and products by land and air; the exploration, production, and distribution of energy; agricultural enhancement and production; the maintenance and development of America's infrastructure; and compliance with various local, State, and Federal operational government statutes. 
   Current regulatory policy inadequately recognizes the public interest benefits which private wireless licensees provide to the American public. Consequently, allocations of spectrum to these private wireless users have been deficient. Private wireless entities received spectrum in 1974 and 1986 when the FCC allocated channels in the 800 megahertz and 900 megahertz bands. Over time, however, the FCC has significantly reduced the number of channels available to industrial and business entities in those allocations. Private wireless entities now have access to only 299 channels, or 32 percent of the channels of the original allocation. 
   Spectrum auctions have done a great job of speeding up the licensing of interpersonal communications services and have generated significant revenues for the U.S. Treasury. They have also unfortunately skewed the spectrum allocation process toward subscriber-based services and away from critical radio services such as private wireless which are exempted from auctions. Nearly 200 megahertz of spectrum has been allocated for the provision of commercial telecommunications services, virtually all of which has been assigned by the FCC through competitive bidding. 
   Competitive bidding is not the proper assignment methodology for private wireless telecommunications users. Private wireless operations are site-specific systems which vary in size based on a user's particular needs, and are seldom mutually exclusive from other private wireless applicants. Auctions, which depend on mutually exclusive applications and use market areas based on population, simply cannot be designed for private wireless systems. 
   Under this legislation, the FCC would allocate no less than 12 megahertz of new spectrum for private wireless use as a measure to maintain our industrial and business competitiveness in the global arena, as well as to protect the welfare of the employees in the American workplace. Research indicates that private wireless companies are willing to pay a reasonable fee in return for use of spectrum. They recognize that their access to spectrum increases with their willingness to pay fair value for the use of this national asset. 
   This bill grants the FCC legislative authority to charge efficiency-based spectrum lease fees in this new spectrum allocation. These lease fees should encourage the efficient use of spectrum by the private wireless industry, generate recurring annual revenues as compensation for the use of spectrum, and retain spectrum ownership by the public. Furthermore, the fee should be easy for private frequency advisory committees to calculate and collect.

   Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair for recognizing me. 
   Mr. President, I want to comment on the legislation pending before the Senate which is the Caribbean Basin Initiative trade bill along with the African trade bill. 
   I remind my colleagues, it came out of the Senate Finance Committee with a unanimous vote. In essence, we did it on a voice vote. At a time when this Congress and perhaps this Senate is becoming better known for what we have not done, we are presented with an opportunity to do something extremely significant in the area of trade for a large part of the world with which the United States deals. 
   When we write about what we did or did not do in this first session of this Congress, it will be clearly pointed out that we did not do Social Security reform, as the Presiding Officer well knows, because of his involvement in an effort to reform that system. 
   We did not do Medicare reform, as the speaker certainly knows, following the efforts of the National Commission on Medicare. 
   We did not do campaign finance reform, and we all remember those arguments. 
   We have not done Patients' Bill of Rights legislation because of the differences of opinion and the politics involved in that legislation. 
   I do not know of any environmental legislation that has worked its way through this body with a resounding vote of support, nor do I remember particularly any major education efforts that have been successfully navigated through this body this year. 
   I have a great fear this body is becoming more known for what we have not done rather than what we have done. I wonder what the American people think of the distinguished Members of this body with whom I have the privilege of serving and why we cannot get together and work out our differences in the interest of the American public. Why do we spend so much of our time debating whose fault it is that nothing is getting done as opposed to working together? We can always have the debate over who did it. At least under those circumstances we would be arguing about success: Look what we did; no, look what we did, rather than arguing about failure and whose fault it is that nothing was done. 
   We have one last opportunity of great significance in this Congress to pass legislation that is bipartisan in its origination, that is strongly supported by the administration, which, when it came before the Senate Finance Committee after the hearings and after the debate, we reported out by a voice vote. 
   The question then becomes: What is the problem now? Some will argue it is the Republicans' fault because they  have filled up the tree. That ought to go over well in my State of Louisiana when I tell people we did not pass this bill because the Republicans filled up the tree. They are going to say: What in the world are you talking about? 
   I daresay some are going to say: We did not complete action on this bill because we were not able to offer amendments to it in the nature of other important efforts, such as minimum wage or agricultural provisions, or other trade legislation that some want to offer. Because they cannot offer it now, we are not going to continue our progress on this legislation. 
   I daresay, the American people would say: What in the world are you talking about? 
   Here is a trade bill that affects U.S. jobs, U.S. industry; it helps people who have been loyal to the United States in other parts of the world. It clearly helps Central American nations which not too many years ago were Marxist countries, Communist dictatorships that have gradually been brought into the family of nations with the assistance of the United States, and we want to continue having their support on things that are important for the people of this country. 
   This legislation is a way of doing that--by working out bilateral trade agreements with these countries to the south of us that will help them economically. When we help them economically, they help us. When countries in Central America can do a little bit better economically, they buy more of what we produce. 
   From my own State of Louisiana, they could buy more rice, more soybeans, more manufactured goods. They would ship it through the Port of New Orleans, the Port of Baton Rouge, and the Port of Lake Charles because they have more money and better jobs. They are helped and we are helped. It is a win-win situation. 
   The question is: Why don't we do it? What is the problem? The problem is politics. The problem is political posturing about whose fault it is that it is not getting done. Most of the debate is going to be why we did not do it and blame each other for failure. Then, again, the American people are going to say: What in the world are they talking about? 
   My State is particularly affected by this. I have heard arguments that it is bad for American jobs. My State has lost thousands of jobs in the stitch-and-sew industry. It used to be in Louisiana that thousands of minimum wage employees, many of them minorities, were working in the stitch-and-sew industry for many of these large companies that manufacture items we are talking about today. Many of them were arbitrarily dismissed, arbitrarily fired. Many of them lost their jobs right before Christmas a couple of years ago when most of the companies moved out of my State and went to Central American and Latin American countries and located down there. That has already happened. It did not happen because of this bill. This bill was not being considered then. It happened because of the existing state of the world. 
   I have worked with our people. We have helped them find other jobs. Fortunately, because of the economic conditions of our State and the economic conditions of the United States, the vast majority of these people who lost jobs in the so-called stitch-and-sew industry have found jobs in more sophisticated, if I can use that term, industries in the United States that represent the future of the United States in terms of jobs in the high-tech industries as opposed to something like stitch and sew. 
   What we have been able to do is use some of the training programs and retrain these people to get them into other manufacturing segments, to get them into high technology, to get them into computers, to get them jobs where they now find they are much better off than they were sitting behind a sewing machine stitching and sewing underwear. 
   I argue the future of U.S. employees is not in the stitch-and-sew industry. If we have to somehow preserve jobs in the stitch-and-sew business, we are not being very bullish on America. I argue that is not the future of this country. The future of this country is highly trained men and women who can do the jobs for the 21st century, and that is not in the stitch-and-sew industry. 
   It is interesting. I love my dear friend and colleague from South Carolina who was reading this article in Time about how these companies have, in fact, moved out of the United States. He is absolutely right. One of the things I noticed when I was looking at the article the distinguished junior Senator from South Carolina was pointing out is the article had a picture of the State of Kentucky, and the caption under the article is: ``Fruit of the Loom eliminated more than 7,000 jobs in the past 6 years. Here would-be workers attend a job fair held by new arrival Amazon.com.'' 
   That is particularly important because it says that while stitch-and-sew jobs are moving out of this country, high-tech jobs, better jobs, better paying jobs, more sophisticated jobs, jobs that require more training and a better educated workforce are moving in. 
   The people who were leaving the Fruit of the Loom jobs were moving, on the other hand, into jobs that Amazon.com was providing in that area using those workers and retraining them for the 21st century. 
   That, I argue, is the future of the United States. The future workers of this country are not going to sit behind a sewing machine. If that is the future of this country, I daresay it is not a very bright future. The future is highly trained jobs in highly technical industries which pay well and have a future. 
   We are not going to be able to compete with the poorest of the poor in terms of who can pay the lowest wages. We should be concentrating on educating our workers for the 21st century and then, at the same time, trying to do what we can in the textile industry. 
   The reason I believe it is so very important and necessary to pass this bill is because we say in this trade bill, particularly in the textile industry: Look, we are not going to have the stitch-and-sew jobs, but, by God, we are the best manufacturer of textiles and cloth and fabric. 
   We have the best technical ability to weave and dye the fabric. And this bill, for the first time, says: Look, if we are going to give these countries some advantages, at least we want it to be a two-way street, to at least say, if you are going to be able to do these products in your country, with lower paying jobs, at least use fabric that is manufactured and woven and dyed and assembled in this country. We will send it to you. We will manufacture the fabric, you will use those fabrics to manufacture garments, and then you have the ability to export those products back to this country. 
   Mexico can do it now. China will be able to do it. Unless we have something like this, we are not going to get any part of the business. 
   This legislation, when it talks about the products that are covered, clearly says: Apparel articles assembled in the Caribbean basin and sub-Sahara Africa from fabrics wholly formed and cut in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States. 
   What that says to the cotton farmers in my State of Louisiana and throughout the South is that we are going to use their cotton. Without this legislation, we are not going to be using their cotton. The fabric will come from overseas, as well as the finished product. At least this legislation says we will use their cotton. 
   This legislation also says it has to be assembled in this country. It has to be woven in this country. If it is going to have a color to it, it is going to have to be dyed in this country. So we are getting something out of this that we do not have now, that in the absence of this legislation we will not have. Therefore, I think it is very clear this is something that is important to do. The House thought it was. 
   You talk about how bad the House is divided. The House passed this 234-163. Now it is before this body. For those who argue they don't like the process, I don't like the process, either. I would probably like to offer a Medicare reform bill to this legislation. People are looking for a wagon to jump on to get something passed they would like to have passed. I understand that. The problem is that you are affecting the merits of good legislation that was bipartisan when it left the Senate Finance Committee, that passed by voice vote in the Senate Finance Committee, and that merits our support. 
   So my point is that other countries are going to benefit, but we are going  to benefit. If we do not have this legislation, other countries will be able to have access to our market with no requirements on using U.S. fabric at all. I think we owe it to the workers of this country who are still engaged in some aspect of this industry to come up with a fair product and fair package like this is. 
   I intend to support this legislation. I think it is the right thing to do. I hope my colleagues will join me in that effort. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to rise to express my thoughts about the loss of a great friend and a dear colleague, Senator John Chafee. The Senate has lost a great Senator and this country has, indeed, lost a great American. All of us in the Senate family have lost a great friend. 
   John Chafee was a Senator who thought of what was best for his country first and thought about the politics, if he did at all, last. All of his colleagues, I know, will have great personal memories of Senator Chafee, how their paths crossed over the years, and the work he did as a leader of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. On our own Senate Finance Committee, when we had such historic debates, Senator Chafee was always in the midst of them. I know his work on the Environment and Public Works Committee will ensure all Americans in the future will breathe cleaner air and drink cleaner water and have to worry less about their health because of the environment in which we all live. He always was a leader in the environmental area and will always be noted for that. It is true; all of us are better off for the services he provided in that capacity. 
   I remember John Chafee and the efforts he and I undertook together. It was, indeed, my privilege to work with him on what became known as the Centrist Committee, a centrist coalition. Senator Chafee was enthusiastic about finding a consensus on the difficult issues that faced our country, but he was concerned about more than just trying to find a consensus; he was really concerned about creating a consensus. His efforts in our little coalition produced some dramatic results because he, in hosting these meetings with our colleagues from both sides of the aisle, truly recognized solutions to difficult problems cannot come from the far left or the far right. These difficult solutions must be found in the center, and that is where I think he found himself most comfortable. 
   We used his hideaway office here in the Senate almost on a weekly basis, as I said, to host meetings between Republicans and Democrats who worked together. We talked to each other rather than merely listened to echoes of ourselves. We actually spoke about the issues and tried to find and recommend solutions that were not necessarily good political solutions but were the right thing to do for this country. 
   I think his greatest accomplishment in this area that I remember was the recommendations that he helped guide in the area of health care. We ultimately brought them to the floor of the Senate and they were adopted by a very strong majority of this Senate, to a large extent because of the credibility John Chafee brought when he was listed as being one of the principal cosponsors. Unfortunately, those recommendations did not become the law of the land, but I am certain, and very confident, that one day they will. 
   So John Chafee will be missed by all of us. He served his State and he served his Nation very well. I look to the day in the Senate when there will be more John Chafee's. Certainly this Nation and this country needs them and we deserve them. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator, and I thank all of my colleagues who have worked with me on this important matter. I certainly agree with the comments of the Senators from Texas  and New Mexico that the proposed MMS royalty valuation rule simply will not work. Regulations should reflect a fair, reliable, and accurate royalty valuation system. 
   The issue here is really very simple: How do you set the fair market value of crude oil extracted from Federal lands on which to base the royalty calculation? Oil companies do not determine how much they have to pay--we do. Congress set the royalty percentage in the Mineral Leasing Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and other Federal laws and these laws provide that the royalty percentage to the Federal Government is 1/6 or 1/8 of the total value of the oil. 
   This is a very complicated, ongoing rulemaking procedure to assess legitimate deductions and transportation costs in order to determine the fair market value of oil. But how do you determine the price of oil that is produced in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico? You can very easily determine the price of oil at the wellhead, if you sold the oil at the wellhead, some 200 miles offshore. However, the oil is transported hundreds of miles onshore where it is refined and then ultimately sold. The question then becomes: Who pays for the transportation of the oil from the middle of the gulf? It is the Federal Government's oil. Do the companies pay for the transportation or does the Federal Government? There is a huge disagreement on this very difficult and complicated issue. 
   We say to the Interior Department, in the Interior appropriations conference report, that the rule is fundamentally flawed. It does not allow for the legitimate deductions in the costs of transportation that should be allowed. Therefore, do not go forward with this rule. Instead, we are giving Congress and the Interior Department time to come to an agreement on what is appropriate and I am pleased that we have been able to at least delay the rule until a suitable solution can be determined.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Fuel Tax Equalization Credit for Substantial Power Takeoff Vehicles Act. This bill upholds a long-held principle in the application of the Federal fuels excise tax, and restores this principle for certain single engine ``dual-use'' vehicles. 
   This long-held principle is simple: fuel consumed for the purpose of moving vehicles over the road is taxed, while fuel consumed for ``off-road'' purposes is not taxed. The tax is designed to compensate for the wear and tear impacts on roads. Fuel used for a non-propulsion ``off-road'' purpose has no impact on the roads. It should not be taxed as if it does. Mr. President, this bill is based on this principle, and it remedies a problem created by IRS regulations that control the application of the federal fuels excise tax to ``dual-use'' vehicles. 
   Dual-use vehicles are vehicles that use fuel both to propel the vehicle on the road, and also to operate separate, on-board equipment. The two prominent examples of dual-use vehicles are concrete mixers, which use fuel to rotate the mixing drum, and sanitation trucks, which use fuel to operate the compactor. Both of these trucks move over the road, but at the same time, a substantial portion of their fuel use is attributable to the non-propulsion function. 
   Mr. President, the current problem developed because progress in technology has outstripped the regulatory process. In the past, dual-use vehicles commonly had two engines. IRS regulations, written in the 1950s, specifically exempt the portion of fuel used by the separate engine that operates special equipment such as a mixing drum or a trash compactor. These IRS regulations reflect the principle that fuel consumed for non-propulsion purposes is not taxed. 
   Today, however, typical dual-use vehicles use only one engine. The single engine both propels the vehicle over the road and powers the non-propulsion function through ``power takeoff.'' A major reason for the growth of these single-engine, power takeoff vehicles is that they use less fuel. And a major benefit for everyone is that they are better for the environment. 
   Power takeoff was not in widespread use when the IRS regulations were drafted, and the regulations deny an exemption for fuel used in single-engine, dual-use vehicles. The IRS defends its distinction between one-engine and two-engine vehicles based on possible administrative problems if vehicle owners were permitted to allocate fuel between the propulsion and non-propulsion functions. 
   Mr. President, our bill is designed to address the administrative concerns expressed by the IRS, but at the same time, restore tax fairness for dual-use vehicles with one engine. The bill does this by establishing an annual tax credit available for taxpayers that own a licensed and insured concrete mixer or sanitation truck with a compactor. The amount of the credit is $250 and is a conservative estimate of the excise taxes actually paid, based on information compiled on typical sanitation trucks and concrete mixers. 
   In sum, as a fixed income tax credit, no audit or administrative issue will arise about the amount of fuel used for the off-road purpose. At the same time, the credit provides a rough justice method to make sure these taxpayers are not required to pay tax on fuels that they shouldn't be paying. Also, as an income tax credit, the proposal would have no effect on the highway trust fund. 
   Mr. President, I would like to stress that I believe the IRS' interpretation of the law is not consistent with long-help principles under the tax law, despite their administrative concerns. Quite simply, the law should not condone a situation where taxpayers are required to pay the excise tax on fuel attributable to non-propulsion functions. This bill corrects an unfair tax that should have never been imposed in the first place. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator BOND in introducing the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of 1999. This is important legislation regarding our children's health. 
   More than 12 million women of childbearing age--one in five--lacked health insurance in 1998, according to the Census Bureau. Lack of insurance leads to bad outcomes for pregnant woman and the children. Pregnant women without health insurance face barriers to care and do not receive the medical attention they need to have healthy babies. The Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act could provide insurance coverage to virtually all pregnant women in the United States. Such coverage will have an enormous impact on the health of children in our nation, by ensuring pregnant women have access to prenatal care and automatically enrolling their babies in their State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   In the United States, 7.6 out of 1000 babies die before their first birthday. Our nation is ranked 25th, in the world for our infant mortality rate. The statistics in my home state are even more disheartening; in Louisiana where 24.7% of childbearing age women are uninsured, there are 9.8 deaths per 1000 births. Many of these deaths are preventable, and good prenatal care is the first step to ensuring that babies see their first birthday. 
   The Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of 1999 addresses these concerns in three ways. One, it would amend Title XXI of the Social Security Act to give states the options to use Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funds for health insurance coverage of uninsured low income pregnant women. Two, it would automatically enroll newborns to CHIP eligible women in CHIP for one year. And  three, our bill would provide states additional opportunities to tap into a $500 million fund created by the 1996 welfare reform act to help expand Medicaid outreach efforts. This bill would allow the fund to be used for any Medicaid or CHIP outreach initiatives. 
   This Act could provide insurance coverage to 95% of currently uninsured women, by both increasing outreach efforts to pregnant women eligible for Medicaid and by giving states the option to extend CHIP coverage to low income pregnant women over the age of 18. Since the enactment of the welfare reform law, many people who are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP coverage do not realize it and remain unenrolled. It is estimated that 358,000 pregnant woman and 3 million children are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid. Millions of additional children are eligible for but not yet enrolled in CHIP. 
   This legislation has the potential to lower healthcare costs and keep our babies healthy. By removing barriers to prenatal care access and automatically enrolling babies in their State Children's Health Insurance Program, we can give our children a head start on good health. Research shows that access to appropriate prenatal care improves the outcome of pregnancy. According to the March of Dimes, prenatal care--especially among lower income women--reduces the risk of low birth weight threefold and results in decreased infant mortality rates and healthier babies. According to the Institute of Medicine, each dollar spent on prenatal care for women at high risk, saves $3.38 in medical care costs for low birth-weight babies. 
   This legislation is an important step to ensuring our children have bright and healthy future. I thank Senator BOND for his leadership on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of 1999.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to express my personal appreciation to all the conferees who participated in the fiscal year 2000 energy and water development appropriations conference for including funding and language for Louisiana projects. 
   Flood control, hurricane protection and navigation are all vital to the safety and well-being of our citizens. These water-related infrastructure projects are of major economic importance to the state. A number of them are of major importance to the nation. 
   Of the Louisiana projects in the fiscal year 2000 report and the Statement of Managers, there are two Louisiana projects which I would like to discuss further at this time: the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Lock Project and the Bayou Darrow Floodgate, Aloha-Rigolette Flood Control, Red River Project. 
   I appreciate all that the conferees have done for these projects. I am taking this opportunity to express my views to the Senate on some key issues affecting them. Resolution of these issues is critical to the two projects being built in a timely manner to provide the protection and service for which they have been authorized. 
   With regard to the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Lock, I am most appreciative of the funding which the conferees have included for it and its mitigation. On the related key project issue, it is of the highest importance that the Corps of Engineers use the full replacement cost to value the real estate and facilities which it acquires from the Port of New Orleans as part of the project. 
   The Port of New Orleans had expected the Corps to use full replacement value when it acquires the Port's properties. I am told that full replacement cost is the value which the Corps is using to acquire other similarly-situated property and facilities for the lock project. 
   Senator LANDRIEU and I contacted the conferees about this full replacement cost issue. 
   As I understand and which I appreciate very much, the conferees noted that there are significant differences in the estimates used by the Corps and the Port to value the Port's properties to be acquired. As I also understand, conferees expect the Corps to work in good faith to arrive at an equitable solution to this issue in accordance with current law, which I also appreciate very much. 
   If, indeed, the Corps is using, in accordance with current law, full replacement cost for other similarly-situated properties which it will acquire for the lock project, then it is only equitable and fair that, in accordance with current law, it use full replacement cost to acquire the Port's properties for the project. 
   With regard to the Bayou Darrow Floodgate, Aloha-Rigolette Flood Control, Red River Project, I am most appreciative that the conferees have provided FY 2000 funding for the project. I also appreciate their consideration of the request by Senator LANDRIEU and I which was not able to be included as part of the conference agreement, that is, to authorize full federal responsibility for project costs which are in excess of those anticipated in the 1994 Project Cooperation Agreement. 
   The excess costs have arisen due to extenuating circumstances which included, as I understand, project-related contract negotiations, but about which the Town of Colfax, the non-federal sponsor, says it was not consulted. The Town, which is a very small rural community, says it is unable to pay the share of the excess costs assigned to it by the Corps. 
   I am most concerned about this situation. I hope that the Corps of Engineers will work very closely with the Town of Colfax to resolve the excess cost issue soon and that this much-needed flood control project will be able to be completed in a timely manner. 
   This concludes my statement, Mr. President.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this question is really about whether we are going to pause for 12 months and negotiate or whether we are going to litigate for 5 years. I think the Hutchison amendment is very helpful in that it says: Let's pause and, instead of fighting it out in the courtroom, let's get people to talk about it in their offices, between Interior and industry, over what is a fair market value. 
   It is well worth a 12-month pause to try to negotiate instead of litigating from here on after--that is all the Hutchison amendment does--in order to find out what a fair market value truly is. We should support it.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding. I appreciate it very much. I really wasn't going to say anything again. I thought I said enough on this issue. I think the Senate probably has debated far too long on this issue. 
   What is surprising to me is what the arguments have been about. I don't think they are directly related to the issue at hand. I think it is important for us to try to understand what the issue is. Is it that we don't like oil companies, or is the issue that we like the environment, or is the issue that we don't like education, or that we do like education? No. 
   The issue is very simple and not complex at all. The law that was passed by the Congress--I was on the committee in the House that wrote the bill in 1976. We wrote the OCS Lands Act of 1976. We determined at that time that offshore oil companies that produce oil on Federal lands and the OCS would pay the General Treasury one-sixth of the value of the oil. That is the law; it is one-sixth of the value of the oil. 
   We established that back in 1976. It was one-eighth before that. Companies, every year, pay one-sixth of the fair market value of the oil. That doesn't go to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It goes to the General Treasury. Congress then appropriates that money to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, appropriates it for defense purposes, appropriates it for health purposes, and everything else Congress does. 
   That is what the companies have been paying every year--one-sixth of the fair market value of the oil. Last year, they paid about $4.7 billion, I think, in royalties for the right to produce that oil on Federal lands in our country. 
   Now, the issue is a very narrow issue. How do you determine what the fair market value of the oil is? It is even more narrow than 
   that. It is what a company is entitled to deduct in determining that fair market value. 
   I listened intently to my good friend, the Senator from Michigan, with his chart showing why independents paid one price and integrated major companies paid a different price for producing oil on the same adjacent leases. There is a very simple explanation of why that is the way it is. The Senator from Michigan would never argue with the fact that if a Michigan automobile company built a car in Detroit and then sold that car in Louisiana, that Michigan automobile manufacturer would not be able to add the cost of transporting that car to New Orleans to the price he got for the vehicle. Of course, the big company would be able to do that. That would be part of the cost of doing business. He would build the car in Michigan, transport it to New Orleans, sell it, and add the transportation cost to the price of the car. No one would think that would be unusual. 
   The same principle affects oil companies, as well. In determining the fair market value, you find out where they sell it. A legitimate deduction is transporting it to the place of the sale. The difference between the independent companies and the major companies in the same area is they sell it at different places. The independent will sell it when it comes out of the ground. He will sell it at the wellhead. An integrated company would not sell it at the wellhead but would put the oil in a transportation pipeline and send it to a point where it is sold down the line. 
   Would anybody argue that the cost of transporting the oil from the time it is brought out of the ground to the time it is eventually sold is not a legitimate cost of producing and selling that product? Of course, not. Just as the cost of transporting that car from Michigan to New Orleans is a legitimate cost of producing and selling it the first time you have a sale; it is a legitimate add-on to the price of the product. So, too, is the cost of transporting the oil from the well to the place of the first sale. It is a legitimate deduction for the cost of producing that product. 
   That is really what we are arguing about. The Department of the Interior and Minerals Management say they don't agree that a cost of transporting it should be a legitimate deduction, or maybe some of it should but not all of it. The companies say they think it all  should be deductible. The MMS says just part of it. That is the fight. 
   This fight is not about education or welfare or defense. It is a very narrow issue. The Senator from Texas is merely saying: Please, let's make them talk a little bit more about trying to resolve this very narrow issue. Oh, we can let the rule go through, and it is going to be litigated from here to who knows where. That is going to cost the Government and the taxpayers and the companies a lot of money, and it is not going to resolve anything--certainly not in 12 months. We will be in litigation in courts all over the country litigating what they think is a legitimate deduction versus what the company thinks. 
   The Senator from Texas has suggested we pause for 12 months and say negotiate out what is a legitimate deduction for transporting the oil from the time it is brought out of the ground to the time it reaches its first sale. There is nothing mysterious about that. We always argue with companies about what is and is not legitimate. My State has sued oil companies right and left, disagreeing on the interpretation of a 
   legitimate deduction. The issue is whether you are going to allow transportation costs to be deducted or not. It is not whether or not you like oil companies. Hate them; I don't care. 
   The question is simply fairness about what a legitimate deduction should be with regard to determining the fair market value of the oil. Oil companies have said: Let's put an end to this. We will give you the oil and you sell it and determine the fair market value. The Government says: No, we don't want to do that; we want you to market it and get a fair market value for it. 
   It is not a question about anybody lying, cheating, stealing, or trying to rip off the Government, or anything else. Companies have an obligation to represent their stockholders and the millions of employees they have. The Government has an obligation to be fair. The only thing the amendment of the Senator from Texas says is, let's avoid litigation and quit fighting. 
   It is unfortunate that we got into a debate about whether we like oil companies or not. That is not the issue. Oil companies have paid ever since they have had production on Federal lands. Like I said, $4.7 billion was paid just last year to the General Treasury, and rightfully so, as the cost of being able to produce energy on Federal lands. In my State and on other Federal lands around the coastal areas of this country, it will continue to be paid. It is a very narrow issue. This is not a monumental deal that we should be talking about. We should not be involved in cloture votes and arguing about something that is relatively so small. 
   Some of the Senators say $88 million is being lost. It is not being lost. It is a dispute as to whether it is a legitimate deduction or not. 
   I think we eventually will pass the amendment and, hopefully, the oil companies will sit down in the offices of the Interior Department and negotiate instead of meeting in courthouses and having to litigate. I just hope we can move on--adopt this measure and get on with the many other things that are more pressing than whether we should deduct transportation costs or not. 
   That is the only issue that is on the table. You can talk about anything else, but the issue is only what are legitimate transportation costs from the time the oil comes out of the ground to the time it is sold at the first sale. I suggest that this is not something that you tie up the Senate for as long as it has been. It should be negotiated out by technicians, lawyers, but it should be negotiated, not litigated. 
   I thank the Senator from Texas.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Mary LANDRIEU, the ``Lake Ponchartrain Basin Restoration Act of 1999,'' S. 1621. Our goal for this bill is clear and straightforward: to help with the ongoing restoration of the Lake Ponchartrain Basin. 
   As one of the largest estuarine systems in the nation and the largest one on the Gulf Coast, restoration of the basin merits federal assistance. 
   Pollution problems accumulated in the basin for years. The clean up of the watershed has been under way for about a decade, but more work remains to be done. 
   Spearheading the current restoration has been the Lake Ponchartrain Basin Foundation, created by the Louisiana Legislature in 1989. Since then, the Foundation has implemented 38 water quality, habitat and education programs and projects. 
   Coordination and cooperation have been hallmarks of the basin restoration initiative. The State of Louisiana, local governments and officials, citizens, businesses, universities and federal agencies all have contributed to it. 
   Three key basin-area institutions have allied themselves and have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to help facilitate the basin's restoration. 
   These organizations include the Lake Ponchartrain Basin Foundation; the Regional Planning Commission, consisting of Orleans, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Bernard and St. Tammany Parishes; and the University of New Orleans. 
   The legislative initiative which Senator LANDRIEU and I have undertaken has been assembled through these organizations' leadership. 
   Is the basin better off today than it has been for many years? Are there obvious signs of improvement? Has the grassroots campaign of the past 10 years been successful? 
   In 1995, pelicans were spotted again and their numbers are on the increase. In 1998, a sea turtle appeared, as well as two manatees. Now there are four manatees. This year, dolphins have been seen for the first time in 40 years. 
   The pelicans, manatees, dolphins and a sea turtle confirm that the hard work and commitment of citizens, the state and the local governments have improved the basin. With these successes in hand, it is vital to the basin's 5,000 square-mile ecosystem that the restoration work continue as vigorously as it has to this point. 
   The bill which Senator LANDRIEU and I have introduced would authorize a federal Lake Ponchartrain Basin Restoration Program, to be housed at the Environmental Protection Agency. A key component of the bill would be the authorization of federal funds for the restoration program. As important, the bill would direct the Federal Government to coordinate the restoration with the State and local agencies and organizations. 
   To carry out the Federal restoration program, the EPA would be directed to establish the Lake Ponchartrain Executive Council. Council members would include the EPA, the State of Louisiana, the Regional Planning Commission, the University of New Orleans, and the Lake Ponchartrain Basin Foundation. 
   The EPA, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, the State and local authorities, would assist the Council with the preparation of a comprehensive, multi-use watershed management plan to restore and protect the basin. 
   Federal grant funds and technical assistance would be available through the EPA. Certain planning, research, monitoring and voluntary restoration projects would be eligible for funding. In accordance with the management plan, the voluntary restoration projects would address various waste, runoff, discharge and water quality problems to improve the basin's watershed. 
   Also to be authorized for continued priority funding would be the New Orleans Inflow and Infiltration Project. 
   Lake Ponchartrain, the basin's namesake, is located in its midst. The lake plays a vital environmental, economic and quality of life role for the 1.5 million people who live around it in 16 Louisiana parishes. A 630 square-mile body of water, the lake is a major beneficiary of the basin's restoration. 
   Other beneficiaries of the restoration program would be the many species of fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and plants which are found in the basin. 
   Federal assistance should be provided for a watershed program of this size and impact to assist with the cost of the voluntary restoration projects as well as planning, research, and monitoring projects. 
   I commend all those who have organized and implemented the current basin restoration program over the past decade. They have given so much of their time, energy and support to make the basin environmentally healthier today than it has been for many years. All of them deserve the highest tribute and recognition. 
   It is my privilege and honor to serve on behalf of citizens who recognize a serious problem and work cooperatively to solve it and also to introduce legislation which would help them continue such a major undertaking. 
   For these reasons, I have joined with Senator LANDRIEU in cosponsoring the ``Lake Ponchartrain Basin Restoration Act of 1999.'' I urge the Senate's prompt consideration of the bill and look forward to working with other Senators on behalf of its passage. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chairman. I commend the gentleman from Washington and the distinguished ranking member Mr. BYRD for the great leadership they have demonstrated in crafting the FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill. Of great personal interest to me is a Kemp's Ridley sea turtle project that is, in part, funded through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This project is a twenty-year-old on-going success story in the recovery of a high endangered species. Since 1978, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, USFWS, has spearheaded the sea turtle conservation work at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. This collaborative conservation project with the Mexican government and the U.S. shrimp industry through the National Fisheries Institute protects Kemp's Ridley sea turtle nests an females from predation and other hazards, and ensures that young turtles make it into the sea. This project is the longest standing collaborative conservation project between the United States and Mexico without a formal treaty. This year, despite the demonstrable success of the project, the Fish and Wildlife Service did not dedicated funds to the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle project. I am extremely concerned and want to express my strong support for continued funding for this valuable conservation effort.

   Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding. In just 60 seconds, it is unfortunate we are voting with a number of Senators absent. I guess we will have to do that. 
   The question is, How do we value oil? The law says the companies owe the Federal Government, taxpayers, one-sixth to one-eighth of the value of the oil. The problem is, how do you determine the value? It is a very complicated rulemaking procedure that is ongoing to try to determine what are the legitimate deductions and transportation costs, in particular, determining what the fair market value of oil is. We can rush this thing through. It will result in years of litigation. Or we can pause for a few moments, which is what we are asking to be done, to try to negotiate out something to which both sides can agree. I think it makes more sense to pause for a few moments, get the groups together and work it out, rather than run the risk of years and years of litigation. We know what is going to happen then. Nobody is going to win. The American public is not going to win. 
   I urge we support the Hutchison amendment and get it done in a more realistic and fair fashion.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   When I heard some of the arguments by my colleagues about cheating, stealing, and lying, I thought I was listening to a country and western song at one point. The question is not about cheating, stealing, and lying. It is not about whether you have sympathy for the oil companies coming out the wazoo. I checked my wazoo, and I don't have any sympathy for the oil companies coming out of it. But I do think I have sympathy for what is fair and what is right. 
   The Federal Government owns the oil, and it allows companies to explore and produce it. The companies give back in return one-sixth or one-eighth of the royalties to the Federal Government--to the taxpayers of the United States--in payment for the right to do this type of production. 
   The only question is, What is the value of oil? The companies don't set that. We do. Congress does. The only issue is, How do you determine the legitimate value of the oil? 
   We have a formula that has been in place for years. The Federal Government, through minerals management, said we will try to make it simple. We are not going to try to raise any additional money and keep it revenue-neutral. We want to have a simpler way of doing it. 
   The issue now boils down to the regulations. They are very complicated. It is not an easy process. How do you determine the price of oil that is produced in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico? If you sold it at the well 200 miles offshore, it would be easy to determine what the price is. But it is not sold in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. It is transported hundreds and hundreds of miles onshore where it is refined and then ultimately sold. 
   The question is, What is the legitimate production price? Who pays for the transportation from the middle of the gulf? It is the Federal Government's oil. Do the companies pay for the transportation, or does the Federal Government pay for the transportation? 
   The question is, What is the legitimate production in determining what the price is? 
   Could I have 30 seconds to conclude? 
   What the Senator from Texas has done is say: Look, pull over. There is a huge disagreement. It is very difficult and very complicated. Nobody is stealing, cheating, or lying. But we need a little bit more time to try to bring both sides together to come up with a realistic way of determining fair market value. 
   I think our amendment is a good one and should be supported.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York and also the distinguished chairman of the full committee, the Senator from Delaware. They are both distinguished gentlemen. 
   I just make a note that when we use the term ``distinguished gentleman,'' we use it sometimes lackadaisically in the Senate. In this case, I think it is important for us to note that there are probably no two finer gentlemen in this body today than the Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the committee, and the Senator from New York, the ranking member of our committee. They are gentlemen in the sense of how they have had to conduct the affairs of bringing this conference report and this tax bill to the American public. Although they have had differences in what they thought 
   the ultimate product should look like, both of these two distinguished Senators have conducted themselves in the finest sense of being a gentleman, and they have worked together in a fashion that I think has kept our committee together. I congratulate them for that. 
   Let me say a couple of words about where we are. Unfortunately, the debate we are hearing on the floor today is about something that is not going to happen. We are spending all of this time talking about something that is not going to become law; it is not going to occur because none of this will, in fact, become legislation. It will only be something about which we have talked. Many colleagues on this side of the aisle are talking about how bad the provisions are in the conference report, and many colleagues on that side of the aisle are talking about how wonderful the provisions in the bill are. 
   The bottom line is we are talking about something that is not going to happen because it is very clear to everybody in America, and everybody in Washington knows, that when this bill gets down to the President in this form, it is going to be vetoed. The veto will not be overridden. 
   All of this exercise today, while I am sure it is important to make our political points, is not talking about what is going to benefit the people of our country. As a result of where we are, there will be no reduction in the marriage penalty. It is not going to be fixed. It is not going to be addressed by this product. There will be no reduction of income rates from 15 percent to 14 percent. That is not going to become law. There is not going to be any increase in the standard deduction for hard-working Americans. The standard deduction is not going to go up. The marriage penalty is not going to go down. Estate taxes are not going to be repealed. Estate taxes are not going to be reduced. It will be the same after this bill is disposed of. Child care credits are not going to go up. Health care credits for people who don't have health care will not be assisted because all of the things we have in these various pieces of legislation that we tried to get into a package that could be signed will, in fact, not be signed into law. 
   In many ways, this is an exercise in futility--in the sense that we know it will never become law. This debate, however, I think is still important. It is important to point out some of the things that are in the bill, which I find sort of interesting. I know my colleagues have looked at this list. It is a list of all of the things that are in the bill that are going to be sunsetted. We have more sunsets in this bill than they had in the movie ``South Pacific.'' The broad-based tax relief is going to be sunsetted. The marriage penalty will be sunsetted. The AMT relief, the capital gains reduction, and the individual retirement accounts, which Senator ROTH has worked so hard on, will be sunsetted. Assistance for distressed communities will be sunsetted. There is a sunset on every page. It is enough to put us to sleep. The problem is that all of these things we have are not going to become law. 
   But I think the debate we have is important because I always remain optimistic. I guess when I lose my optimism, I will lose my interest in serving in this esteemed body; and I haven't reached that point yet. I think it is important to have this debate. It is unfortunate that we only have 10 hours. It is unfortunate that we had 20 hours for 100 Senators to debate a major reform in the Tax Code of this country. I think we have to recognize that the system in which we bring tax bills to the Senate floor for open debate needs to go back to that old system where we have open debate on something as important as tax policy. We used to do it and produce good bills. The distinguished ranking member and the chairman remembers those days. We need to go back to the process whereby we have open and complete debate on tax laws in this country. 
   The final point I will make is that I hope sometime when we come back--after we have had the veto ceremony and the response to the veto ceremony, and everybody has gotten it off their chests, we can come back in September, as the chairman has said, and address the real issue of Medicare, try to look at what amount of money we really need in Medicare. We have a plug number in the Democratic bill of $320 billion. We don't need that much. I don't think we can spend $320 billion more in Medicare and make it any better than it is today. But we can reform it; we can figure out how much money we do need because we do need more money. 
   We can figure out how to craft a program that brings Medicare into the 21st century. It was a great program in 1965. This is approaching the 21st century, and the model of 1965 does not fit what we need to do for the 21st century. We need to reform it and figure out how much money we need for a good, solid prescription drug program, particularly one with catastrophic protection, and try to combine that legislation with a realistic tax bill. 
   I recommend that we also consider doing something on Social Security--certainly a lockbox, a temporary protection, but we need real reform for that program as well. We need to look at the private sector to help increase the return on Social Security investments from what we have right now as part of any real reform effort. 
   I hope that sometime late in September we will have an opportunity to look at trying to combine the business recommendations from all of our Members on Social Security reform and on true Medicare reform, and figure out what we actually need to put into a tax bill that would give real relief to all of these things we are sunsetting right and left, and come up with something that helps people who need the greatest help. 
   I voted for this bill in the Finance Committee to keep the process going forward. I voted for it when it passed the Senate the first time to keep the process going forward. Unfortunately, at this stage the process has now gone backwards. What we have before the Senate is more reflective of the House-passed bill, which I think does not really direct the limited tax help to those who need it the most. 
   It is interesting to note that, with all the trigger mechanisms, it looks like a shooting gallery as far as all the triggers that have to go into effect before the tax bill goes into effect. Add the sunset provisions with the trigger mechanisms, and I doubt that anybody in this body can tell you what the real tax benefits are going to be for the American people. Is it going to be $800 billion, or $545 billion, which is sort of pretty close to what a centrist group recommended of $500 billion. I suggest that we have, at best, a mishmash of differing recommendations and viewpoints about what the tax bill ought to look like. 
   I am not sure, with all the sunsets and everything else we have in here, that anybody can really describe exactly what we are presenting to the American public other than a political issue. We are going to have a great political debate on this from both sides of the aisle. We are going to criticize everything coming from our opponents from both perspectives, but we are going to ultimately be talking about what we didn't do. We are going to be talking about failure, and we are going to talk about whose fault it is that we didn't accomplish anything. That is really unfortunate.  
   I happen to think the American people would much prefer for us to have a debate on success: You did it. We did it. No. You did it. But at least we would be talking about success. We would be talking about something we did instead of debating failure and whose fault it was that we weren't able to come together. 
   We have a divided government. The President is a Democrat. He is going to be there until the next election. And who knows what after that? 
   I conclude by saying that I congratulate our two leaders. They did a terrific job. I greatly respect them for it. Hopefully, we can come back and do it later in a better fashion.

   Mr. BREAUX. Thank you, Senator LANDRIEU. I agree that it is vital that these ongoing agriculture research projects be given much deserved and badly needed attention and consideration by the U.S. Congress. and I join Senator LANDRIEU in my concern about the urgency to control Formosan termite devastation to privately-owned and public property, to historic preservation, to commerce, and to economic development. Research being conducted at the Agriculture Research Service in New Orleans is vital to controlling the Formosan termite. Formosan termites are unique and are capable of inflicting more damage to more plant species than native termite species. In addition, they have unique biological traits which make them more difficult to control, such as being able to avoid traditional termite controlling toxins by building nests above ground. The fundamental research currently conducted in New Orleans will identify vulnerabilities in termite biology or colony development which can be exploited for the development of new detection methods and environmentally-sound control strategies. The structural foundation of New Orleans and other areas all along the coast will benefit from this research. 
   Also, the ongoing Phytoestrogen research being conducted by the Southern Regional Research Center in coordination with Tulane and Xavier Universities in New Orleans is an exemplary partnership. The Tulane/Xavier Center for Bioenvironmental Research has one of the leading laboratory efforts in the world for the study of estrogenic chemicals, including Phytoestrogens. USDA's Southern Research Center has 54 years of distinguished service to agriculture and science, making this a productive and sensible collaboration. The ramifications of this partnership will be broad-reaching, aiding not only the prevention and treatment of disease in humans, but also the development of safe biological alternatives to conventional pest control. I join Senator LANDRIEU in looking forward to the continuation of these projects.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Motor Carrier Safety Specialist Act. The reason for the Act is to ensure that all inspectors performing compliance reviews on inter- and intra-state motor carriers are certified to a uniform standard and proficiency. This Act is in part a response to the recent bus accident in Louisiana by Custom Bus Charter, Inc. in which 22 people were killed, and in which the driver was found to have marijuana in his system. 
   In July 1996, just four months after the Federal Highway Administration (``FHWA'') inspected and assigned a Satisfactory rating to Customs Bus Charter, Inc., a private company under contract to the Department of Defense failed Custom Bus Charter, Inc. for not having a drug and alcohol testing program. The absence of a drug and alcohol testing program is a FHWA Critical violation for which the carrier should have been assigned, at best, a Conditional rating by FHWA. Furthermore, 27 percent of motor carriers that were assigned a Satisfactory rating by FHWA, failed to enter the DoD program because of Critical violations discovered by the DoD contractor. These examples demonstrate that FHWA does not have the resources and structure to certify inspectors, and that compliance reviews are not always performed in a consistent or accurate manner.  
   In addition to inconsistent inspection, FHWA cannot possibly collect sufficient safety information on the motor carrier industry. There are estimated to be more than 450,000 inter-state motor carriers licensed to do business in the U.S. The Federal Highway Administration has the resources to conduct only a limited number of compliance reviews annually. While they intend to double the current level of inspections, this will only bring the total to approximately 8,000 inspections annually, less than 2 percent of the estimated motor carrier population, with more than twice that amount entering and exiting the market. Over 70 percent of existing motor carriers have never been inspected by FHWA, and fewer than 5 percent of the inspections conducted could be considered current, within the past three years. 
   Clearly, the problem is twofold: FHWA is in desperate need of more information regarding the compliance level of carriers licensed to do business, and, those individuals that collect the information through inspections must possess some uniform level of competence and consistency. Thus, this Act is needed to certify all Motor Carrier Safety 
   Specialists, both in the private and pubic sectors, so that these professionals can perform consistent compliance reviews and provide safety data on motor carriers to the government, industry, and the public. The Act not only provides for certification and training of federal motor carrier safety specialists, but state, local, and third-party safety specialists as well. 
   Third-party, private auditors can provide additional information to assist FHWA in monitoring carrier performance. Previously, the FHWA has not accepted information from private sources because there is no certification of their proficiency. The Motor Carrier Safety Specialist Certification Board, a non-profit organization, would be formed by technical representatives of the transportation industry, for the expressed purpose of working with the Secretary of Transportation to establish a training and certification program for Motor Carrier Safety Specialists and to serve as a clearinghouse for motor carrier data from third-party auditors. This follows the policy contained in Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-119 and directs agencies to use voluntary standards where possible and the model used successfully by the Environmental Protection Agency for referring federally-mandated certification to private organizations. 
   Further, FHWA needs accurate and current information on motor carriers in order to target its resources towards problem carriers. Investigations by the General Accounting Office and the Department of Transportation's Inspector General found that FHWA motor carrier data are inadequate and out-of-date, limiting FHWA's ability to identify and target ``at risk'' carriers. Private auditors could provide additional information to augment FHWA's database. The Motor Carrier Safety Specialist Certification Board would establish a program to collect and verify current information on motor carriers, and provide this information to the Federal Highway Administration to augment their database. 
   Finally, the public must play a role in removing unsafe carriers from U.S. highways by considering safety first when hiring a motor carrier. Simply put, if the public does not hire carriers that have poor safety performance, they will be put out of business and off our nation's highways. A media campaign must be implemented to educate the public on their role in increasing motor carrier safety, and about publicly available information systems that provide safety information on motor carriers. Two such internet-accessible systems are the publicly-funded FHWA SAFER system and the privately funded International Motor Carrier Audit Commission (IMCAC). 
   This program can be quickly implemented due to the support of existing groups that are equipped to carry out training, certification and clearinghouse functions, such as the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) which currently provides certification for roadside vehicle inspectors, and the International Motor Carrier Audit Commission (IMCAC) which currently provides safety data to the public. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed into the RECORD.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding time. 
   It is not unusual that we are doing the sugar amendment again. It seems that we do it about every 2 years. We have been doing it for probably the last 20 years. 
   It is interesting that this time we are doing it on a bill that is designed to help American agriculture, except that I think this amendment is being offered to try to eliminate an entire farm program for only one commodity. But this amendment is on a bill we are working on to try to help American agriculture. So I guess the only thing unusual is not that we are doing a sugar amendment but that we are doing it on a bill that is designed to help American farmers. And, of course, the amendment would do the exact opposite. 
   It is interesting that some of my colleagues said, well, the program only helps a couple of folks in south Florida when in truth the fact is that about 420,000 people earn their living every day either directly or indirectly because of the sugar industry. 
   The distinguished Senator from Hawaii knows its importance in the State of Hawaii. He has been involved not only with sugarcane-producing States but also sugar-beet-producing States. It is a program that has actually undergone a great deal of change and modification and improvement over the years. 
   In the last farm bill, which was in 1986, we made some serious changes in the sugar program. I think most people involved in it said: Look, we are going to try to make the program better than it has been, and we are trying to address some of the legitimate concerns but also trying to provide some protection for this very important American industry, to do it consistent with our international obligations. We have done that. Domestic production controls were eliminated. There is no limit on how much you can produce in beets or in sugar. You can do as much as the market will bear. 
   The guaranteed minimum price was eliminated. It is one of the few commodity crops that doesn't have a minimum guarantee of what the farmer is going to be receiving from the Government. 
   We had a special tax for deficit reduction in the last farm bill, which was increased by 25 percent. 
   This means sugar farmers were actually given an assessment to pay for the Federal deficit. Of course, now that the deficit is gone, it makes a great deal of sense to eliminate the assessment. 
   Minimum imports--talking about not getting enough sugar--in the last farm bill were increased by about 20 percent, a substantial increase over the previous years' pattern on the amount of sugar being imported from about 41 countries that are greatly helped by the program. 
   Forfeiture of sugar crop penalties were imposed. 
   The point is that we made some serious changes to the program in order to improve it. So to come before the Senate, on a bill that is designed to help farmers, and offer an amendment to hurt farmers sort of seems inconsistent. But, well, what else is new? 
   The other point I would make is how many Members of 
   Congress have letters from constituents complaining about the price of a candy bar? 
   How many of us have stacks and stacks of letters complaining about the price of a soft drink, or stacks of letters complaining about the price of a 5-pound bag of sugar in the supermarket? 
   They don't do that because it is not a price that is out of proportion to what it has been in the past. Because of the program, it has not spiked upward or crashed downward but has remained fairly stable so that people can predict what it is going to cost for a 5-pound bag of sugar. 
   It is interesting that the only real complaints about the price of sugar come from the large industrial users and not from consumers in America. 
   I remember my colleague, Senator CRAIG, was here back in the old days, I would say, when we first started these debates, and Senator INOUYE was there, of course. It was the soft drink manufacturers who complained about the price of sugar. It made them charge too much for their soft drinks because they had sugar in them. Then they eliminated the sugar, and the price of the soft drinks went up even more. The actual can of soft drink with no sugar was selling for more than the price of a can of soft drink with sugar. They said, well, the price of sugar is making us raise the price of the soft drink. 
   Then they went to sugar-free drinks, and they charged more for that than they did for the can with sugar in it. They actually increased the price of soft drinks about four times because it said the sugar price went up. 
   Guess what happened when the price of sugar went down? Did they reduce the price of a soft drink? Don't hold your breath. They did not. The price of soft drinks kept going up. 
   The only complaint we have about the sugar program to any extent outside the Chamber is from the professional lobbyists and the large industrial users which, for the most part, have changed over to the use of corn sweeteners and other things in the soft drink industry. 
   I suggest that what we have is a program that works better than most farm programs because it doesn't have any Federal tax subsidy being used to hurt the income for sugar farmers. We use it by trying to regulate foreign companies from dumping cheap subsidized sugar from other countries onto the U.S. market. Some would way that is pretty good. Why don't you let them do that because then the price of sugar would be much lower? The problem with that theory is if they knocked out all of the American beet farmers and sugar cane farmers, the price would be lower for a short period of time, but when they monopolize the market and again control the market, they certainly would have the ability to exercise a sugar cartel and charge whatever they wanted, and we couldn't compete. 
   In summary, we made great changes in 1996. The program is working. Consumers are not complaining. They have a stable price for a very important product. 
   Like we say back home in Louisiana, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' Not only is it ``ain't broke,'' but it works very well, and should be maintained.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I say to our colleagues who may be watching some of this debate, the last time this amendment was offered--and it is offered to the Senate on an annual basis--was on the Senate Agriculture appropriations bill in 1997. The distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. COCHRAN, at that time moved to table the effort to do away with the program. I remind all Senators we had a recorded vote and 63 Senators voted to table it at that time. 
   I hope people understand the program is working. We made major changes in 1996. It operates at no cost to the taxpayers and has provided a stable floor of prices for the product, sugar, that we import and produce domestically. 
   The point again is, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' It is working as we in the Congress intended it to work. It is working for producers and consumers. This is something that is almost a rarity in agricultural programs. It has been very difficult to come up with a proper balance. 
   This program is working. It is working as Congress intended. We should keep it and not try to kill it when it is working as well as it is. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee. 
   I will be very brief and comment on the amendment of my good friend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts. 
   I do not think there is any disagreement that we ought to have prescription drugs in the Medicare program. But it is interesting that the recommittal motion tells the Finance Committee to report it back in 3 days. I guess we could go over the weekend and, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday write a prescription drug program and modernize Medicare and reform Medicare, but I doubt whether that is humanly possible, unless the senior Senator from New York wants to spend the weekend doing all of this and finishing it up by Monday morning. 
   There is no question that there is a need for prescription drugs in the Medicare program. But I say to my colleagues, that is not the way to fix Medicare. We have a program that is becoming insolvent. It is going broke in the year 2015. Just adding more benefits to the program, without reforming the structure of the program, is like having dessert before you eat your spinach. It is easy to add more benefits to a program. But bear in mind, we have a program that is structurally going insolvent. We spend more money today than we take in. Just adding more benefits, without taking the time to fundamentally reform the program, is not the answer. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee said he planned to actually begin a markup in September on a comprehensive Medicare reform bill which will include prescription drugs, doing it in a timely fashion. I suggest that after that is reported out, that is the time to look at how much money we need, and then pare down the tax cut, combine the 
   two, and have something that can be signed into law. 
   I think, obviously, we cannot do it in the next 3 days. I think the chairman has outlined a program that makes more sense and that I think is really doable. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I suggest it is time for a reality check by Members of both parties as to where we are and what we are attempting to do. 
   We in the United States in this period of time are in a very unique, and I would also say very unusual, position in the sense that other countries around the world would love to have the problem that is facing all of us in the Senate this afternoon: We are faced with a country that has a $1 trillion surplus. 
   That is a problem that most countries would love to have. It is a problem because we are now faced with the question of what we are going to do with a $1 trillion surplus. Some have said all of it should be used in the form of a tax cut and given back to the American people. We can argue about how they do that. But, for the moment, let's just say they have decided all of it should go for a tax cut. Some on my side of the aisle say, no, we can't do that. It should be a very small tax cut, and the rest should be reserved for other functions of Government. 
   I point out to my colleagues what I think the rest of the American people already fully realize. They know if the proposal on that side of the aisle--an $800 billion tax cut--should pass and get sent to the President, it is clearly going to be vetoed, and nothing will result from this other than a debate. We will end up with nothing more than a political argument to make against each other. If we pass the Republican bill, and it ultimately goes to the President, there will be a big ceremony in the White House where he will veto that piece of legislation. He will then have a powerful political argument to say the Republican Party has wasted the trillion dollar surplus. There are some on the Republican side of the aisle who will say that is a great argument. The White House and administration will blame the Republicans for wasting the trillion dollars and giving an unnecessary and unrealistic tax cut that is targeted to the wealthiest people in this country. That is a great argument for us. 
   While the political parties may have a short-term political gain, I suggest that the real losers, if this is what is going to happen, are the American people because they end up with nothing --no tax cut, no decision on how to spend the surplus, with no money being allocated to real Medicare reform, and no pressure to continue to work on a Medicare reform program. 
   I suggest there is a different way we can look at this problem instead of a political opportunity. We can look at it as a policy opportunity to do something realistic, and that is what the amendment before this body does. 
   It is a $500 billion tax cut that is targeted to people who really need help in this country. There are some arguments that say the polls tell us the people don't want any tax relief. If you explain it properly when you go back, people do need help. People in the middle-income brackets would like to have  a greater standard deduction than they have now. People on the edge of being kicked up into the 28-percent bracket would like to stay in the 15-percent bracket and work harder and earn more for their family. People would like to see more tax assistance for education and help for the 43 million Americans who work every day and can't afford to buy health insurance because they work for a company that doesn't provide them health insurance. We have carefully tailored the $500 billion to help those 
   people. 
   Our legislation helps people buy health insurance. It helps people avoid the ridiculous marriage penalty by eliminating it and increasing the standard deduction. That is a tax policy that should have an opportunity to become law, because while we spend $500 billion over the next 10 years to help people who need help the most, we also reserve $500 billion for other priorities of Government, to do something on Medicare, which needs to be reformed. The chairman says we will do something in September, and that is a very courageous position to take. But there will be money to pay for what is needed for Medicare. There will be a $500 billion pot of money to go to cover the very necessary discretionary spending needs in this country. 
   So we are offering something, according to a reality check, that has the potential to become law as opposed to being merely a political statement on both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, people in both parties have taken the position: It is my way or no way. 
   We were sent here not to do political statements and take political positions only, but to work together to resolve differences and come to an agreement on public policy. I happen to think public policy is good politics. But good politics is not necessarily good policy. We have a choice today, in the next couple of hours, to determine whether we are going to be interested in good politics in the short term, or whether we are going to try to work together to reach an agreement that can become law and become policy for the American people. 
   There are very few things in life that are either all one way or the other way. Anybody who has been around for a short period of time knows that. Certainly, when we are discussing what to do with $1 trillion, there are a lot of good ideas. But we have to conclude that neither side is completely right. There has to be a blend of different ideas and philosophies in order to come together in a democracy and reach something that can become law and, ultimately, good public policy. Then the argument will be over success, as opposed to an argument over failure. The track we are on now leads us to go back and tell our people it was their fault that nothing was done. That is arguing over failure as opposed to arguing about success and who was able to bring that to the American people. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   I do not think this is the time to run or to walk away, but neither do I think that either of the two parties at this time is supportive of the concept that has been offered by our centrist coalition. 
   However, while I think that time does not arrive yet today, I think some time before the year's end both sides will come to reach an agreement that what we have offered on the floor is the right approach and one which will allow us to get something done with regard to this type of a tax cut and reservation of funds to do what we need to do as a government. 
   I hereby ask that my amendment at the desk be withdrawn.

   Mr. BREAUX. Following up on the Democratic leader's question, when we have passed a bill out of the Finance Committee, the Moynihan bill, the Democratic version, and the Roth version, both for permanent tax cuts, different amounts--ours was $295 billion, the chairman's was $792 billion, but they were both permanent tax cuts--I think the point the Democratic leader makes is a good one. I think I could possibly be for waiving the point of order if it was against this bill that we all know about. But to extend that to a conference report when we do not know what is going to be in that bill I think is probably going further than certainly I would be comfortable going. 
   If it was limited to the bill that is before the Senate where everybody does know what is in it, I could understand that argument. But to say that all points of order against anything that may come back--and who knows what may come back; I have my ideas about what it should be, and others have different opinions. I don't know that we can waive points of order against something we have not yet seen. I was wondering, why does the point of order waiver cover everything that has not yet even been written?

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader of our Finance Committee. It is interesting; I think the action we have taken really means no matter what type of tax bill ultimately comes back to this body after the conference, we cannot make it a permanent tax cut. For those on our side who have argued for permanency in the Tax Code for research and development or tax incentives, that means we cannot do that. It means if we have an increase in the standard deduction and fix the marriage penalty, we can't do that. It means all those things many of us as Democrats have argued should be permanent tax policy, now we are no longer going to be able to make it permanent no matter how good it is. The argument is true for the other side as well. No matter what comes back in the conference report, it cannot be permanent. 
   I think from a policy standpoint this is terrible policy. We literally are telling all the businesspeople in this country and employees in this country, people who save in this country, no matter what the law is today, it is going to fall off a cliff and go poof in 10 years. What kind of roadmap for economic growth is it, when a country says our tax policy is only going to be good for 10 years no matter how good it is? No matter how good a Democratic policy it is or Republican policy, it is only going to last for 10 years. That in itself is very bad policy in this Senator's opinion. 
   At the same time, I recognize we are operating with our hands tied behind our back with regard to bringing up a tax bill through budget reconciliation, with all these rather archaic rules. We ought to be able to debate fairly a tax bill, make it permanent. If you do not like what is in it, vote no; if you like what is in it, vote yes. But we should not be restricted from offering tax legislation that is the permanent policy of this land. 
   We have had meeting after meeting in the Finance Committee, when people have come up and said: You have to make these provisions permanent. I am  not sure whether I am going to expand and grow my company if you are only going to allow it for 10 years, and who knows what is going to happen after 10 years. 
   That is not good public policy; it is not good tax policy, and it points to the problem: the fact that we are bringing up tax legislation in this reconciliation scenario that requires us to operate as we are operating. I suggest to folks on both sides of the aisle, if we can't make tax laws in this country for more than 10 years, we have done something that is very terrible for this country. I think it is the wrong thing to do. 
   Let me make a couple of comments on the legislation that is before the Senate. Most countries around the world would love to have the problem we have in this Senate and in this Congress right now. Other countries would look at it as a great opportunity to have the problem we are facing. We cannot seem to come to an agreement on it. That problem is the United States has about a $1 trillion surplus, and all of us are trying to figure out what to do with the surplus. I suggest if we as a Congress, Republicans and Democrats, cannot come to an agreement on what to do with a $1.1 trillion surplus, we, in effect, have said we are not very good at governing; that we cannot simply come together, make our points, seek legitimate compromise, and figure out what to do with a $1 trillion surplus. 
   I know there are some who want the President to be in a position to have the Republican tax bill of $796 billion pass and send it down to him at the White House and have a great ceremony vetoing it. 
   His argument will be that it is too large; it is too irresponsible; it is wasteful; it is going to cause the economy to go south; we are going to have an increase in interest rates. He is going to make a lot of good, solid political points when he has that veto ceremony. 
   There are those on the Republican side who I think would love that to happen, in fact, because they will be able to say: No, the President, when he had the opportunity, chose not to give the American people a legitimate tax cut, and he turned his back on the American people; we are fine with that political argument, and we will take that argument into the election. 
   The American people outside Washington, in my opinion, have come to the conclusion that they are getting very tired of those types of political positions being taken by Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   Under the current circumstances, we are headed for a financial train wreck because we are taking positions on both sides of the aisle: It is my way or no way. 
   I suggest that type of position leads to nothing happening. Sure, we will all at the end of the debate have an argument politically about whose fault it was that nothing was done. Some will say it is the Republicans because they were too greedy. Others will say, no, it was the Democrats' fault because they did not want to give a reasonable tax cut to the American people. We will have good political arguments, but we will have no public policy. We will have good political arguments, but we will be arguing about failure and whose fault it was and whose fault it was that nothing was done. We will not have good public policy, which we were all sent here to craft. 
   It is clear that in a divided government under which we operate, no party can have their way all the time. If both parties take that position, we will end up getting absolutely nothing done. 
   There are a number of us who have suggested that somewhere between the $295 billion Democratic proposal and the $796 billion Republican proposal which the President has said he will veto, there has to be some common ground. There has to be a way in which intelligent, hard-working Members are able to come to an agreement somewhere in the middle and come up with a figure that is reasonable and gives a good tax credit to the American people and, at the same time, uses some of the surplus money, the $1 trillion, to address the very serious needs and shortages we have in discretionary programs, such as veterans, health and education, and has some money in it for paying down the national debt, has money in it for Medicare, which is obviously very important. 
   There should be a way both sides can come together and say: We don't have everything we want but, yes, this is good public policy. 
   I suggest the American people are crying out for us to move in that direction. 
   I and others have joined in offering an amendment, which we hope to offer tomorrow, which tries to take the approach of: All right, let's take $500 billion of the $1 trillion and give the American people a good, solid tax cut for those who need it the most, increase the standard deduction for hard-working people, increase the amount that you can earn before you are kicked up into the higher 28-percent bracket so people can keep a little bit more of their dollars. Yes, let's fix the marriage 
   penalty that encourages people, who are two single earners in the same family, not to marry only because of the Tax Code. Yes, let's do something for education and savings, but let's keep it at a reasonable figure of $500 billion, and then we can have the other $500 billion for things that are necessary or are needed. 
   The President has put some 320-odd billion dollars into Medicare. I was privileged to chair the Medicare Commission for a year. I will tell you that no one can tell this Congress how much money we need to fix Medicare. No one can make that assessment today because we have not yet reformed Medicare. How can we say how much we need to spend on Medicare until we reform it, which everybody agrees we ought to do? 
   Yes, ultimately the Roth tax bill will pass the Senate. A similar bill with the same size tax cut has passed in the House. I suggest to our leaders on both sides of the aisle, let's hold back trying to go to conference. Pass these two bills and hold them in abeyance and let all Members, Republicans and Democrats alike, those in the House and in the Senate, go back to their respective States and respective districts and listen to our constituents and ask them what their priorities are. 
   Do not look at the polls that Republican pollsters take and Democratic pollsters take. I can give you the answer when I see the questions they ask. Listen to the people and have town meetings and talk about trying to work together to finish this problem and solve what I think is a real opportunity on what to do with $1 trillion. 
   I suggest that after we spend that time in August, we then come back to our respective bodies, the House and the Senate, and move quickly, as Senator ROTH has said he will do, on reforming Medicare, real Medicare reform, coming up with good suggestions about what we need to do with a system that was first established in 1965 which no longer works as it should. 
   When we do Medicare reform, we will then know how much more money we need in order to make that program work. When we find out what that number is, we can then combine it with a reasonable tax cut and have enough money for hard-working Americans and yet have enough money for Medicare reform with a good, solid prescription drug package to go along with it, and then come together, join hands for a very rare moment in bipartisan cooperation to do something which I think is in the national interest, so that at the end of this year we will have more than a political issue about whose fault it was that nothing was done. We will be able to go back to our constituents and say that when we had the opportunity to decide what to do with $1 trillion, we took that opportunity and came up with good public policy. 
   I hope many of our colleagues can say: I think the Democratic bill is a little too low in the tax cut, but I also think the Republican bill is a little too much of a good thing; therefore, I want to find a legitimate compromise. 
   I suggest the word ``compromise'' is not a dirty word. It is something we should be seeking as Members of an elected body which is called upon to make Government work for everyone. 
   I hope when we do offer in a bipartisan fashion the $500 billion tax cut and reserve the other $500 billion for other needs of discretionary spending, to fix Medicare and reform it with prescription drugs, that we will be able to get a strong degree of bipartisan support so we can all work together and hopefully, sometime in September, we  can reach an agreement that makes sense and is good public policy. Good public policy is also good politics. I suggest that is the approach we should be taking. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as you know, technology is fueling the tremendous economic growth the nation is currently experiencing. However, as is frequently the case, rural states are struggling to participate in this new economy. The EPSCoT program is a competitive matching grants program that reaches beyond the traditional recipients of federal research and development funding. This pioneering initiative brings together the interest of economic development, science and technology, university research, and private business. Although the program is only a couple of years old, it has met with very high enthusiasm in areas such as Louisiana and New Hampshire. 
   Mr. President, there is important work being done through the EPSCoT program. This is a flexible program designed to assist states. Applications may be submitted by state, local, or Indian tribal governments, community colleges, universities, non-profit organizations, private organizations, technology business centers, industry councils or any combination of these entities from the eligible states. The eligible states are those that have received less in federal research and development funding than the majority of the states. Therefore, the program is carefully designed to benefit those states that need more assistance in developing a high-tech economy. 
   Mr. President, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, also a part of the Department of Commerce's Technology Administration, runs the Advanced Technology Program. The ATP provides matching funds for high-risk research with broad economic benefits. As a part of the program, grants occasionally are reclaimed by the ATP due to business failures and other such circumstances. These reclaimed monies are used by the ATP to fund new awards. The Committee has provided in the bill that the ATP may use these ``carry ove r'' funds for new awards in Fiscal Year 2000. 
   Does the Senator from New Hampshire concur that it is the intent of the committee to direct $2.0 million in funds provided to NIST for new ATP awards under the provisions dealing with the use of carry-over funds be used for new grants under the Technology Administration's EPSCoT program?

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me first congratulate the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire for his remarks and his major contribution in this effort to bring to the floor of the Senate a proposal on reforming Social Security that, first of all, is real; it is serious, it is bipartisan. A lot of the credit goes to the Senator from New Hampshire for his diligent work in this area. 
   Previous to the work of the Senator from New Hampshire, we had the words of Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska, who also joins with all of us as lead sponsors on this Social Security reform legislation. Senator KERREY has been involved in this issue of entitlement reform for a long time. He chaired the Entitlement Reform Commission and his work in the Social Security area has truly been outstanding. 
   It is interesting that what is happening today on the floor is this is the first time, certainly in my memory and probably in a long time, we have actually had a bipartisan proposal on reforming Social Security introduced in the Senate. Not only is it unique that it is the first time in this body, it is also even more surprising that this proposal, in addition to being bipartisan, is also bicameral. By that, of course, I mean the same proposal has also been introduced on the other side of the Capitol, over in the House, by our colleagues over there, also in a bipartisan fashion. 
   This is truly historic in the sense that Members of both parties and both Houses can join together in addressing an issue as important, yet at the same time as politically divisive, as Social Security has been. Yet we have been able to do that and have been joined by a number of our colleagues, particularly on the Senate Finance Committee. We have come together to make a recommendation on Social Security which I think is one that bears favorable consideration of our colleagues. 
   We just had a very strenuous and sometimes somewhat heated debate on the question of the Social Security lockbox, which we just voted on. We will have future debate on that. I think it is very important for all Americans to know that while we debated on this concept of a lockbox, it does not do a single thing to restore the Social Security program. It does not change the program in any way. It does not make any structural changes to Social Security. It does not increase any American's retirement options. It does not give them any additional choices about how they want to plan for their retirement future. It does not increase widows' benefits. It does not address the problems the Senator just spoke of regarding the female population in the country and the special concerns they have. It does not allow low- and middle-income workers to access any Government contributions to help them in their retirement planning and to build up a larger nest egg. The lockbox does not do anything regarding the current unfunded liabilities in the Social Security program. It certainly doesn't restore the confidence in the Social Security system. 
   We have heard the statements that more young people believe in flying saucers than believe Social Security is going to be there for them. So while we had a great, interesting debate on this lockbox concept, it is very important to know it does not do a single thing to take care of the problems that are facing this country in regard to the Social Security system. But this bill does. This bill has been scored by the people who have to do this for us professionally as restoring solvency to the Social Security program to the year 2075, and that is a fact. There is no debate about that. How we do it, I think, is the substance of our bill. I think it is very positive. 
   Let me point out, why do we have a problem in Social Security? We have been rocking along since 1935 in a pretty fortunate situation. Most people got their Social Security benefits, everything they contributed, back very quickly. 
   If someone retired in 1980, for instance, they got back everything they put into the Social Security system in a little over 2 years. They got back everything they put into the program. Retirees in 1980, at the age of 65, took 2.8 years to recover everything they put into the program. That is a heck of a deal for anyone. I know my father has said many times: I will never get back what I put into Social Security. He got it back in about 2.8 years. It was a very good deal for most Americans, and that is changing. 
   The question is, Why? Very simple: People live a lot longer and there are a lot more of them. Life expectancy--thank goodness and thank medical science and thank God--has dramatically increased over the years so people live a lot longer than they used to. 
   The second point is there are a lot more people. There are 77 million people in the so-called baby boom generation, those Americans born between 1946 and 1964. We have about 40 million people on Social Security today. We are getting ready to add 77 million more people into this program. It does not take rocket science to figure out why we are having problems. 
   We have a lot more people who are living a lot longer and earning retirement benefits through Social Security. We have fewer and fewer people left who are working to pay for those benefits. When Social Security was passed under Franklin Roosevelt, there were about 16 people working for every 1 person who was retiring. Because people live a lot longer now and there are a lot more of them, it is now down to about 3 people working for every 1 person who is earning retirement benefits and getting retirement benefits. We cannot continue on this trend. The so-called lockbox does not do a single thing to help reform the program or allow it to generate more funds to make sure the program is going to be there for the 77 million baby boomers. 
   For those who are on Social Security retirement now, the good news for them is it is there; they do not have to worry about it. We have never missed a payment. They will be guaranteed their payments. 
   Unless we do something, we are in danger of letting the program go broke. We have presented to the Senate today, and it had been presented to the other  body earlier, our recommendation in the form of a specific bill that has been scored by the people who do this work as restoring the solvency to this program to the year 2075. 
   How do we do it? It is not that complicated. One of the things we have done is to say that every American who pays Social Security will be required to divert 2-percentage points of their payroll tax--which is 12.4 percent payroll tax of which they pay 6.2 percent--to an individual retirement account, which is strongly supported by most Americans. 
   Almost two-thirds of Americans in the polls I have seen have said yes to the question: Would you like to be able to save a portion of your payroll tax in an individual retirement account that you would be able to control? There is strong support for that. I do not think they want to privatize the whole program, but they would like to have some of the money to invest for themselves, as we do as Federal employees. 
   I do not know if a lot of Americans realize it, those who are not Federal employees, but I can do that as a Member of the Senate. We establish our own Federal employees Thrift Savings 
   Plan, and we can put up to 10 percent in that savings plan. We can earn interest on the market, and we get a lot better return than we get as a Government with Social Security funds. The Federal Government invests the Social Security surplus in Government bonds. It has been earning about 3 percent. That is not a good return in today's market. We need to allow individuals to do a better job with their own tax dollars. 
   Our plan creates a savings plan for people on Social Security where they can put 2 percent of their payroll tax into an individual retirement account which they will own, and when they pass away, it can be inherited. It will be theirs and they can invest it and hopefully get 10 percent or 15 percent or more return on their money, and they will be able to get the advantage of that higher investment when they retire and add it to the rest of their Social Security program. 
   It will put more money into the program. It will strengthen the program. It will allow people to become more involved in their own retirement. A lot of young people do not think it is going to be there. They think the Government does not do it very well. 
   This changes all of that and, I think, in a very important way. Individuals will own those proceeds, and I believe that is extremely important. 
   That is one of the features of our program I wanted to highlight. 
   In addition, we also say you can do more than that. People in lower- and middle-income brackets will be able to put an additional amount of money for an additional $1 over this 2 percent that they would put into their account. The Federal Government would match it with $100.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 additional minutes. 
   The Government will match it with $100. They can make additional voluntary contributions, up to 1 percent of the total wage base of $72,600, which means they will be able to get a maximum contribution of about $626 from the Federal Government. 
   This is a good plan. It is a solid plan. It restores Social Security viability to the year 2075, and it is something of which we need to take advantage and do it in this Congress. We cannot continue to wait. 
   The big problem is this has always been a political football. This effort, this bill, is bipartisan and it is bicameral. I urge my colleagues to look at the substance of our legislation. I think they, too, will find, when they review it carefully, that this is the right approach, it makes sense, it is balanced and one that can be considered favorably by this Congress this year. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. As a cochair of the Congressional Oil and Gas Forum, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the importance of America's small, independent oil and gas producers and the importance of this oil and gas loan guarantee program to their survival. 
   Over time, oil and gas production in the lower 48 states has become the province of independent producers. The so-called majors are more likely to operate in the offshore deepwater and in Alaska. The independents' share of production in the continental U.S. has increased from about 45 percent in the mid-1980s to more than 60 percent in 1997. 
   Independents are a different element of the oil and gas production industry than majors. Most producers operating in the lower 48 are small producers. They don't have the resources of majors such as refineries and chemical operations to buffer them during periods of low oil prices, such as those over the last year and a half. 
   As a result, independents finance their operations differently than majors. Independents generate 35 percent of their capital primarily from financial institutions. Low oil prices have made banks reluctant to make loans to the industry. This program would unlock the access to capital that is the lifeblood of this industry. 
   Independent producers have suffered significantly from the current price crisis. These statistics show the impact low prices have had since October 1997: 
   Domestic production has dropped below six million barrels per day--from 6.4 million to 5.8 million barrels per day. That's the lowest production since 1951. 
   More than 56,000 jobs lost out of an estimated 340,000 total industry jobs--that's more than 16 percent. 
   Although prices are improving, an additional 20,000 oil and natural gas jobs are at risk of being lost. 
   Since October 1997, 136,000 oil wells (25 percent of the U.S. total) and 57,000 natural gas wells have shut down. Many will never operate again. 
   Mr. President, $2.21 billion in lost federal royalties and state severance and production taxes. In my state, falling royalty and severance tax revenue have caused Governor Mike Foster to order a $30 million freeze on state government hiring and spending to head off a budget shortfall. The rate of growth in Louisiana sales and personal income taxes has fallen in recent months as laid-off energy workers reduce their spending. 
   Mr. President, $25 billion in lost economic impact associated with shut down oil and gas wells. 
   U.S. production down 651,000 barrels per day to 5.88 million, the lowest level since 1951. 
   Operating rig counts have hit historic lows. From November 1997 through April 1999, the domestic drilling rig count dropped 50 percent. The rig count is a quick measure of the level of activity in the industry. While most of this drop has been in the oil side of the business--about a 60 percent drop--the natural gas side of the industry has seen a 40 percent decline. 
   Capital budgets for oil and natural gas development are down 25-30 percent with the biggest cuts in the U.S. Most independents are drilling new wells. 
   Faced with these stark problems, the oil and gas loan guarantee program provides a two-year, GATT-legal, $500 million guaranteed loan program to back loans provided by private financial institutions to qualified oil and gas producers and the associated oil and gas service industry (drilling contractors, well service contractors, tubular goods, etc.) 
   The OMB estimates that the program will cost $125 million. The cost is fully offset by funds from the Administration's travel budget.  
   Loan guarantees are an approach that the Federal Government has used to help recovery of key domestic industries or cities in times of severe crisis. They have been used for Chrysler Corporation and New York City. The Department of Agriculture operates an ongoing loan guarantee program for farmers that addresses their problems during low commodity prices. Here, the concept would provide bridge financing to allow independent producers and the oil industry supply business to recover from the current price crisis. 
   Independent producers throughout the country continue to suffer severe economic distress. Recovery will be neither quick nor easy. This Emergency Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program will save jobs and businesses. It will contribute to the continued viability of the independent producing industry and U.S. national security. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, last week Louisiana lost of one its most prominent sons. An era passed into history with the death of former Governor John McKeithen, who served his state with distinction as governor during the turbulent years of 1964 to 1972.  
   When he died at the age of 81 in his hometown of Columbia, Louisiana, on the banks of the Ouachita River, John McKeithen left a legacy of accomplishment as governor that will likely not be matched in our lifetime. As one political leader observed last week, with John McKeithen's death ``we have witnessed the passing of a giant, both in physical stature and in character.'' 
   Indeed, McKeithen was not affectionately called ``Big John'' for nothing. Like most great leaders, he thought big and acted big. 
   Louisiana was blessed with John McKeithen's strong, determined leadership at a time when a lesser man, with lesser convictions, might have exploited racial tensions for political gain. 
   In fact, throughout the South, McKeithen had plenty of mentors had he wanted to follow such a course. But Governor McKeithen was decent enough, tolerant enough and principled enough to resist any urge for race baiting. In his own, unique way, to borrow a phrase from Robert Frost, he took the road less traveled and that made all the difference. 
   John McKeithen's wise, moral leadership at a time of tremendous social and economic transformation in Louisiana stands as his greatest accomplishment in public life. Not only did he encourage the citizens of Louisiana to tolerate and observe the new civil rights laws passed by Congress in the mid-1960s, he worked proactively to bring black citizens into the mainstream of Louisiana's political and economic life. 
   Hundreds of African-Americans will never forget the courageous way that National guardsmen under John McKeithen's command protected them from harm as they marched from Bogalusa to the State Capitol in the mid-1960s in support of civil rights. And generations of African-American political leaders will always have John McKeithen to thank for the way he helped open door of opportunity to them and their predecessors. 
   But racial harmony will not stand as Governor McKeithen's only legacy. All of Louisiana has ``Big John'' to thank for the way our state has become one of the world's top tourist destinations by virtue of the construction in the early 1970s of the Louisiana Superdome. To many--those who did not dream as big as ``Big John''--the idea of building the world's largest indoor arena seemed a folly, sure to fail. But like a modern-day Noah building his ark, McKeithen endured the taunts and jeers of his critics while he forged ahead--sure that his vision for the success of the Superdome was sound. 
   And today, more than a quarter century later, the citizens of Louisiana, particularly those in New Orleans, are only beginning to understand the enormous economic benefits that Louisiana had reaped by virtue of the Superdome and the world-wide attention and notoriety it has brought to New Orleans. 
   Even at that time, Louisiana's citizens recognized that there was something unique and very special about their governor. And so it was for that reason that they amended the state's Constitution to allow him to become the first man in the state's history to serve two consecutive terms in the Governor's Mansion. 
   Senator LANDRIEU and I doubt that we will never see the likes of John McKeithen again--a big man, with a big heart, who dreamed big dreams and left an enormous legacy in his wake. We know that all our colleagues join us in expressing their deepest sympathy to his wife, Marjorie, his children and his grandchildren.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, when I first got into this business of being involved in Congress many years ago and also involved in fundraising activities, I remember trying to compose a fundraising letter. I sat down at my desk and drafted one. I thought I put out a pretty good fundraising letter to constituents saying why I thought I was the best person running for a particular office and would they please consider sending a contribution to me because I was obviously the best person for the job. 
   I shared the draft of my fundraising letter with one of the professional people who does this for a living. He looked at it, read it and said: This will never do. 
   I said: Why? 
   He said: It is not outrageous enough. 
   I said: What do you mean? 
   He said: In order to get people to extend money to you in your election, you have to be outrageous in the letter, be as outrageous as you possibly can; don't worry about whether it is totally accurate. Just make sure it gets the people's attention and really scares the you know what out of them in order for them to feel like it is absolutely essential that to save their future, they need to send you a political contribution. 
   I said: I am not going to do that. It doesn't fit how I operate, and I think it is a wrong thing to try and scare people. 
   Apparently, there are organizations in this city that think otherwise. I call to my colleagues' attention one of them called the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. It is a very noble-sounding organization. They sent out this letter, a bright yellow thing, and it came in an envelope that is enough to look like it is from the Internal Revenue Service. 
   It says: ``Urgent Express. Please expedite. Dated material enclosed.'' 
   It would really get your attention if you walked out to the mailbox and received this. But also, if you are a senior, you would be scared to death if you thought what they were telling you was true. 
   It starts off by saying the Breaux-Thomas effort to fix Medicare is going to basically destroy Medicare by giving you a voucher instead of a guaranteed contribution for your Medicare benefits. No. 1, that is absolutely, totally inaccurate, incorrect, misleading, false and anything else you want to call it. 
   What we do is give seniors the same type of system that every one of us as Federal employees, including Members of the Senate, has. Under our plan, it is guaranteed in law that the Federal Government will contribute 88 percent of the cost of whatever plan the seniors take. The seniors would pay about 12 percent. That is what they pay now. That is not a voucher. For them to say it is a voucher is misleading, false, and intended to simply scare people into giving more money. 
   If you look at the rest of their letter, they say you do not get guaranteed benefits. That is not true. The statute clearly says that you will have the same guaranteed benefits that you get under Medicare today. That is in statute. That is guaranteed. What they have to say is false. 
   What they are really trying to do, in addition to scaring seniors, is they are trying to raise money from them; tell  them anything to scare them to death and hope they send money. 
   I was underlining all the times they said, ``please send money'' in this letter. It is one after another. 
   It says on page 3: ``..... we need your signature ..... and your generous special donation .......'' 
   Then they go on to say: ``We also need as generous a donation as you can afford.......'' 
   They then talk about sending a special donation to help us with our effort, and by making a special donation today, we can help save Medicare; endorsing this with as generous, and then they call it an ``emergency donation''--they go from ``special donation'' to send us an ``emergency donation'' to stop what BREAUX and THOMAS are trying to do by fixing Medicare. 
   Then they say:  
   [Please] boost our grassroots efforts by including an emergency contribution with your Petition. Your contribution of [$10] or $25, will be used to reinforce [our] message. ..... I've suggested [some] contribution amounts, but anything you can give will help more than you know. Please decide the most you can afford and enclose your check with your signed ..... Petition in the enclosed envelope .......  
   Your emergency donation is needed ``along with your contribution of [blank] or [blank] in the envelope provided.'' 
   Mr. President, this is a fundraising letter intended to scare seniors into digging into their pockets, into their retirement funds and funding this operation so they can continue to put out false, erroneous, inaccurate information, information which is simply not true.

   Mr. BREAUX. This is not the way to fix Medicare, by scaring seniors. They do not mention that under the current Medicare program the premiums are going to double by the year 2007 if we do not do anything to fix it. That should really scare seniors into saying we need to do something to fix the program for our children and our grandchildren. But to send out false information calling the program a voucher, which it clearly is not, and to say it does not have the defined benefits, which it clearly does, all under the guise of scaring seniors into digging into their pockets and sending money that they need for food and groceries and extra Medicare benefits that they do not get now is something they should be ashamed of. 
   I think all of us know what they are trying to do. We just have to stand up and say it like it is and call it what it is. This is shameful.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that will not only promote employee ownership, but also enhance retirement savings. The ``ESOP Dividend Reinvestment and Participant Security Act of 1999'' will grant many workers their long-sought desire to share in the growth of their company while not sacrificing one nickel of their retirement security. This legislation will permit employees to reinvest dividends paid on employer securities held in an ESOP without going through the administrative complexity that companies currently face in order to encourage workers to keep their dividends in the plan. 
   Under current law, an employer may deduct the dividends paid on employer securities in an ESOP only if the dividends are used to repay an ESOP loan or they are paid in cash to participants. This runs counter to one of the most important themes expressed by this administration as well as many others since the passage of ERISA--what to do about ``leakage'' in our retirement programs, or assets coming out of plans prematurely. In short, we need to encourage our nation's workers to keep their money in their retirement plans and not let small amounts drip out over time so that little is left by the time they enter retirement. The bill I am introducing today addresses this issue and would bolster the retirement security of ESOP participants because it would encourage both employees and employers to reinvest their dividends in the company. 
   Not only does the current approach of denying a deduction for reinvested dividends discourage the accumulation of assets for retirement, it also thwarts one of the primary purposes of an ESOP--providing an efficient means for employees to build an ownership interest in their company. Congress has steadfastly maintained the ESOP dividend deductibility rules for over 15 years in order to encourage employers to establish ESOPs that hold dividend-paying company stock. These rules clearly are intended to provide ESOP participants a broader opportunity to share in the company's growth and to ultimately use such growth to provide retirement assets. Unfortunately, our present rules fall short of the mark. 
   This bill fulfills the promise inherent in the original ESOP dividend deduction provision. The ``ESOP Dividend Reinvestment and Participant Security Act of 1999'' would give employees the ability to retain the dividends paid on employer stock in the ESOP and to reinvest these amounts in the employer stock for continuing growth and accumulation. No employee would then be forced to receive dividends that could instead be used to build retirement savings. And, all employees could receive the benefit of participating in their company's growth.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished Senator from the State of Texas. Senator HUTCHINSON, in introducing the Domestic Energy Production Security and Stabilization Act. I believe it is legislation all of our colleagues should support. 
   First, I'd like to outline the problem and then discuss how this legislation helps address it. Oil prices may be in the early stages of recovery, but over the last 17 months, a glut in the world market forced crude oil prices down to their lowest inflation-adjusted levels in 50 years. The Independent Petroleum Association of America estimates that, since November 1997, when the price of oil began to decline, more than 136,000 crude oil wells and more than 57,000 natural gas wells have been shut down.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I, along with my distinguished colleague Senator DON NICKLES, am introducing legislation today to clarify the tax treatment of commodity derivative dealers and of ordinary business hedging transactions. This legislation, which was proposed by the Administration in its Fiscal Year 2000 budget, is necessary to eliminate the existing tax uncertainties with respect to dealer derivative transactions and hedging transactions. 
   Specifically, Internal Revenue Code section 1221 would be amended to include business hedging transaction in the list of ordinary assets and clarify that activities that ``manage'' rather than only ``reduce'' risk are hedging activities. In addition, derivative contracts held by derivative dealers would similarly be treated as ordinary assets. Current tax and business practices treat derivative contracts held by commodity derivatives dealers as ordinary property. Nevertheless, such derivative dealers are faced with uncertainties regarding the proper reporting of gains and losses from their dealer activities, unlike dealers in other transactions. Finally, supplies used in the provision of services for the production of ordinary property would be added to the list of ordinary assets in section 1221. Such supplies are so closely related to the taxpayer's business that ordinary character should apply. 
   The Treasury Department has promulgated numerous regulations that affect derivatives contracts and our bill merely clarifies current law treatment of dealer activities. I urge my colleagues to support this important and much needed legislation.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, Louisiana is today mourning the loss of a giant in the news media, Douglas Manship, Sr., the chairman emeritus of the Baton Rouge Advocate and the founder of WBRZ-TV in Baton Rouge. 
   Douglas Manship devoted nearly all of his 80 years to providing the citizens of Louisiana with timely, objective and thorough coverage of the day-to-day events of our state. In the process, he and his family have always set the standard for excellence in news reporting in Louisiana, winning dozens of statewide, regional and national journalism awards. 
   For most of this century, the Manship name has been synonymous with journalism in Louisiana. In fact, the school of mass communications at our state's flagship institution of higher learning, Louisiana State University, bears the Manship name and has already trained a generation of young journalists to follow the example of journalistic excellence set by Douglas Manship and his family. 
   Those of us who knew Douglas Manship knew him as someone totally committed to his community and just as dedicated to the daily dissemination of fair and objective news. In almost every way, Douglas Manship was what a journalist should be. He believed that a public given the facts on a particular issue would invariably make the right decision. And he fought tirelessly through his newspaper to throw open the closed doors of public bodies all over Louisiana so that citizens could become better informed about the important business that was being conducted in their behalf. 
   Of course, Douglas Manship's imminent fairness and objectivity didn't stop him from expressing his opinion and using his newspaper to champion a cause when he believed his state and his community could do better. In the early 1960s, long before other southern media leaders recognized the need for racial integration, Douglas Manship used his position at WBRZ-TV to bring Baton Rouge community leaders together to discuss ways to peacefully achieve racial integration. WBRZ's courageous advocacy on behalf of desegregation resulted in threats of violence against Manship and his station. But he never backed down. And I believe that Baton Rouge made great strides because of principled leaders like Douglas Manship who put the well-being of his community ahead of his economic interests. 
   Nothing distinguished Douglas Manship more than the strength of his character and his strong sense, as he put it, of who he was. ``If there is any attribute that I have that has any meaning,'' he once said, ``it is that I know exactly who I am. That's where you get into trouble . . . when you think you are something you are not. I believe that after all these years I have learned who I am, what my limitations are.'' 
   Mr. President, today we remember Douglas Manship as a principled community leader, a courageous and fairminded journalist and a loving father and husband. I know that I join with the entire journalistic community of my state in saying that his presence and leadership will be sorely missed.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to make comments about the very unfortunate situation that occurred in Denver, CO, yesterday at Columbine High School. I know that our entire Nation mourns and grieves for the students and the teachers who lost their lives in the very tragic occurrence that happened just yesterday. 
   I, and I know all of my colleagues, hope for a day when the young people, our Nation's children, will never again have to fear for their safety anywhere in this country--but especially in their own schools that they attend each day. I certainly want to join with others who have extended their sympathies and condolences to the families and friends of those children who lost their lives. We hope for the very best for their families as they deal with this very tragic situation. I express my desire that they know our prayers are with them and their families. 
   As I, along with millions of Americans, watched on television yesterday the carrying out of something that used to be only in theatrical performances and in the movies--the tragic situation--I was drawn to the men and women of the Denver Police, Colorado law enforcement officials, members of the SWAT team, and the emergency medical personnel who were all working so diligently to spare people from suffering grave damages that were being inflicted on the victims in that community. They were doing everything they could to minimize the loss of life and human suffering and misery that was being brought about by the tragic actions of two apparently very disturbed and deranged young students who carried out these dastardly deeds. 
   I was also reminded of all of the people in my home State of Louisiana who, at the same time, have been working every day, night, week, and month to try to do something about the abnormal crime rate that has affected my own State of Louisiana. I report to my colleagues and to the people of our State that there is, indeed, some good news. The good news is contained in a report I saw just yesterday while this tragic event was going on in Colorado. The good news was that violent crime in the city of New Orleans, for example, has fallen 21 percent just since the month of January. This is the 11th consecutive quarter in which total crime--and particularly violent crime--was down. 
   This is not something that just happened. It happened because of the joint efforts of Mayor Marc Morial and the city council, along with the police force and, in particular, the superintendent of police in New Orleans, Superintendent Richard Pennington, and all the men and women of the New Orleans police force who have been working very diligently in a joint and cooperative effort to try to reach the success that now is becoming more and more apparent. 
   Since Chief Pennington took over the New Orleans Police Department, violent crime has dropped 55 percent. Overall, crime has fallen 33 percent. Murders are down 30 percent. Armed robberies, which numbered 1,200 every quarter, are now down to the 390s. Assaults are down 15 percent compared to the first quarter of 1998. 
   The New Orleans story is truly a real success story in confronting violent crime and doing something about it and doing something that has been enormously successful. Chief Pennington has said this success is a result of ``saturating the streets with more officers and putting them in key places'' and improving the investigations of repeat offenders. 
   I remember, for many months, we talked about President Clinton's proposal that the Congress adopted regarding community policing. This is a real example of the fact that community policing does in fact get the job done when you have people who believe in it. This administration can be justifiably proud of their proposal, and the States that implemented it and benefited from it can justifiably be pleased with the results. Chief Pennington has not only worked with Mayor Marc Morial and the city council to hire more people, he has been able to use the COPS program to hire 200 additional officers. New Orleans has received $8.6 million through this Federal program, dollars that have paid the salaries of extra and new police officers--obviously, money that has been well spent. Also, Chief Pennington has installed Comstat, which uses block-by-block data to track crime and find so-called hot spots in the community. 
   Using this data, the chief and his enforcement officials can move his offices from quiet areas to those areas that need more attention and need more police presence. 
   Obviously, the bottom line is these strategies and community policing programs are working. We now see actual indications and statistics which say that New Orleans is today a much safer place than it used to be, so that the thousands and thousands of people who regularly visit our cities for the numerable festivals, activities and celebrations which are part of our Louisiana culture, and particularly part of the New Orleans culture, can come to our city knowing it is a much safer place than it used to be. 
   I am particularly reminded of the next two weekends. We celebrate the jazz festival in New Orleans, and literally thousands of people from all over this country and literally from all over this world will be visiting our city. The good news is that they now know that when they visit these cities it is much safer than it has been in the past because of the actions of so many people who are dedicated, just as the people in Denver, to making their communities a safer place. 
   While we remember the tragedies in one city today in our Nation, we can also take great pride in knowing that activities by dedicated people are making a difference and that things in most communities are getting better. New Orleans is one example of that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to join with my friend and colleague, Senator JOHN CHAFEE, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, to introduce legislation to restore America's estuaries. Our bill is entitled the ``Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1999.'' 
   In the 105th Congress, on October 14, 1998, the Senate passed by unanimous consent S. 1222, the ``Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998.'' I joined with Senator CHAFEE and 15 other Senators to introduce the bill on September 25, 1997. On July 9, 1998, I testified on its behalf during hearings held by Senator CHAFEE and the Committee on Environment and Public Works. 
   I am pleased that the Senate gave its unanimous approval to the bill's passage in the last Congress and look forward to such consent in the 106th Congress. 
   Estuaries are a national resource and treasure. As a nation, therefore, we should work together at all levels and in all sectors to help restore them. 
   Other Senators have joined with Senator CHAFEE and me as original cosponsors of the bill. Together, we want to draw attention to the significant value of the nation's estuaries and the need to restore them. 
   It is also my distinct pleasure today to say with pride that Louisianians have been in the forefront of this movement to recognize the importance of estuaries and to propose legislation to restore them. The Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, an organization which is well-known for its proactive work on behalf of the Louisiana coast, has been from the inception an integral part of the national coalition, Restore America's Estuaries, which has proposed and supports the restoration legislation. 
   The Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana and Restore America's Estuaries are to be commended for their leadership and initiative in bringing this issue to the nation's attention. 
   In essence, the bill introduced today proposes a single goal and has one emphasis and focus. It seeks to create a voluntary, community-driven, incentive-based program which builds partnerships between the federal government, state and local governments and the private sector to restore estuaries, including sharing in the cost of restoration projects. 
   In Louisiana, we have very valuable estuaries, including the Ponchartrain, Barataria-Terrebonne, and Vermilion Bay systems. Louisiana's estuaries are vital because they have helped and will continue to help sustain local communities, their cultures and their economies. 
   I encourage Senators from coastal and non-coastal states alike to evaluate the bill and to join in its support with Senator CHAFEE, me and the other Senators who are original bill cosponsors. 
   I look forward to working with Senator CHAFEE and other Senators on behalf of the bill and with the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana and Restore American's Estuaries. 
   By working together at all levels of government and in the private and public sectors, we can help to restore estuaries. We can, together, help to educate the public about the important roles which estuaries play in our daily lives through their many contributions to public safety and well-being, to the environment and to recreation and commerce.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to again introduce a bill that would make a technical change in the Internal Revenue Code. We often talk about the need to simplify the Tax Code. The change I propose today would do that. 
   This change is small but very important. It would not alter the substance of current law in any way. It would, however, greatly simplify a common corporate transaction. This small technical change will alone save corporations millions of dollars in unnecessary expenses and economic costs that are incurred when they divide their businesses. 
   The Treasury Department agrees that there is a technical problem with the drafting of the Tax Code and has agreed to work with me on this proposal. In fact, the President included a similar provision to correct this problem in his budget. I am introducing today the same bill I introduced during the last session of Congress, but expect to work with Treasury to perfect the language and make sure that corporations are not further hampered by this problem. 
   Corporations, and affiliated groups of corporations, often find it advantageous, or even necessary, to separate two or more businesses. The division of AT&T from its local telephone companies is an example of such a transaction. The reasons for these corporate divisions are many, but probably chief among them is the ability of management to focus on one core business. 
   At the end of the day, when a corporation divides, the stockholders simply have the stock of two corporations, instead of one. The Tax Code recognizes this is not an event that should trigger tax, as it includes corporate divisions among the tax-free reorganization provisions. 
   One requirement the Tax Code imposes on corporate divisions is very awkwardly drafted, however. As a result, an affiliated group of corporations that wishes to divide must often engage in complex and burdensome preliminary reorganizations in order to accomplish what, for a single corporate entity, would be a rather simple and straightforward spinoff of a business to its shareholders. The small technical change I propose today would eliminate the need for these unnecessary transactions, while keeping the statute true to Congress's original purpose. 
   More specifically, section 355 (and related provisions of the Code) permits a corporation or an affiliated group of corporations to divide on a tax-free basis into two or more separate entities with separate businesses. There are numerous requirements for tax-free treatment of a corporate division, or ``spinoff,'' including continuity of historical shareholder interest, continuity of the business enterprises, business purpose, and absence of any device to distribute earnings and profits. In addition, section 355 requires that each of the divided corporate entities be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. The proposed change would alter none of these substantive requirements of the Code. 
   Section 355(b)(2)(A) currently provides an attribution or ``lookthrough'' rule for groups of corporations that operate active businesses under a holding company, which is necessary because a holding company, by definition, is not itself engaged in an active business.  This lookthrough rule inexplicably requires, however, that ``substantially all'' of the assets of the holding company consist of stock of active controlled subsidiaries. The practical effect of this language is to prevent holding companies from engaging in spinoffs if they own almost any other assets. This is in sharp contrast to corporations that operate businesses directly, which can own substantial assets unrelated to the business and still engage in tax-free spinoff transactions. 
   In the real world, of course, holding companies may, for many sound business reasons, hold other assets, such as non-controlling (less than 80 percent) interests in subsidiaries, controlled subsidiaries that have been owned for less than five years (which are not considered ``active businesses'' under section 355), or a host of nonbusiness assets. Such holding companies routinely undertake spinoff transactions, but because of the awkward language used in section 355(b)(2)(A), they must first undertake one or more (often a series of) preliminary reorganizations solely for the purpose of complying with this inexplicable language of the Code. 
   Such preliminary reorganizations are at best costly, burdensome, and without any business purpose, and at worst, they seriously interfere with business operations. In a few cases, they may be so costly as to be prohibitive, and cause the company to abandon an otherwise sound business transaction that is clearly in the best interest of the corporation and the businesses it operates. 
   There is no tax policy reason, tax advisors agree, to require the reorganization of a consolidated group that is clearly engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business, as a condition to a spinoff. Nor is there any reason to treat affiliated groups differently than single operating companies. Indeed, no one has ever suggested one. The legislative history indicates Congress was concerned about non-controlled subsidiaries, which is elsewhere adequately addressed, not consolidated groups. 
   For many purposes, the Tax Code treats affiliated groups as a single corporation. Therefore, the simple remedy I am proposing today for the problem created by the awkward language of section 355(b)(2)(A) is to apply the active business test to an affiliated group as if it were a single entity.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very important bill for small businesses in Louisiana and throughout our country that I also introduced during the 105th Congress. My bill would restore the 80 percent deduction for business meals and entertainment expenses, thus eliminating a tax burden that has seriously hampered many small businesses in our country. 
   Small business is a powerful economic engine, both nationwide and in Louisiana. Small businesses have helped to create the prosperity that we have all enjoyed in the last few years. They are leaders in the innovation and technology development that will sustain our economy in the 21st century. Nationwide, small business employs 53 percent of the private work force, contributes 47 percent of all sales in the country, and is responsible for 50 percent of the private gross domestic product. 
   For these reasons, I believe the tax code should encourage, not discourage, small business development and growth. For the more than 225,000 self-employed and for the thousands of small businesses in Louisiana, business meals and entertainment take the place of advertising, marketing, and conference meetings. These expenses are a core business development cost. As such, a large percentage of these costs should be deductible. 
   For many years, businesses were allowed to deduct 100 percent of business meals and entertainment expenses. In 1987, this deduction was reduced to 80 percent. The deduction was further reduced in 1994 to 50 percent because of the misconception that these meals were ``three martini lunches.'' 
   Contrary to this perception, studies show that the primary beneficiary of the business meal deduction is not the wealthy business person. Studies indicate that over two-thirds of the business meal spenders have incomes of less than $60,000 and 37 percent have incomes below $40,000. Low to moderately priced restaurants are the most popular types for business meals, with the average check equaling less than $20. In addition, 50 percent of most business meals occur in small towns and rural areas. 
   In 1995, just one year after the deduction was reduced to 50 percent, the White House Conference on Small Business established the restoration of the deduction as one of its top priorities for boosting small business. In Louisiana alone, it is expected that the positive economic impact of this proposal could exceed $67 million in industries, such as the travel and restaurant industry, that employ over 120,000 people. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I support the Senator's sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I will start off by saying that sense-of-the-Senate resolutions are pretty senseless, because it really is not making law; it is just an expression of what people think. To that extent, it is very important. 
   Let me just start off by saying that if the debate on Medicare is whether we want a tax cut or whether we want to reform Medicare, we will never reform Medicare. Medicare has been here since 1965, and it has been a political football every year. Every year that we run out of money with Medicare, we fix it by using the SOS approach--same old, same old. Every year when there was a shortfall, we simply tried to reduce reimbursements to doctors and hospitals and said, ``Well, we fixed it because we gave them less money to treat 40 million Americans who need health care in this country.'' 
   The President's budget this year again talks about approximately $20 billion in further cuts to the Medicare program. That is $20 billion less that is going to be available to provide medical benefits to 40 million seniors. That, I would suggest, is not reform. That, I would suggest, doesn't fix anything. That, I would suggest, just makes the problem greater and not less. 
   The reason I call into question the concept that a 15-percent transfer of the surplus in the form of IOUs to the  Medicare trust fund is not what it seems to be is that, in fact, it is not. 
   The GAO came to the Senate Finance Committee and they testified very specifically on this proposal. What they said, in bipartisan, unequivocal economic language that I think everyone can understand, is the following. They said this 
   transfer ``..... has no effect on the current and projected cash-flow deficits that have faced the [Medicare program] since 1992--deficits that taxpayers will continue to finance through higher taxes, lower spending elsewhere or lower pay downs of publicly-held debt than the baseline. Importantly, the President's proposal would not provide any new money to pay for medical services.'' 
   So the concept of saying we are going to fix Medicare by taking 15 percent of the surplus and putting IOUs in the trust fund and that somehow we have fixed the problem is nonsensical. It does not make any sense economically. It is not good policy. It gives us a false sense of security that somehow we have solved Medicare by loading up the trust fund with IOUs. That is not reform. That is not saving the program. That is not giving the program one nickel more in money. It is merely giving the trust fund more IOUs. We are in effect transferring publicly held debt from one account and putting it in another account and saying we fixed the program. 
   I could not live with that, because I don't think it does anything. It doesn't help the program. It doesn't hurt the program, but it doesn't fix the program. 
   This resolution says in essence that we are going to have to work in a bipartisan fashion to look at real reform. Our National Bipartisan Commission worked on this for a year. We have a recommendation which will be submitted in the form of legislation. We will have hearings in the Senate Finance Committee. I would like them to report on exactly what we send over there. But if they don't, hopefully it will be something similar. Hopefully, it will be real reform. Hopefully, it will be something that we can quit arguing about--whether we want tax cuts, or whether we want to save Medicare. 
   The program needs more money. There is no question about that. But it desperately needs reform. The 1965 model runs like a 1965 car, and putting more gas in an old car, it is still an old car. And putting more IOUs in the Medicare trust fund doesn't make it a modern, efficient delivery system for health care in this country. 
   I think the resolution is a good resolution. It is offered in a bipartisan fashion. It is a sense of the Senate. Big deal. I don't think it will change public policy. But it is so important that it needs a discussion on how we solve this particular issue. It says that Congress should move expeditiously in a bipartisan fashion to reform the program. Yes; we should. It says that Congress should continue to work with the President as he develops and presents his plan to fix the problem with the Medicare program. Yes; he should. 
   We are not going to fix it. We are going to be looking for issues to beat each other over the head once again. That is the old way of doing it. That is old politics. And people are sick and tired of it on both sides of the political spectrum outside of Washington. Maybe in Washington we love to play political games. We beat them up, they beat us up, and nothing gets done. We end up arguing about failure: It is their fault we didn't fix it. No; it is your fault we didn't fix it. And absolutely nothing is ever fixed with that kind of a procedure. 
   How much better would it would be for us to gather and work together and fix it? And we can always argue the political argument about who fixed it: We fixed it. No; they fixed it. But at least we are arguing about success about fixing something instead of trying to argue about whose fault it is that nothing 
   gets done on something as important as Medicare, and trying to figure out which wedge issue we are going to use this week and which wedge issue they are going to use next week. Is it not time that we kind of come together and say, ``Look, we have a big problem''? 
   Today, we spend more money in Medicare than we take in in revenues to pay for it. Today, not in 20 years. Today. If you use all of the revenues in the trust fund, plus the revenues coming in, we are totally insolvent in the year 2008. My fear is that in the year 2007 we are going to still be arguing about whether we want to fix Medicare or whether we want to have a tax cut. That is not the appropriate argument. That is not the discussion we should be engaged in. We can argue whether we need a tax cut, and how we should craft it, and who should benefit from it. That is a separate argument. 
   We should concentrate now on how to reform Medicare in a bipartisan fashion. I think this sense-of-the-Senate resolution suggests that. 
   It makes the point that the 15-percent surplus is nothing more than IOUs in the trust fund. It does not add a nickel to the trust fund. That is a correct statement, and that is why I support the resolution. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I do not necessarily disagree with everything the distinguished Senator from North Dakota has pointed out. It is important for everyone to understand that the suggestion of the administration of 15 percent of the surplus in the form of IOUs into the Medicare trust fund does not give the trust fund one nickel, one dime, one dollar more money. It only gives the trust fund IOUs in the form of Treasury securities on which, in the future, Medicare can go to the general fund and make a claim. That is all it does. 
   Basically, that is the same situation as we have today because it is an entitlement program. People are entitled to it. The question I have is, are we going to have no limit on how much of the general fund is going to be used to finance Medicare? 
   Madam President, 37 percent of the money today comes out of general revenues. It was supposed to start off as a payroll tax and that was how it was to be funded. Are we going to go to 40 percent without any concern? Are we going to go to 50 percent without any concern? How much of the general revenues are going to finance Medicare to the detriment of the national defense or anything else that we have as a nation? 
   I suggest to use this transfer of IOUs without making formal decisions and having serious debate about it is not good policy because it doesn't help Medicare at all. That is why it is important to understand it does not provide any new money to the Medicare program at all. 
   We should have that debate. We suggested a way of looking at it, but I think just saying 15 percent of the surplus solves the Medicare problem to the year 2030 is very, very erroneous. It is incorrect. We should not rely on that as a way of saving Medicare. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this month marks the end of a distinguished and remarkable career in public education for the president of my state's flagship university. At month's end, Dr. Allen A. Copping will be retiring, leaving the post of president of the Louisiana State University System that he has held since March of 1985. 
   Dr. Copping's retirement is significant for several reasons. Under his able and dedicated leadership, the LSU System has enjoyed enormous growth and development and is recognized around the country as a leader in educational excellence in numerous fields of academic pursuit. Dr. Copping's fourteen-year tenure is significant for another reason: He will always be remembered as the first health scientist to hold the position as LSU president. 
   Allen Copping is a native of New Orleans, born in 1927 and educated in the city's public schools. After graduating from Loyola University with a Doctor's degree in Dental Surgery in 1949, Dr. Copping entered the U.S. Navy and served our country with distinction during the Korean Conflict. After the war, he returned to New Orleans, where he began a very successful dental practice and also landed on the faculty of the Loyola University School of Dentistry. In 1968, Dr. Copping joined the faculty of the newly created LSU School of Dentistry as an associate professor and, six years later, he was appointed the second dean of the LSU School of Dentistry. 
   As dean, Dr. Copping's leadership ability and his vision quickly caught the eye of the LSU Board of Supervisors, which chose him to head the LSU Medical Center as Chancellor in 1974, a position he held with distinction for the next eleven years. During his years at the helm of the Medical Center, Dr. Copping helped initiate a remarkable expansion in both the curricular offerings and in the physical facilities at the Center. 
   On March 18, 1985, Allen Copping became the third president of the LSU System and the fifteenth LSU president, a job that entailed the leadership and supervision of the eight campuses in the system and management of an annual budget of over two billion dollars. 
   During his tenure as LSU president, Dr. Copping guided the system through some very challenging years, highlighted by the development of the world-renowned Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Baton Rouge and the addition of the Health Care Services Division of the LSU Medical Center. 
   Throughout his years at the helm of the LSU System, Dr. Copping enjoyed a well-deserved reputation as a man of extraordinary loyalty, honesty, compassion and sincerity who is unalterably devoted to public education and the well being of his native state of Louisiana. 
   Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of my state, I wish to congratulate Allen Copping on a well-deserved retirement and offer my profound gratitude for the leadership that he has provided the LSU System over the past fourteen years. He will be missed, but I know that I and other public officials will continue to benefit from his wisdom and his commitment to providing a quality education that meets the needs of our country's most precious commodity--our young people. I wish Allen and Betty and their family all the best in this next and very exciting phase of their lives.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senator COVERDELL, Senator DEWINE and Senator GRAMS in introducing the ``Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999.'' 
   My primary reason for sponsoring the bill is to make the federal Clean Water Act equitable by requiring that it apply to and be enforced against the federal government. 
   Currently, states, local governments and the private sector do not have immunity from the act's enforcement. By the same principle, the federal government should not be granted such immunity from the clean water statute and this bill provides that parity. 
   The bill also provides that the federal government would be subject to all the same enforcement mechanisms that apply to states, local governments and the private sector under the Clean Water Act. 
   Fairness, safety, public health and environmental protection all dictate that Federal agencies should be held to the same standards for water pollution prevention and control as apply to states, local governments and the private sector. 
   Equity is ensured by our bill because all levels of government and the private sector would be treated the same under the Clean Water Act's enforcement programs. No one would be allowed immunity. 
   To paraphrase a well-known adage, what's good for states, local governments and the private sector in terms of clean water should be good for the federal government. 
   In addition to the provisions stated previously, the bill reflects the adage's fairness principle in another fashion. 
   The bill would hold the federal government accountable to comply not only with its own clean water statute, but also with state and local clean water laws. Again, equity would be upheld. And, safety, public health and environmental protection would be strengthened. 
   Other provisions are contained as well in the legislation which Senator COVERDELL, Senator DEWINE, Senator GRAMS and I are introducing today. For example, the EPA administrator, the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Transportation would be authorized to pursue administrative enforcement actions under the Clean Water Act against any non-complying federal agencies. It also includes provisions for federal employees' personal liability under the act's civil and criminal penalty provisions and a requirement that the federal government pay reasonable service charges when complying with clean water laws. 
   Over the years, the United States has made dramatic advances in protecting the environment as a result of the Clean Water Act. We have all benefitted as a result. 
   Today, I encourage other Senators to join Senator COVERDELL, Senator DEWINE, Senator GRAMS and me as cosponsors of the bill to bring equity to the clean water program and to make possible the expansion of its public and private benefits.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, with the passing this week of Louisiana state Representative Avery Alexander, our nation and my state of Louisiana lost one of its most legendary and respected citizens. For most of his 88 years, Reverend Alexander gave himself selflessly and completely to the service of others--as a dedicated and caring minister, as a fearless and principled civil rights leader and as a tireless and thoroughly honorable public servant. 
   To those who knew him, ``The Rev,'' as he was called, was a nothing short of a living legend and the very embodiment of the courage, passion and vision that characterized the civil rights movement of the 1950s and l960s. In a day and time when standing up for your rights as an American meant taking your life into your hands, Avery Alexander and his allies took to the streets and helped transform our nation. Avery Alexander and his contemporaries in the civil rights movement helped give our nation a new birth of freedom and for that we are internally grateful. 
   Yet long after the great civil rights marches and protests of the 1960s and well into his ninth decade of life, Reverend Alexander was still as passionate and committed to the cause of human rights as he had always been. It wasn't that long ago--three years to be exact--that the people of Louisiana were treated to the familiar image of Avery Alexander on a ticket line in Baton Rouge, protesting changes to the state's affirmative action laws that he believed were unfair and unwise. When Avery Alexander believed in something, especially civil rights, he gave it his all. And he knew better than most that the civil rights laws of the 1960s were only a beginning, not an end, of a great national journey for every citizen, black, white, Hispanic or Asian. 
   Whatever one might have thought about him, and however one might have disagreed with him, I know of no one who would have ever thought of questioning Avery Alexander's motives. He was a supremely principled man, led by conscience and an innate sense of mission and morality to serve always as a voice for those who had lost or had never been given the right to speak for themselves. If you were down and out, forgotten, discriminated against, despised or rejected by society, then Avery Alexander was your friend. I have known few people who lived up to the Biblical admonition to love unconditionally as well as he did. Avery Alexander will be missed. But he will also be long remembered for the ways he taught and inspired us to love, to care, to serve and, most of all, to look beyond skin color and gender and age and creed and to see that which is best, noble and God-given in each of us. 
   We will all miss the ``Rev!''

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today Mr. MACK and I are again introducing legislation to place a permanent moratorium on the Department of the  Treasury's authority to finalize any proposed regulations issued pursuant to Notice 98-35, dealing with the treatment of hybrid branch transactions under subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. Our bill also prohibits Treasury from issuing new regulations relating to the tax treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F and requires the Secretary to conduct a study of the tax treatment of hybrid transactions and to provide a written report to the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means. 
   By way of background, the United States generally subjects U.S. citizens and corporations to current taxation on their worldwide income. Two important devices mitigate or eliminate double taxation of income earned from foreign sources. First, bilateral income tax treaties with many countries exempt American taxpayers from paying foreign taxes on certain types of income (e.g. interest) and impose reduced rates of tax on other types (e.g. dividends and royalties). Second, U.S. taxpayers receive a credit against U.S. taxes for foreign taxes paid on foreign source income. To reiterate, these devices have been part of our international tax rules for decades and are aimed at preventing U.S. businesses from being taxed twice on the same income. The policy of currently taxing U.S. citizens on their worldwide income is in direct contrast with the regimes employed by most of our foreign trading competitors. Generally they tax their citizens and domestic corporations only on the income earned within their borders (the so-called ``water's edge'' approach). 
   Foreign corporations generally are also not subject to U.S. tax on income earned outside the United States, even if the foreign corporation is controlled by a U.S. parent. Thus, U.S. tax on income earned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies--that is, from foreign operations conducted through a controlled foreign corporation (CFC)--is generally deferred until dividends paid by the CFC are received by its U.S. parent. This policy is referred to as ``tax deferral.'' 
   In 1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed eliminating tax deferral with respect to the earnings of U.S.-controlled foreign subsidiaries. The proposal provided that U.S. corporations would be currently taxable on their share of the earnings of CFCs, except in the case of investments in certain ``less developed countries.'' The business community strongly opposed the proposal, arguing that in order for U.S. multinational companies to be able to compete effectively in global markets, their CFCs should be subject only to the same taxes to which their foreign competitors were subject. 
   In the Revenue Act of 1962, Congress rejected the President's proposal to completely eliminate tax deferral, recognizing that to do so would place U.S. companies operating in overseas markets at a significant disadvantage vis-a-vis their foreign competitors. Instead, Congress opted to adopt a policy regime designed to end deferral only with respect to income earned from so-called ``tax haven'' operations. This regime, known as ``subpart F,'' generally is aimed at currently taxing foreign source income that is easily moveable from one taxing jurisdiction to another and that is subject to low rates of foreign tax. 
   Thus, the subpart F provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (found in sections 951-964) have always reflected a balancing of two competing policy objectives: capital export neutrality (i.e. neutrality of taxation as between domestic and foreign operations) and capital import neutrality (i.e. neutrality of taxation as between CFCs and their foreign competitors). While these competing principles continue to form the foundation of subpart F today, recent actions by the Department of the Treasury threaten to upset this long-standing balance. 
   On January 16, 1998, the Department of the Treasury announced in Notice 98-11 its intention to issue regulations to prevent the use of hybrid branches ``to circumvent the purposes of subpart F.'' The hybrid branch arrangements identified in Notice 98-11 involved entities characterized for U.S. tax purposes as part of a controlled foreign corporation, but characterized for purposes of the tax law of the country in which the CFC was incorporated as a separate entity. The Notice indicated that the creation of such hybrid branches was facilitated by the entity classification rules contained in section 301.7701-I through -3 of the Income Tax Regulations (the ``check the box'' regulations). 
   Notice 98-11 acknowledged that U.S. international tax policy seeks to balance the objectives of capital export neutrality with the objective of allowing U.S. businesses to compete on a level playing field with foreign competitors. In the view of the Treasury and IRS, however, the hybrid transactions attacked in the Notice ``upset that balance.'' Treasury indicated that the regulations to be issued generally would apply to hybrid branch arrangements entered into or substantially modified after January 16, 1998, and would provide that certain payments to and from foreign hybrid branches of CFCs would be treated as generating subpart F income to U.S. shareholders in situations in which subpart F would not otherwise apply to a hybrid branch as a separate entity. This represented a significant expansion of subpart F, by regulation rather than through legislation. 
   Shortly after Notice 98-11 was issued, the Administration released its Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposals which, among other things, included a provision requesting Congress to statutorily grant broad regulatory authority to the Treasury Secretary to prescribe regulations clarifying the tax consequences of hybrid transactions in cases in which the intended results are inconsistent with the purposes of U.S. tax law....... While the explanation accompanying the budget proposal argued that this grant of authority as 
   applied to many cases ``merely makes the Secretary's current general regulatory authority more specific, and directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations pursuant to such authority,'' the explanation conceded that in other cases, ``the Secretary's authority may be questioned and should be clarified.'' 
   Notice 98-11 and the accompanying budget proposal generated widespread concerns in the Congress and the business community that the Treasury was undertaking a major new initiative in the international tax arena that would undermine the ability of U.S. multinationals to compete in international markets. For example, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman BILL ARCHER wrote to Treasury Secretary Rubin on March 20, 1998 requesting that ``Notice 98-11 be withdrawn and that no regulations in this area be issued or allowed to take effect until Congress has an appropriate opportunity, to consider these matters in the normal legislative process.'' The Ranking Democrat on the Committee, Charles RANGEL, wrote to Secretary Rubin expressing strong concerns about the Treasury's increasing propensity to ``legislate through the regulatory process as evidenced by Notice 98-11.'' 
   Despite these concerns, on March 23, 1998, the Treasury department issued two sets of proposed and temporary regulations, the first relating to the treatment of hybrid branch arrangements under subpart F, and the second relating to the treatment of a CFC's distributive share of partnership income. As Notice 98-11 had promised, the regulations provided that certain payments between a controlled foreign corporation and a hybrid branch would be recharacterized as subpart F income if the payments reduce the payer's foreign taxes. 
   The week after the temporary and proposed regulations were issued, the Senate Finance Committee considered H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. A provision was included in the bill prohibiting the Treasury and IRS from implementing temporary or final regulations with respect to Notice 98-11 prior to six months after the date of enactment of H.R. 2676. The Senate bill also included language expressing the ``sense of the Senate'' that ``the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service should withdraw Notice 98-11 and the regulations issued thereunder, and that the Congress, and not the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, should determine the international tax policy issues relating to the treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F provisions of the Code.'' 
   Opposition to Notice 98-11 and the temporary and proposed regulations  continued to mount. On April 23, 1998, 33 Members of the House Ways and Means Committee wrote to Secretary Rubin expressing concern about the Treasury's decision to move forward and issue regulations pursuant to Notice 98-11 without an appropriate opportunity for Congress to consider this issue in the normal legislative process, urging Treasury to withdraw the regulations. 
   In the face of these and other pressures from the Congress and the business community, on June 19, 1998, the Treasury Department announced in Notice 98-35 that it was withdrawing Notice 98-11 and the related temporary, and proposed regulations. According to Notice 98-35, Treasury intends to issue a new set of proposed regulations to be effective in general for payments made under hybrid branch arrangements on or after June 19, 1998. These regulations, however, will not be finalized before January 1, 2000, in order to permit both the Congress and Treasury Department the opportunity to further study the issues that were raised following the publication of Notice 98-11 earlier this year. 
   While we applaud the Treasury's decision to withdraw Notice 98-11 and the temporary regulations, we believe that additional legislative action is needed to prevent the Treasury from finalizing the forthcoming regulations until Congress considers the issues involved. We believe that only the Congress has the authority to achieve a permanent resolution of this issue. Notice 98-35, like its predecessor, Notice 98-11 continues to suffer from a fatal flaw; it is the prerogative of Congress, and not the Executive Branch, to pass laws establishing the nation's fundamental tax policies. Simply put, Notice 98-35 adds restrictions to the subpart F regime that are not supported by the Code's clear statutory language, and there has been no express delegation of regulatory authority to the Treasury that relates specifically to the issues presented in the Notice. 
   More importantly, we question the policy objectives to be achieved by Notice 98-35 and the accompanying proposed regulations. We do not understand the rationale for penalizing U.S. multinational companies for employing normal tax planning strategies that reduce foreign (as opposed to U.S.) income taxes. Moreover, Notice 98-35 is contrary to recent Congressional efforts to simplify the international tax provisions of the Code. For example, the Congress reduced complexity and ridded the code of a perverse incentive for U.S. companies to invest overseas by repealing the Section 956A tax on excess passive earnings in 1996. Again in 1997, the Congress repealed the application of the Passive Foreign Investment Company regime to U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations because of the complexity involved in applying both regimes, in addition to enacting a host of other foreign tax simplifications. The Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing on March 11, 1999 to further investigate the reforms needed in the international tax arena that not only reduce complexity, but also encourage U.S. global economic competition. I fully expect Notice 98-35 to be discussed at this hearing. 
   In order for Congress to gain a better understanding of the Treasury Department's position on this matter, our bill would require the Treasury to conduct a thorough study of the tax treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F and to provide a report to the Senate Committee on Finance and House Committee on Ways and Means on this issue. 
   If the forthcoming regulations are permitted to be finalized by the Treasury, U.S. multinational businesses will be placed at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis foreign companies who remain free to employ strategies to reduce the foreign taxes they pay. Clearly, such a result should be permitted to take effect only if Congress, after having an opportunity to fully consider all of the tax and economic issues involved, agrees that the arguments advanced by the Treasury are compelling and determines that additional statutory changes to subpart F are necessary and appropriate.

   Mr. BREAUX. I take the time today, Mr. President and my colleagues, to introduce a bill which I happen to think addresses a very important issue that this Nation is facing; and that is the question of trying to devise a system where the United States can continue to be the world's leader in the space launch business. 
   Every day, every month, more and more satellites around the world are being put into service. I daresay that most people really do not follow the details of how this is accomplished, but I do know that over the last several months people in this country have heard a great deal about Chinese rockets, Ukrainian rockets, Russian rockets and all the problems that they have been involved with related to the U.S. aerospace industry. 
   One may wonder, why would a U.S. company have to use a Ukraine launch vehicle or a Chinese launch vehicle or a Russian launch vehicle or a European launch vehicle in order to launch a U.S. satellite to serve the technological and communications needs of the world. The reason is not that hard to figure out when you look at the fact that these countries that I just mentioned are not countries that are under the same economic obligations that we are. Many of those are not free market economies. Many are still government-run economies. Many of those countries have governments that have put a great deal of money in their launch industries and are now able to provide those launch vehicles for use at a cutrate or subsidized price. 
   I do not think that is particularly good for our country to have to buy space transportation on a Ukraine rocket to launch a U.S. satellite. When those rockets malfunction, then we are in a problem area trying to tell them based on our technological expertise why the failure happened. Our companies could get into trouble because of the risk that they are sharing with them technology that could be used for military purposes. 
   So I, for one, do not think I would want to drive a Ukrainian car let alone ride in a Ukrainian rocket. But that is what is happening because of a situation where we do not have enough access in the private industry to U.S.-built space transportation vehicles that can launch U.S.-built satellites for communications purposes. 
   We have learned that one of the reasons is the fact that there is inadequate private sector funding for U.S. companies to engage in building space transportation vehicles for this purpose. It is, of course, a high-risk business. This is much more risky than building a ship or building a car or building just about anything else. A lot can go wrong. So it is a high risk. And there is inadequate funding in the private sector. 
   To solve this problem, what do you do? Do you make the Government take it over? Do you make the Government own the launch vehicles and make the Government pay for the building of the launch vehicles? In our society the answer is no. But I think that the legislation that I am introducing today, along with Senator CONRAD BURNS of Montana, sets up a program which would be a loan guarantee program where the U.S. Government can pattern in the space transportation industry what we have done very successfully in the shipbuilding industry under what is known as a Title XI shipbuilding loan guarantee program, where the Federal Government comes to a qualified builder who is having a difficult time getting adequate financing because of the nature of the industry, and that the Federal Government will be in a position to guarantee the loan to a company which company would go out into the private market and borrow the money but have the loan guaranteed by the Federal Government. Under that scenario, we have built literally hundreds and hundreds of vessels, probably thousands, through the Title XI loan guarantee program. 
   What I am proposing in the ``Commercial Space Transportation Cost Reduction Act of 1999'' is to set up a loan guarantee program which would be patterned after the Title XI Shipyard Loan Guarantee Program. We would vest the Secretary of Transportation in our Government with the administrative responsibilities for the program operations. The legislation would initially provide up to $500 million of funding for the loan guarantee program. That would represent the possibility of generating up to $5 billion in loans for U.S. space transportation companies to engage other U.S. companies and U.S. workers in building space transportation vehicles for use in our society. 
   I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.

   Mr. BREAUX. And by having that type of a system, I think that we would give our private companies the ability to compete with all of these other companies in countries which have their governments supporting them in these areas. 
   We have had a number of Senators who have expressed an interest in participating with us in this legislation. Let me just mention Senator LOTT, Senator BACCHUS, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator GRAHAM of Florida and Senator LANDRIEU of Louisiana. I hope--and now that the bill has been introduced, that the Commerce Committee can have some hearings on it--that we can continue to improve it and move forward with establishing something that will allow the private sector of the United States to continue to be, and even increase the ability to be, the world leader in space transportion. In particular, the ability to launch our satellites with our vehicles and not have to rent space from the Russians or from the Chinese or from the Ukrainians or from any other part of the world. This is a vitally important industry, and the United States should be the technological leader now and for the future.

    Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with my colleague, Senator HATCH, an important bill that will assist states and localities in working with private industry to foster economic development and provide home ownership opportunities to low-income Americans. Specifically, our bill will increase the private activity tax-exempt bond cap to $75 per capita or $250 million, if greater, and index the cap to inflation. 
   Congress created the private activity tax-exempt bond decades ago to apply to mortgage revenue bonds and other bonds for multifamily housing, redevelopment of blighted areas, student loans, manufacturing, and hazardous waste disposal facilities. However, Congress unintentionally restricted the growth of this program by imposing a cap on the bond volume of $50 per capita or $150 million that was not indexed to inflation. The resulting erosion in purchasing power has crippled the ability of states to meet the growing demand for these bonds. 
   Congress took an important step to correct this problem in the Fiscal Year 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill by approving a partial, phased-in increase in each state's bond cap. The bond cap will be increased by $5 per capita beginning in 2003. The volume limit will reach $70 per capita, or $210 million if greater, in 2006. Unfortunately, inflation will have reduced the purchasing power of these bonds by nearly thirty-three percent by the time the volume cap increase is fully phased in. 
   Tax-exempt bonds are issued by state and local governments to provide below market interest rates to fund authorized programs and projects. Revenue bond investors accept lower interest from these bonds because the interest income is tax-exempt. For example, mortgage revenue bonds are issued to help lower income working families buy their first homes. These low interest loans significantly lower the cost of owning a home. 
   In my own state, the Louisiana Housing Finance Agency has issued over $1.1 billion in mortgage revenue bonds for almost 16,000 affordable home mortgages since the program began. In 1996 alone, the agency issued over $112 million in mortgage revenue bonds for nearly 1,200 home loans. That's 1,200 Louisiana families who now know the pride of owning their own home--Louisiana families that earned, on average, less than $28,000 last year. The Louisiana Housing Finance Agency estimates that it could have put another $50 million in bond authority to good use. Nationwide, states could have used an additional $7 billion in bond cap for mortgage revenue bonds, student loan bonds, industrial revenue bonds, pollution control bonds and other worthy investments. 
   Student loan bonds are also issued to raise a pool of money at tax-exempt interest rates resulting in lower interest rate college loans. In my state, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority has issued $745 million in student loan bonds since 1984. These bonds have funded over 80,000 college loans for deserving Louisiana students--students who otherwise might not have been able to afford to attend college. 
   In Louisiana, the roughly $40 million of remaining 1997 volume cap will not come close to fulfilling the $330 million of demand for these bonds. The total 1997 volume cap for Louisiana was $217,500,000. After funding minimal housing and student loan needs, little volume cap remains available for industrial development bonds for manufacturing purposes. Many of the industrial and manufacturing facilities create substantial employment opportunities. Unfortunately, a deficiency in volume cap limits these opportunities. 
   Our bill will correct this woeful situation and improve the ability of states and localities to provide home ownership opportunities to low-income families throughout the United States, to help fund student loans for college students and to help finance industrial and manufacturing facilities. These facilities will, in turn, increase employment and the tax base of local governments. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator HATCH in this effort.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. Chief Justice and my colleagues. Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice, as so many people have said before, for serving with your patience and your fairness. If you care to extend your time with us, I would invite you to help preside over my Medicare commission--if you would like to help out in that regard. 
   I also want to acknowledge and thank our two leaders for the fairness and the patience that they both have exhibited to all of us and the good job they have done keeping this body together, which I happen to think is extremely important as well. 
   I think it is always very difficult for us to sit in judgment of another human being, and particularly is that very difficult when it involves moral behavior, or moral misbehavior as this case essentially is all about. I was always taught that there was a higher authority that made those types of decisions, but here we are, and that is part of our task. 
   I think it is also especially difficult to make those kinds of decisions when they involve someone you know and someone you actually deal with in a relatively close relationship, almost on a day-to-day basis. It is difficult when it is someone that you can in private kid with or that you in private can joke with, as is the case for many of us with this accused whom we now sit in judgment of. 
   I know this President and he is someone I have admired for his political accomplishments and I have admired for what he has been able to do for this country, but also quite well recognize the human frailties that he has, as all of us have. If this were a normal trial, many of us wouldn't even be here; we would have been excused a long time ago; we would never have been selected to sit in judgment of this President. We would have been excused because of friendship, we would have been excused because we know him, we would have been excused because we campaigned for him and with him, or we would have been excused for the opposite reasons--because he is a political adversary that we have campaigned against, that we have given speeches against, that we disagree with publicly on just about everything he stands for. None of us would find ourselves sitting in judgment of this individual if it were a normal trial. But, then again, it is not a normal trial, and these certainly are not normal times. 
   For many of us, this is the first time we have ever had a President who has sort of been a contemporary--certainly for me, and many of my colleagues are in that same category. I was here, as many of you in my generation, when President Johnson was here, and served throughout the time of President Johnson all the way through President Bush. I have met them all and knew them all to various degrees but never in the same way that I and many of us know this particular President, because he really is in the same generation as we are. I think we have that feeling, when we talk with him. I mean, many times I feel he knows what I am going to say before I say it and he understands what I am trying to convey to him before I even have say anything about the subject matter. 
   I think that many of us have had, with him, the same type of life experiences, and that our lives have been shaped by similar events because we really are of the same generation. So it is very difficult, coming from that position and now sitting in judgment of a person for his moral behavior. So I think we have to be extremely careful, those of us who come from this side with that personal friendship and relationship, as well as those who come from the opposite side, as a political adversary. It is very difficult to set those emotions aside and say I am going to be fair in judging someone I just cannot stand politically, that I don't agree with on anything, and I wish he wasn't my President; in fact, I supported someone else. So, it is very difficult for all of us to try to set that aside and come to an honest and fair and decent conclusion. 
   I think the American people have been able to do that. I think they have had a good understanding of what this case is about from the very beginning. They understood what it was about before the trial ever started, they understood what it was about during the trial, and I think they understand what it is all about after the trial. I think they understand what happened. I think they know when it happened, they know where it happened, and they know what was said about it. I think that they were correct from the very beginning. 
   What we really have is a middle-aged man, who happens to be President of the United States, who has a sexual affair with someone in his office, and that when people started finding out about it, he lied about it, tried to cover it up, tried to mislead people about what happened. I would daresay that this is not the first time in the history of the world that this has ever happened. I daresay it probably will not be the last time that it will happen. It is probably not the first time it has happened in this city. 
   All of that does not make it right; it does not make it acceptable. It does not make it excusable. It cannot be condoned and it cannot be overlooked. Actions that are wrong have consequences, and now the consequences must be determined by the Senate. 
   The question here is not really whether anything wrong was done. For  heaven's sakes, everybody knows that what was done was clearly wrong. It was unacceptable. It was embarrassing. It was indefensible and any other adjective you can possibly think of to really describe it. But that is not really the question before us, and we can all agree on that. I think the question is not even whether this was perjury or whether it was obstruction of justice under the terms of the Constitution. 
   I think the only question before us is whether what happened rises to the highest constitutional standards of high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution, justifying automatic removal of this President from the office of President. 
   I have concluded that the Constitution was designed very carefully to remove the President of the United States for wrongful actions as President of the United States in his capacity as President of the United States and in carrying out his duties as President of the United States. For wrongful acts that are not connected with the official capacity and duties of the President of the United States, there are other ways to handle it. There is the judicial system. There is the court system. There are the U.S. attorneys out there waiting. There may even be the Office of Independent Counsel, which will still be there after all of this is finished. 
   But we here cannot expand the Constitution in this area. I think history supports my position. I will cite you just a quick two examples. Senator SLADE GORTON earlier spoke about the situation with the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. As Secretary, he was having an affair with a woman here in this city and they found out about it. He was paying off the husband of the wife that he was having an affair with. He was trying to get her to burn the evidence, which were letters that he had sent, to try to cover it up--criminal acts. But the Congress that was investigating him, came to the conclusion that the behavior was private. It was wrong, it was terrible, it was criminal, but it was private behavior and he was not impeached. Not because, I think, as SLADE tried to say, that he wasn't impeached because he admitted it, he only admitted it when he got caught. But he was not impeached because they decided that it was essentially private behavior. That was in 1792, and Adams and the Founding Fathers were here at that time and they came to that conclusion. 
   More recently, the situation with President Richard Nixon, I think, is a clear example of what we are struggling with here, to find this connection between official duties and what he did. One of the articles that they accused President Nixon with was that he had, not once, but four times filed fraudulent income tax returns under the criminal penalty of perjury--that he deducted things that he should not have deducted and that he didn't report income that should have been reported. By a 26-to-12 vote, the House Judiciary Committee said, among other things, that ``the conduct must be seriously incompatible with either the constitutional form and principles of our Government or the proper performance of the constitutional duties of the President's office.'' They said that it did not demonstrate public misconduct, but rather private misconduct that had become public. I think the situation today is very similar. 
   These are clear examples both in the beginning of our country's history and very recently about the need for this nexus or connection between the illegal acts and the duties of the office of the President. 
   Let me conclude by saying I am voting not to convict and remove. But that is not a vote on the innocence of this President. He is not innocent. And by not voting to convict we can't somehow establish his innocence. If the standard of removal was bad behavior, he would be gone. I mean there would probably be no disagreement about that. But that is not the standard. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on conviction and removal and ask our colleagues to join in a bipartisan, strong, clear censure resolution and spell out what happened and where it happened and when it happened and what was said about what happened so that history will be able to, forever, look at that censure resolution and study it and learn from what we do today. That, my colleagues, I think is an appropriate and a proper remedy. 
   Thank you.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to commend Senator GRASSLEY for his leadership on the important issue of cutting waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. As chairman of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, I strongly support our legislation that will save federal dollars by modernizing an outdated and confusing billing system. The Medicare Universal Product Number Act of 1999 is a practical solution which will ensure that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) knows what it is paying for when reimbursing for durable medical equipment (DME) under the Medicare program. 
   Currently, HCFA's billing system uses overly broad and sometimes outdated codes. These codes can cover a wide range of products which vary in price and quality, making it difficult for HCFA to track and price medical equipment accurately. By using Universal Product Numbers (UPNs), which provide a unique, unambiguous means of identifying each product on the market, HCFA will be able to track utilization more efficiently. 
   Because UPNs are unique identifiers, HCFA will be better equipped in combating fraud against the Medicare program. Currently the system is vulnerable to a type of fraud called ``upcoding.'' This occurs when Medicare is billed for a product under an improper code. Perpetrators of fraud can use improper codes to receive higher reimbursement rates then those given for the products which they actually provide. By tracking utilization, made possible by UPNs, HCFA will know what product is provided to the beneficiary and how much that product costs. 
   There is widespread support for the use of UPNs in the Medicare program. A recent GAO report addresses the need to reform Medicare's billing system. The report found that HCFA ``does not know specifically what Medicare is paying for when its contractors process claims for'' medical equipment and supplies. The Department of Defense and the Veterans' Administration have already begun to require UPNs, as do many private sector purchasing groups. Moreover, the medical products industry recognizes the value of UPNs and strongly supports this legislation. 
   Medicare's current billing system is vulnerable to abuse. This legislation is a practical approach to help ensure that taxpayer dollars are protected and spent wisely. I thank Senator GRASSLEY for his leadership, and I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Regulatory Right to Know Act of 1999 with my colleague, Senator THOMPSON. This important piece of legislation will make the regulatory system more understandable and accountable to the American people. 
   The Regulatory Right to Know Act of 1999 is similar to an amendment that was attached to the Fiscal Year 1999 Treasury, Postal Appropriations bill and which the Senate unanimously passed on July 29, 1998. It is also similar to the two Stevens' Amendments passed with a large majority of support in the Senate in 1996 and 1997. All of these amendments required the Office of Management and Budget to prepare an accounting statement and report on the annual costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. Obviously, Congress is on record in support of having more information about the federal regulatory system. 
   The Regulatory Right to Know Act of 1999 simply makes this requirement permanent and requires OMB to submit a yearly report to Congress on the total costs and benefits of federal regulations. Costs and benefits include those that are both quantifiable and non-quantifiable. OMB must present both an analysis of the impacts of regulations on Federal, State, local and tribal governments, the private sector, small businesses, wages and economic growth, as well as recommendations for reforming wasteful or outdated regulations. Lastly, our bill provides the public with an opportunity to comment on the draft report before it is submitted to Congress. 
   Our bill does not do a number of things. It does not require that any regulations or programs be eliminated because the benefits do not outweigh the costs. It does not impose an unworkable burden on the OMB because much of the needed information is already available. And, our bill doesn't undermine the need for regulations protecting public health, worker safety, food quality or environmental preservation. 
   Some studies have estimated the total cost of federal regulations to be almost $700 billion annually. On average, regulations cost every household in America approximately $7,000 per year. As the people who bear the cost of federal regulatory programs, America's citizens have a right to know what they are getting for their $7,000. Taxpayers are able to track how the government spends its tax dollars through the budget process. The same openness should apply to the federal regulatory system. Congress also needs the accounting statements provided by our bill in order to make better, more informed, and more efficient decisions. For these reasons. I urge all of my colleagues to support the Regulatory Right to Know Act of 1999.

   Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation allowing certain U.S. legal tender coins to be qualified investments for an individual retirement account (IRA). 
   Congress excluded ``collectibles'', such as antiques, gold and silver bullion, and legal tender coinage, as appropriate for contribution to IRAs in 1981. The primary reason was the concerns that individuals would get a tax break when they bought collectibles for their personal use. For example, a taxpayer might deduct the purchase of an antique rug for his/her living room as an IRA investment. Congress was also concerned about how the many different types of collectibles are valued. 
   Over the years, however, certain coins and precious metals have been excluded from the definition of a collectible because they are independently valued investments that offer investors portfolio diversity and liquidity. For example, Congress excluded gold and silver U.S. American Eagles from the definition of collectibles in 1986, and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 took the further step of excluding certain precious metals bullion. 
   My legislation would exclude form the definition of collectibles only those U.S. legal tender coins which meet the following three standards; certification by a nationally-recognized grading service, traded on a nationally-recognized network and held by a qualified trustee as described in the Internal Revenue Code. In other words, only investment quality coins that are independently valued and not held for personal use may be included in IRAs. 
   There are several nationally-recognized, independent certification or grading services. Full-time professional graders (numismatists) examine each coin for authenticity and grade them according to established standards. Upon certification, the coin is sonically-sealed (preserved) to ensure that it remains in the same condition as when it was graded.  
   Legal tender coins are then traded via two independent electronic networks--the Certified Coin Exchange and Certified CoinNet. These networks are independent of each other and have no financial interest in legal tender coinage and precious metals markets. The networks function in precisely the same manner as the NASDAQ with a series of published ``bid'' and ``ask'' prices and last trades. The buys and sells are enforceable prices that must be honored as posted until updated. 
   Mr. President, the liquidity provided through a bona fide national trading network, combined with published prices, make legal tender coinage a practical investment that offers investors diversification and liquidity. Investment in these tangible assets has become a safe and prudent course of action for both the small and large investor and should be given the same treatment under the law as other financial investments. I urge the Senate to enact this important legislation as soon as possible.
