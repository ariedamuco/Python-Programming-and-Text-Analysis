Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the 105th Congress is likely to adjourn without enacting S. 1427, the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1998. Even so, I want to provide my colleagues a status report on the bill and advise them of the prospects for passage next year. 
The principal purpose of S. 1427 is to provide permanent `Class A licenses' for low-power broadcasters. Currently these broadcasters have secondary status, which means that they can be bumped from their place on the spectrum by a full-power station. Without permanent status, these broadcasters have a hard time obtaining long-term capital. 
After introducing this legislation last year, I worked with the staff of the Federal Communications Committee to refine the bill. In pursuing this matter, I have sought to provide a degree of certainty for low power broadcasters without creating any unintended consequences for other users of the spectrum. The result, which was reported from the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on October 1, has achieved that goal. 
The core mission of low power broadcasters is to provide programming for local communities that are not served by full power stations. These under-served communities may be in rural areas or in large metropolitan areas. In my state, we have a low-power station that provides programming that is geared to the interests of rural Kentuckians. However, in Washington, D.C., low power broadcasters provide Spanish language programming to meet the needs of the Hispanic population in this area. 
The FCC has recognized the unique role that community broadcasters play in providing programming to under-served audiences. Earlier this year, when I asked Chairman Kennard for his comments on the legislation, he responded favorably. Chairman Kennard said, `Having reviewed the legislation, I have no major concerns with the bill.' 
Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator McCain, the chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Hollings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, and my other colleagues on the committee for their support of this legislation. As of today, 13 members of the Commerce Committee have joined as cosponsors. Also I want to express my appreciation to Senator Burns, the chairman of the Communications Subcommittee. Senator Burns has cosponsored S. 1427, and he has advised that he will introduce this legislation when the 106th Congress convenes next year. I thank my colleague for his continued interest in and support for community broadcasters. I am very pleased to leave this legislation in the capable hands of the Senator from Montana.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, in the closing days of the 105th Congress, it appears that S. 1802, a bill to reauthorize the Surface Transportation Board, may not be enacted into law. I hope that the STB is not penalized in any way for the failure of Congress to enact S. 1802. In fact, I want my colleagues to know that Linda Morgan, the current chairman of the STB, is well respected within the Senate on both sides of the aisle. She was a valued member of the staff of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for several years. The work ethic, honesty and balance that she demonstrated as a member of the Committee's professional staff have been evidenced also at the STB. 
Linda Morgan and her staff have handled a significant number of complex matters in a timely, thorough manner despite very limited resources. Just one example of the Board's evenhanded approach is the exhaustive review of the acquisition of Conrail by CSX and Norfolk Southern. This transaction will yield significant competitive and environmental benefits, not only in Kentucky but throughout the Eastern United States. The Board's evenhanded, professional approach in reviewing this major transaction and assessing the public benefits is indicative of the excellent work that Chairman Morgan and the Board have done since its creation. 
As a result, I support S. 1802 and hope that the bill could still become law before the conclusion of the 105th Congress. Also, I urge the Administration to renominate Ms. Morgan for an additional term as Chairman of the STB. She is a proven, well-qualified public servant, and she has earned the opportunity to complete the work that she has started.

Mr. FORD. As my colleague from Louisiana well knows, most liquid cargo transportation companies on the coastal and inland waterway system of the United States have embraced safe operation and risk management as two of their most important and fundamental values. For example, members of the American Waterways Operators (AWO) from Kentucky, Louisiana, and other states have implemented stronger safety programs that have significantly reduced personal injuries to mariners. Tank barge fleets have been upgraded through construction of new state-of-the-art double hulled tank barges while obsolete single skin barges are being retired far in advance of the OPA90 timetable. Additionally, AWO members have dedicated significant time and financial resources to provide continuous and comprehensive education and training for vessel captains, crews and shore side staff, not only in the operation of vessels but also in preparation for all contingencies that could occur in the transportation of oil products. As of today, more than 90 percent of the tugboats, towboats and barges owned and operated by AWO member companies are in compliance with the AWO Responsible Carrier Program (RCP), a program developed by the towing industry, on its own initiative, to improve the overall safety, efficiency, and quality of its marine operations. The RCP, complemented by advanced training programs such as the ground breaking wheelhouse resource management and simulator training program for towboat operators, is greatly enhancing the professionalism of mariners engaged in the transportation of oil products. 
Mr. President, I know that the commitment to marine safety and environmental protection by responsible members of the oil transportation industry from Kentucky and elsewhere is real. They continue to work closely with the Coast Guard to upgrade regulatory standards in such key areas as towing vessel operator qualifications and navigation equipment on towing vessels. That commitment is demonstrated by industry-driven safety initiatives like the Responsible Carrier Program mentioned above and the Coast Guard-AWO Partnership, which brings the leadership of the industry together with government to solve marine safety and environmental protection problems.

Mr. FORD. As my colleague from Louisiana has most ably demonstrated, OPA90 is working in a truly meaningful sense. To prevent oil spill incidents from occurring in the first place, OPA90 provides an enormously powerful deterrent through both its criminal and civil liability provisions. Moreover, OPA90 mandates prompt reporting of spills, contingency planning, and both cooperation and coordination with federal, state, and local authorities in connection with managing the spill response. Failure to report and cooperate as required by OPA90 may impose automatic civil penalties, criminal liability and unlimited civil liability. As a result, the number of domestic oil spills has been dramatically reduced over the past eight years since OPA90 was enacted. Coast Guard statistics reflect that in 1990 there were a total of 35 major and medium oil spills, seven of which were major spills. In 1997, as a direct result of OPA90, there were no major oil spills and the number of medium spills had been reduced to eight. In those limited situations in which oil spills unfortunately occurred, intensive efforts commenced immediately with federal, state and local officials working in a joint, unified manner with the industry, as contemplated by OPA90, to clean up and report spills as quickly as possible and to mitigate to the greatest extent any impact on the environment. OPA90 has provided a comprehensive and cohesive `blueprint' for proper planning, training, and resource identification to respond to an oil spill incident, and to ensure that such a response is properly and cooperatively managed. 
OPA90 also provides a complete statutory framework for proceeding against individuals for civil and/or criminal penalties arising out of oil spills in the marine environment. When Congress crafted this Act, it carefully balanced the imposition of stronger criminal and civil penalties with the need to promote enhanced cooperation among all of the parties involved in the spill prevention and response effort. In so doing, the Congress clearly enumerated the circumstances in which criminal penalties could be imposed for actions related to maritime oil spills. In particular, OPA90 properly imposes criminal liability for negligent violations and provides for punishment of up to one year imprisonment and/or fines between $2500 and $25,000 per day. The punishment for each knowing violation was increased by OPA90 to up to three years imprisonment and/or fines between $5000 and $50,000 per day. Furthermore, OPA90 added and/or substantially increased criminal penalties under other pre-existing laws which comprehensively govern the maritime transportation of oil and other petroleum products.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, to illustrate Senator Beaux's point, please permit me to present a scenario that highlights the dilemma faced by the maritime oil transportation industry in Kentucky. Imagine, if you will, that a company is operating a towing vessel in compliance with Coast Guard regulations on the Mississippi River on a calm, clear day with several fully laden tank barges in tow. Suddenly, in what was charted and previously identified to be a clear portion of the waterway, one of the tank barges strikes an unknown submerged object which shears through its hull and causes a significant oil spill in the river. Unfortunately, in addition to any other environmental damage that may occur, the oil spill kills one or more migratory birds. As you know, under OPA90 the operator must immediately undertake coordinated spill response actions with the Coast Guard and other federal, state, and local agencies to safeguard the vessel and its crew, clean up the oil spill, and otherwise mitigate any damage to the surrounding environment. The overriding objectives at this critical moment are to assure personnel and public safety and to clean up the oil spill as quickly as possible without constraint. However, in the current atmosphere the operator must take into consideration the threat of strict criminal liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act, together with their attendant imprisonment and fines, despite the reasonable care and precautions taken in the operation and navigation of the two and in the spill response effort. Indeed, in the Coast Guard's recently issued environmental enforcement directive, the statement is made that `[t]he decision to commit the necessary Coast Guard resources to obtain the evidence that will support a criminal prosecution must often be made in the very early stages of a pollution incident.' Any prudent operator will quickly recognize the dilemma in complying with the mandate to act cooperatively with all appropriate public agencies in cleaning up the oil spill, while at the same time those very agencies may be conducting a criminal investigation of that operator. Vessel owners and their employees who have complied with federal laws and regulations and have exercised all reasonable care should not continue to face a substantial risk of imprisonment and criminal fines under such strict liability statutes. 
Criminal liability, when appropriately imposed under OPA90, should be employed only where a discharge is caused by conduct which is truly `criminal' in nature, i.e., where a discharge is caused by reckless, intentional or other conduct deemed criminal by OPA90.

Mr. FORD. In the maritime industry's continuing effort to improve its risk management process, it seeks to identify and address all foreseeable risks associated with the operation of its business. Through fleet modernization, personnel training, and all other reasonable steps to address identified risks in its business, the industry still cannot manage or avoid the increased risks of strict criminal liability (again, a liability that has no regard to fault or intent). The only method available to companies and their officers to avoid the risk of criminal liability completely is to divest themselves from the maritime business of transporting oil and other petroleum products, in effect to get out of the business altogether. Furthermore, strict liability criminal laws provide a strong disincentive for trained, highly experienced mariners to continue the operation of tank vessels, and for talented and capable individuals from even entering into that maritime trade. A recent editorial highlighted the fact that tugboat captains `are reporting feelings of intense relief and lightening of their spirits when they are ordered to push a cargo of grain or other dry cargo, as compared to the apprehension they feel when they are staring out of their wheelhouses at tank barges', and `that the reason for this is very obvious in the way that they find themselves instantly facing criminal charges * * * in the event of a collision or grounding and oil or chemicals end up in the water'. These views were eloquently expressed as well by two tank vessel masters in a recent House hearing on strict criminal liability for oil pollution. Certainly, the federal government does not want to create a situation where the least experienced mariners are the only available crew to handle the most hazardous cargoes, or the least responsible operators are the only available carriers. Thus, the unavoidable risk of such criminal liability directly and adversely affects the safe transportation of oil products, an activity essential for the public, the economy, and the nation.

Mr. FORD. In the event of an oil spill, a responsible party not only must manage the cleanup of the oil and the civil liability resulting from the spill itself, but also must protect itself from the criminal liability that now exists due to the available and willing use of strict liability criminal laws by the Federal Government. Managing the pervasive threat of strict criminal liability, by its very nature, prevents a responsible party from cooperating fully and completely in response to an oil spill situation. The OPA90 `blueprint' is no longer clear. Is this serving the objectives of OPA90? Does this really serve the public welfare of our nation? Is this what congress had in mind when it mandated its spill response regime? Is this in the interest of the most immediate, most effective oil spill cleanup in the unfortunate event of a spill? We think not.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, as the 105th Congress comes to a close, I want to take a moment to say thank you to my fellow colleagues who, like me, will be retiring this year. 
I came to the Senate in 1974 with Senators Glenn and Bumpers. It was a different time, when campaigns were still won by going door to door, when the Senate itself was much more open to compromise and bipartisanship. 
Despite the changes in the Senate, Senator Bumpers has continued to be a voice for his State, never giving up the fight for something in which he believed. And when the Senate itself began to listen, they began to respond. In fact, after fighting 19 years to reform the National Parks concessions operations, he finally won approval of the legislation on last Thursday. 
And while it's true the Senate long ago lost its reputation as a place of eloquent debate, my colleague from Arkansas has proven time and again the power of words with his skillful oratory, whether the issue was arms control, education or balancing the budget. In all my years here in Washington, I was never so moved as I was by a speech he gave on preserving the Manassas, Virginia, Civil War Battlefield. He not only changed votes, but he reminded his colleagues and the American people that our greatest strength lies in our ability to give voice to our beliefs and to our constituent's concerns. 
Like Mark Twain who came into this world with Halley's comet and left this world with the return, Senator Glenn came into the public eye with his historic orbit around the earth and he will close out his public career with another historic flight into space. In between, he's demonstrated over and over that he's truly made of the `right stuff.' 
As the `Almanac of American Politics' wrote, he is `the embodiment of the small town virtues of family, God-fearing religion, duty, patriotism and hard work . . .'. And over the years, he has brought the same fight and determination that made him a brilliant fighter pilot to his efforts to expand educational opportunities, increase funding for scientific research, to clean up nuclear waste sites, promote civil rights and to make our government more efficient. 
Despite their long list of contributions in the Senate, perhaps their greatest contributions to this nation are still to come. Senator Bumpers has talked about going back to Arkansas to teach and Senator Glenn has said once he gets back down to earth, he'll work to steer young people toward public service. I can't think of a greater honor than to say I've served alongside these two men and shared their vision of a better America. 
I also want to thank my two retiring colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We may not have always agreed on which road to take, but I believe we always shared a deep commitment to our country and its betterment. Whether you agree or not with Senator Coats' position on the issues, everyone in this chamber will agree he's willing to roll up his sleeves and do the hard work necessary to accomplish his goals. He's brought the same tenacity to the Senate that found him at three percent in the polls when he began his first congressional bid and had him winning by 58 percent on election day. He got that win the old-fashioned way, organizing block by block and pressing his case one-on-one. 
Senator Kempthorne has only been a part of this institution for just one term, but he has already proven that he can work with his colleagues to pass laws, like the unfunded mandates bill, in a place where it's often easier to move mountains than a piece of legislation. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996 was a perfect example of his ability to bring together scientists, activists on both sides of the issue, and public health experts to craft legislation that each one had a stake in seeing succeed. So while he may have spent just a short while in these Halls, he demonstrated that it is only through compromise that we can achieve solutions in the best interest of the nation. 
So Mr. President, let me tell my fellow retirees what a privilege it has been to serve with you over the years and how grateful I am for your commitment to public service and the American people.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to make a few brief remarks, share a few thoughts, and express my heart felt thanks to a number of individuals who have made my life in the Senate a little bit easier and a little bit more enjoyable than it otherwise would have been. 
I have been privileged to serve in this body since December 28, 1974. As I look back, it is amazing how much progress we have made as a country during that period. The average life expectancy in this country has increased by 4 years. The average per capita income after adjusting for inflation, has risen 40 percent during this time period. The portion of adults with at least a high school diploma has risen from about two-thirds of adults to more than four-fifths. The percentage of adults with at least a bachelor's degree has risen from 14 percent to 25 percent. 
So we are living longer and healthier lives, we are wealthier, and we are better educated. 
And the quality of life has improved in many other ways as well. We have an almost unlimited ability to communicate. The developments with computers in recent years have been almost breathtaking. Children understand computers at an early age--often before they even start school. The percentage of homes with computers keeps rising. We have cell phones and laptops and cable TV and satellite dishes and fax machines. Our access to information is better and faster than ever. 
We have opportunities to travel more, live in bigger homes, and eat more nutritious meals. We spend more on entertainment than ever. 
But Mr. President, our challenges are probably greater than ever. 
I entered the Senate at the beginning of a period of deep cynicism and distrust of government, having just come through the Vietnam war and Watergate. We have always had a very healthy distrust of government in this country, but 1974 was an especially troublesome time. And I have witnessed a fascinating national debate on the role of government during the period since. The cynicism from Watergate evolved into a crisis of confidence in our country, and a growing feeling by some through the 1980's that government was the major source of many problems in our society, not the solution. 
But the debate of the role of government has continued to evolve. I think we are at the point today where there is a fairly broad consensus among Americans about certain aspects of government. 
There is a consensus about certain things that Americans want from their government--a strong defense, the best educational system in the world, managing the economy in an efficient way, including balanced budgets, low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment, and the least amount of taxation and regulation possible. Americans want fair rules in the workplace and the marketplace, from family leave to fair trade to basic consumer protection. They want an adequate infrastructure to sustain a successful and growing economy. And they expect minimal safety and health protections, from law enforcement to food and drug safety to providing health care for the elderly and the poor. 
I have found that almost all of my colleagues want these things as well. We often differ on the best approach, or the best philosophy, for meeting these goals and providing what our constituents want, but we are all basically after the same things. 
Some of my colleagues on the other side of aisle still use the rhetoric from the 1980's about being for lower taxes and smaller government. Who could be against that? But most of these same colleagues are also for all of the things I just mentioned. They would agree with me that these are all things that our constituents demand and expect us to address. We all want the smallest government possible, but we want government to deliver on all of these things. So it is a challenge for all of us. 
And the future challenges for the next Congress and beyond will be even more complex. I mentioned earlier that we are living longer. The standard retirement age has not gone up since I came to the Senate. In fact, the average private sector retirement age has gone down. But we live longer. The percentage of the population age 65 and older is up to about 13 percent today, and is projected to continue to grow. During my tenure in the Senate, I have seen federal spending on Social Security grow from $64 to $380 billion. I have seen Medicare spending increase from $13 to $220 billion. And roughly half of Medicaid spending, which has gone from $7 to $100 billion in the budget, is attributable to nursing home care. These three areas alone--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--have gone from about 25 percent of the total budget to roughly 42 percent of the total budget. Without question, the major budget issue in the next few years is how we deal with the costs associated with the elderly. 
And it is a quality issue as well. Many of the same trends which are currently affecting managed care in the private sector will certainly affect the quality of medical care received by the elderly. I wish we had made more progress in these areas before my time in the Senate expired. I wish my colleagues well in addressing these issues and urge them to do so earlier rather than later. I know many colleagues share my sentiments. 
The other area I would urge my colleagues to address is the financing and operation of campaigns. Here is an area that has changed dramatically during my 24 years. When I announced my retirement from the Senate, I mentioned the two `M's,'--Money and Meanness--as major reasons why I chose not to run again. Now that we are in the midst of the current campaign season, I believe even stronger about this issue. As reported in the newspaper yesterday, PACs have collected almost $360 million in the last 18 months. We all like to say that the money does not influence how we vote and how we think, but, truthfully, it is a matter of degree. There needs to be a stronger ethic of avoiding even the appearance of a conflict of interest. We need more of that in politics--much more of it. Senators who solicit campaign contributions and then within a very short period of time are casting votes and making decisions on matters which greatly affect both the contributors and the Senator's constituents place themselves in very difficult situations. It goes to the heart of our system of Democracy, and whether it works or will continue to work. There has got to be a better way. There are also a lot of ideas around here on how to make a better way. I can only hope some of these ideas are translated into law in the very near future. 
So, Mr. President, I wish may colleagues well. I will miss the institution dearly. I will miss the daily interaction with my colleagues, many of whom have become such dear friends to me. Let me thank you for your friendship. And lastly, let me thank staff. My personal office staff, both here and in the state offices, have been like family to me. I have tried to treat them that way, and it has been mutual. The committee staff and floor staff I have been privileged to work with over the years have all been great to me as well--they make this place run and make us all look good from time to time. I thank them all for their support and service to our country. This country would not be nearly what it is without office, committee and floor staff. As I leave the Senate, please know that I will keep you all in my thoughts and prayers, and wish all of you good luck and happiness in the years to come. 
Mr. President, for perhaps the last time, I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank my distinguished friend from Montana for his kind remarks. I understand Montana a little bit. My mother's brother married a lady from Montana and she persuaded him to move there. So I have been to Montana on many occasions and have enjoyed the friendship, the rugged mountains, the pristine areas and the big blue sky. I have enjoyed it very much--and the trout are not bad when you catch them and have a shore dinner. I understand Montana and I can understand why you love it. I can understand why anything we might copy from you would make our State a little bit better. 
I say to my friend from Montana, I thank him for his kind remarks. I thank him for his friendship. I thank him for his ability to sit down and talk things through where we might move forward and help the country and talk about those things we couldn't agree upon at a later date. I thank him for his friendship.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, a few moments ago the distinguished assistant Republican leader was on the floor chastising the President, chastising Democrats, chastising people that were trying to be helpful or influential, and I heard him say more than once, `Get on with our business.' 
Mr. President, this is October 10th and the budget for next year should have been completed April 15 of this year. April, May, June, July, August, September, October--we still don't have a budget. We are running on last year's budget. Somehow or another, this train hasn't been running as efficiently and as effectively as some think it should. 
If you haven't had a budget, it makes it difficult to set the levels for next year's spending. We are already into the next fiscal year by 10 days and we only had one appropriations bill on the President's desk. 
The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma says let's get on with our business; then he says that the President should not be involved in negotiations. Mr. President, I have been around here 24 years. I have never gone through any negotiations involved with the White House that they didn't call me. I have gone to the White House to talk with President Reagan; I have gone to the White House to talk with President Bush in order to try to find a way to be helpful, and they were trying to find a way to persuade me to be helpful. I don't see anything wrong with that. And I don't believe the President wants to veto bills. That is one reason that everybody agreed to the group--if that is a good term, or the Members of the group--so they might be able to work out bills that can be signed. I don't see anything wrong with the administration playing a part in what they believe is the proper course. 
We talk about a budget. Going back to 1993, there wasn't a Republican that voted for President Clinton's budget at that time. I wonder how those now who are saying we have a great surplus can be breaking their arm patting themselves on the back for that great vote that they didn't cast in 1993. 
The President has every right to be part of the negotiations. I wanted to say to my colleague who had to leave, what is wrong with wanting more for education? What is wrong with wanting to improve our school system? What is wrong with having smaller classes? What is wrong with having more teachers? I don't see anything wrong. 
What is wrong with seeing that every child that leaves the third grade can read? What is wrong with that? The 21st century will be full of technology and we have to have educated children. So what is wrong with trying to improve education in this country? Public education teaches 90 percent of all of our children. It has to be the best educational system we can give them. We need to be able to improve education all across this country. 
How in the world can the Senator from Oklahoma say that the Federal Government will appoint their teachers? We give money to the States. The States, then, make the selection. The States, then, set the criteria. The States, then, have the vacancy. The States do that. I have never known a Federal Government to hire a teacher in my State. I have been Governor. I understand writing a budget. I understand what we do. I still understand it. But I don't believe the Federal Education Department hires teachers in my State or any State. So we are not telling them who to hire and who not to hire. 
That is just a straw man, or whatever, to try to say we don't want Big Brother involved. We sure want Big Brother's money, we sure want Big Brother to pay it, but we don't want them to have anything to do with any kind of guidelines. 
So, when we come out on the floor and chastise the President and the administration for wanting to work out pieces of legislation, you talk to the farmers in the Midwest, talk to farmers in my State; they have had a tough several years. Sure, it may have been less a year ago than it is now and times have changed. We have had a bad summer. We have had real problems. So why not help our farmers? 
So, Mr. President, I suggest to those who want to come to the floor and have press conferences saying that the administration ought to stay out of our business and we will pass the legislation, well, where is it? Where is the legislation? What have we passed? The Patients' Bill of Rights? No; that was killed yesterday. Education? No. Where are the bills they were supposed to pass? `Let us get on with our business,' the Senator from Oklahoma said. Well, let's get on with our business. 
Here we are on Saturday, and we are lucky we are not in on Sunday afternoon. We will be here Monday. That is a holiday. They set a sine die date of October 9, and we don't even have the appropriations bills done. So let's not be too harsh on the administration for wanting to try to get it done. 
I regret that I am here. I wish all 13 appropriations bills had been on the President's desk and signed before October 1, which begins the fiscal year. I remember how hard Senator Robert Byrd, when he was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, worked to be sure that all 13 of the appropriations bills were on the President's desk by September 30. And they were. That is what we are supposed to do. Those are the rules. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that over the weekend we can find some way that those who are responsible for the appropriations bills can bring them together, that they will find a way that we can say we have worked together, that we have used Henry Clay's advice and we have compromised. Henry Clay said, `Compromise is negotiated hurt.' Negotiated hurt. Clay said, `You have to give up something and it hurts, and I have to give up something and it hurts. Once we agree, then I am willing to sign a social contract.' 
Clay was saying he was willing to support legislation to move the country forward and on another day we will argue the things we had to give up. So that is what we are all about here --the Henry Clay era of compromise, and the ability to sign a social contract and move forward in the best interest of this country. I hope that we can see the light at the end of the tunnel by the end of the week. I hope to be here to cast a vote in favor of a compromise and agreement that will make this country a better country. It is my last one, Mr. President. I would like to see as good a piece of legislation in all areas passed, so that when we look back on this session, we will have said we did a good job. 
I yield the floor.

I really do not know how to respond to it, except to thank my staff. We claim to do a lot of things around here. And if we did not have loyal, faithful, hard-working, dedicated, intelligent staff, not only in our offices but here on the floor, we would not get accomplished near as much as we do.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, all across America, people from every walk of life carry a vision in their heads and in their hearts of the perfect community--of the kind of place where they can raise their children and their children can in turn raise their children. 
There's no doubt that everyone's picture would look different, based on our own experience. But I feel certain they would have many elements in common. We want safe neighborhoods. We want to be economically secure. And we want to keep our families healthy. These are the building blocks of a liveable community, and the City of Louisville has played an important role in helping to put them into place, serving as a model for inner-city revitalization. 
The city has rehabilitated and built hundreds of housing units, they've created new jobs and businesses, and more families are building stable, productive lives. East Russell, an inner-city Louisville Neighborhood, has seized the nation's attention by creating a renaissance in that part of the city, bringing it new life and vitality. Rightfully so, this revitalization project has received attention by mayors and elected officials all over the United States. 
The University of Louisville's Sustainable Urban Neighborhoods (SUN) is devoted to making inner city neighborhoods healthy and safe places to live. The project is located at the Center for Urban and Economic Research at the University of Louisville. One of the biggest accomplishments of this project has been building affordable houses for residents with a strong cooperative effort by the entire staff, including the University of Louisville, CityBank, and Telesis, along with many community organizations. 
Mr. President, the SUN staff--including its Director, Dr. John Gilderbloom and students from the University of Louisville --and SUN community partners have already done so much to strengthen our inner city communities and boost the hopes and spirits of the people living there. 
I would ask that my colleagues join me today in commending their work to make our cities `dream places' to live and for their continued commitment to the greater community. And as they host their conference the week of October 15th through the 17th, we wish them the best of luck in their continued efforts.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Fort Campbell Tax Fairness Act. This legislation is designed to restore some sense of balance and maintain some level of fairness in the taxation of individuals who work at the Fort Campbell military installation in Kentucky and Tennessee. 
My colleagues may recall that earlier this month, an unprecedented provision was included in the Defense Authorization bill which granted special tax status for a single site--Fort Campbell--to Tennessee residents who work on the Kentucky side of the border. Even worse, the provision in the Defense bill preempted State tax law. It preempted the ability of my State to administer its own tax laws in a fair manner, and in a way in which the State determined was fairest and best. 
The provision adopted in the Defense bill exempts Tennessee residents who work in Kentucky at Fort Campbell from paying Kentucky state income taxes. This special exemption was snuck into the House version of the bill, and then maintained in the conference committee. It is extremely unfair. 
Mr. President, the Congress has no business dictating to States how they should administer their own tax laws. This is a matter for the States to determine by themselves. The basic principle of taxation is that income is taxed at the location where it is produced. There are exceptions to this rule, but generally they are worked out among and between States themselves. The only other exceptions of which I am aware relate to federal employees with a unique interstate aspect to their jobs, like members of the military or Members of Congress, or other employees with a special interstate job situation, like Amtrak employees or those involved in constructing interstate highways. 
I have never heard of a special State tax exemption for private sector employees at a single site. That is, I had never heard of it until I saw this year's Defense Authorization bill. 
But Mr. President, the provision in the Defense Authorization bill is a one way street. It preempts Kentucky state law for Tennessee residents who would otherwise be taxed within Kentucky's borders. But there is no comparable preemption of Tennessee state law for Kentucky residents who are taxed at Fort Campbell within Tennessee's borders. 
As a matter of basic fairness, if Tennessee residents are to be granted a special tax exemption while on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell, Kentucky residents should be given equal consideration while on the Tennessee side of Fort Campbell. In addition, it is currently the case that unemployment compensation for any Tennessee residents who work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell are paid out of Kentucky tax dollars. This should no longer be the case now that Tennessee workers are being given a special tax status and are exempt from Kentucky laws. 
My legislation attempts to correct these new inequities created by the passage of this year's Defense Authorization bill. First, it would direct that Tennessee sales taxes imposed on the Tennessee side of Fort Campbell apply only to Tennessee residents. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee, in debate on the Defense Authorization bill, asserted that no such taxes are currently collected at Fort Campbell. Therefore, he should have no objection to this provision whatsoever. However, I have been informed that Tennessee sales taxes are in fact collected from private business operations within the Fort Campbell boundaries. So this provision is badly needed as a matter of fairness. 
Second, the legislation clearly states that the Commonwealth of Kentucky has absolutely no obligation to continue paying the unemployment benefits of Tennessee residents out of Kentucky tax dollars. Since Tennessee residents have been given this special tax status and preemption of State laws, Kentucky should no longer have any liabilities should these workers become unemployed. Those claims should be the responsibility of the State of Tennessee. 
Mr. President, I have always attempted to fiercely defend the interests of my State during my 24 years in the Senate. The special tax preemption provision tucked into the Defense Authorization bill was one of the most unfair provisions imaginable, singling out my State for unfair treatment. I realize the time is short in the current session, and the odds of enacting this legislation are not great in the days ahead. However, I am introducing this bill to go on the Record in advocating fairness for my State. It is my hope that when the Congress reconvenes vigorously pursue efforts to pass this legislation and correct an unfairness which has been imposed upon my State.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute from the time remaining of the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers. 
Mr. President, we have talked about catalog sales and the loss of funds. Yesterday, on the DOD authorization bill, we usurped States in their ability to tax, and now we are turning that around. Yesterday, we told the States that we are going to usurp a tax if we don't think it is fair locally or statewide. The residents of Tennessee who work in Kentucky at a Federal installation, who have been paying taxes--and the States have worked it out--were excluded yesterday. And then my residents in Kentucky are paying the Tennessee sales tax, and they were not exempt because Tennessee goes on a high sales tax and no income tax. So, yesterday we said to State and local governments that you can't tax. 
There are 240 installations around the country. I think you will rue the day that you usurped the Buck Act and you said to the States that we are Big Brother and we will tell you how to tax. Now we have a catalog question before us that says we ought to get the tax. So we have to be very careful what we are doing. Yesterday was a bad day, not necessarily for Kentucky, but for others. Oregon had the same problem with Washington. They passed a law and worked it out and everything is fine. That is what we ought to do between States. This was not a Federal tax. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I regret that I am here this morning making my remarks, because in this piece of legislation we have preempted the States and their ability to tax. Under the Buck Act, it gave that responsibility to the States. But in here we are preempting the States. 
The Presiding Officer understands the problem between Oregon and Washington. But Oregon has passed a law that exempts residents of Washington. So, therefore, the States have worked out their problem. Here, the Federal Government, Big Brother, has to tell the States what they can do. I think it is highly unfair. I think it is unprecedented where the Armed Services Committee has gone around the Finance Committee. 
Senators can't come to this floor and say that the chairman of the Finance Committee says this section is all right. It has to go before the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is the committee of jurisdiction here--not the Armed Services Committee. 
The occupant of the Chair is one of the finest jurists in the Senate, having been, I believe, Attorney General of his State. 
The law says: 
No person shall be relieved from his liability for any income tax levied by any State, or by any duly constitutional taxing authority therein having jurisdiction to levy such a tax by reason of his residing within a Federal area, or receiving income from transactions occurring or services performed in such areas, and such State, or taxing authority, shall have full jurisdiction and power to levy and collect such tax in any Federal area within such State to the same extent and with the same effect as though such area was not a Federal area. 
That is the Buck Act. 
The Armed Services Committee has altered or broken that statutory provision. They preempted the States. They went around the Finance Committee. Now they are altering the Buck Act. 
As I said, Mr. President, this is regrettable, for me to think that my colleagues would have such a sweetheart deal that when the State of Kentucky and the State of Tennessee were in the process of negotiation and working out their problems, they were told it would be worked out in Washington and not to worry about it; therefore, the negotiations were cut off, and the sweetheart deal was started. 
I want to call the attention of my colleagues to the provision in the defense authorization bill which I consider to be one of the most misplaced, misguided, and unfair proposals I have seen in my 24 years in the Senate. I am referring to a tax proposal in this defense authorization bill which preempts the State of Kentucky from administering its own tax laws. 
Let me repeat that. 
I am referring to a tax provision in the defense authorization bill. We are now establishing, Mr. President, the precedent that defense authorization bills can become vehicles for State tax provisions. 
The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over tax issues in the Senate. But the Finance Committee did not report this legislation. The Finance Committee did not report any other legislation with this tax proposal contained in this defense authorization bill. It is not even a Federal tax issue. This is not a Federal tax issue. This is a tax provision in this bill which dictates to States how they administer State income tax laws. 
The Republican Party has always been States rights. That is one of their long suits. I have heard in campaigns all my life, `States rights.' 
And now in this bill you are preempting States rights. We are preempting my State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, from deciding for itself how to administer its own income tax laws on work performed within the State of Kentucky by private sector employees. It is an outrage that my colleagues who are conferees from the other side of the aisle agreed to include this provision in the final bill. 
Mr. President, Fort Campbell is a military facility which straddles the Kentucky-Tennessee border. It is located partially in Trigg County and Christian County in my State and partially in Tennessee. There are Federal employees working at Fort Campbell who reside in both Kentucky and Tennessee, and there are private sector employees working at Fort Campbell, some on a full-time basis, some on a contractual or part-time basis. 
How would you like to be sitting at the table having lunch, and the worker across the table from you, working for the same company, doing the same job as you, pays no tax, but you have to pay yours? 
For Kentucky employees, there is no exemption from the sales tax in Tennessee. That will be the next bill that will be in the Chamber, and I am going to encourage my colleagues to do that so all you have to do is show your driver's license and where your residence is and you are exempt from Tennessee sales tax, which is one of the highest in the Nation. 
According to groups such as the Federation of Tax Administrators, which is an organization comprised of the top revenue officials from all 50 States and the District of Columbia, it is a fundamental principle of taxation that workers are taxed where the work is performed. Workers are taxed where the work is performed. That is the basic rule. There are exceptions to the rule, of course, but the exceptions come from agreements negotiated between States--negotiated between States. States can agree to a variety of ways to treat income tax earned within one State's borders by out-of-State residents--States rights. And we recognized that a long time ago even in the Buck Act. 
But this is for the States to decide. Congress should keep its nose out of their business. But not this Congress, not this majority, and not this defense authorization bill. Do I want to be against the Strom Thurmond defense authorization bill? Of course, I do not. I do not want to be against the Wendell H. Ford aviation bill either. But what is in this bill is not right. 
That is my responsibility as a Senator, and I am surprised that my colleague on the other side, who is a major player with the Republican Party, did not defend his constituents rather than his party. We are losing $4 million a year. Not even the Congressman from the First District raised a peep about it. Who are you supposed to be representing up here in this body or in the other body? You are supposed to be representing your State and your constituency. 
A dispute arose when some Tennessee workers objected to paying income taxes on work performed within the borders of Kentucky. Legislation was introduced in the House to impose a Federal solution on the States. Hearings were held. The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on April 17th of last year on this issue. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held hearings on October 24 of last year. To my knowledge, the Senate Armed Services Committee held no hearings. The Senate Armed Services Committee held no hearings on this issue during either session of this Congress. The reason is obvious. Because the Armed Services Committee has absolutely no jurisdiction over this issue--none. The conferees for this defense authorization bill have no business attaching language which preempts State tax laws as part of this defense authorization bill. It has no place in this piece of legislation. 
Let's go back now to the House hearing of last April. What kind of testimony did that committee hear? It heard that the Kentucky tax structure met all appropriate constitutional standards for fairness and nondiscrimination. The committee was told that the ability of States to define their own tax structure within the bounds of the Constitution was `one of the core elements of sovereignty preserved to the States under the Constitution.' 
That committee was told that if Congress jumped in and preempted State laws in this case, `It will by definition create a preferred class of taxpayers that benefits at the expense of all other taxpayers. Currently, all workers, public and private, in Kentucky are subject to the same rules. This should not be disrupted by the Congress without a strong policy rationale.' 
The House committee was also told that the proposal to grant special status to Tennessee residents violated the spirit of the Unfunded Mandate Act of 1995. I wonder how many colleagues on the other side in 1995 voted for the unfunded mandate bill. Are you going to fund this unfunded mandate? No. It breaks that law. You are taking away by mandate funds that belong to my State. It is under the unfunded mandate law of 1995. 
Do you think this bill is not going to go to court? You can bet your sweet bippy that once the President signs it, if he does, this portion of the bill will be in court. It is wrong. It is wrong from the start; it is wrong from the middle; it is wrong from the end. 
The House committee was also told that if Congress believes that the impact of Federal workers employed on installations crossing the borders of two States should be offset, it should provide the funding necessary to offset the cost imposed on the States affected and not just preempt legitimate taxing authorities. This is what the committee was told, but the committee didn't pay any attention to that--it is our way or nothing. What Kentucky is getting is nothing. I am not going to allow this bill to go forward without having an opportunity, which I am doing now, to express to my colleagues my outrage and what their outrage should be. Pretty soon, I will tell you, 240 installations that are subject to the same law--subject to the same law, 240 in this country--will want the same. 
So what are you going to look forward to next year? Are you going to preempt all these States? Be fair. Be fair. 
So, let me repeat one section of that sentence that the committee in the House was told:  
. . . if Congress feels the impact of federal workers employed on installations crossing the border of two states . . . should be offset, it should provide the funding necessary to offset the costs imposed on the states affected and not just preempt legitimate taxing authority. 
Mr. President, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee heard similar testimony during its hearing last August. The Senate Armed Services Committee, however, heard no such testimony because it held no such hearings and has no jurisdiction over this issue. Nevertheless, without any floor debate, a provision was snuck into the House version of the defense authorization bill on the House floor. Where was my Congressman from the First District when that happened to his employees and to his State? I do not know where my House colleagues from Kentucky were on this issue when this issue arose. Maybe they did not notice. Maybe they were just asleep at the switch. But either way, not a finger was lifted by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop it. 
Let me explain to my colleagues why this provision is so offensive. The provision preempts the State of Kentucky from applying its own tax laws to Federal workers at Fort Campbell. But it does not stop there, it is broader. It also exempts private sector employees, such as contractors, who perform work at Fort Campbell. Private contractors are exempt. This goes well beyond any precedent which exists anywhere else in Federal law. 
What it means is that when two contractors bid on work to be performed on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell, a Tennessee contractor is going to have a built-in advantage over a Kentucky contractor because of the special exemption written into this defense authorization bill. Can you imagine what other Senators would be doing this morning if this had happened to them? Maybe, with this precedent, it will. Why don't we try to prevent it? 
The House language is overly broad and, in my opinion, extremely unfair. No such language is included in the Senate version of the bill. However, I was very concerned about the attempt to sneak this in. I informed my colleagues on the committee of my strong concerns with this tax proposal on June 25th, when the bill was debated on the floor. 
I should say at this point that the ranking member of the committee, the Senator from Michigan, acknowledged that tax issues had no place in a defense authorization bill, he shared my concern about the broad and misguided precedent set by this proposal to preempt State tax laws, and he fought to keep it out of the final bill. However, apparently among my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, this was a done deal. I do not believe the issue was even a matter of serious discussion by the Republican conferees. So here we are on the Senate floor with a sweetheart deal being cut on a tax provision which preempts State law. I thought I had seen it all.

Mr. FORD. The State preemption provision in this bill is also strongly opposed by the Federation of Tax Administrators. Let me read from a June 24, 1998 letter from Mr. Harley T. Duncan, the executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators: 
I am writing concerning amendments to the defense appropriations bills (S. 2057) which would preempt Oregon, Kentucky and Nebraska from applying their income tax to certain federal employees (and in some cases, contractors) who work in those states, but reside in bordering states with no income taxes. . . . 
These amendments have been separately considered earlier in the 105th Congress as H.R. 1953. The Federation of Tax Administrators is an association of the principal tax administration agencies in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and New York City. The Federation has adopted a policy which urges that the Senate reject H.R. 1953 and any similar language which may be offered as an amendment to other bills. 
We ask the Senate to recognize that, throughout the history of income taxation, both federal and state, workers are taxed by the jurisdiction where the work is performed. This system represents the keystone of taxation. State lawmakers make exceptions to this system to address individual circumstances where strict adherence to the principle leads to undesirable results. In particular, in those instances where sound fiscal and government policy permit, a State may enter into a reciprocal agreement with a bordering State to permit taxpayers to file a single return in the state of residency. Kentucky is at the forefront of such policy refinements. 
They are complimenting my State for being in the forefront of these policy refinements. --it has a reciprocal agreement with every border state that has a broad-based individual income tax.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the National Conference of State Legislatures also strongly oppose the State tax preemption provided in the defense authorization bill. Let me read from an August 7, 1998, letter to the conferees. This was written to the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond. `Federal preemption of legitimate State taxing authority.' The National Conference of State Legislatures wrote to the chairman and said this is wrong: 
On behalf of the National Conference of State Legislatures, I am writing in opposition to Section 1045 of the House version of the National Defense Authorization bill (H.R. 3616). NCSL opposes federal action that preempts the states' constitutional authority to tax income earned within their borders . . . We urge you to preserve the States' sovereignty--

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, apparently all of these requests to the Republican conferees to keep this State preemption provision out of the defense bill fell on deaf ears. The conferees either did not listen or did not care. One way or another, this was a done deal, a sweetheart deal, a special tax provision which favors one set of workers over another for the same work performed, at the same location, despite State law. 
We are sitting at the same table. We are both working for the same employer. We are both doing the same job. We are both drawing the same pay, but you do not pay any taxes because you are a resident of Tennessee. I am a resident of Kentucky, and I pay my taxes. 
Mr. President, all of the requests to the Republican conferees to keep this State tax provision out of the defense bill fell on deaf ears. I wanted to repeat that. It is a special tax provision which favors one set of workers over another. It also gives the employers, or the companies, an advantage when they bid, because they don't have to pay the tax under this. 
As I said earlier, the next bill ought to be exempting Kentucky residents from the sales tax in Tennessee. Just show your driver's license and your address and place of employment, and you don't pay the taxes, one of the highest sales tax States in the Nation because their income comes from the sales tax. 
I hope my colleagues understand the precedent that is being set here. We are preempting State law--preempting State law--and establishing a special tax status for a group of not just Federal employees, but private sector workers who perform their work entirely within one State's borders. It is a very broad precedent. There is no stated policy rationale for this special preemption and special tax status we are granting. It is a precedent that will haunt my colleagues. 
I want my colleagues to understand how many other Federal facilities are in similar situations. When the workers at these facilities, not just the Federal workers, but the private sector workers as well, when these workers find out about the sweetheart deal at Fort Campbell, they are going to be asking their Senators, `Why can't we get a good deal as well?' 
I have asked the Federal Tax Administrators just how many other Federal facilities are similarly situated. We have a preliminary list, but it is only preliminary. It probably does not include everything. The partial list we have shows there are 240 Federal facilities around the country that are on or near the borders of two or more States with significantly different income tax structures. 
We talk about how hard it was to work out this bill, how many issues came before the committee. In the future, if this is the precedent that is being set, the Armed Services Committee will be in the tax business; they will be in the finance business; they will be preempting State laws 
and will not be looking after the right thing they should be doing, and that is the defense of this great country of ours. 
I want to share this with my colleagues because more than 20 other States are affected. I think about 20 other States. That is 40 Senators--pretty good bunch of Senators. In other words, Senators from at least 20 other States are in jeopardy of having to face this same issue. 
What have you done to the future of the military bill, the defense authorization bill? What have you done to it? You have turned it into a finance bill, not a defense bill. And I say to my colleagues, if they are from one of these States, you might be standing up here next year. Once the private sector employees find out about the special tax preemption, they may be lobbying their Senators next year to exempt them from the State tax laws in your State. 
Let me read a list, and this is only a partial list: Arkansas has 7 installations. Arizona has 7. California has 50--50 installations similar to the one in Kentucky. Think about that when the two Senators from California will have to say--it goes all the way from military facilities, such as Fort Irwin Naval Weapons Center, Sierra Army Depot, the Grand Mesa National Forest. 
Connecticut has 2. Georgia has 1. Maine has 1. Oh, I remember the argument here between Maine and New Hampshire. They are left out of this bill. They are left out of this bill because both of them apparently are on the other side. I was for Maine. 
Massachusetts has 1. Mississippi has 8. Mississippi is probably the most vulnerable State of all of them because of their border situation. Can you imagine what would happen if all of these employees went to the two Senators in Mississippi and said, `Right across the line here in Tennessee they receive tax exemptions. What about us? What about us? What's fair for the goose is fair for the gander.' 
Missouri has 6. Montana has 10. They are not in this bill. Nebraska has 1. New Jersey has 20--New Jersey has 20. New Mexico has 6. New York has only 1. I was surprised at that. But North Carolina has 13--North Carolina has 13. Oregon has 20. Pennsylvania has 1. I heard a lot about the Philadelphia Naval Yard last year. 
South Carolina has 1. South Dakota has 3. Tennessee has 3. Utah has 37. Think about that. Utah has 37 installations similar to the situation in this bill. 
What about those employees--Federal employees, private sector employees--who were not exempt? Can you imagine what the two Senators from Utah are going to face when they understand that other States were preempted and created a special tax group? 
Vermont has 2. The State of Washington has 37. 
What about the Indian reservations? Oh, we get into a good one there--Indian reservations. What about State workers at Indian casinos located on tribal lands? I do not understand. Why, the little leak in the dike here is beginning to take away the whole dike; and it could.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I also want to make clear to my colleagues that this special tax preemption provision in the bill is a clear violation of the spirit of the Unfunded Mandates Act. I have said that before, but I want to make it clear. This provision will cost my State $4 million in lost revenue. What are we doing to offset the loss from the special tax preemption provision in this bill? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not a thing. 
Mr. President, if this special provision had been offered on the Senate floor, I would have offered a second-degree amendment requiring us to at least study the broad scope of the precedent we were setting here before we acted. I am not sure a great deal of thought has been given to the far-reaching effect of this one little amendment in the defense authorization bill. It was a special political decision, and that special political decision will have ripples that will turn into waves in the future. 
Mr. President, had this special provision been offered on the Senate floor, I would have asked for a study. Let's think through this one. We are preempting the States; we are telling the States how they can tax and how they cannot tax. This is not a Federal tax. This is a State tax. 
I think my colleagues would have been shocked at how broad this precedent is by applying this sweetheart deal at Federal facilities across the country. They would be embarrassed to find out the extent to which we are meddling in State tax law matters on a defense authorization bill--all to create a special State tax status for a select group of Federal and private sector workers. I think my colleagues would want to know this information.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the proponents of this special deal suggest that Tennessee employees receive no services from the State of Kentucky and, therefore, should be entitled to their special exemption. Mr. President, this is simply not the case. Let me read from a July 11, 1997, letter from the Kentucky Revenue Cabinet outlining the services the State of Kentucky provides to those workers. 
Again, I remind my colleagues that these are Federal and private sector workers who perform their work within the borders of the State of Kentucky. 
Roads--Fort Campbell is accessible from both the Kentucky side and the Tennessee side. Most workers enter the base at the gate nearest their work station. This means, for example, that most hospital workers enter on the Tennessee side . . . and most school workers enter on the Kentucky side using Kentucky maintained roads (the school is in Kentucky). 
Water and sewer services-- . . . 
Electrical service--Most is supplied directly to the base by the Tennessee Valley Authority. One housing area, however, is supplied by the Pennyrile Electric Cooperative, a Kentucky-based electric company. 
Cooperative Fire Protection [is there]. . . . 
Schools--The school system on the Fort Campbell base is fully self-contained and federally funded. It is limited [however] to the children of active duty military personnel . . . 
Police Protection--. . . . 
Unemployment Benefits--. . . . 
Mr. President, we talk about exempting the Tennessee employees from paying Kentucky tax, but the Federal civilian workers who become unemployed can apply for benefits from the State where they work or the State where they live. If a Tennessee resident working in Kentucky becomes unemployed and applies in Tennessee, a transfer is made from the Kentucky fund to the Tennessee fund to pay that worker's unemployment claim. 
What is wrong with that agreement? I don't think anything. The result is that wherever the claim is filed, Kentucky funds pay the claim.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, had this conference report been on a Senate bill, I would have offered a motion to recommit the bill to conference to strip this special State tax preemption provision from the bill. It is quite unfair, and I think everybody understands that. 
They are doing a political favor, because the Senators who represent that State are from another party. I do not understand why my colleague, who is a member of that party, would allow this to happen to his State. I thought we were here representing our constituents, not our party. I think it is disappointing that both my colleagues here in the Senate and the Congressman from the First District in my State allowed this to happen without at least raising their voice in objection. 
However, I understand the option is no longer mine to offer any kind of amendment or any kind of motion to recommit. Since this is a House bill and it has already been approved by the House, thereby dissolving the conference, I understand the rules. I think I know the rules reasonably well here--not quite as well as Senator Byrd or, hopefully, the Parliamentarian, but I have no illusions about what the outcome of that vote might have been. After all, a sweetheart deal is a sweetheart deal. 
I did want to draw attention to this provision. It is patently unfair. It has no place in this bill. The committees that put this bill together have no jurisdiction over the issue whatever. I think it is a dark mark on this piece of legislation as it relates to States rights, going outside the jurisdiction of the committee. I think it leaves a black mark and a black cloud over this piece of legislation. This special tax preemption provision is terrible policy. We should not be dictating to States how to administer their own tax laws. We should not be imposing our will on the States in matters that have nothing to do with the Federal law and are traditionally and constitutionally left to the States to resolve. 
We hear a lot of rhetoric from the other side of the aisle that is never matched by the actions we see around this place. They say `lower taxes,' but fail to say how they will offset them without causing more deficits. They say `less government,' without saying where they will cut. They say `no more unfunded mandates,' but continue to impose unfunded mandates on the States. And this is, in the strictest interpretation, an unfunded mandate. They say `States rights,' but continue to pass special proposals like this one, which preempt State law, even in the areas that have been left to the States for the last 200 years. 
Once again, Mr. President, we see that the rhetoric does not match the reality. When my friends on the other side see that expanding the role of Federal law fits their purposes, the rhetoric about States rights goes out the window. When they create a special tax exemption by imposing a $4 million cost onto another State, the unfunded mandates rhetoric goes out the window. 
Mr. President, I am very disappointed we have seen this issue, the preemption of State tax law, legislated this way on a defense authorization bill. It is bitterly opposed by my State and it ought to be bitterly opposed by every other Senator on this floor. 
I say to my colleagues, you have created a broad precedent here that I believe will come back to haunt you. I will not be here on the floor to see it play out but I can see it coming. The next time, it won't be Kentucky that will be hit. It very well may be the State of one of the Members who sat on the conference. 
How much time remains?

Mr. FORD. Since I objected, I will use some of my time. 
I was hoping that the proposer of this amendment would be here on the floor so we could discuss it a little bit more. I have been here, now, for about 30 minutes--I guess, a little better--trying to discuss my side, and I don't want to lose my time on the basis that the opposition or the proponent is not here. I am more than willing to let the time come off of the time of the managers of the bill but I prefer the time not come off of mine. If the chairman of the committee and the manager of the bill would like to do that, I would have no objection. If he prefers not to do that, I hope he will encourage the Senators from Tennessee to come to the floor. 
The only problem I have here before I suggest a quorum is, I would not want to be preempted from taking the quorum off--which I could--and then we would have to go through the process. Would the Senator give me the assurance he would not object if I want to take the quorum off?

Mr. FORD. I am delighted that the distinguished Senator from Tennessee would come to the floor to explain his reasons for using the Armed Services legislation in an authorization bill for a tax provision. 
One of the things my distinguished friend said is that Kentucky provides no facilities. Well, if a person who is employed at Fort Campbell files for unemployment benefits in Tennessee, guess who pays for it. Guess who pays for it. Kentucky reimburses Tennessee. Isn't that a service? 
I heard talk about other States. Let's talk about our States--the roads that enter at the nearest gate. Sure, we have electrical service that is provided. That comes out of Kentucky into Fort Campbell. We have cooperative fire suppression. If they say it is serious, both Tennessee and Kentucky would be there. 
Unemployment benefits--I am surprised the Senator would say that we don't pay anything. We reimburse Tennessee for the unemployment. Kentucky pays. He raised the fact that the Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on this but the Finance Committee did not. When did the Governmental Affairs Committee take over for the Finance Committee? 
The Senator has talked about Oregon quite a bit. I have a copy of a letter to the Senator, written from the director of the Department of Revenue, saying that they settled their own problem, that Oregon passed their bill and the States worked it out. There is no need for them to be included in this legislation. Here is the letter, dated October 21, 1997. The Senator had it almost a year, but yet they put Oregon and Washington in this legislation and they don't need it. The States have worked it out themselves.

Mr. FORD. The Senator says that this only applies to two States really, or very few. But the precedent here is the dangerous thing. We start under the Buck Act, and I am sure the Senator, being a legal expert, is fully familiar with the Buck Act and what it says about the State's ability to tax its own. Now, if he is not familiar with that, I can help him a little bit in trying to explain the Buck Act. 
But the two States were in the process of negotiating when they were informed, or at least the Tennessee side was informed, that it would be taken care of here. And it was being taken care of, so the negotiations were called off. 
I remember when Tennessee called a special session to prevent Kentucky contractors from doing business in Tennessee. This is a long-term thing. It is just not the first one. I go back into the early 1960s when this occurred. 
So, Mr. President, I understand what the Senator is trying to do, but I wonder how he voted on the unfunded mandates bill. You are eliminating $4 million a year--$4 million a year--from Kentucky's income. Are Kentuckians excused from the high Tennessee sales tax? Why not? Why wasn't that put in this bill? If you are going to be exempt from our income tax, why don't you exempt Kentuckians, who are identical employees with an identical employer? What about the restaurants and the canteens and the cleaners and such that are going to be exempt under this, the private sector? This is a broad, broad piece of legislation. Broad, broad. 
Let me read the Buck Act. Of course, we have the authority, I guess, to do that, but is it right? There are 240 known installations similar to this situation. And Mississippi is one of the most vulnerable States in the country as it relates to this type of legislation. 
The Buck Act says: 
No person shall be relieved from his liability for any income tax levied by any State, or by any duly constitutional taxing authority therein, having jurisdiction to levy such a tax by reason of his residing within a Federal area or receiving income from transactions occurring or services performed in such area. And such State or taxing authority shall have full jurisdiction and power to levy and collect such tax in any Federal area within such State to the same extent and with the same effect as though such area was not a Federal area. 
That is the Buck Act. 
My colleague lays out exempting military employees. When I served in World War II, we got exempted then. You only paid taxes in the State where you resided. That is nothing new. That is 55 years old, I guess--something near that. It has been here for 55 years. 
He talked about Amtrak employees. They are on a train, they are going across the country. Would they pay tax in every State? Of course not. That is common sense, to let them pay tax in the State where they reside. 
We have a lot of employees on the Interstate Highway System. They live in one State and they work in several States, as they construct interstate highways through various States. They are exempted. That is common sense. 
But, to take an exemption and cost a State $4 million--what kind of surplus does Tennessee have? He refers to the surplus of Kentucky. What kind of surplus does Tennessee have? That has nothing to do with the principle and the character of this provision under the armed services defense authorization bill. 
The Senator can argue all he wants to, but when he talks about in-State and out-of-State college, that individual renounced his Kentucky citizenship and moved to Tennessee. You enjoyed him moving over there. You probably welcomed him with open arms. But then you come in here and say he cannot get exemption in another State? Why didn't he go to Tennessee, if he likes it so much? We have a few universities there that are pretty good. They get State exemption, residential exemption. He just happened to want to go to a better school. So, you fuss about that. They moved to Tennessee. Anybody else from any other State would not be exempted. Tennessee would not exempt a Kentuckian residing in the State of Kentucky to go to a Tennessee school. That seems to me a pretty thin reason for having this section of the armed services bill. 
Mr. President, I go back to the point--I have heard many, many Senators in this body talk about States rights. There is a lot of rhetoric here. There is a difference between talk and action--talk and action. The talk is States rights. The action is taking it away. 
This bill is going to pass. There is no question about that. I have no illusions. I have counted votes around here longer than the Senator from Tennessee, and I understand what the vote will be. But you have something in the legislation that is not right, that is not fair, that the States were in the process of trying to work out and to negotiate. Then the word comes from Big Brother: `Don't you worry about it, we'll take care of it. Big Brother is going to preempt the States. Big Brother is going to take care of a few residents in this legislation.' There are other States that have already settled. The Senator from Tennessee has the letter setting it out and objecting to what he is trying to do here because they worked it out as a State. You preempt the States. 
What would happen if we were preempting Tennessee? Oh, it would be a bear in here. There would be growling and fighting and fuming and fussing over preempting Kentuckians in Tennessee. I hope my colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, will offer an amendment or something next year so Kentuckians who are in the same position will not have to pay the outrageous Tennessee sales tax. Just have a drivers license, show it, so we can be exempt. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's flattery, but in this case, it won't get him anywhere. 
Let me correct one thing, if I can. The Senator said we were exempt from sales tax. That is not true. We checked this morning. You pay tax at restaurants, dry cleaners--all that--you pay the sales tax on the base. On the base, you pay it. We called down there this morning. Now, if you want to call again, that is fine. I know where it is. I have been there. They have trooped out the troops for me. They jumped with parachutes and all that. It is obvious my name won't be on any building down there, however, but that is all right. I don't really worry about that. 
What I worry about is what is being done here and the precedent that is being set. They talk about they are all similar. The two other locations are dams. They are dams. They go across a river. They connect the States. That is a very small area. This is 105,000 acres that we are talking about here. This is a different facility, different situation, different problem altogether. One is a hydro; the other one is a dam. I say to my friend, in those two cases he is defending here, it is limited to Federal employees. In the Tennessee-Kentucky problem, it is not. You did not limit it to Federal employees. You went to private sector contractors and their employees. That is the reason the $4 million is there and there is no unfunded mandate help for my State. 
It is quite different. This is as broad as broad can be, with a capital B. It is not only Federal employees. The others are very small--35 employees. They are hydroelectric and dams, both of them. This is 105,000 acres. 
We pay sales tax, as Kentucky residents, on the base. You exempt private contractors and their employees, and it costs us plenty. People will say, `Ford, this is fair.' Fair to whom? I can bring the document--I don't have it here with me--but tuition was part of the negotiations. I wouldn't negotiate either if it was going to be settled here and you know what is going to happen. But the rights of the minority should be protected. I can't change the vote. Mine is the only one that I can handle, that I can guarantee, but we ought to be protected. 
I have seen a lot of debate here in a little over 24 years. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina has seen a lot more. But most of the time, almost without exception, both sides have wanted to protect the minority, and here there is no protection. 
Mr. President, as we are being stampeded here, I think it is highly unfair, it is uncalled for, and this is very one-sided. We pay the unemployment, reimburse Tennessee, we help with electricity, we help with roads--we do all those things. You act like we don't do anything. But if you have unemployment benefits and Kentucky pays a Tennessee resident and reimburses the State--Kentucky doesn't do anything. 
It is very difficult for me to understand when they start talking about precedents set here. That is for active duty military. They pay the tax, if any, in the State in which they are a resident. The Senator brought up Amtrak employees. You can get on a train in New York and wind up in California. Do you pay in each one of the States you go through? Of course not. That is just common sense. 
You can have a construction worker who is building interstate highways and can go through several States. You wouldn't expect him to pay tax in every State. So common sense says pay the tax in the State in which he is a resident. 
Here it is different. If you are a resident of Tennessee and work in Kentucky, you don't pay any tax. If you are a private sector employee and you are at a Federal facility, you don't pay any tax. The Tennessee contractor who would offer a bid at Fort Campbell has a sweetheart deal because a Kentucky contractor, or any other contractor, will have to pay the taxes, but Tennessee will not. 
Big Brother says we are going to settle State taxes, not Federal taxes, State taxes, and put it on the defense authorization bill. It has never been to the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction. 
And the testimony that was received in the House was something that I think we should go back to. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on October 24th of last year. The House held a hearing on April 17th of last year. To my knowledge, the Senate Armed Services Committee held no hearings on this issue in either session of this Congress. The reason is obvious: because the Armed Services Committee had absolutely no jurisdiction over this issue--none. 
The conferees on the defense authorization bill, in my judgment, have no business attaching language which preempts State tax as part of the defense authorization bill. 
Let's go back to the House hearing of last April. What kind of testimony did that committee hear? It heard that Kentucky's tax structure met all appropriate constitutional standards for fairness and nondiscrimination. That is the testimony. That committee was told that the ability of States to define their own tax structures within the bounds of the Constitution was `one of the core elements of sovereignty preserved to the States under the Constitution.' It may be constitutional, but it is `one of the core elements of sovereignty preserved to the States under the Constitution.' 
The committee was told that if Congress jumps in and preempts State laws in this case, `it will by definition create a preferred class of taxpayer * * *. Currently all workers--public and private--in Kentucky * * * are subject to the same rules. This should not be disrupted by the Congress without a strong policy [mandate].' 
The House committee was also told that the proposal to grant special status to Tennessee residents violated the spirit of the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995. The committee was told, `if Congress feels that the impact of federal workers employed on installations crossing the borders of two states * * * should be offset, it should provide the funding necessary to offset the costs imposed on the states affected and not just preempt legitimate taxing authority.' That is the testimony. That is what the committee was told. 
Mr. President, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee I believe heard similar testimony during the hearing last August. The Senate Armed Services Committee, however, heard no testimony--the Senate Armed Services Committee, however, heard no such testimony--because it held no such hearing and had no such jurisdiction over this piece of legislation. 
Nonetheless, without any floor debate, a provision was snuck into the House version of the defense authorization. So I ask where my Kentucky colleagues were.

Mr. FORD. Well, I understand why the Senator from Tennessee does not want to debate this; because he is wrong. I like him. He is a nice fellow, friendly. Oh, you could not ask anybody to be any friendlier than the Senator from Tennessee. And I have always enjoyed his acting. In fact, I have seen some reruns. I have enjoyed watching those a second and third time. 
I look for him. But that does not mean he is wrong or right all the time. But in this case he is wrong. 
And I wish this would not happen because, I say to my colleagues, when we start telling the States how to tax, when we take that authority away from the States, then we have gone a long way in disrupting what the Founding Fathers said this country should be made up of. 
So I will not leave this Senate without having made this statement. I understand where the votes are. I understand what is going to happen to this bill. But at some point, I believe, sincerely, that it will be in court. And the constitutionality of this and the preemption of States' ability--not a Federal tax but a State tax--they give a preferred class of taxpayer here. You have two people sitting across the table, having lunch, and both are working for the same company; both do the same job; both make the same money; but the fellow from Tennessee pays no tax; the fellow from Kentucky pays it on a military installation. 
There are 240 of these, at least, out there. And as I said, Mississippi is going to be one of the most vulnerable States. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Levin for his use, and I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. I may give back some. 
I rise to speak about the conference report to H.R. 6, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. I take this opportunity to commend my colleagues on the conference committee for the truly outstanding work they have done on behalf of our Nation's students and the higher education community. This legislation includes an important expansion of the Pell and work study programs, provides the lowest interest rates in 17 years for student borrowers, provides for loan forgiveness for teachers working in high poverty areas, and makes a continued commitment to improving our teacher preparation programs. 
I know that the passage of this bill will have a significant impact on students and colleges in my State. While I am pleased with many provisions in this bill, I am extremely disappointed that the conference committee did not include the text of the Wellstone amendment. This amendment allowed up to 24 months of postsecondary or vocational education, removed the 30-percent limitation on education as a work activity for teen parents, and clarified that participation in a Federal work study program is a permissible work activity. 
Instead, the conference report calls for a GAO study on this issue. I am personally aware of at least a half dozen studies--a half dozen studies--which already indicate that this is a problem for many low-income, single mothers. Why do you have to have a study to tell you that the more education you have the better job you can receive and the better the employer likes you? Instead of doing the right thing for these single mothers, trying to better themselves, our colleagues want to study the issue to death. What they ought to do is try living in the single mother's shoes for a day and see what it is to try to raise a family and attend school full time, while holding down a part-time job. 
As many of my colleagues know, I supported and voted for welfare reform. It has been almost 2 years since Congress rewrote our Federal welfare laws in the hopes of breaking the cycle of dependency that was trapping too many Americans in poverty and despair. Much good has come of that law, including substantial drops in the welfare rolls and saving States like Kentucky $14 million. But despite its good intentions, the new welfare law is penalizing parents, particularly single mothers trying to improve their chances at getting good jobs. 
Under the new law, a parent must work 20 hours to continue receiving aid. That might not seem particularly onerous, but the law also limits these single parents to just 1 year of education before requiring them to find work. As a result, too many promising, capable, nontraditional students are being forced out of postsecondary education due to the Federal restrictions. 
My State is not a wealthy State. There are many single mothers trapped in the cycle of poverty. Recently, the University of Kentucky released a study which demonstrated that higher education greatly increases a person's ability to earn a living. The study found that a parent living in rural Kentucky needs to earn at least $10.61 an hour working full time, or $19,708 a year, to support two children on a basic budget. The study found that only women with a college degree--and let me repeat, only women with a college degree--earn above that threshold in Kentucky. This same study found that single mothers with a high school degree never, never reach that threshold. In fact, the average income for Kentucky women of any age with a high school degree is only 67 percent of that benchmark. 
My State wants to go forward and help these women help themselves. A bipartisan bill in the 1998 Kentucky general assembly to improve access to education for welfare recipients was ultimately scrapped. Why was it scrapped? Due to the fear of Federal penalties. The State wanted to extend the opportunity, particularly to single mothers, and they were fearful because of Federal penalties. 
I know the Wellstone amendment was perceived by some of my colleagues as an effort to undermine the welfare law and had little business being attached to a Higher Education Act. I am sorry that these colleagues decided to frame this issue in such a way. This was an amendment about education. This was an amendment about education. Education is the key to helping parents escape the low-paying jobs that only perpetuate the welfare wheel. If these single mothers have just a little more time to get an education, they will be able to compete for higher paying jobs which will help them keep their families from sinking. 
Although I will not be here next year, I am heartened by the fact that there will be joint hearings on this issue and that my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Paul Wellstone, will continue to advocate for this change. 
I urge my colleagues to learn more about this pressing problem, pay full attention to these hearings, and talk to people in your State. I believe that my colleagues will find that this is a commonsense fix that will improve the welfare law. As someone who voted for this bill, I reiterate the Wellstone amendment was not about trying to undo welfare reform, but an attempt to help single mothers caught in a Catch-22. The Wellstone amendment is about helping families help themselves. I hope my colleagues will look beyond party lines next year and do the right thing. 
I thank my friend from Minnesota and I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. May I say to my good friend, I found the same thing, too. We have several community colleges around the State. I have not talked to an employer yet who said he would not prefer to have an employee that was better educated. I have never talked to those from academia who would not tell me that at least, the minimum, 2 years of education would give, particularly a single-parent mother, the opportunity to secure the $10.91 per hour that was necessary to keep that family out of poverty. That is just a little over $19,000 a year to take care of three people. That does not sound like much. But you give them an opportunity to earn and compete. That is what this bill is all about, I thought, under welfare. 
So, somehow, some way, our colleagues are going to have to understand the employer wants a better educated employee; the single-parent mother particularly wants to be able to get out of poverty and get away from that cycle. Whatever you can do next year--you don't have to have a study to understand that.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is difficult for me to respond because it is somewhat melancholy, as this is my last effort at developing an aviation package, to have such kind remarks come from my learned friend who also has worked tirelessly in an attempt to make the aviation industry safer, more accessible, helping it expand, and giving it the opportunity to grow. 
He comes from a unique State. He sits down with you and explains the problem. It isn't `I am Ted Stevens, vote with me.' He sits down and explains the problem and what is needed to improve the problems of his fine State. It is very difficult for anyone to not help once they understand what Alaska has. 
We have a great mix in this country. You go all the way from the cold in the north in the 49th State to the south where it is hot, and to Hawaii, the 50th State. We have a great mix. The people who represent those States are great. 
My friend from Alaska is really and truly my friend. One of the things I will miss around here is my association with him. He has helped me on more than one occasion to do some things maybe that he would rather not do. But I found, as my dad taught me, that you pay your debts whether you sign the paper or shake a man's hand. Ted Stevens' word is his bond. And I respect him for that. I respect what he does as a Member of this institution. 
I will feel comfortable when I leave here that Senator Stevens is head of appropriations. He is still on the Commerce Committee. And when the new aviation bill comes forth, he will be sure that those things that we fought for so long will be improved. 
I thank my friend very, very much.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for all their hard work in putting this bill together. It was a tough task. But we have been able to work out just about every issue that was of concern to Members on both sides of the aisle. 
The FAA in the future years must be able to have the funding that it needs to modernize. The new Administrator has a very difficult job. She has been working with the industry and with Congress to move forward on many tough issues. 
Some have described the modernization of the air traffic control system like this: It is sort of like needing to rebuild your entire house, but you have to live there at the same time. 
Modernization is a critical issue. We included in this bill a section on tourism, and because of its importance to each of us and without an aviation system that can grow, tourism will also be affected. In leaving, let me mention a few areas of concern. 
In the next year the FAA and the aviation community, airports, airlines, manufacturers, and our international partners, all must address the year 2000 computer problem. The FAA must also move forward on the STARS and WASS programs. Think about that. We need to yank out all of the controller workstations across the country and put in new computers. All of us have had new systems put in our offices, and we know it is a mess. The FAA has to do it while planes are still flying and people's lives are at stake. We may fault the FAA at times for not moving as quickly as we want, but keep in mind how tough the task is. 
With respect to the Wide Area Augmentation System, the industry is beginning to equip its fleet to be able to take advantage of a satellite-based tracking system. The FAA, Congress and the industry have got to move forward with this new program. We have committed hundreds of millions of dollars to this effort, and we cannot turn back now. 
The Administrator knows all this, but this body has to give her the resources to do the job. Next year, you will debate and argue over how to fund the FAA. It is a critical matter. We know that traffic will increase by 35 percent over the next several years. We know that our airports need to be expanded. Gridlock cannot occur because the FAA does not have the ability to meet the industry's needs. 
I also want to mention the small communities program in this bill. There are many segments of the country that have not received all the benefits of deregulation. We are going to try to help those areas, but not by merely giving them money. The communities will need to work hard to develop their markets and work with carriers to provide the needed service. 
I thank the chairman, Senator McCain. I know that he will continue to fight for FAA's needs next year. I also hope that we can quickly conclude the conference on this bill. There are a few tough issues that will need to be decided by the Members, and I hope that we can come to closure soon. 
Mr. President, in this life in the Senate, you come across some very, very fine people, and those are the ones who make this place run and are not recognized. We get all the publicity, good or bad. We have to face the voters, good or bad. But the staff who support us, the staff who support the committee, the staff who support us on the floor, they are the ones who need to have the accolades. They work hard--all night, they work 24 hours, around the clock--and we never seem to thank them as we should. I know my life in the Senate would have been made a lot tougher, and I probably would not have succeeded had it not been for staff. 
You find a lot of excellent staff, on both sides now. Don't think I am just talking about one side of the aisle. Ann--I hope I pronounce her last name right--Choiniere. Getting close? This is the first time I have worked with her, and I found out how tough she can be but how thorough and fair she is representing the chairman; she has done an excellent job. Mike Reynolds and others on Senator McCain's side have all done well. Senator Gorton's staff. He was fairly bright and smart when he brought Brett Hale from Kentucky on his staff. He is 
one of the people around here who definitely understands Kentucky Wildcat basketball, and we can talk together about that on occasion. And Jeanne Bumpus on Senator Gorton's staff; Jim Drewry and Carl Bentzel, Dave Regan and others on my side. 
But there is one you have to depend on, one who is the leader, one who comes and sits down and we work through the problems and then get the challenge to go and get it settled and come back and see where we are and keep you informed and keep you moving. Sam Whitehorn is that kind of fellow, and I am going to miss him. He and I have become good friends. I don't look at him as a staff person. I look at him as a member of the family, because he is. He is dedicated, and wants to get the job done. And sometimes he has to do maybe what he didn't exactly like to do, but I made the decision. Sam has been a good soldier through the whole thing, and I am grateful to him. 
Mr. President, as we end this part of the aviation bill, I again thank my colleagues, and I look forward to being down in Kentucky to see some of this work I have done, to watch it grow there, because we need as much help as any other State. I am grateful for the opportunity I have had, and I thank the chairman again. Some people think he is tough and rough and that sort of thing, but he really has a soft spot. Now, if you can find that soft spot, you can get along with him. Sometimes it is difficult to find it. But you see him laughing. That is the kind of association we have had. I look forward to working with him to complete this bill, working in conference, so that when we leave here sometime mid-October we can leave knowing we have done the best we could, that we have tried to be responsible to the people we represent in this great country of ours. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is always painful to be against an amendment by one of your colleagues, and particularly a friend. But I think under the circumstances it is a little premature to go with this when the Environment Committee has asked that this come through their committee and not be offered on the floor. But attacking noise is a difficult problem that requires a coordinated effort involving research, airport grant money, flight paths, and phaseout of noisy aircraft. 
The FAA has been successful in its efforts to reduce airplane noise. In fact, the FAA has spent in the last few years $2 billion for sound insulation and property purchase around our U.S. airports. And duplicating the expertise of the FAA within the EPA and costing the taxpayers some $21 million would be wasteful, in my opinion, of government resources. It would complicate and confuse efforts to deal with and better understand community noise concerns. And it would, Mr. President, create a judicial ambiguity that could have real problems as we reduce aircraft noise worldwide. 
Since 1993, the Federal Interagency Committee on Aircraft Noise has worked successfully to advance cooperative noise research among the various Federal agencies with an interest in this area. The participants of this interagency committee on noise includes the National Park Service; EPA is a part of this, FAA, NASA, HUD housing, Department of Defense, National Institutes of Health, and others. And the participating agencies have and continue to address all of the responsibilities envisioned in the Quiet Communities Act through their cooperative research work, and EPA is, has been, and will remain an active participant in this process. 
Mr. President, there is no need to change their current structure. I want to reiterate:--There does not appear to be any substantive reason to expend $21 million and add needless jurisdictional confusion to the ongoing efforts to deal effectively with community aircraft noise. 
I go back to the struggle we had to eliminate Stage 2 aircraft engines. There were 4.5 million, as my friend from Arizona said, people that were subjected to noise as it relates to aircraft. We have been quite successful. We have reduced that now by 90 percent. We are down to a mere 10 percent. And by January 1, 2000, all aircraft will have to be Stage 3. So the noise is going to be reduced even further. 
I understand the problems. But we have been working on it for some time. I hope that our colleagues will leave the authority with FAA and let them continue with all the groups in the Federal Government, such as NASA, Housing, Defense, National Institutes of Health, and EPA that are working together. 
I am going to join with my friend in endorsing his motion to table. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, the proponent of this amendment, Senator Torricelli, wanted at least 2 minutes. I don't believe Senator McCain and I have any time left. I will suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be charged equally to both sides up to no more than 2 minutes.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me compliment and thank my friend from North Dakota. No one has worked harder or spoken more eloquently in support of the small family farm than the Senator from North Dakota. How well I understand what he is going through. 
We heard on this floor yesterday afternoon that we are getting ready to spend money for `emergencies,' but we ought to give a tax break. What is an emergency? Farmers, the Senator said. We should have known there would be a drought or there would be too much water. We ought to have put money in the budget for it. 
`Emergency' is something that is on occasion. We cannot anticipate an emergency. We can't do that. But a tax break is in perpetuity. It goes on forever. Emergency is one time. 
So we try to cover up by accelerating the payments under Freedom to Farm. I voted against the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, one of seven in this body. It is awfully hard to get a Senator with something on his mind, with a philosophy that never looks in the future. The future is now at hand on that vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement when we are being flooded not only with farm products but wool and everything else relating to our people trying to make suits, pants and so forth in the textile business. It is driving our people out of this country. 
The Senator is absolutely correct, we need that safety net for our farmers. 
I have sat on too many front porches of farm families. I have been in the kitchen with the farmer and his wife and family. I understand what they are going through. They can't compete. 
One of the finest men I know was in my office yesterday taking a load of hogs to the slaughter house. He got $3,500 for hogs that a year ago would have brought $7,000. What did he get? Nothing. We don't have any compassion for him; we don't have any reason to try to help him keep that farm. He put everything into that load of hogs. What does he get back? He couldn't even pay for the feed. 
So we say `compete.' Competition is like dialing a new bank at home. The tape says if you want so and so, push 1; if you want so and so, push 2; if you want so and so, push 3. You keep on pushing the phone and finally people throw the phone out the door. They want to talk to a human being, but we call another State to talk about local loan problems or financial problems. 
We are getting into an intolerable situation. I hope the Senator never lets his vote die as it relates to the family farm. I compliment the Senator for what he is trying to do. 
I understand we have been debating the aviation bill, but he has an amendment that talks sense. The commodity we have so little of here is common sense. Common sense, I think, if it prevails, the Senator might win a couple of amendments in the not-too-distant future. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have to oppose this amendment, also. The FAA must have the ability to act when it believes safety is at risk. The FAA is often criticized for not acting quickly enough on safety matters. Here they revoke a certificate for safety purposes and we want to make it harder for them to act. Right now the court of appeals has upheld the FAA actions in every case. They do not second guess the agency charged with the regulation of safety, so let's be sure we give the FAA the authority for safety in the air.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I join my colleague in asking the Senators to help us move this bill along. We worked late into the night last evening in order to try to accommodate as many Senators as we could. There were some changes in language to where the amendments could be agreeable. Those amendments will be offered because both sides have agreed. We are down to maybe five or six amendments that will need votes. I don't know of any other vote that would be necessary. 
Under the unanimous consent agreement of last evening, we said that these were first-degree amendments and that there might be second-degree amendments. We hope not. I want to encourage those on my side, if they have amendments that they want to debate and discuss, we are ready to take the time to do it now. 
It gets a little frustrating here at the end of a session when everybody wants something done and nobody is here to help us get things done. It is the `nature of the brute,' as I have heard quite often. But we will be in a crunch, we will be here Saturdays and Sunday afternoon if we are going to get out by October 9, or we will be labeled as a `do-nothing Congress.' I don't like that label, and I don't like to work on Saturdays or Sundays. 
I don't think my colleagues do either. 
If they would just come and offer their amendments and give us a time agreement, we can stack votes. We can do a lot of things to accommodate our Members. 
I hope they will listen to the admonishment of my friend from Arizona that we want to finish this bill today, if at all possible. We intend to do that. If colleagues are not cooperative, then third reading is always possible. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I will have a few additional remarks tomorrow. I made a speech one night and read it, and going home that evening Mrs. Ford said, `Did you ever think about just speaking from notes and off the cuff? It seems more sincere.' So the next time we went out, I made this speech from just three or four notes, and I thought I did very well. We were going home, and I said, `Well, how did I do tonight?' There was a hesitation, and she said, `I believe I'd go back to reading.' And so I will be off the cuff tomorrow, with probably some prepared remarks. As you all know, this is probably the last piece of aviation legislation I will have any input into as a Senator. 
I appreciate all the cooperation and good humor that has been displayed as we have moved along the way. I have been impressed by the staff that Senator McCain has assembled to assist him. I have been amazed at the staff that we have, and how they work together and ultimately get it done. One of the things we worried about was having all the amendments maybe worked out before we got on the floor. And that came close. 
But I remember something that Senator Robert Byrd told me a long time ago: If you cannot get an agreement, start, and it will create a vacuum. So I think that is exactly what has occurred here, along with the hard work on both sides of the aisle. It has been a good ride, and I look forward to the vote in the morning at 9:50, and then I will make some comments after that. 
I am grateful to my colleague for his patience with me. We look forward to several more weeks of working together and accomplishing many things that he and I want to do. We are going to try. Whether we accomplish those things or not, only time will tell. But if there is anything in trying to get it done, Senator McCain and I will accomplish our end purpose. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. I thank my friend, Senator McCain, chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. I compliment him on his remarks. I think he fully and fairly explained the legislation that is before the Senate. 
One of the things I want to reiterate that he stated is that every State in this Nation has a vital part in this piece of legislation as it relates to air transportation, not only domestically but internationally. It is important. We are talking, I think, in the neighborhood of approximately $10 billion per year. It is so important, as the chairman has said, that we work hard and quickly on this bill so that we might pass it prior to adjournment. I would hate to see this piece of legislation caught up in a continuing resolution that would generally turn into a `Christmas tree.' 
So, Madam President, before us today is S. 2279, a bill that my good friend, Senator Ted Stevens, and this committee named after me. I hope having that name on it won't prevent it from moving expeditiously. It is an honor to have a piece of legislation named after a Member, and I thank the Senator from Alaska for his friendship and his kindness. 
As many of my colleagues know, this bill is a `must' pass bill. Without it, the FAA and our nation's airports can not continue to build to meet future needs. I have watched over my career as airports in Louisville, Cincinnati, Owensboro, Hazard and may other places in my State, have benefited from the work of the FAA. We all have seen the growth in aviation throughout the country and, yes, throughout the world. Denver, for example, was a pipe dream for many years. Today, it is a vital part of the aviation system. 
Past Administrators, like Linda Daschle, and Secretaries, like Sam Skinner, have also realized how critical aviation is to our economy. In naming these two individuals, I do not mean to exclude the many fine individuals who have held those posts. 
The Administrator today, Jane Garvey, and the Secretary, Rodney Slater, have seen first hand how important airport improvements are to our communities. 
I had hoped, in my last FAA reauthorization bill, that we could have done more. In 1996, along with Senator McCain  and others, we tried to set a course to reforming the FAA. We worked through difficult issues together, and produced a good road map for the FAA. One piece remains missing--funding. There will be options that will be debated next year--a fee system, taking the Airport and Airways Trust Fund off budget, or keeping the current system. As long as you can ensure that the FAA has the money it needs to modernize and meet the future needs of the traveling public, you will succeed. 
Today, we will lay down a managers' amendment. We have been working on it ever since the FAA bill was reported by the Commerce Committee. Many issues of concern of the Members have been addressed. Some remain unresolved. 
I want to make clear that there are a few provisions that still need some work. Clarification of intent will be important. 
The bill today does two critical things--it gives the FAA a road map to improve safety and to make sure that communities that have not benefitted from airline deregulation have a chance to improve airline services.  
I have heard the Chair's distinguished colleague, who is on our Commerce Committee, talk about the air transportation problems in small communities in their area. I am hopeful that in this piece of legislation we moved in the right direction to help those communities that have not benefited from airline deregulation and have a chance to improve their services. I will talk more about the small community needs later. 
As I said earlier, I think Senator McCain explained the bill very well and very fairly. I am hopeful that colleagues on my side will be more than willing to accept the managers' amendment and will be Henry Clay-like--that is, in the mood of compromise--as we move into the amendments that are not quite ready to be agreed to. 
I am hopeful that we will be limited to maybe five or six votes and then final passage. If we can do that, then that will be a real victory for the legislative process. I want to express a special thanks to the staff on both sides who have worked so hard since this bill was introduced to work out many of the amendments that were being proposed and suggested. 
I think we come today with a package that is almost there. I am sure that once we get into the five or six amendments that might be contentious, we will be able to work it out. Even now, as we are bringing this piece of legislation to the floor, staff are working to see if they can reach an agreement on the final pieces of legislation. I agree with my colleague, Senator McCain, that we are hopeful that between now and roughly 6 p.m., we will know how many amendments will be brought to this piece of legislation, how many would need a vote, and how many we would need to discuss. We are hopeful that we can be very close at the end of the day to getting this bill prepared to pass here tomorrow and send it to conference, so that we can include this must-pass bill in our agenda before we leave here somewhere around October 9. 
Again, I thank my colleague for all of his hard work. He is a pretty tenacious fellow. When there are things that he believes should be done, even though he may not have a majority with him at that time, look out, here he comes. So we are down to five or six amendments, I believe, and we are still working to try to see if an accommodation can be made, because when we are talking about the transportation and the industrial development, those things are so important to this country and our ability to move in the international sphere that we must pass this bill before we leave here. 
So I am ready to work. I will meet with our colleagues any time. Our staffs are prepared to meet, and we will do whatever is necessary to spend the time to work out these final few amendments. Before we leave here this afternoon, I look forward to having some kind of a finite list, if we can get it, of those that we will be considering in the next 24 hours. 
Madam President, I thank the chairman for his courtesy and the time. I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from New Hampshire. Many of the economists give credit for the financial position of this country to the President and those who voted for the 1993 Budget Act, for which not a one on the side of the Senator from New Hampshire voted. 
Secondly, the CBO, which is an appointment of the majority party, has said there will only be a $31 billion surplus in the general fund at the end of 10 years. He is partially right in saying if we have an emergency supplemental that it would come from the surplus, which is basically Social Security. Any tax break that is given comes from Social Security. I think whatever we might believe about the President, if a bill that goes to his desk that takes part of the Social Security trust fund money and spends it for a tax break or anything else that he will veto it, because the economic situation of this country is still an amazement to the rest of the world, how we have put our economy and our economic position in place. 
What is an emergency? I think the rules are basically something similar to this. I don't have it before me to read. But it is something that doesn't come all the time, it is unexpected. The Senator from New Hampshire says you can expect a drought, or you can expect too much water, or you can expect all these things, so you should fund for it. I have gone through years when we didn't have an emergency in the farm community. I have gone through years when we did not have an emergency appropriations. So, therefore, you didn't need to budget it. 
Secondly, the emergency is something that occurs and is not in perpetuity. The tax cut goes on; it doesn't stop. If you have an emergency now, you try to take care of that emergency; if it doesn't occur again, you don't have to do it again. If you give a tax break, that goes on forever, in perpetuity. So there is a difference between a tax cut and an emergency supplemental appropriations. It isn't something that reoccurs; you do it one time. 
As we look at the Freedom to Farm bill that was heralded as the savior for the farm program, we see now that it really doesn't work; there is no safety net for the farmers. There is a crisis in the Midwest. The farmers who raise the grain have had a lot of trouble, and it is not necessarily no rain, a drought, and so forth, but prices. The North American Free Trade Agreement, which only seven of us in the Senate voted against at the time, has now come back to bite us. When you find farmers standing at the border between the United States and Canada preventing those 18 wheelers from coming in, it is somewhat understandable that we should be concerned about it. 
I hope we can sit down and work out whatever moneys are necessary as it relates to an emergency supplemental, particularly for our farmers and particularly in defense. 
I did not want the Senator from New Hampshire to get up and say all these things as fact without having a little bit of the other side from whom some people refer to as a moderate Senator from Kentucky. I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I join my chairman in his remarks. I thought they were excellent and to the point. I agree with Senator McCain that we ought to work with the Senator from Oklahoma to see if we can get something in the bill that will at least recognize the problem that he has brought forth here this afternoon. 
As of now, I will join with my colleague and oppose Senator Inhofe's amendment. It is my understanding that GAO, FAA, and the Department of Transportation IG have all looked at FAA's use of its emergency authority. There are only a few cases where the FAA has been reversed. GAO found that FAA used its authority in only 3 percent of its enforcement cases from 1990 to 1997. It shows a great deal of restraint that they only use it in cases where they think it is an emergency. And, as my friend from Arizona has said, most of those cases have been upheld. So FAA must have the authority--must have the authority--to revoke certificates on an emergency basis. 
The National Transportation Safety Board, FAA, and GAO all oppose any change. Beyond that, I think I will join with my friend from Arizona in trying to work out something that might be satisfactory, rather than just to look at it a little closer than we have been looking at it. We can all find one or two horror stories. I don't know how many certificates were revoked. I don't know how many charges were presented to the FAA. Those figures are not here. But in all cases, the percentage that Senator McCain represented--2 percent or 1 percent--and then only 3 percent, from 1990 to 1997, of its enforcement cases have they revoked certificates. So I think it indicates that there is a concern on the part of FAA that they not do anything irrational, but that they look at the cases thoroughly and then make a judgment as it relates to emergency authority only. 
So I hope that the Senator from Oklahoma will give us an opportunity to sit down and work with him. I hate to be in opposition to all the amendments that are brought, but this is one that I will have to be opposed to and would encourage my colleagues to vote against if the Senator insists that we go on. 
He stops in my hometown on occasion, I say to my friend from Arizona, and buys gasoline from the chairman of the Republican Party in my county. He is keeping the Republican Party going. I want him to continue to fly over the Owensboro stop and fill up with gasoline and keep our economy going. I would not want him to not stop in Owensboro. I gave you a hometown reason for us to try to help the Senator from Oklahoma to work something out. I look forward to him agreeing to that. If not, I could not agree to a vote tonight. I am sure the Senator would not want one either. We would have to wait and set a time certain for tomorrow because I understand that his side has a little shindig tonight that they would like to get to. We will accommodate him as they accommodated us last night. We ought to reciprocate, under the circumstances. 
I yield the floor.

The Snowe amendments we have agreed to, the technical corrections amendment we agreed to, and those have been taken care of. 
So we are moving on, even though it does not appear there is much action on the floor. Once the legislation is before the Senate, a vacuum is created. I learned that a long time ago. You may not have everything put together, but once you get started it creates a vacuum, and I think we are on our way to being able to pass this piece of legislation sometime tomorrow.

So I agree with my colleague, we have an opportunity to finish this bill tomorrow. And it is one of those `must-pass' bills. And I am very hopeful that we can do it. We are here. Our staff is available. We are very amenable right now and probably more so tomorrow; but toward noon and a little after we may get intolerable. So let's hope we can do things early in the morning after our first vote. 
I thank the Chair and thank my colleague.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue that is of great importance to my state. For over 30 years the Tennessee Valley Authority has administered a parcel of land in Kentucky called Land Between the Lakes. For those of you who have not had the pleasure of visiting this region, Land Between the Lakes is used for recreational and educational activities and for pure enjoyment of the land's beauty. 
In 1961 TVA proposed to President Kennedy that land between Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake be established as a national recreation area. In 1963 that proposal became a reality. Initially, TVA was to administer Land Between the Lakes for about 10 years as a temporary demonstration project after which permanent administration would be determined. Though no formal proceedings were held to determine who should administer Land Between the Lakes it has been the custom and practice of Congress to provide annual appropriations to TVA for Land Between the Lakes. 
TVA has invested years in creating a program that meets the needs of all Land Between the Lakes visitors. According to the Administration Land Between the Lakes is `the hub of tourism and recreation industry that annually generates $400 million in economic activity in nine contiguous counties.' TVA has the equipment, it has the resources and it has employees to do the job correctly. TVA has a vested interest in protecting the integrity of the land, a vested interest like the original landowners who want to assure their land in Kentucky receives the upmost care and protection. And Mr. President, people in the Commonwealth of Kentucky have deep cultural ties to the land. Land Between the Lakes is not just another recreation area--it is a part of family history. Kentuckians gave up their rights to property that had been in their family for generations, so the whole world would have the opportunity to enjoy Land Between the Lakes and its natural resources. 
Creation of Land Between the Lakes as a national recreation area was not without incident. But over the years TVA has proven itself as a worthy guardian of one of Kentucky's most precious resources. Land Between the Lakes is a place for both the young and old, Kentuckians and visitors to our state to appreciate nature in its purest form. TVA is keeping a promise made to the original land owners to conserve, protect and keep the land in its natural state. 
Mr. President, a provision of this bill transfers the administrative authority of Land Between the Lakes to the National Forest Service if Congress does not appropriate $6 million to manage the recreation area. But in Kentucky, we believe if it isn't broken don't fix it. The people of Kentucky who sacrificed their family land to create Land Between the Lakes do not want this transfer to occur. They cannot understand why people in Washington want to take away TVA's administrative authority of Land Between the Lakes when Kentuckians are happy with the status quo, and I'm having a hard time explaining why people who don't live in Kentucky are making this decision. It doesn't make sense to my constituents and I agree. 
If Congress is willing to appropriate $6 million for Land Between the Lakes for the Forest Service, then it's sending a clear message that it supports continued funding for Land Between the Lakes. If Congress intends to fund Land Between the Lakes then it makes sense to fund it through TVA, an established and successful route of management. 
Who administers Land Between the Lakes may not be an issue of national importance, but for Kentuckians it is a matter of pride and honor in protecting their land. For the last couple of years we've all heard how important it is to give local communities the power to make decisions that directly affect their lives. When it's in Congress' best interest, they're all for giving local communities the power to make their own decisions. But for Kentuckians who gave up their land to help create Land Between the Lakes, Congress believes it knows better what's in their best interest. 
This provision threatens the integrity of the land and the integrity of the people of Kentucky. My fellow Kentuckians have never been shy about letting me know what is best for them and I've never been afraid to listen. Transferring administrative authority of Land Between the Lakes away from TVA is a bad move. The proposal of this transfer has caused an emotional response and divided communities. It does not represent the best interest of Land Between the Lakes, the original landowners' families, nor the people of Kentucky.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the efforts of the Take Back The Night Alliance, an organization in the metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky area that is working to end a problem that affects us all in one way or another: violence against women. On Thursday, September 10, as part of Sexual Assault Awareness and Domestic Violence Awareness months, the Alliance will for the first time in its nine-year history kick off a month-long series of events that will create a greater awareness of the attitudes, beliefs and behaviors that perpetuate these specific kinds of crimes. 
The statistics of domestic violence are sobering, and I'll give you just a brief sampling here: 
A woman is physically abused every nine seconds in the United States. 
In Kentucky alone, 80,000 women were victims of domestic violence in 1997. 
One out of four females will be sexually assaulted before they reach the age of 18. 
For every rape, 10 others go unreported. 
Husbands and boyfriends commit 13,000 acts of violence against women in the workplace every year. 
The total healthcare costs of family violence are estimated at $44 million each year. 
Take Back The Night rallies have been held throughout the United States since 1978. In Louisville, the National Organization for Women has been the organizing force for this event for the past nine years, but over 200 civic organizations, government agencies and businesses have joined this year to sponsor a wide range of activities drawing attention to the problems faced by women who are victims of domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. One group will collect previously owned business clothing for abused women returning to the workforce. Another will sponsor safety and prevention workshops in area hospitals and companies. And yet another will provide materials on date rape and sexual assault to be placed in bars and in women's restrooms. 
Louisville and Jefferson County have been recognized as leaders in the field of domestic violence, and I am heartened by the strong outpouring of support that the Take Back the Night Alliance has received from the community. We all know that such success does not happen by accident, and I would like to commend the Alliance leaders for their dedicated efforts to ease the plight of women who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and rape.

Mr. FORD. Mr President. In 1948, back in my home state of Kentucky, Governor Earle C. Clements made the Commonwealth the 38th state to enact a State Police Act. Kentucky was changing rapidly, and Governor Clements saw a need for a statewide police force to support the local authorities. With this measure, Kentucky kicked off fifty proud years of state police enforcement. 
For each twist and turn through the last half century, the Kentucky State Police have responded by continuing to push themselves to provide the best service they can to protect Kentuckians. The police motto is `To Serve and Protect,' but the Kentucky State Police have another slogan as well--`A Proud Past . . . A Prouder Tomorrow.' That says it all about this group of men and women so committed to Kentucky. 
The first decade of the agency brought the very first pay raise to state police officers. Their pay went from $130 to $150 a month. In the Fifties, the state police took to the air with the first aircraft purchase while they still patrolled the highways in `incognito squads,' as they called them, checking for speeders and overweight trucks. 
The Sixties put the officers in gray cars just like their gray uniforms, creating an instantly recognizable presence in person and on the roadways. The Kentucky State Police responded to a need they perceived statewide by creating Trooper Island, a cost-free summer camp for underprivileged boys on a former Army Corps of Engineers island in Dale Hollow Lake. To this day, boys and girls who otherwise would be unable to attend a camp come for a wonderful week of fun dedicated to the development of their self-images. 
The Seventies brought massive upheaval to the entire country, and Kentucky was no different. A drug enforcement unit became necessary for the agency, and the first female trooper was hired. A computerized network was set up linking state and local law enforcement to crime information. 
In the Eighties, the Kentucky State Police coordinated with the Kentucky National Guard to begin a full scale marijuana eradication effort. In response to a national movement, a toll-free hotline for reporting drunken drivers was established. And this decade brought video cameras installed in patrol cars, a centralized laboratory with state-of-the-art equipment, and the 911 phone system in local communities was linked to the statewide network. Today there are sixteen field posts distributed throughout the state, 1,000 officers, and comprehensive law enforcement resources. The Kentucky State Police have responded to each and every change, continually making themselves to be the best force they could be. 
In light of recent events at the Capitol, I am more aware than ever of the ways police put themselves on the line to protect our safety each and every day. It takes a special calling and an extraordinary commitment to choose police work as your life's work. They have chosen to get up every day and protect us. They do it even though we often take them for granted, even though the work can be thankless, even though they could lose their life. I am so appreciative of those men and women who serve this country in such a noble way, and today I want to honor the men and women of the Kentucky State Police who have served Kentucky in their own noble way for fifty years.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow Kentuckian and my friend, William B. Greenwood of Central City, who will be installed as president of the nation's largest insurance association--the Independent Insurance Agents of America (IIAA)--next month in Boston. Bill is president of C.A. Lawton Insurance, an independent insurance agency located in Central City. 
Bill's career as an independent insurance agent has been marked with outstanding dedication to his clients, his community, IIAA, the State association--the Independent Insurance Agents of Kentucky--his colleagues and his profession. 
At the state level, Bill served as president of the Independent Insurance Agents of Kentucky in 1983, and was named the Kentucky association's Insurer of the Year in 1986. He was Kentucky's representative to IIAA's National Board of State Directors for seven years beginning in 1985. 
Bill also has been very active with IIAA. He served as chairman of its Communications and Membership Committees as well as chairman of the Future One Communications Task Force. Bill was elected to IIAA's Executive Committee in 1992 and since then he has exhibited a spirit of dedication and concern for his 300,000 independent agent colleagues around the country. 
Bill's selfless attitude also extends to his involvement in numerous Central City-area community activities. He received the 1989 Kentucky Chamber of Commerce Volunteer of the Year Award. He is on the Boards of Directors for the Leadership Kentucky Foundation, Kentucky Audubon Council Boy Scouts of America, and Central City, Main Street, Inc. 
In the past, Bill served on the Board of Directors of the Muhlenberg Community Theater, the Everly Brothers Foundation, and the Central City Main Street and Redy Downtown Development Corporation. Also, Bill is past president of the Central City Chamber of Commerce and the Central City Lions Club. 
Bill's professional endeavors outside IIAA extend to serving on the board of directors and serving as president of the First United Holding Company, which owns Central City's First National Bank. 
I have complete confidence that Bill will serve with distinction and provide strong leadership as president of the Independent Insurance Agents of America. I wish him and his lovely wife, Leslie, all the best as IIAA President and First Lady over the next year.

Mr. FORD. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by my colleague and good friend from Arizona. I do not do so because I disagree with his goal of making the good work of the Congressional Research Service available to the general public. Nor do I believe that the American people should be prevented from seeing the kinds of documents we use every day to help us make difficult decisions here in Congress. The Senator from Arizona is nothing if not consistent in his commitment to open government, and this current effort, like so many others, is continued proof of his faith in those principles. 
That said, however, I oppose this amendment because it attempts to solve a problem that really doesn't exist. For years, all Members of Congress have had the opportunity to make CRS materials available to constituents upon request. This arrangement has been beneficial to everyone concerned: citizens receive information on issues of interest; Members of Congress are kept informed about the issues that concern their constituents; and the CRS--which is an extension of Congressional staff and not a public agency--maintains the ability to study and explain difficult issues for its primary audience, the Congress, without external pressure from groups with an interest in the issues that CRS is charged with researching. 
Of course, as technology has changed, CRS has been able to improve the ways of delivering materials to Congress. While CRS still prints reports and delivers them to Congressional offices by hand and by mail, those same reports are also now available to Members and staff via the Internet. Congress, similarly, can make use of technology and the Internet to distribute CRS materials to their constituents. There is no reason to switch from the procedure of allowing Members of Congress to interact with their constituents with regard to CRS products to a system where CRS responds directly to the public. 
That is why Senator Warner and I, as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Rules Committee, recently circulated a `Dear Colleague' letter announcing that the Rules Committee will be providing selected CRS documents to the public through a special link on the Committee Web site and inviting Members and Committee Chairmen to investigate the feasibility of doing the same with their Web sites. 
Although it might seem like a big step for the Rules Committee and other offices to make CRS documents available on the Internet, the truth is that our Web page is nothing more than a new twist on the old method of making CRS documents available to interested citizens. The only difference is that, instead of using what Internet users call `snail mail,' Members of Congress can make CRS materials available to constituents at the click of a mouse or the press of a button. 
What has not changed is the necessary participation of Member offices in the process. Without that participation--without the ability of Members and Committees to respond to constituent requests and to provide CRS products accordingly--CRS risks losing its status as an extension of our staff and the scholarly research and non-partisan analysis that are its hallmarks will be jeopardized. 
That is why I think the pending amendment--which would remove Congressional offices from the equation and require that CRS prepared and maintain a central public Website for its products--is flawed. What is worse, requiring CRS to put all of its products on the Internet would cost millions of dollars--money that could be put to better use in recruiting new CRS analysts to replace those who will be eligible to retire shortly after the turn of the century. I simply cannot understand why CRS should be saddled with a project of this size when we in Congress already have the means to use existing technology to significantly improve the traditional method of distributing CRS products. 
Madam President, as Ranking Member of the Rules Committee I have had several opportunities to hear out my colleague from Arizona on this issue. I urge him and any colleagues who support this amendment to follow the lead of the Rules Committee in offering CRS products to constituents via the Internet. As of now, no other Senate Committee--including the Commerce Committee, chaired by my colleague from Arizona--has taken advantage of the offer by CRS to assist Committee and Member offices with online access to CRS products. 
Madam President, I have always believed that `if it ain't broke, don't fix it'--and until it is clear that Committee- and member-sponsored online distribution of CRS products is inadequate, I do not think we should expend the energy of the Senate--or the resources of the CRS--on such a questionable solution. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in cosponsoring S. 2316, which earmarks a portion of Treasury funds obtained through the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation for the clean up of depleted uranium hexafluoride, or so-called uranium `tails.' The legislation earmarks roughly $335 million for this cleanup, preserving authority to conduct the treatment and recycling of depleted uranium tails. 
However, none of the money will be spent unless Congress appropriates such funding. I am pleased that my amendment has been added to this bill which puts the Senate on record in support of fully appropriating funds to implement a cleanup plan to be developed by the Secretary of Energy. It is a two way street, Mr. President. I agree that the Secretary of Energy should immediately develop a plan to clean up the depleted uranium tails. But I also believe Congress should respond quickly to appropriate the necessary funds. 
Three weeks ago, the Administration announced that the USEC Board had approved the privatization of USEC through an initial public offering of stock in the new Corporation. This will be the largest federal privatization effort since Conrail, establishing a $2.4 billion private corporation to enrich uranium for nuclear power production and compete in world markets. I have been involved in this effort for more than a decade. It directly affects 2,200 workers in Paducah, Kentucky who work at one of the two gaseous diffusion plants operated by USEC. 
As part of this transaction, a $1.7 billion `exit dividend' is to be paid to the Treasury. This legislation assures that an appropriate portion of those funds will be available for clean up at the existing USEC facilities. And it also puts the Senate on record in support of future appropriations for clean up purposes. 
Among the reasons for obtaining these assurances is the employment situation at the two USEC plants. One of the great myths some are promoting is the suggestion that the privatization is causing 600 job losses at the two plants over the next two years. This is simply not the case. The job losses were apparently likely regardless of whether privatization went forward. As part of the privatization agreement, the new corporation has agreed to operate both existing plants through January, 2005. However, some job reductions will occur. The job impact was likely in the event that USEC remained as a government corporation and did not privatize. And it is equally likely in the short-term if privatization goes forward. They are a reality and we must deal with this situation. The privatization transaction provides $50 million to begin clean up efforts at the two plants. This legislation adds to that amount, earmarking an amount necessary to fully fund the estimated clean up liability for all uranium tails acquired since July 1993. Once enacted, it will be the responsibility of the Secretary of Energy to develop an adequate clean up plan. And just as importantly, it will be the responsibility of the Congress to appropriate funds which are sufficient to fully implement the clean up plan. 
I believe any individuals who lose their jobs at either of the existing two facilities should be given a preference in obtaining these clean up jobs, and I will be urging the Administration to provide such a preference in the months ahead. 
A second great myth associated with privatization is that there is a large pot of money laying around which could be spent on clean up. That is not the case. First of all, upon privatization, the authority to spend the so-called `exit dividend' will expire unless we pass this bill. Time is of the essence. Second, even if the authority is preserved, none of the exit dividend may be spent unless Congress appropriates the funds. That is why our Sense of the Senate language is important. When we return to this issue in the future, it is essential that Congress act expeditiously to appropriate the funds. So I think this is a timely bill and strongly support its adoption. 
I also support the privatization decisions which have been made by the Administration and by the USEC Board. There is little question that the current course of action is in the best long-term interest of the employees at the Paducah facility. As a private corporation, USEC will be more efficient. It will be better suited to enter into long-term contracts and recapture its world market share for uranium enrichment. It will be better suited to implement the technology of the future, which many believe will be the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS) technology. And it will be better suited to provide for the long-term employment of the workers at the two current facilities. 
Mr. President, I urge the passage of this bill and will continue to work with my colleagues to get this proposal to the President's desk in the days ahead.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, first, we should not be legislating on appropriations bills. We are getting to a point that we cannot pass appropriations bills for all the legislation that is on the appropriations bills, especial something of this magnitude. 
I understand how easy it is to talk emotionally about children, but there are two things wrong with this amendment. One, it is not relevant, because under the unanimous consent agreement that these would be relevant amendments, this is not. So you have a point there. Second, there is a budget point of order that will be made against the amendment, and therefore we should go ahead and, I guess, get rid of it. 
But this is just nibbling again. The bill I wanted to try to get through here did not go. I wanted to take care of my farmers a little bit, but no one seems to think about those. It makes it a little bit hard to take. But the amendment invites us to reopen the tobacco debate, and I do not think this is the time or the place. What is next, liability limitations? That would be quite a debate. What next, tax increases? That would be a real debate. What next, new programs? That is what we have here, new programs. 
We began debating this bill on June 18, 4 weeks ago. It is time we stopped considering legislative amendments that go way beyond the scope of this bill. 
I received, and I guess all my Democratic colleagues received: 
Support Harkin amendment to fund FDA's ongoing teen antitobacco initiative. This is no anti-teen-smoking initiative, when you get right down to it. The amendment fully funds the FDA youth and anti-tobacco efforts by imposing a tobacco industry user's fee of $100 million, or approximately $25 per child who uses tobacco products. How do you know that? It is really not $100 million. The amendment says $150 million. Are we into that phrase now, `a haircut'--you have to raise $150 million to get $100 million? Anyhow, the information I got was it was $100 million. I read the amendment and it says $150 million. 
This is a tax on adults. This is a tax on adults. It says the tobacco product market share. It has nothing to do with how many teens smoke. We hear about `spit tobacco.' The HHS set a level, by the year 2000, of no more than 4 percent of those between 12 and 17 would be using spit tobacco. The rate today is 1.9. The industry is doing a wonderful job--twice the amount that was set by HHS by the year 2000, without any imposition by this legislative body. So now we are putting a tax on adult smokers, trying to fog it up with teen programs. 
Mr. President, I understand what is going on. This is a new tax being described as a $25-per-kid tax without any basis. It started out with a survey. That is a terrible way to tax. It has nothing to do with youth smoking or how many youth are smoking. This is a $150-million tax increase as assessed based on the share of the adult market--not teenagers, the adult market. It was based on the adult use of the product and taxes adult use of the product. It should not be on an agricultural bill. 
The amendment raises taxes, not by $100 million that we have heard, but $150 million. It is based on a terrible public policy. We should not be raising taxes on an agriculture appropriations bill anyhow. This amendment should be defeated, maybe not for its purpose, but for its procedure. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair for the description. 
Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me to join with my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee. He is my friend. He is a gentleman in the best tradition of Virginia. I appreciate the honor that he has proposed for me this morning. It will be the first piece of legislation in 24 years that carries my name. I hope it doesn't impede the progress, however. I am grateful to the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, for his gracious remarks this morning. Hopefully, that tenor will continue through the consideration of this legislation by all of our colleagues, because our heart is right as it relates to the introduction of this legislation. 
I hope our minds have put together a piece of legislation that will be lasting. But there is one thing about this institution; once it settles in and you find some problems with it, you always have the opportunity to correct those problems. Most of the time, we do not `throw the baby out with the bath water'; we take the changes and do them in an appropriate way. 
So I join my colleague in introducing this legislation today to ensure one thing, Mr. President--that the American public continues to have access to the Government information. As my friend has said, it pays to produce. It is the people's access to Government, Government information, that forms the basis of our system of Government and ensures that democracy survives.

Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Wellstone amendment. I am honored to be able to add my name as an original cosponsor to this important amendment. 
Booker T. Washington wrote that `success is to be measured not so much by the position one has reached in life as by the obstacles which one has overcome while trying to succeed.' 
He might well have been talking about the single, uneducated parents in this country trying to turn their lives around, while ensuring their children grow up in a healthy, safe environment. 
Things like child care, transportation, and education, become obstacles of insurmountable proportions for these struggling parents, putting jobs that can build secure futures further and further out of reach. 
As many of my colleagues know, I supported and voted for welfare reform. It's been almost two years since Congress rewrote our welfare laws in hopes of breaking the cycle of dependency that was trapping too many Americans in poverty and despair. Much good has come of that law, including substantial drops in the welfare rolls, saving states like Kentucky $14 million. 
But despite its good intentions, the new welfare law is penalizing parents trying to improve their chances at getting good jobs. Under the new law, a parent must work 20 hours to continue receiving aid. 
That might not seem particularly onerous, but the law also limits these single parents to just one year of education before requiring them to find work.  
Let me just repeat that. But the law also limits these single parents to just 1 year of education before requiring them to find work. 
As one of Kentucky community college wrote me, `for even the best prepared traditional students, our community college programs require two years with a full load of course work. The best prepared traditional student, however, doesn't represent our average student. With over 70 percent of our students testing into developmental English, reading or math courses, the extra time needed to prepare for actual college course work is critical to their success. Twelve months is inadequate time for a person to move from a life of dependence upon government assistance to a life of independence and self-sufficiency.' 
For most single parents, the burden of going to school full-time, holding down a part-time job, all while trying to raise healthy children, will simply become too much, forcing them to choose a low-paying job with no future over the path to skilled, high-paying work. 
Leaders in my home state of Kentucky, like Representative Tom Burch, recognized this problem. But their efforts to change the policy have been hampered by fears that the state will lose critical federal funds, further short-changing those who need the aid most. 
That is why I am pleased to join in offering this amendment which will stop penalizing parents trying to improve their situation. 
This amendment allows up to 24 months of post-secondary or vocational education, removes the 30 percent limitation on education as a work activity for teen parents, and clarifies that participation in a federal work-study program is a permissible work activity. 
In my state, nearly 4,000 parents could benefit directly from these changes. But the truth is, they're not the only ones who stand to benefit. With the economy growing in Kentucky, employers are having a harder time finding qualified employees. 
With good-paying jobs, these parents can provide a much better quality of life for their children, and that adds up to success no matter how you measure it. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this worthwhile amendment.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have one other item I would like to put in the Record. It is an editorial from the Lexington Herald-Leader dated July 1, 1998. I only quote a couple of paragraphs from that editorial. It says: 
We urge Congress to endorse such a change in a welfare policy that right now insists on work first, education later. It makes sense that work be the priority but not at the expense of forcing the most motivated to choose an entry-level job over a career track. 
It is a shame we have to pass laws to mandate what is common sense. A better education leads to career opportunities and long-term self-sufficiency. 
And they end that editorial with this paragraph: 
One thing we do know. In this country, education is the surest route out of poverty. And we shouldn't close off that option by forcing people out of college into any old kind of job just so we can proclaim that we made the transition from welfare to work.

Mr. FORD. I don't know how many of my colleagues have been to junior colleges in the last year. I don't know how many of my colleagues have been to universities and colleges that have these types of individuals who have started. I go to my community college, and I talk to them. And this young lady with tears in her eyes says, `I finally am on the edge of opportunity, and that edge is being sharpened by 1 year, and I have to leave education and go to work.' She said, `I cannot handle a job, I cannot handle education, I cannot handle my children, unless you give me this opportunity.' 
I have looked into the eyes of those who want to do better, who can do better, and we must give them that opportunity so they can have that better life. I hope that the 4,000 in my State have that opportunity for that second year of education, that opportunity to find that job, and that opportunity to make a better life for their children. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank the chairman.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am surprised at the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee for objecting to an individual having the opportunity to get an education. He ought to understand better than anybody in this Senate Chamber that education is power, education levels the playing field, education gives people an opportunity to do things that they have always wanted to do. The employers will be able to reach out to get individuals who are educated and trained. These people we are trying to help here want to get out of welfare. They want to be educated. They want better jobs. They want to take care of their children. If education does not belong on a higher education bill, I don't understand where it belongs. 
The employers want better employees. Where do you get better employees but educated employees? Where do you find them today? Those who are on welfare, trying to get out of welfare, get out of Catch-22. 
We have the American Association of Community Colleges that endorses this amendment, the State Directors of Vocational Technical Education Consortium, Career College Association, the Children's Defense Fund, Center for Women Policy Studies, American Association of University Women, the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education, the American Council on Education. I could go on and on, of the associations that endorse this amendment. 
So we are saying here this is going to destroy the welfare program? How in the world are they going to buy a Roth IRA, if they don't have a better job and have more money so they can save? 
Mr. President, I hope the distinguished Senator would understand we are trying to get them out of poverty, give them a good job, help the employers--and higher education is where this amendment belongs. I hope this doesn't destroy welfare. We have a bipartisan effort here. These people are Democrats and Republicans who have endorsed this amendment. 
So I am hopeful we would not look at this amendment as destroying the welfare reform bill that I voted for and that I supported. I think this is one place, now that it is in place, soon to be a 2-year anniversary, that we would have an opportunity to correct those things that we made a mistake on. This is one we made a mistake on. It belongs in the higher education bill. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. Moynihan addressed the Chair.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is hard for me to understand, when this was a House bill and it came over and the Senate committee studied it and sent it to the Senate floor with a substitute amendment, and then we don't want to take the committee substitute amendment. 
`There is something about that,' as we would say down in West Kentucky, `that ain't right.' So we are again telling the committee you can go through all of your work, you can do your hearings, you can do your markup, but you did the wrong thing. 
So I think the amendment that we offered, which was a committee amendment as modified, was appropriate. If the majority leader wishes to object to that, why, that is the way it has to be.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, just entered a colloquy as it related to the tax situation between Kentucky and Tennessee. I wanted to be sure that my remarks on the unconstitutionality of that amendment were brought to the attention of my colleague. 
Mr. President, there is a provision in the House version of this bill that really astounds me. I am referring to an amendment to title X of the House bill which was offered by Congressman Bryant. I wish to bring it to the attention of the managers. It is a tax issue involving the States of Kentucky and Tennessee. Let me restate that. 
It is a tax issue--not even a federal tax issue, but a state tax issue--and it is mentioned in the House version of this bill. 
The House bill contains language which preempts state tax laws and lays out how federal and private sector employees who may do work at the Fort Campbell Army installation should be taxed by states. I think all Senators should be concerned by the precedent set by this language. Let me make a few points relevant to this language. 
The language in the House bill raises fundamental TAX issues. It is within the jurisdiction of the Finance and Ways and Means Committees. It has no place on this bill. 
The House tax language involves issues that should be decided among States. Congress should not be dictating state tax policies in a Defense Authorization bill. Congress should not be preempting state tax laws in a Defense bill. 
At my urging, our Governor's office has contacted the Tennessee Governor's office. Revenue officials from both States have had preliminary discussions in the last few weeks. We should allow this process of negotiation to continue. That is the usual way in which States deal with tax issues like this one. Not on the floor of the House or Senate.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on July 17, 1996, President Clinton supported legislative language establishing a two-year `pilot program' to identify and demonstrate a safe and cost-effective technology for the destruction of chemical weapon munitions stockpiles. 
The language signed into law by the President directed the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology to designate a program and appoint an executive officer to carry out the pilot program who was not, nor had been, in direct or immediate control of the Army Baseline Chemical Incineration Demilitarization program. 
The legislation further prohibited the obligation of funds at two chemical weapons stockpile sites--Lexington Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky and the Pueblo Depot in Colorado--pending the outcome of the two-year research program. 
It is Senator McConnell's and my understanding that the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment (ACWA) program has been a success in its initial stages. The management team for ACWA has just completed selecting seven technology teams who will conduct further evaluations toward a possible demonstration phase later this year. Based on information received, I am encouraged that at least two of the non-incineration technologies will be available for full scale testing by fiscal year 2000. 
I am also very impressed with the very effective `dialogue' process including local citizens, state regulators, environmental organizations, tribal representatives, and many others in building a consensus in the ACWA program. I'm hopeful this open exchange will help in the eventual deployment and operation of a non-incineration facility, ensuring the days of delay and distraction that have plagued the chemical demilitarization program will soon be over. 
Because of this success, I believe the ACWA `dialogue' will continue as a central part of the decision-making and consensus building in the Chemical Weapons Destruction program. 
Mr. President, the amendment we introduce today does many things in the area of chemical demilitarization. It directs that the ACWA program must continue its independence from the baseline incinerator program through the next phase of pilot and full scale development. This will prevent any break or pause in the ACWA program by disallowing any transfer of responsibility for the program while making sure it meets the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty (CWC) deadlines. 
The program will stay under the direct supervision of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. The ACWA program manager will continue to act independently of the program manager for the Baseline Chemical Demilitarization Program. 
This amendment also provides $18 million additional dollars so the Program manager of ACWA can move forward to meet the CWC deadline of 2007, which can be expanded until the year 2012. The additional funds authorized for chemical demilitarization for fiscal year 1999 will not come from the funds for the alternative technologies `Bulk Pilot Program.' 
Mr. President, I want to thank the leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee for accepting this amendment. I would also like to thank Ms. Monica Chavez and Mr. Richard Fieldhouse of the committee staff for working with my staff in developing this amendment. Also, Mr. Billy Piper, Senator  McConnell's military legislative assistant, should be commended for a job well done.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I'm offering this amendment for myself and my Co-Chairman of the Senate National Guard Caucus, Senator Bond, along with Senators Lott, Stevens and Grassely. 
Last year conferees added language to the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense Authorization bill requiring all counter-drug missions conducted by National Guard units to comply with section 2012 of Title 10 and section 508 of Title 32. Before these changes, National Guard men and women supported Federal, State and Local law enforcement agencies in a wide variety of ways from transcription and translation of DEA wiretaps to aerial and ground thermal imaging of suspected indoor marijuana growing to maintaining listening and Observation posts along the Southwest Border. But because of changes in last year's bill, National Guard members now can only participate in counter drug missions if the mission contributes to their military speciality skills or MOS. For example, this means a member of National Guard whose MOS is a radio specialist could only work in that speciality or if an airman is a mechanic he or she could only repair an airplane! 
You won't find anyone in the Guard Bureau or the Department of Defense who has ever claimed that counter-drug duty has a negative impact on the training and readiness of National Guard personnel. In fact, there's empirical evidence that counter-drug duty enhances the military readiness of National Guard personnel. And because counter-drug duty is in addition to the required readiness training, it adds no extra readiness training costs. Our amendment will correct this problem, deleting the provisions added in the Fiscal Year 1998 bill, and allowing the National Guard to continue this supportive role in federal, state and local drug demand reduction, as well as interdiction missions. 
The amendment would also clarify how National Guard personnel can be used in counter-drug activity when providing support to certain youth and charitable organizations. Our amendment would amend the definition of drug interdiction and counter-drug activities to specify that such activities include drug demand reduction activities. By providing support to youth and charitable organizations as part of state counter-drug activities, demand reduction has been part of the National Guard program since its inception and has had the approval of the Secretary of Defense. Language in last year's Defense Authorization bill presented major problems in the Guard's ability to interact with these groups. 
Our amendment also says that federal funds provided to a state for counter-drug activity can be used to procure or lease equipment. Current law authorizes leasing, but precludes the procurement of equipment. This forces states to lease equipment even though it would be more cost effective to purchase the equipment. Examples of equipment that would be more cost effective to purchase then lease would be Night Vision goggles, Infrared I.D. equipment and Range Finders.

Mr. FORD. In closing, I want to tell the members of the Armed Services Committee and their staffs how much I appreciate their consideration and willingness to accept this amendment. I know they'll do the best they can to assure this amendment remains in the final bill. 
Exhibit 1. 
Section-by-Section Analysis 
Subsection (a) would specify that Federal Funds provided to a State under a State plan can be used to procure or lease equipment for the National Guard to use in support of drug interdiction and counter-drug activities. A strict interpretation of the current statutory language would authorize the leasing, but preclude the procurement, of equipment necessary to carry out the purposes of the statute. Such an interpretation would impose unnecessary expenses on the program because it would force states to lease equipment in situations where procuring equipment would be more cost effective. This interpretation would also prevent participation in authorized support missions when necessary equipment cannot be leased. The statute needs to be clarified to ensure that States have flexibility in deciding whether to lease or purchase equipment based on considerations of economy and determinations of necessity. 
Subsection (b) would eliminate the provision in paragraph (b)(2) of section 112 that provides that units and personnel of the National Guard can only perform drug interdiction and counter-drug activities that comply with the requirements of section 2012(d) of title 10, United States Code. Paragraph (b)(2) was enacted as part of the Department of Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 (public law 105-85) to ensure that the use of units and personnel of the National Guard pursuant to a State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities plan is not detrimental to their training and readiness. However, the restrictions in section 2012(d) are not tailored to address the unique nature of the National Guard drug interdiction and counter-drug program. National Guard personnel may derive readiness and preparedness benefits from their participation in activities under section 112, but such activities are in addition to, not in lieu of, required training. If this provision is enacted, National Guard personnel on extended Counterdrug orders will not lose any benefits while performing their required IDT and Annual Training requirements. 
Subsection (b) would also facilitate the accomplishment of training, by adding a new provision to enable National Guard members on extended tours of duty in the drug interdiction and counter-drug program to participate in required IDT and AT with their units without breaking their orders for counter-drug duty. During such training periods, covered individuals would be entitled to the same pay and benefits which they would otherwise receive if continuously performing duty for the purpose of carrying out drug interdiction and counter-drug activities. This will ensure that these individuals, while performing AT, do not lose any of the benefits associated with the longer period of counter-drug duty. This will also clarify that such individuals, while performing IDT, are entitled to pay associated with full-time National Guard duty, but not additional drill pay. 
Subsection (c) would clarify and revise the provision in subsection (b)(3) of section 112 that makes the restrictions in section 508 of title 32 applicable to situations in which units or members of the National Guard are used, pursuant to a State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities plan, to provide support to certain youth and charitable organizations. Under subsections (a)(3) and (a)(4) of section 508, services cannot be provided to eligible organizations unless the provision of such services enhances military skills and does not result in a significant increase in the cost of training. Because counter-drug activities are not incidental to training, but are in addition to training, these restrictions present a problem. The proposed revision would eliminate these restrictions, but would continue to make the other provisions in section 508 applicable to situations in which services or assistance are provided to an eligible organization as part of a state counter-drug activities plan. 
Subsection (d) would amend the definition of drug interdiction and counter-drug activities to specify that such activities for purposes of section 112 include drug demand reduction activities. Although drug demand reduction has been part of the activities carried out under section 112 since the inception of the program, the statute needs to be clarified to specifically include such activities to avoid confusion that results from a strict interpretation of the statute. Like any other counter-drug activities, proposed drug demand reduction activities must have a law enforcement nexus in order to be acceptable under a State plan.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the concerns I have about recent proposals to dramatically change the regulatory structure of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Recently, legislation was introduced to make dramatic changes in the regulatory structure of TVA, starting with the granting of regulatory authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
TVA has had remarkably stable rates over the last decade, with only one significant rate increase during this time period. I agreed that TVA has not been run perfectly through the years. However, to consider a substantial regulatory overhaul for this agency at a time when comprehensive electric industry deregulation is right around the corner appears to me to be premature and unwise. Legislation to impose additional regulatory controls at a time when the Congress is beginning to seriously consider significantly less regulation for the rest of the industry seems contradictory to me. 
In addition, I have concerns about the impact of such a proposal on the coal industry in my state. I would strongly oppose efforts to impose a new federal regulatory layer that may limit the flexibility of TVA to purchase Kentucky coal. TVA buys over 26 million tons of Kentucky coal per year, which adds $600 million to the economy of my State. TVA is responsible for more than 20 percent of all coal purchases in Kentucky. 
I have heard from many Kentuckians who are concerned about this new regulatory proposal. I wish to place my colleagues on notice that I will strongly oppose any such regulatory scheme, and will oppose other overhaul efforts outside of the context of deregulation legislation. It makes no sense to consider two major regulatory changes in such a short period of time.

Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, a few moments ago, my colleague from Kentucky inserted some editorials in the Record--a few, and selective letters to the editor concerning our debate over the future of tobacco farmers. 
I do not want to take a lot of time on this matter, but I do not want anyone to get the mistaken impression that these articles represent the prevailing view in my State. I have 30 pages or more here, Madam President, of articles of my own, editorials with headlines like--and this is the Owensboro Messenger and Inquirer that my colleague mentioned a few moments ago. It says, `Lugar Tobacco Bill Punishes Farmers.' I think that tells a lot and that there are opinions at home that are somewhat different.

Mr. FORD. Madam President, let me just pick out a couple of headlines here. `The best deal? Plan McConnell backs brings in quick cash, but would ultimately kill off small farms.' `Untimely demise. McConnell plan kills tobacco program too fast.' 
These are in the Record. 
My colleague, Senator McConnell, referred to Congressman Ron Lewis who is for his position. Well, let me just say this, that Congressman Ron Lewis said that blood would run through Congress before he would give up the fight for the quota system. Then all of a sudden he now is for selling out. The Republican nominee to replace me for the U.S. Senate is for the LEAF program, not for the side that Senator McConnell is on. So it raises a lot of suspicion in the minds of my folks back home. Are Senator McConnell and Senator Lugar supporting the manufacturers or are they supporting the farmer? Because if the Lugar plan would go into effect, it would save the tobacco manufacturers a minimum of $1 billion a year over the next 25 years. 
And so when you have one major statewide official in Kentucky, elected official, representing the tobacco farmers in Kentucky for one position, the others the other way--our Governor supports the LEAF plan--I just do not understand. Maybe it is the big bucks for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee to kill this bill and, in fact, killing the bill, then can say that the farmers continue to grow as they are. But then everybody is worried about their demise. And if you have a demise of the tobacco program, then we are in mighty bad shape without funding. 
I was criticized for supporting Senator McCain and $1.10, but then we find the Lugar-McConnell plan is using that money to pay the farmers. If we didn't have the money, we would not be able to pay the farmers. 
So, this thing gets awful mixed up. I will be very hopeful about those who read this and those who understand what is happening. 
I have a lot here I could talk about, but we have ENACT, that supports the Ford-Hollings plan; an open letter from the tobacco States, from all of the health groups and the tobacco groups supporting our plan. It just seems some way, somehow, there is something more than trying to do something for farmers here and those who are trying to defeat the program. 
I might just say in closing, here is the Chicago Tribune today: `Health Funds Lose In Tobacco Talks: Everybody else gets their project on and youth are forgotten.' If we are going to forget youth in this bill, maybe it is time we send it back to the Commerce Committee and try to write a bill that will be on target, that will save the youth from smoking. 
I think these young pages, after they hear the debate here, will never want to smoke, and I hope that is true. But when they become 21, they can do basically whatever they want to do. At that point, if they have not started smoking, they probably will not. But at the same time, we have a lot of folks who depend on this program. What we have done is help phase it out rather than cut it off at the knees. 
One of the things my friends on the other side, Senator Lugar and Senator McConnell, fail to say is when they do away with the program and the farmers get some money, they lose the value of their land. By some $7 billion in Kentucky alone, the value of farmland will be reduced, because the farmland is based on the tobacco quota. When you advertise a farm for sale, you put what the tobacco quota is in that farm sale. 
So, if we lose the farm program, as they would try to do, then we lose $7 billion in farmland value almost immediately. Some farmers could go to bed at night with their farm at one price, get up in the next morning and their farmland is at a lower price and it doesn't cover the mortgage, and the bank will foreclose on those farmers. 
People have not thought this through: `Pay them some money, and get out of the business.' Pay them a little bit of money, help them through the transition period here so we might be able to save their way of life. 
If my 5 minutes is up, I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Delaware. He is always gracious, and I appreciate him as a friend very much.

<TEXT>
Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we will discuss this amendment, I am sure, at great length. We have here a system for producers who are experiencing farm income loss which we feel is only fair and will help farmers all across the country. 
Members have heard two of our distinguished colleagues and the chairman of the Commerce Committee saying that they hope we can move forward with passage of this bill this week. I do, too. 
I also want to say I have a lot to say about this amendment I have just offered because it goes to the heart of this bill for me and for my constituents and it deals directly, it deals most directly, with how my constituents are treated. Very briefly, if the quota is removed, you make the tobacco companies another $1 billion a year. If you remove the tobacco quota, the value of the land in Kentucky to my farmers is reduced up to $7 billion. A farmer could go to bed tonight having a mortgage that was completely covered by the land he owned or had mortgaged, and we take the tobacco quota away from him and he wakes up the next morning and he doesn't have enough value for that land to cover his mortgage, and his mortgage is called. 
So I think it is important that we begin to look at the ramifications of losing the tobacco program as we know it. We have tried to put into this amendment the transition from where we are today as it relates to the tobacco program to what might come in the future if we reduce underage smoking. I am very much for the reduction of underage smoking. Let's put that up front. I have no problem with that. But in the fact of reducing teen smoking or underage smoking, it is pretty tough to put people out of business. 
So we will be discussing this amendment for some time. My colleague and friend from Virginia, Senator Robb--and there will be other Senators on our side--will be supporting this amendment, and I think there will be some Senators on the other side of the aisle who may want to speak, who will be supporting this amendment. 
What I do under this amendment is to strike title XV, and that is doing away with the tobacco program and using 69 percent of all the moneys in this bill for health programs, for research, and for child care. It is very, very important not only to the farmers of my State but those health groups. We have 24 health groups in this country that have endorsed the LEAF program. The smoke-free kids--there is a letter on your desk that shows that they support the LEAF Act. ENACT supports the LEAF Act. All farmer organizations, practically, that have some longevity to them support the LEAF Act. 
Let me summarize the main reasons why title XV must not remain in this bill. Now, title XV is designed, whether on purpose or not, to save tobacco companies $1 billion a year. So you get down and the vote ultimately will be: Are you going to vote for the farmers? Are you going to vote for the cigarette manufacturers? Are you going to take $1 billion off the backs of the tobacco farmers and give that saving to the cigarette manufacturers? Make no mistake, title XV forces Senators to choose between the tobacco companies and the tobacco farmers. Unless we want to save tobacco companies $1 billion per year at the expense of the tobacco farmer, the motion to strike must be supported. 
Now, title X, not title XV, is supported overwhelmingly by a majority of tobacco farm organizations. I have a list of all those and probably will insert those in the Record or read them later. Title XV is not supported by the public health 
community. The public health community supports the LEAF Act. They support retaining the program. They support keeping control over the growth of tobacco and the prices high. So, it is heartening that the health groups and the tobacco groups have gotten together and signed the core principles. Those core principles are to reduce underage smoking, to keep the tobacco program. All these principles are out there. 
If this motion passes, the public health programs and health research programs in this bill, if my amendment passes, we save 69 percent of all the moneys that would go into the health research and development. Title XV eats up 47 percent of the funds in the bill over the first 3 years. Title XV, known as the Lugar-McConnell amendment, already has an amendment at the desk, and that amendment says that all the money in this bill, up to 47 percent, will go to that program in the first 3 years. So 40 percent to the States, 47 percent to this program; that is 87 percent of all the money. Where are you going to get the marriage penalty? How are you going to do the drug amendment that Senator Coverdell put up? 
So, we will talk about how title X was developed. I think my colleague from Virginia wishes to make some remarks.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Georgia for his eloquent remarks and hope that our colleagues were listening and they understand well what drives us who are more familiar maybe with the tobacco farmer, the small farmer. 
The distinguished Senator from Indiana laid out how he arrived at where he is as it relates to his position on the tobacco farmer. It is ideology with him more than it is fact for the farmer. He just does not believe that Government ought to help people, and so therefore he thinks everybody ought to be out there scratching on their own. And maybe that is the correct way. But I have always thought that government is here to serve people, and if it does not serve people, then we do not need government. 
I guess the Senator from Indiana understands that what he is about to do is just put people out of business. Under the Freedom to Farm Act, we are paying for millions of acres--millions of acres--and under the tobacco program there are less than a million total. Under the Freedom to Farm Act, the purpose there was to increase production. What Senator Lugar will do, if his amendment is agreed to, will be to put people out of business. 
I have sat on a good many front porches, Mr. President; I have been in many kitchens having a cup of coffee with the farmer, his wife, and family; I have been in seven States talking to farmers--as we would say, to the people who put the tobacco on the stick. I think I understand their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations, and all have been based on history and what they expect the future to bring. 
I have a statement here from the National Commission on Small Farms. The National Commission on Small Farms said:  
The tobacco program for more than 50 years has cushioned small farmers, African American farmers, new and beginning farmers, by providing them a degree of economic certainty. It's not the tobacco crop for which there is no alternative but the tobacco program itself. 
There is a strange thing in the Lugar amendment that was put on after the committee had met and sent the bill to the floor. The Lugar amendment does away with the program. That means the tobacco farmer can grow all the tobacco he wants to grow from year 1, but the Lugar amendment keeps the price support in for 3 years. 
Now, think about that. Here I am, a farmer growing 10,000 pounds of tobacco. They do away with the program. I can grow all the tobacco I want, as we would say at home, fencerow to fencerow. They keep the tobacco support program in place for 3 years, and so I grow twice the amount of tobacco, get the price support, and nobody wants my tobacco, so it goes to the so-called pool or into surplus. You do that for 3 years. At the end of 3 years, it is all gone. The pool is lying there with hundreds of millions of pounds of tobacco. Then what happens? The general fund will pick up that tab. Oh, there is a provision in here that says we will pay so much to try to offset that, but it doesn't work. 
And you know something that didn't happen as a result of the Freedom to Farm Act that we hear Senator Lugar was a strong supporter of. In my State, if we lose the tobacco program, it will reduce the value of the farmland up to $7 billion. 
If you take the program away from the farmers, you have four companies that control 98 percent of tobacco, and the farmers don't have a thing to fight with, other than the program. What do you think the price of tobacco is going to do? It is going to decline rapidly, and it will make a minimum, under this bill--well, beginning the first year--a minimum average to the tobacco manufacturers of $1 billion a year off the backs of a few farmers. All we are talking about is 124,000. 
So the vote comes down to: Are you going to vote to support the farmer, or are you going to support Senator Lugar's bill that gives $1 billion a year to the tobacco manufacturers?

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is pretty tough when you have gone to the bank and borrowed money based on the value of your property, your farm, and overnight--overnight--the value of your property is reduced several hundred dollars per acre because you have lost your tobacco program that is of value. 
You go to bed tonight with a loan from the bank and your property will cover that loan, and in the morning, you have no program; the price of your property has been reduced and your mortgage is called. This is what I call a taking, Mr. President. We hear a lot about takings around here, about taking property, but you are taking the value of the land of this small farmer. 
As we say down in West Kentucky where I come from, `Something about that ain't right.' 
What do we do? We hear a lot about the buyout and money upfront and the older people who would like to sell out. Under the LEAF Act, that occurs. Anyone who wants to buy out at $8 a pound, the tenant, the lessee can sell. They can offer their crop for a buyout, and it will be done. It also says that one quota holder can sell to another quota holder. But it also says that if you want to continue under the present program, you can't. 
All agricultural economies--and I am sure a lot of folks here understands it--agribusiness says that it takes 10 to 15 years, and leans toward the 15 years, for a community to transform from one economic aspect to the other. 
We see under Senator Lugar's amendment--which was never voted on by the committee while the hearings were going on or when we had the regular markup; it was done here on the Senate floor by checking the majority on the Commerce Committee and the majority leader putting it in. I thought I had helped the chairman, Senator Hollings, and others get this bill out of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and on to the Senate floor. 
If you wonder how much money the Lugar amendment will take, they have submitted an amendment which is at the desk which will take 47 percent of all the money. If that amendment to this bill, which is at the desk and has not been called up yet, is adopted, I believe it is 47 percent, maybe 48 percent of all the money will go to this one project. If 40 percent of the money goes to the States, that is 88 percent of all the money. What we find is that those health programs that we want to fund have become discretionary. They are not part of the budget process; they are not part of the estimated amount coming in under this bill. They will be discretionary, and they will be subject to appropriations. 
When you live with these people, having been one of them, 
having been a farmer, and you see them every day, it seems a little bit ironic that we are telling them what is good for them, because this year they voted 97 and 98 percent to keep the program. Yet, we are saying to them, `You don't know what you are talking about; you don't know what you voted for; we're going to change it; we're going to do away with that program that 98 percent of the farmers said they want to keep.' 
We say to them, `You don't know, we know better than you do,' and that is what I said earlier. One of the reasons this place isn't liked is because we get 98 percent of a group of people who say we want to keep this, and we say, `No, we know better than you do, so we're going to take it away from you.' 
Oh, you can go out there and get all kinds of polls. You can get the fellow who grows 600,000 pounds of tobacco a year, and he sure would like to have 4.8 million. They say under the Lugar bill you can keep growing. Sure, but at what price? 
My Agriculture Department estimates that the 65,000 farm families in Kentucky will be reduced to less than 10 percent. Only the big farmers can contract with the manufacturers who will be getting $1 billion more a year. Do you want to vote for the farmer, or do you want to vote for the tobacco manufacturers? It comes down to that. 
Just think, you will be reducing farm values in my State by up to $7 billion. I have heard a lot from the other side of the aisle and some on this side about property rights. I have talked to my home builders and others who worry about takings. Under this one amendment, if this one amendment is adopted, up to $7 billion in farm value will be lost. That is almost one-third of the farm value in my State. Approximately $20 billion is the assessed value of the farm property in Kentucky. So we are reducing the value of that land and the ability of that farmer to secure a loan. 
It doesn't make any difference how much money you give him. Our average is about 3,000 pounds, and you want to pay it over 3 years. That is $24,000. Then, you are going to pay tax on it. Boy, that is really going to be great. Only the large farmers are the ones who have the voice. The small farmer down there working depends on others. But Hamilton said in these Halls, meaning the House and the Senate, `The people's voice shall be heard by their immediate representative.' 
I am that immediate representative. And I am trying to bring the voice of the small farmer to the attention of my colleagues here in the Senate. 
Is this emotional for me? Of course it is. In my last few months here in the Senate, I ought to be over there taking care of constituents, packing up my papers, getting them to the university, getting ready to go home and spend some time with my family. But, no; the worst political question of my career, the toughest one I have ever had, is now in the last 6 months of my service in the U.S. Senate. 
You sit on the front porch with these farmers. You sit in the kitchen and drink coffee with them and their families. From back in June of 1997, last year, June 20, the farmers have been on a roller coaster ever since. 
Let me try to describe a little better where I come from with my LEAF Act. Tobacco farmers tried to get in on the negotiations between the Attorney General, the tobacco companies, and public health groups. They were not let in the room. They were not even let in the room. I tried to find out what was going on. It was private. It was quiet. It was closed. But the White House was there. The health groups were there. The attorneys general were there. The tobacco companies were there. But the ones who are going to get hurt the most were not there. Now we are trying to hurt them even more. 
The June 20 settlement did not include one dime for the tobacco farmer. But there is $750 million in there for NASCAR and rodeos. And I didn't hear anybody say, `Take that out.' No. `Take it away from the farmer. Don't take it away from NASCAR. Don't take it away from rodeos. Let them advertise at rodeos. Let them advertise at NASCAR.' 
I am for the Winston 500. I do not have any problem with that. But I have not heard a word in here, or from the other side, that they gave too much to NASCAR, that they gave too much to rodeos. But, boy, you sure are taking away from the farmer down there who has labored all his life and has produced a superior product. 
Alben Barkley, on this floor in 1939, put in the tobacco program. It took him 3 years--1936 through 1939. Alben Barkley was a pretty good legislator. He was a mighty fine Vice President. I think he understood his people as well as anybody. And it hasn't changed. I wish I had the ability that Alben Barkley had to speak and to convince people that what I am trying to do is right. 
But sitting on those front porches, sitting in the kitchens and talking to the farm families, I told them to get to work and come up with something that they felt would be acceptable. And to work they went. They developed a comprehensive plan not just for individual tobacco farms but for their communities as well. We have not thought about Russellville or Horse Cave or Glasgow or Springfield or Carrollton. They are small farm communities that depend on tobacco. And their banks depend on tobacco. Their businesses depend on tobacco. Fifty percent of their income comes from tobacco. 
The average, in my State, is 25 percent is farm income. There are loans because the value of the property is there. The banker understands as long as the program is there, it gives them financial stability. 
And so last October, after months and weeks of work, we introduced the Long-Term Economic Assistance for Farmers Act, what we call the LEAF Act. And, you know, even the night before I 
introduced that--and we all sat around, made one change--we all shook hands and got up and left, that this is what we are going to support. And it was cosponsored by nine tobacco State Senators--myself, Senator Helms, Senator Faircloth, Senator McConnell, Senator Hollings, Senator Thurmond, Senator Frist, Senator Cleland, and Senator Coverdell. All of us agreed that this was in the best interest of the tobacco farmers and the communities and the welfare of our States. 
Since that time, we have worked hard to broaden our consensus, including changes sought by Senators Robb and Warner of Virginia and their tobacco growers. We made those changes. We accepted a broader consensus. This modified version of the LEAF Act is now included in the bill before the Senate in title X. Title XV, on the other hand, was inserted into the bill at the last minute after we got to the floor. It was never debated in the Commerce Committee. It was never debated during the markup. And all of a sudden here it comes--after we had an agreement. And the chairman went and explained the bill to farmers and what was in it. 
It provides buyout payments for tobacco farmers who want to leave the program. And they keep using, against this bill, that, `You take our money and you can keep on growing.' Well, if you keep the program and you sell out, that reduces--you no longer can grow, you don't want to grow. It may be the widow who has the quota. It may be the elderly couple who can no longer perform. But remember this: 69 percent of all the farmers in Kentucky, 69 percent of all the quota holders in Kentucky, have another job. This is a husband, wife, and family operation; 3,000 pounds, 3,100 pounds. Instead of hiring help, they do it themselves. And that money is theirs. They buy a major appliance. They paint the house. They get a new truck, pay on the mortgage, help send the kids to school. 
What are we saying to those families now? `In 36 months you're gone.' Three thousand pounds is the average. That is $24,000; $8,000 a year. And you are going to pay tax on it. Hasn't anybody said whether there is going to be capital gains or regular taxes? If it is capital gains, it is 20 percent. So you take $1,600 out of that right off the top. I have not heard whether it is going to be capital gains or regular taxes. Maybe some people who understand the tax program better than I do can come up here and say how great it is going to be, and they will not have to pay any. 
There are buyout payments for tobacco farmers who want to leave the program. But under the Lugar amendment, the program is gone. And for 3 years you still pay them so much per pound, and they can grow all they want to. So it costs the taxpayers lots and lots of money, and nothing will go to the farmer, it will go to the pool. And then after the 3 years, there is nothing. And who owns it? Who is going to pay for it? I think I know, and I think the Senator from Indiana knows. 
It reforms and maintains a tobacco-supplied management program. We have a core principle statement by about 24 health groups and the tobacco groups that they support--whatever--to reduce youth smoking. But they also support keeping the program. It maintains a tobacco-supplied management program. Without a tobacco-supplied management program, the 124,000 tobacco farm families in this country--which their average tobacco growing in various States varies, the amounts--have absolutely no bargaining power to deal with the four largest tobacco corporations. 
We are getting to a point where everybody is getting down to just a small group controlling everything. 
Four tobacco manufacturers control 98 percent of the tobacco grown in this country. The Senator from Indiana says about 40 percent of the tobacco in cigarettes now are foreign. I think that is a little high. Of course, if you are for something it is less, and if you are against something it is higher. I find somewhere in the middle might be about right. We do have GATT and GATT limits the amount of tobacco that can be imported into this country. I know that was about 150,000 metric tons and the tobacco companies have first choice. 
So when you are going up against the small group of companies that control the 98 percent of everything, you don't have much bargaining power unless you have a program. So we say as you reduce the quota based on 1995, 1996 and 1997, that we will take the difference in that as we transition out into the future. Most agricultural economists say that it takes 10 to 15 years, and closer to 15 years, to transition into a new economic stream. 
So as we look here at the bill itself we are under what the bill says will go to agriculture. What the Senator from Indiana has to do with his amendment, if passed and accepted, he has to correct the bill to say he will get almost 48 percent of all money for the next 4 years, where we will only get 16. At the end of 10, we only get 4. Talk about saving money--it costs $10 billion more. The bill is for 25 years. My amendment is for 25 years. If you want to shorten it some, that is all right. If you are willing to talk, I am willing to talk, too, but I am not willing to give up what the farmers have earned. 
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids--they have been very active in this--supports a continuation of the tobacco program. They said the following:  
Legitimate concerns have been raised that in the absence of some sort of a program, tobacco production may, in fact, increase; that tobacco will be grown in other States that presently do not produce tobacco and the tobacco companies and the tobacco leaf dealer will gain control over the production and move to contract production, keeping tobacco farmers and their communities at risk. 
The Senator from Indiana knows that. He knows that. But no, he wants to say here is the money, you get it upfront, you pay your taxes on it, you get it over 3 years and I will only get 48 percent of all money for the next 3 years. I am not sure he can get that. When you have the marriage penalty in here, you have Senator Coverdell and his drugs, vouchers and the veterans --we have done a lot of work here. To do everything but take care of the farmer and to try to stop underage smoking does not make sense. What is going to stop underage smoking in this act? 
I think you lose control of the production of tobacco under the Lugar amendment. You have no way of controlling it except by price. When prices go down and tobacco companies make $1 billion more a year, you will vote for the farmer; you will vote for the manufacturer. I hope you will vote for that hard-working family, hard-working, God-fearing family. 
Under the LEAF Act, it requires that tobacco companies pay all the administrative costs associated with the tobacco program, assuring that no general taxpayer funds will be used for the tobacco program. Right now, the only cost to the Federal Government under the tobacco program is the administration of the program and the poor old tobacco farmer out there pays a deficit budget fee. I doubt if anybody here 
has ever heard of a deficit budget fee paid by a farmer who grows a legitimate crop. Last season they paid in over $30 million, about $32-34 million. 
The tobacco farmer pays a deficit reduction fee before he gets his check from the warehouse. Think about that now. You have assessed him out there about everything you can assess him for and he has paid everything but the administrative fee, and now we are willing to take care of that. Somehow or another that poor tobacco farmer down there has been beat on and beat on and beat on. Somebody has got to stand up for him against the big manufacturers. 
Whether Senator Lugar knows it or not, he is playing into the hands of the tobacco manufacturers by saving them $1 billion a year. When you take the controls off, they are then in control of how much tobacco they want and what they will pay for it. If we don't deal with this, if we want to get around GATT, I am sure that will be the next one--they want to increase the amount of imports from 150,000 metric tons to whatever so they can bring foreign tobacco in here that has no control over pesticides or anything else, no environmental control and bring those on in, so it will be 100 percent. You are going to get it coming up from Mexico, you are going to get it coming down from Canada. I understand Marlboro Lights in Mexico are around 90 cents. We have tens of thousands of cartons of cigarettes being made every month on Indian reservations. This is playing into their hands --they don't want to pay State taxes. All these things are happening, but there is no control under Senator Lugar's amendment of the growth of tobacco. 
The LEAF Act, or title X of the bill provides economic development funding to tobacco-growing States which must deal with the impact of settlement legislation. We understand that if this bill ever becomes law, and the way it is going now and what the House says and Speaker Gingrich says, we are just flipping our lips here because it isn't going anywhere when it gets there. We are spinning our wheels. There hasn't been anything added to this piece of legislation to stop underage smoking--maybe $1.10. But you get a $185 pair of Nike shoes and some kind of jacket with all the designs on it and all that, and $3 or $4 for a pack of cigarettes, I don't think it bothers anybody too much. But then you ruin the farmer. You ruin the farmer. 
So we try somehow as we reduce the use of tobacco, and hopefully we do, we just try to say to that community--and I can go down community after community and say to them that we are going to try to help you with infrastructure, with economic development, with loans for new business, to try to make up for the loss. And it all comes out of the tobacco company. It is not a taxpayer fund. It is not coming out of the general fund anyhow, but it comes out of the money developed from the tobacco companies. 
One thing I found, that the love of the tobacco farmer or the farmer for his family is hard to improve upon. They are out there in the country and they get up early, work hard, go to school, come back, work hard, study. 
One thing that a farm family wants is to see that their children have a good education. If we put him out of business--and 90 percent of them, my university estimates, will be--and there is no income, how do they do it? We keep the program and we say, then, that as the time goes by, and in a certain period, in a certain amount, we will give the tobacco-growing families who wish to provide our* education assistance for their children. What is wrong with that? I don't see anything wrong with it. Others may. They say, well, you are trying to do too much. Well, if you are going to put somebody out of business and that is not his or her choice, something has to be done. 
Everybody around here voted for NAFTA--I didn't, but most of them did. What do you do about dislocated workers? I had about 25,000 in my State in the textile industry, and all of those jobs have gone to Mexico after NAFTA. What do you do with 25,000 idle workers? Under the law, you try to train them and get them prepared for another job. That is what we said here. We provide assistance for dislocated workers from tobacco warehouses, processing and manufacturing facilities, who lose their jobs as a result of this tobacco legislation. What is wrong with that? We do it every place else. You say you don't want to do it for this industry. Well, not a farmer had a document, not a farmer was in on the advertising, and not a farmer did anything except try to support the tobacco program. 
I think that we have developed an approach that looks not just at the farmer, but at the entire community that will be impacted by this legislation. This approach is included in title X of what we call the McCain bill. I can understand the large farmers wanting their money and then being allowed to grow all they want. They will be the only ones that can contract with the manufacturers. They will be the ones that will get the big money and membership on the board of some outfit down there. Not one of them grow less than 200,000 pounds of tobacco a year, and so they get anywhere from $1.6 million to around $4.8 million--just those four people. So they will get around maybe $10 million, $11 million, or $12 million. No wonder. Those four who raised about 1.2 million pounds are big enough. They are big enough to deal with the manufacturers. But we have just paid them a good deal of money and told them `you are out on your own.' They like that. They have money. But you are going to pay it over 3 years, and they are going to have to pay tax on it, so it is going to stick them a little bit. 
Title XV, on the other hand, promises tobacco farmers the same amount of money, but over 3 years instead of 9. It would allow for the unlimited and largely unregulated production of tobacco. Title XV saves tobacco companies $1 billion per year for the next 25 years. Title XV requires somewhere between 46--I wanted to look at the amendment, and I am sure the Senator will correct me. It is 46 or 48 percent of all the money--that is in the amendment at the desk--to pay for the Lugar amendment in the next 3 years, where under the bill it says it can only have 16 percent. At the end of 9 years, we only get 4 percent. Something about that in the transition, it seems to me, ought to be done. 
So let's remember that title XV is a billion dollars per year windfall for the tobacco companies. It is $1 billion a year windfall for the tobacco companies. Are you going to vote for the farmer or the tobacco companies? I think that question is pretty clear. Each year, tobacco companies pay based on the program. Most of the time, they pay above the average. So we take the average and knock 70 cents a pound off. That is going in. You can't pay people to grow it, fertilize it, for the equipment and all that, and come out as a small farmer. So roughly one-third will be reduced. Over the course of 25 years, the Lugar amendment saves the tobacco manufacturers a minimum of $25 billion. Do you want to take the manufacturers over the farmers? I hope not. 
And the Lugar amendment takes away the money that the Leaf Act would spend to try to spur economic development, to try to give them technical advice, to go from one crop to the other, which is 
not in the Lugar amendment. It takes away the education. It doesn't even talk about educating kids. We are just going to put you out of business and give you some money and let you go on your own. We are going to reduce the value of your land--in my State, $7 billion. How is that going to reflect on the taxes that are paid in the counties and the cities and the State? Are they going to raise taxes on a smaller amount of value? You know, this thing has ripples. 
I don't believe the Senator from Indiana has thought all these through. If he has, I don't believe he would be this harsh on tobacco farmers. I am sure there would be a rebuttal, but you can't rebut if you take the quota away and it reduces the value of the land. That is a taking. You go to bed with the value of the land, and you wake up and the program is gone; tomorrow the value of your land is gone. They can foreclose on you because you don't have enough value to cover your mortgage.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it has been a good debate, and I have enjoyed it. I am not learned in debate. Whatever skills I might have come from experience. I have been around here a little longer than the Senator from Indiana. This is my 24th year, and I believe this is maybe his 21st or 22nd. Of course, he was mayor of Indianapolis; I believe, one of the favorite mayors at that time. He said after I leave the Senate, the tobacco program is gone. Can you believe one Senator can be that strong? The first thing I learned when I came here was that every Senator is independent. Every Senator has one vote. He controls that out here and nobody controls him. I just can't believe it, but it is in the Record, and I might cut it out of the Record and frame that statement from a Member of the other side. 
I was sitting here thinking about the money and how much is available. If the Senator's amendment stays in, this amendment will have to go beyond the 16 percent. But, if you get 46 percent in the first year, that is where you need 60 percent of the first year's money. That is $8 billion that you will have to pay out the first year. That is 60 percent. I suggest it will be close to 60 percent in the second year and the third year. If the Senator wins, he might want to change the percentage on that amendment. 
The Senator says that public health groups say regulation of tobacco will be less efficient. I believe that is his statement. On the one hand, he says funding is not important; on the other hand, he says there is a ticking time bomb of explosion. I don't quite understand that money is not important. He says funding is not important but, on the other hand, there is a ticking time bomb. 
Senators should know that Senator Lugar is promoting his proposal because it would increase tobacco production. He said that--increase tobacco production, going to make it more efficient, all those good things. But he is promoting the increase in tobacco production. 
Ask the public health groups what they think about that. Ask a small farmer what he thinks about that: a production increase for big farmers, fine, while the small ones are out of business. I don't believe the Senator would like it if he was back in his home in Indiana, and he has value of land--they talk about the money up front and they can make an investment, but when you lose hundreds of dollars per acre in value of your farm, I am not sure how well you come out in this, and they put them out of business. At least 90 percent of my small farmers in Kentucky are gone, and that is a conservative estimate, not a liberal estimate, but a conservative estimate. 
We are getting to the point where it is very difficult for me to understand, and I think the Senator is having a hard time defending his position when he is wanting to increase the growth of tobacco, reduce the price and save the tobacco companies a billion dollars. I say to the Senator, that is true, and it may be even more than that, because four companies control 98 
percent of the growth of tobacco. We have a hard time exporting tobacco because other countries are growing it, and companies have promoted some of that. So we limit it. Like everybody else, we limit it, and it is a pretty large limit on imports, to 150,000 metric tons or more. 
Somebody has to be thinking through all of this as much as we are, and those people who are thinking through this are the health groups that have been fighting so long as it relates to reducing the use of tobacco by underage children. 
Something quite remarkable, I say to the Senator from Indiana, occurred on March 16 of this year. Remember that date, March 16. On that day, March 16, 16 tobacco farming groups and 24 public health groups came together to agree on a common set of core principles. You talk about health groups now. Here are 16 tobacco farm groups and 24 public health groups that came together to agree on a common set of core principles to guide the debate--to guide the debate--on tobacco legislation. Both sides and all 40 groups agreed that `a tobacco control program which limits supply and which sets a minimum purchase price is in the best interest of the public health community.' 
That is a pretty strong statement by the health groups, and in conjunction with the tobacco interests. According to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in a letter dated May 13, `those public health groups who signed the core principles remain committed to the principles outlined in them, including maintenance of a supply limiting tobacco program.' 
What we are doing here is--I believe it is under title IV of the bill, and I am sure the Senator knows what title IV is, but that limits the amount of money that can be spent for agricultural purposes under this bill. The LEAF Act is under that limit. The Senator's amendment is about three times or four times over that limit. But we are within that limit. This is approved by the health groups. Instead of cutting them off at the knees in 36 months, we give them a little more time to phaseout. They can sell out, they can buy out. 
I have a list of all of the groups that signed the core principles, such as the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, Americans for Nonsmokers Rights, American College of Chest Physicians, Association of Schools of Public Health, the Oncology Nursing Society, Partnership for Prevention, National Hispanic Medical Association--I can go down all these groups that think keeping the program is the right thing to do and saving $18 billion. I might say to my colleagues, saving $18 billion for the use for research and health care and all these other things.

Mr. FORD. I do not know that there are a great deal of additional thoughts that we need to discuss. I could go down--one of the things that I want people to understand is that we are not just doing away with the tobacco quota. Oh, we are paying them some money, but the average, I don't think, is going to be much over $20,000, divided by 3 years. And the taxes are paid. 
Anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the value of Kentucky farmland is based on the tobacco quota. In rural Kentucky, banks will not lend to farmers unless they know the value of their tobacco quota. Real estate does not sell without disclosing the amount of tobacco quota on a farm. You can't sell a farm without disclosing that. That is an important feature. 
If you read the real estate section of the Kentucky newspapers, you will see the amount of tobacco quota advertised with the sale of the farmland. So if the program is done away with, then the value of the land is reduced anywhere from 15 to 20 percent, and that is up to $7 billion. So we are not only taking away the livelihood, we are also reducing the value of the product this farmer has worked all his life to hold. 
There is something here that I believe is fundamental--fairness. And under the Lugar bill, that is not fair. So this will have major, devastating consequences on the tax base in rural Kentucky--all because of the hostility of title XV toward the small tobacco farm. 
The Lugar alternative is really no alternative at all when you look at what happens to that tobacco farmer. It gives him a little money, and he is out. And we reduce the value of his land. He pays big sums of tax on it. If it is 20 percent, fine, but he has to figure some way. 
So, Mr. President, I do not know what the majority leader or the Democratic leader would like to do. I understand we have a joint meeting tonight, with both sides, beginning at 6:30. We are getting reasonably close to that. So in order to find out if it is all right with the Senator from Indiana, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ruby L. Wyatt and Dixie L. Owen of Falmouth, Kentucky, who have both been selected as Phoenix Award recipients for Small Business Disaster Recovery by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The Phoenix Award seeks to recognize outstanding individuals who overcome the odds in the face of disaster. 
Ruby is the President of Wyatt's Supermarket, Inc., and her daughter Dixie is the Secretary of this business which has been owned by their family for over 50 years. Ruby and her late husband Abe started in the grocery business in 1945 by selling food and supplies from the back of their Studebaker truck throughout the rolling hills of northern Kentucky. The Wyatt family soon expanded their operation and opened a full service supermarket. 
The business continued to flourish until a major flood hit Falmouth in March 1997. The supermarket Ruby and Dixie had just built only seven years earlier, was devastated by the flood. Ruby, at age 75, and Dixie decided to rebuild the store. In just 66 days, Wyatt's SuperValu reopened for business and all 52 employees were rehired. Today, Wyatt's SuperValu is the only grocery store serving Pendleton County. 
Ruby and Dixie's dedication did not end with rebuilding their own business. They worked to help secure federal funds to help rebuild the surrounding community in the aftermath of the flood. In addition, Ruby and Dixie participated in a fund-raiser with the Coca-Cola Company that raised money for the local public library damaged by the flood. 
There can be no doubt that Ruby and Dixie's drive and determination during the aftermath of the flood is worthy of the Phoenix Award. The community of Falmouth is lucky to have two business leaders who are dedicated to the well-being of their community. The actions of the Wyatt family serve as a role model for other business leaders who are affected by natural disasters. I congratulate them on their success and wish them many future years of success serving the people of northern Kentucky.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Lior S. Yaron of Louisville, Kentucky, who has been selected as the Kentucky Small Business Person of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration. 
Mr. Yaron is the President and CEO of LSY International, a distribution company in Louisville. He started the company in 1985 in New York and then moved the headquarters to Kentucky. Lior began LSY with a unique idea of marketing General Electric appliances with European voltage standards to domestic customers who would be moving back to their native country. 
Mr. Yaron recognized that he was in a position to fill a niche market. As a result, his customers were able to buy an appliance in the U.S. that was designed to work on foreign voltage standards. This allowed customers to bring these appliances back to their home country without having to pay duties, thus providing them with significant savings while also giving them quality home appliances. 
The success of LSY is also attributed to heavy advertising in publications frequently read by foreign nationals. Mr. Yaron relied on his unique advertising to minimize risks associated with selling goods that are only marketable overseas. LSY's innovative way of doing business has enabled it to grow and prosper. Sales have increased from $600,000 in 1985 to $11,520,460 in 1997. Employees have increased from only two in 1985 to 40 in 1997. 
And finally, I would like to say that Mr. Yaron's vision and innovation set an example for all small business entrepreneurs. I am very happy that Mr. Yaron is being recognized for all of the hard work that has gone into this successful business. I congratulate him on this significant accomplishment and am proud that this innovative business is based in Kentucky.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from Illinois, I understand his frustration. I understand the goals that he is attempting to reach, and I agree with him, but I am one of those who voted against cloture. In his 15-minute speech, he did not mention the farmer, the farmer who could wake up in the morning if we pass this bill with some amendments in it and be out of business in 36 months. The Senator from Illinois wouldn't mind that, but I certainly do. 
I don't object to smoke-free schools. Ninety percent and better in my State, a tobacco State, are opposed to underage smoking. We have no problems with that. But be fair to those and help those who have a life in front of them based on a legal product. They have had no part in all these problems of lies and documents and court cases, but are down there living by the sweat of their brow. And we are not talking about the farmer. 
Look at this bill that is before us and the amendments that have been adopted or that are pending, and you want cloture to be invoked on that bill and be the bill that goes out of here? I cannot allow that. I cannot in good conscience allow cloture to be voted on that bill and my farmers not be taken care of. 
I agree with the Senator from Illinois--of course I do--we have lost the target. We have lost the target. Someone figured up the other day that if everything that has been introduced and is in this bill is taken care of, we will spend 169 percent of the estimated amount of money that is going to be raised in the next 5 years. 
Mr. President, I am one of those--and I admit it, it is on the record--but I want people to know why I voted against cloture and will continue to vote against cloture until we can get some consensus as it relates to my farmers. 
The Senator from Illinois said he wants leadership. I think our leader is doing one heck of a job. I think he is pushing the point. I think he is doing the right thing for the position he is in, and I think the leadership on the other side is making one mistake after the other after the other after the other, because of what they are trying to do--to make a lifesaving piece of legislation into a tax cut bill. We need to understand that, and I think the American people will. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that before we have too many cloture votes and are criticized for voting no on cloture that we can have something that is palatable or even reasonable--even reasonable--that we can vote on to do the right thing for those we represent. I represent 65,000 small farm families, and I intend to see that, to the best of my ability, every one of those are treated fairly. Up to now, the answer has been no, and the answer will continue to be no on cloture until such time that we can see some daylight as it relates to those families that are struggling down in my State of Kentucky. I yield the floor. 
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico yielding to me. I have a piece of legislation in to eliminate the marriage penalty, already having been introduced. I found, to my surprise, that 52 percent of married couples get a marriage bonus. Not many people know that. There is a marriage bonus for 52 percent. I forget how many million couples get a marriage bonus of about $1,300-plus. The marriage penalty is about $1,400-plus. If you wipe out the penalty and the bonus, we have a surplus of about $4 billion. If you take the marriage bonus away and wipe out the marriage penalty, it is almost a $4 billion surplus. 
In the Senator's proposal here, what does the Senator propose, to make up the difference in the marriage penalty and you leave the marriage bonus in place?

Mr. FORD. I am trying to find out an answer here. I understand the marriage penalty. I am opposed to it, and I am trying to find an answer to it and the unfairness of it. 
In 1986, we repealed the two-earner deduction, but increased the standard deduction for married couples, and reduced the number of tax brackets from 15 to 2. The combination of these changes reduced the marriage penalty considerably. 
Now it appears the EITC gets involved here, and I understand the distinguished senior Senator from Texas is eliminating that, or is he keeping that in?

Mr. FORD. But the point here, then, is that I am putting out all this information, and it doesn't work; then you get fined. I am a little bit concerned about that. I understand where the Senator is coming from. But I think we need to cover one more base, that if the tobacco industry is going to be responsible for the percentage reduction, and, if it isn't, then they pay, they ought to be able to be charged with advertising, or something, rather than letting HHS do it. And if it doesn't work, they get penalized. 
As we say down home, `Something about that ain't right,' and I hope the Senator, with all his knowledge of this area, would look somehow to be sure that, if you are going to be charged with a penalty here, somehow you ought to have some input on how it is completed. You might be able to clear me up on that.

And some companies, a brand only has about 1 percent of youth. They don't like it, and they don't use it. But if you reduce it down, if it is 1 percent, which one brand is, then you have to reduce that to six-tenths of 1 percent. That becomes very difficult when it is all adults. 
I agree with what you are trying to do. I hope somehow or another we can make it fair rather than unfair.

Next week, the Uranium Enrichment Corporation will make a final decision on whether they go public or whether they go sell to an individual. And we have one member who needs to be on that. She has been held up 4 months now, and that vote and that expertise, for 4 years, needs to be on that board.

It should not be jammed up because of a hold on the Senate floor for an individual who has nothing to do with it, and it is jeopardizing the budget process, because funds are in there as it relates to the sale of this item. 
So I just--I plead with you, if you can, and I will do the best on my side, and if somehow, tomorrow, we will not be back, able to do it--and I do not want a recess appointment. It will all be over before the year expires. I don't like to do recess appointments.

Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from South Carolina. I am not a lawyer, and I don't understand all the work that lawyers do. When I was growing up, my dad said a little knowledge of the law is dangerous. Get yourself a good lawyer and stay with him or her. That is what I have tried to do. 
I have been in the insurance business, and I understand that very well. How many times has an independent agent down in some small community--and I have done it on many occasions--been asked to make bids on a piece of property or on a fleet of trucks or liability, or whatever it might be, and the staff in that little agency work for hours, day and night, putting together a comprehensive bid. Lo and behold, we lose. That is part of the game. 
Then we get another bid. It may be on a county or on a city, and we work for days and into the nights putting together a comprehensive bid. And we lose. 
But lo and behold, one time we submit a comprehensive bid and what happens? We win. It makes us feel good. But then somebody comes along and says, `Ford, you've made too much money.' Well, I have lost 100 times and finally win one and they say, `Ford, you've made too much money, you just can't do that.' So they limit the amount of money I can make as an insurance agent. 
It is the same thing that happened yesterday. Ninety-eight percent of the farmers who have tobacco quotas voted to keep the farm program. But in here, on the Senate floor yesterday afternoon, they said that 98 percent didn't know what they were talking about--`We're going to wipe out the quotas because we know more than you do.' That is why they don't like politicians in Washington. They don't want to do what their constituents want them to do. 
Here we are saying after 98 percent of the people voted one way, `You don't know what you want, and we're going to take care of you.' It is the same way with the attorneys general. Over 40 of them took on the tobacco industry. It was a pretty awesome cause, and they have won. They worked out a deal. 
Now we say, `After you have done all that, you can't charge that much.' You sign a contingency fee. What is a contract for? Are we the `big brothers' that vitiate contracts? I don't think so. You talk about protecting little fellows. As I understand the tobacco deal, it came from a little fellow whose secretary lost her mother, and he figured out that the States could sue. A little fellow made it, and he came along and others joined with him. 
We are now saying to these 40-some-odd attorneys general, `You don't know what you're doing, you paid too much.' We weren't even in on it. We didn't even help. But now in the end, we say, `No, you can't have that, that's too much.' 
They took the chance. How much did it cost? How much did they pay? Everything they have paid comes out of this hourly cap. I am sure that some lawyers do better than others. Lord, when I was in the insurance business, I would have loved to have had a boat. I had a johnboat I fished in, and I was proud of it. I had a decent automobile--I didn't have a jet to fly around in --but I was proud of it. I made it by being competitive. I went to the people who had an opportunity to give me a chance, and I asked them, `Can I bid?' We worked it that way.

Mr. FORD. I ask for 1 more minute. 
Now we are saying you can't just do it. If there ever was an intrusion in private practice, private business--I am surprised at the Republican side. Ninety-eight percent of the farmers say we want it one way, and they say, `You can't have it because you don't know what you're talking about.' 
Lawyers go out and win a case, and they say, `You've got too much by winning, we're going to take it away from you.' 
I don't understand what this body is trying to do. I don't want you to take anything out of my pocket, but that is the name of the game, as I see it, and when you win, you win; when you lose, you lose. When you lose, you pay it all. When you win, you get to pay off what it cost you. You don't put all that in your pocket. 
So I go back to the insurance business. We spent hours and hours trying to be competitive and win one. But we did not win them all. We lost a lot of them. But when we did win one, I would not want somebody coming along saying, `You have made too much.' 
It is like gambling. You have to pay--they had an amendment around here saying, `If you win, you have to pay tax on it; but if you lose, you can't deduct it.' 
Oh, we are doing pretty good around here, Mr. President. I hope that someday we can come down and have a little common sense and we can try to work this to the advantage of everybody in this country under the basis that we are competitive. It is a free system. And if you come out ahead, Lord, let's don't say, `You made too much.' Let us praise them for being good. The prize is being good. You made it work. 
So we are saying, `If you are good, you are going to be handicapped.' That sounds like a horse race to me. I come from Kentucky. We race thoroughbreds. If you have one that is way out front, you better put 126 pounds on him. If you have one that is light, you put 112 or 114. 
So that is what we are trying to do here. If you are a thoroughbred doing a good job, we are trying to handicap you from running a race. 
Well, Mr. President, I hope this amendment is not approved. I hope my friend from South Carolina wins on this one. Then we can get on to other things and help the farmers that have a tobacco quota. Let them win a little something in the days to come. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair for his courtesies. He is a gentleman and a scholar. 
Mr. President, today the Senate begins what I hope is a productive debate on S. 1415, the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act. We have come a long way in this debate. But in the 15 weeks left in this session we also have a long way to go. 
Nothing surprises me anymore concerning tobacco legislation. Yesterday afternoon they asked me if I was surprised. I said no. I was angry. So, therefore, I wasn't surprised. Last year, I would not have believed the tobacco manufacturers, attorneys general, and public health groups would have agreed on a comprehensive settlement. But on June 20, 1997, a national settlement was announced. I would not have believed that the Senate Commerce Committee could have reported a bill of this magnitude, and to do so in only one day of markup. But on April 1st, under the leadership of the Senator from Arizona, the Commerce Committee did just that by a vote of 19 to 1. Last Thursday, the Finance Committee modified the bill again in only one day. 
But part of the explanation for the success of the chairman of the Commerce Committee was his ability to get Senators to wait to debate many issues. A lot of them were left to the Senate floor. This bill raises hundreds of billions of dollars. Estimates of the Commerce Committee product range from $516 billion to almost $1 trillion. This is a tremendous amount of money by any standard. The Finance Committee increased the taxes raised by this bill even further. 
But not surprisingly, there is no shortage of ideas around here on what to do with the money. Some want to use it to 
offset tax cuts. Some want to expand existing spending programs. Some want to fund new spending programs. The one thing nearly all of these ideas have in common is that they have nothing to do with youth smoking. We have taken our eye off the problem of youth smoking. It is how can we raise more money and spend it on other programs. 
Somehow, almost miraculously, the two committee chairmen were able to get members of their committee to defer the debate on how to spend all of this money. But that debate cannot be deferred any longer, Mr. President--not if the Senate is actually going to pass a bill. With the confusion that was expressed here yesterday, there are some who are beginning to wonder if a bill can be passed. 
How all of this money is used goes to the very heart of the bill, and until we answer these fundamental questions, it is impossible to say with any certainty what kind of bill we have. Mr. President, there is an equally important issue that goes to the heart of the bill as well. It will define what this legislation is really all about. There is no more important issue to me personally than how we treat tobacco farmers and rural and tobacco-growing communities under this bill. 
In many ways, tobacco farmers and tobacco-growing communities are the innocent victims in this whole debate. They have not been sued. They have not been accused of withholding documents or information. They have not been accused of manipulating the tobacco grown on their farms. 
Mr. President, tobacco farmers and tobacco-growing communities are scared about what is going on in Washington, DC. They are bewildered at the almost daily barrage of hostile comments coming from various sources in this city. Most tobacco farmers are engaged in the same livelihood as their fathers, their grandfathers, and in some cases their great grandfathers on the same farm and on the same ground. 
Just like most Americans, tobacco farmers also don't want to see young people smoke. The poll in my State was something over 90 percent that opposed youth smoking. But they are having a hard time figuring out what some of the difficulties in Congress have to do with youth smoking. To most tobacco farmers much of the discussion in Congress sounds like an attempt to punish an industry with the youth smoking issue finishing a distant second. Tobacco farmers are being lumped in with tobacco manufacturers. 
A recent Congressional Quarterly article about the plight of tobacco farmers quoted one farmer from King, NC, about the tobacco debate in Congress. He said, and I quote:  
They are making us feel like drug dealers. That just burns me up. They put us in the tobacco industry when all we are doing is growing a legal crop. 
Tobacco farmers have been on a roller coaster ride for several years. But that ride has been almost out of control for the last year. Among the greatest disappointments was the June 20th settlement agreement itself. That agreement, which threatens to throw the lives of tobacco farmers into turmoil, did not provide one thin dime for tobacco farmers. Zero. Zip. 
The tobacco companies, attorneys general, and public health groups who were huddled in hotel rooms putting the deal together did not even invite tobacco farmers to the table. They would not let them in the door. It is tough to find words to express how insulting I found this. 
The June 20th tobacco settlement included money for event sponsors who would lose tobacco sponsorship under the settlement. The settlement had money for teams or entries in such events. They had money for NASCAR races. They had money for rodeos. 
Somehow, they found $750 million for these people. But there was nothing for tobacco farmers. 
Mr. President, tobacco farmers in my state were at first shocked by news of the settlement. Then they became angry. I encouraged them not to get mad, but to get to work. I urged them to come up with a plan for themselves, to help tobacco farmers and tobacco growing communities deal with the settlement. And Mr. President, tobacco farmers did go to work. I pledged to them last summer that I would do everything in my power to represent their interests, and to see to it that a proposal drafted by tobacco farmers would be included in any legislation considered by Congress. I'm here today to keep my word. 
Mr. President, there are 124,000 tobacco farm families producing the crop across 20 states in this country. That represents 6 percent of the farms in the United States. Most of these farms are in the southeast. On average, these tobacco farms are 126 acres--about one-third the size of the average U.S. farm. So we're talking about small, family farm operations. 
In Kentucky, tobacco is produced in 119 of 120 counties. Two-thirds of the farmers in my state produce tobacco. They average about 4 acres of tobacco. It is less than 3 percent of their cropland, yet it brings about 25 percent of their farm income. Most tobacco farmers in my state have family incomes of less than $35,000--including non-farm income. Make no mistake, we're talking about middle to low-income families. 
The tobacco settlement will have a significant negative impact on the family farms in my state, and this impact must be considered in any tobacco legislation. 
Tobacco farmers started meeting last summer to deal with the impact of the settlement. They came up with three general principles for tobacco settlement legislation: (1) the legislation must preserve the federal tobacco program; (2) fair compensation should be provided to tobacco farmers should their ability to produce the crop be diminished; and (3) the impact on tobacco farming communities should be taken into account. 
Mr. President, farms in my State and other States are valued with the quota. If the quota under the so-called Lugar-McConnell bill is implemented, from $2 billion to $4 billion in reduction of farmland value will occur in the fourth year because we lose the quota. What does that do? It has a rippling effect on local taxes, the tax base, the income for the cities and the counties, our school systems, to say nothing of the business community of these small communities. 
After countless meetings among tobacco farming groups from states like Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia, an outline of a tobacco farmer proposal came together. We worked hard to iron out details and put `meat on the bones.' 
I daresay, Mr. President, there are not many Senators who have sat on the porch of many grocery stores and talked to farmers. There are not many Senators in this body who have sat in the kitchen and had a cup of coffee with farm families, talking about what is about to happen to them and their future. I think I understand and feel what they say because I grew up on a farm and I raised tobacco until I was drafted into World War II. 
Finally, last October, I introduced the Long-term Economic Assistance for Farmers Act, or one we refer to as the LEAF Act. It was cosponsored by 9 tobacco state Senators. 
But our work didn't stop there. We continued to work through the winter and spring to improve the proposal. Finally, after nine months of work, a consensus proposal was developed to assist tobacco farmers and their communities. 
We have provided direct payments to farmers in the event their ability to produce declines. This is the very heart of the LEAF Act. It is designed to make farmers whole as the value of their assets decline. 
We also made changes to make tobacco companies pay for any possible administrative provisions associated with the tobacco program. Mr. President, I have been working for 16 years to eliminate any opportunity for critics to claim that there is a tobacco `subsidy.' In 1982, we started requiring tobacco farmers to pay for the tobacco loan program. I worked closely with Senator Helms to achieve these changes. Senators Thurmond, Hollings, and Warner were all in the Senate at that time, and will remember these changes. 
In 1986, we required tobacco companies to share in these costs. The tobacco loan program has operated at no net cost to taxpayers since that time. Still, there were criticisms. Salaries at USDA, crop insurance, and extension services all are partially attributable to tobacco. Mr. President, under the LEAF Act, all of these costs--and any other conceivable USDA cost associated with tobacco--will now be paid by tobacco companies. There will no longer be any basis, directly or indirectly, to allege that there is a tobacco subsidy. All possible taxpayer costs have been eliminated under the LEAF Act. 
And you know something, Mr. President. Our tobacco farmers make an extra payment, a deficit reduction payment that is taken out of their check before they get it from the warehouse and it goes to the general fund. Last year, it was almost $32 million. And not another farmer in this country--maybe the peanuts--makes a payment out of their check called a budget reduction payment. It was over $32 million last year. 
Mr. President, we have wanted to look beyond the tobacco farmer and the tobacco program. The LEAF Act attempts to take a broader view and deal with the entire impact on tobacco communities and the next generation. 
Why is it so important? We had to have some financial underwriting of the 13 colonies--and that was tobacco through Virginia. They underwrote the debt of the colonies. It has been around a long time. `Mr. Jones came in to buy his spring planting and paid for it with some of the finest tobacco I have seen'--a quote from history. That was before we became colonies. The pages of Virginia history are splattered with tobacco juice. Just think about it. And they want to do away with it overnight. It cannot be done. 
We've included economic development assistance. We've included grants for higher education for the children of tobacco farm families. And we have included assistance for displaced workers who have jobs in warehousing, processing, and manufacturing tobacco. We understand things are changing for tobacco and we want to prepare these communities. 
Mr. President, I'm grateful to Senator McCain for his leadership in including the LEAF Act as Title Ten of S.1415. It's an essential part of the overall picture. It must be included in any tobacco settlement legislation. The LEAF Act has broad support among tobacco farming groups. It's supported by the public health community. President Clinton, who visited Kentucky in April, announced that the LEAF Act satisfies his fifth principle for tobacco legislation of providing assistance to tobacco farmers and tobacco growing communities. 
But let me provide fair warning, Mr. President. I will keep my pledge to my tobacco farmers. I will do everything in my power to oppose attempts to undermine the LEAF Act, or attack the federal tobacco program, or threaten the ability of tobacco farmers in my state to deal with the impact of the national tobacco settlement. 
How many farmers out there have 98 percent of their product controlled by four companies? There is no leverage. The tobacco farmers have no leverage if we don't have a tobacco program. We have four companies that handle 98 percent of all the product, so if we don't have that, we are at their mercy. 
I don't know how many farmers around here have heard of `farm buy.' They just go directly to the farm and buy it from big farmers, and the small farmer is gone, has no leverage whatsoever. And, as we see, people attack the farm program. A proposal has been made which is nothing short of a thinly veiled bribe to offer larger tobacco farmers a promised lump-sum payment in exchange for eliminating the tobacco program. We found out yesterday it is not a lump sum payment, it is 3 years. And if you look at the bill that was introduced, that is before the Senate, 50 percent of all the money goes to the States and 40 percent of that money will be taken up by the McConnell-Lugar bill. That leaves 10 percent for everybody else. But in the bill it says only 16 percent of the money can go to the farmer. 
Where are we on this--40 percent we would have to take in order to pay for it, yet the bill says only 16 percent? We are going to try to correct that if we can, because it is talking out of both sides of the mouth, and you can't do that around here--only for awhile. 
This is a classic example of Washington telling people, `We are smarter than you.' But it simply won't work. Tobacco farmers want to keep a supply management program. For 3 years, every 3 years, farmers vote on whether to keep the tobacco program. Earlier this year, farmers of flue-cured and burley tobacco, the two largest types of tobacco, voted overwhelmingly to keep the program. In a referendum conducted by USDA for both types of tobacco, almost 98 percent of tobacco farmers voted to keep the program. But now some in Congress want to tell farmers that, `We are smarter than you.' That is what is wrong with this place. That is why people don't like us. There are 98 percent of a group saying, `This is what we would like to have and what we would like to keep.' And what do we say up here? `You don't know what you are talking about. This is what is good for you. This is what is good for you. So you don't know what you are talking about, and we are going to take care of it for you.' 
So, 98 percent of those down there who voted, it doesn't make any difference what you do. This is typical Washington, DC, arrogance. I have already discussed how my small, average tobacco farmer--there are 124,000 of those, but there are only 4 large manufacturers, controlling over 98 percent of the cigarette market. This disparity in bargaining power could not be greater. Unless tobacco farmers have some mechanism to bargain together jointly, they are helpless; they are helpless in dealing with the large tobacco manufacturers. The tobacco program provides that mechanism, and it must not be tampered with as a part of this legislation. 
The focus of the bill should be, must be, youth smoking. I voted for smoke-free schools. I have voted, tried every way I can, to stop youth smoking. So I have no apologies to make, because I want to stop it. Over 90 percent of the people polled in my State want to stop it. But the focus of this bill must be on youth smoking, which is to focus on what will work to reduce youth smoking. 
Youth smoking rates peaked in the 1970s. Starting in about 1979, youth smoking rates began to decline and continued to 
decline through the 1980s. Then, about 1991 or 1992, they started to climb again. No one knows exactly why. And guess what; youth alcohol use started to go up at the same time, binge drinking started to go up, marijuana use started to go back up. In fact, youth usage of marijuana has been increasing faster than cigarette smoking during the 1990s. So far, Congress has failed to look broadly at all these trends. Surely this is more than a coincidence. When we look at the causes of youth smoking increases, we should also look at drinking and illegal drug use. 
The American people seem to have a better sense of that than Congress. They seem to realize that teenage behavioral changes are more complex than just tobacco, and the youth tobacco rates have been influenced by more than just slick advertising by the tobacco industry. In fact, one recent poll verified these opinions. A Tarrance Group/KRC research poll conducted earlier this month asked people why they thought youth smoking rates had been going up. Mr. President, 58 percent said the influence of peers and friends was the main reason; 18 percent said the parents' example was the main reason; 12 percent said Hollywood, television, and popular culture were the main reasons; and only 6 percent said the tobacco industry and advertising were the main reasons--only 6 percent. So we have a lot more to learn about this issue, and I think, really, how little we do know should have an influence on how broad we make this legislation. 
I have serious concerns about the size of the legislation. These concerns existed even before the Finance Committee took its action to increase the size of the bill. First, the bill as reported by the Commerce Committee appears to contain language never considered by the committee on April 1. I am specifically referring to the annual payments made by the industry. In the McCain committee amendment adopted by the committee, the annual payment starting in the sixth year was set at $21 billion, plus an adjustment up for inflation and down for volume. However, in the reported bill, the sixth-year payment is the `adjusted applicable base amount,' which it defined as the amount of the preceding year, which appears to be $23.6 billion. I do not know where the language came from. I do not recall it ever being approved by the committee. However, it appears they add $2.6 billion per year for 20 years to the cost of the bill. In other words, it appears that $52 billion has been added to the cost of the bill. I hope we can clear up some of these things. 
Mr. President, OMB proceeded to take a number of misleading steps to achieve competing objectives. They totally omitted the bill's revenue impact on prices in several respects. They ignored any costs from future legislation and attorneys' fees. They ignored additional regulatory costs of complying with the bill. They ignored price increases resulting from higher sales taxes, State excise taxes, wholesale and retail margin increases, manufacturers' future price increases, and they ignored the new licensing fee in title XI. 
But perhaps the most offensive manipulation by OMB involved their conflicting projected volume declines. OMB projected youth smoking would decline by 60 percent when calculating the look-back penalties, but they projected youth smoking to decline by only 29 percent when calculating the price-per-pack increase. 
As we say down in Kentucky, there is something about that that ain't right. But you need a small consumption decline to make the price-per-pack increase smaller. OMB just had it both ways. They changed the projections to say the bill costs $516 billion and raises the price by $1.10. 
Mr. President, I have Wall Street Journal analyses, I have all these things I could read here this morning. I don't know how much time I have left. It is probably getting close to the time.

Mr. FORD. Good. I thank the Chair. 
Let me also outline several other concerns I have with S. 1415 which I hope can be corrected or improved during the debate. 
First, we have continuing concerns about the potential for a black market. We say we can stop that, but Mexico sells cigarettes that I smoke for 90 cents to $1 a pack at retail. Indian reservations are selling cigarettes at a retail of around $1.20. If these new estimates are correct, we are creating a disparity in price of up to $4 a pack. This is well above the level experts say will cause black market activity. In fact, we already have a considerable amount of smuggling in this country because of the large State excise tax increases in recent years. A disparity in price of only 50 to 60 cents per pack has already proven to be enough to create black market incentives, and they are going on right now within our own country. Canada fussed at us, you know, when they raised their prices. Now we have two borders. 
We raised prices that come from Canada and from Mexico, the Caribbean and wherever. These fellows do pretty good out there. They are called cartels. We have had a hard time stopping drugs from coming in. What are we going to do when cigarettes are added to that? When you go down to the skid, `You want some cheap cigarettes or I have another menu on the other side over here starting with marijuana.' It is interesting how we are going to provide for that and are playing into the hands of those people. 
The international provisions of title XI sets dangerous precedents, Mr. President. If it were any other product, this would not even be tolerated. I hope title XI can be eliminated or substantially improved. 
I have concerns that the bill gives the FDA excessive authority to do what I suspect they wanted to do for the last several years--ban the product. It is my hope that we can place reasonable limits on the unbridled authority. 
Several serious constitutional concerns have been identified, particularly since the tobacco manufacturers are unlikely to sign on to this legislation. Late last month, four State attorneys general sent a letter to Senator Hatch outlining these concerns. Constitutional concerns throw into jeopardy the advertising and marketing restrictions, the upfront payment, the look-back provisions, the document disclosure section, and the so-called corporate culture language. 
These are legitimate concerns. Each one will have a suit filed. It will be completed. They will file another suit. It will be completed, and we will be in court under these provisions for a long, long time. I hope these concerns can be addressed as well. 
Mr. President, a recent Wall Street Journal poll showed that Americans have serious doubt about the motives behind this debate. By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, a majority of the people thought the current debate was more about raising taxes to pay for new programs than it was about reducing youth smoking. We have a chance to change some views with the way this debate on the bill is conducted and the final product. 
I have two overriding tests for the final product produced on this floor: No. 1, does the bill adequately compensate and protect farmers and farming communities? And No. 2, is the bill more about reducing youth smoking or punishing an industry? 
I look forward to the debate and the opportunity to find the answers to many of these problems. I say to the Chair and to my colleagues in the Senate that I am going to do whatever I can to be sure that the farming community is protected in this bill. With the procedure that occurred late yesterday, to undo all of the work for 10 long months that many of us have put into this legislation, to undo it in a motion is a serious thing. I think it rubbed some of us a little bit the wrong way, as we say. There will be some scorched-Earth approach as we develop this. If we can work out something, I would love to do it. But I will not work out anything that does not compensate and take care of the farmers who I am here to represent, and I intend to represent them as long as I can stand and as long as people will listen to me. I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say this with all respect to the majority leader and to my colleague. It is very difficult to understand what has developed. I thought I understood the rules very well and worked diligently, along with the distinguished Senator from 
South Carolina, and others, including Senator Frist, who worked hard to work out the FDA amendment that is in the bill; all of us worked hard to put this together. 
I understand the 60-vote rule. I understand that very well, because this amendment by Senator Lugar cannot raise the money. They talked about a lump sum payment and had to change it today because it is 3 years or more. There is no lump sum payment here. You are fooling the farmers, misrepresenting things to the farmer, if the Lugar amendment gets in here. It is the farmer versus the manufacturer. The manufacturer, under the Lugar amendment, will save a billion dollars a year, minimum--a billion dollars a year. You are going to see that check signed tomorrow. You are going to see the press conference tomorrow. You are going to see the farmers come in here tomorrow, because they are opposed to Lugar. You can have all the misgivings you want. There could be ghosts behind every tombstone about the future, but you have to lay groundwork. 
I say to the majority leader, with all respect, if this is done to us, I am going to make it as difficult as I can to see that the bill is not passed this week, and probably not in June. I believe my responsibility here is to the farmer, not to the manufacturer and not to misrepresent that 40 percent of all the money raised by the McCain bill will go to the farmers under 3 years. 
Think about that 40 percent. What are you going to reduce? Research? What are you going to reduce? Advertising? What are you going to reduce in order to get that money? Sure, you have to raise it $1.50 to pay for Lugar, and you may not be able to do it then. So here we are, saying to those of us who have worked for months--and I have been on the front porches of grocery stores, in kitchens of farmers, I have been in six States talking to farmers, and this is what the farmers wrote--the LEAF Act. They didn't write the Lugar amendment. 
I am sorry that the chairman of the Agriculture Committee is not going to have a vote. I feel sorry for him, but this is the nature of this institution. This is the nature, this is the rule, and this is the precedent. You are following the rules, that is true. But when it comes down to the farmer versus the manufacturer--and this Lugar amendment will give billions to the manufacturer--then I think that the Senate will have a question of whether they want to support the farmer or whether they want to support the tobacco manufacturer. 
I know there is nothing I can do, Mr. President. I can object to the unanimous consent, but eventually we will vote on it. Everybody is working hard on the other side to get a bill out of here--just get it out of here. We don't want to touch it, we don't want to fool with it anymore, because what comes out of conference is going to be a minuscule bill. You will have a hard time getting that bill through this body. So rather than starting to take the hide off of folks in the beginning before you even bring the bill up, it seems to me it is a little bit disconcerting. 
The chairman of the Commerce Committee has been as straight with me and with us as he could be. I find no fault with what he has attempted to do, because some things we can't agree on. But we were not disagreeable. Everything has always been on top of the table with us, and his word has been as good as gold; his word has been his bond. And now the majority leader takes over all this hard work he has done and say to the chairman of the committee, and to us who worked to cooperate, that what you did and your cooperation is for naught. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. I say to the majority leader that I understand that Senator Lugar is chairman of the Agriculture Committee. I understand that Senator Lugar has been around here more than a week or two. I understand that Senator Lugar should understand the rules. And I understand that he has been working 
diligently, along with others, to make this work. I have been doing the same. And then when I get it to a point where you have it where you think you are safe and that you are protected, then in order to be fair about it, in order to be fair about it, you change everything we have done for the last 10 months, except that I get a vote up and down. But I had the position--or we had it in a position where it would take 60. 
So I think that the fairness now in all of the work that you do that is not fair, and so, therefore, the work you do is out the window because it is not fair. I thought when you made it through here, and you got it through the committee, and you got it on the floor, that was pretty fair after 10 months. Now because another Senator doesn't have an opportunity to bring it up----

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Bond, co-chairman of the Senate National Guard Caucus, Senators Dorgan and Leahy, I am introducing today the National Guard and Reserve Components Equity Act of 1998. 
Over the past few years, we've had to expend a huge amount of energy fending off attacks to the Guard. Worse, the whole time we're dusting ourselves off and assessing the damage, our opponents deny they've ever laid a finger on us. 
It reminds me of the boxer who, at the insistence of his trainer, took on the current champ. After the first round, he came back to his corner with a busted lip, and his trainer patted him on the back and said, `You're doing great,' then shoved him back out when the second bell sounded. After the second round, he staggered back to his corner with a black eye and a busted cheek, and his trainer said, `You're doing great, he hasn't laid a hand on you.' And the boxer replied, `Well you'd better keep an eye on the referee, `cause someone is beating' the heck out of me.' 
Year after year, the Guard has come back to its corner, bruised and battered by the budget process, only to hear Pentagon officials insist they haven't laid a hand on them. 
I think we all agree that as we enter the 21st Century, the common goal of the U.S. military should be to create and maintain a seamless Total Force that provides our military leaders with the necessary flexibility and strength to address whatever conflicts that might arise. 
The 1997 QDR should have been the vehicle to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, it fell far short. One analyst described the QDR as `another banal defense of the status quo.' 
There are close to a half million men and women in the National Guard, accounting for about 20 percent of this nation's Armed Forces. Because of their dual federal-state mission, National Guardsmen and women are on hand to serve in both the international arena and in our own backyards. Perhaps more than any other soldier, members of the Guard embody our forefathers' vision of the citizen-soldier. 
That's because the citizen-soldiers of the National Guard find their roots not only in the history of this country, but equally important, in the communities of this country. 
The Army National Guard alone provides more than 55 percent of the ground combat forces, 45 percent of the combat support forces, and 25 percent of the Army's combat support units--all while using only two percent of the Department of Defense budget. 
But if you look at the QDR process, you would think the Guard has outlived its usefulness--that their cost-effectiveness, their flexibility, their readiness are all figments of this Senator's imagination. 
This contentious relationship got even hotter last spring when leaders of the National Guard expressed outrage at never being given the opportunity to present their case before the QDR and over the Army's failure to be up-front about how deeply they wanted to cut the Army Guard. 
The outrage was well placed. The Washington Times was right on target when they wrote back in June that  
The Guard has a greater relevance today than during the Cold War--exactly the kind of relevance the Founding Fathers envisioned when they elected to place the preponderance of the nation's military strength in the state militias. 
They understand that with its `dual use system,' the Guard is the wave of the future, not a relic of the past. 
While many of us felt blind-sided by the QDR, the fact is it was just one more instance where the Pentagon refuses to give the Guard the status it deserves. 
I don't believe making the Chief of the National Guard a four star general and a member of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council will solve all of the Guard's problems, but I do believe it would help to change the dynamics of this dysfunctional relationship, and better ensure the Guard's needs are met when the Defense budget is being written, rather than through Congressional intervention. 
As many of you probably recall, last year Senator Stevens offered an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill to make this change. It was approved by the Senate, but later dropped in Conference Committee. Instead, Conferees agreed to having a Two-Star General from the Guard and one from the Reserves--a position the Guard already has. 
Since then, I've been working with Senator Bond--my co-chairman of the Senate National Guard Caucus to come up with new legislation reinforcing the important role of both the Guard and the Reserves. 
The bill would direct the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress regarding the force structure necessary for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve to meet future national security threats. The bill would freeze the end strength of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve at the level Congress approved for Fiscal Year 1998, until September 30, 2000. This freeze will provide Congress a chance to review the force structure report submitted by the Secretary of Defense. 
The bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a master plan for the modernization of the National Guard And Reserve Components to ensure compatibility of equipment with our active forces. Under this legislation, the Secretary must also submit a master plan to Congress on meeting the military construction needs of the National Guard and Reserve Components. 
This legislation builds on Senator Stevens's amendment to last year's Defense Authorization. It elevates the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Grade of General (4-star) and elevates the Senior Representatives of the Reserves one Grade. These are just some provisions of the bill. My Guard Caucus Co-Chairman, Senator Bond, someone who has been deeply committed to improving the readiness of the Guard, will be outlining other provisions of the bill. 
Mr President, the Reserve Components are the only contact a majority of Americans have with the military. When they see a neighbor, a child's teacher, or their family doctor representing the U.S. in the international arena or on hand when natural disasters strike, they have a direct link to the military. 
That bond has remained strong for well over 200 years. And despite resistance from the Pentagon, I believe Congress has no intention of seeing that bond damaged through insufficient funds or lack of resources--from operations and maintenance to pay and allowances to continued equipment modernization and military construction. This is why the National Guard and Reserve Components Equity Act of 1998 needs to become law. 
Muhammad Ali used to say that not only could he knock'em out, but he could pick the round. Opponents to the Guard and Reserves should be on notice--no matter how much they try and bob and weave, this is the round they're going to go down. 
Before closing, I'd like to take just a moment to say how much I've enjoyed working with Senator Bond on National Guard issues over the last ten years. We've worked together, along with the other members of the Caucus, in a bipartisan manner to ensure that the National Guard and Reserve components receive the funding these dedicated men and women need to successfully fulfill their role in preserving our national security.

Mr. FORD. When the Senator said we had other nominees, and he only listed the judicial, there are other nominees on the Executive Calendar who have no reason to be held. For instance, we have a woman who has been serving for 4 years on the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. She came before the Energy Committee on February 11. She was given the greatest of accolades for the tremendous job she had done, and she is caught up in the holds on everything else. And now 90 days have passed since she was unanimously reported out of the Energy Committee. 
The Uranium Enrichment Corporation is about to privatize. There is $2 billion, approximately, in this budget that will have to be voted on by that particular individual. They said--the `they' being the majority--let her have a contract, just a consultant's contract. And that means she can sit there and listen but cannot say a word or cast a vote. We are about ready 
to close the deal. 
So not only do we have the judicial problem, we have other nominations that are vitally important to my State and the State of Ohio of which we have a vital interest. I want to encourage the Senator. I am about to make a unanimous consent request that we bring Margaret Greene up so we might try to do something here to get her moving and on the board so she can continue to make decisions and do the good work she has been complimented for by the Energy Committee. So I thank the Senator.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today, I want to take a few minutes to speak on the latest actions by the Federal Aviation Administration with respect to its emergency inspection order of Boeing 737's. 
Last Thursday, May 7th, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive which ordered the inspection and possible replacement of fuel tank wiring insulation in certain Boeing 737's, 747's and 767's. The FAA order for 737's required immediate action on an estimated 152 U.S. registered Boeing 737-100 and -200 models with more than 50,000 hours of flying time. A second directive also ordered the operators of 264 Boeing 747's and 231 Boeing 767's to inspect wiring within 60 days. 
Yesterday, Sunday May 10th, the FAA ordered the immediate inspection for all older Boeing 737's with between 40,000 and 50,000 flight hours. The FAA ordered that the aircraft could not be operated in commercial service until mechanics could inspect, and repair, if needed, the fuel tank wiring. The FAA's action on Sunday came about after initial inspections by the airlines found additional evidence of electrical problems in the fuel tank wires. 
There is no question that the FAA's actions inconvenienced a number of travelers yesterday. The decision by the FAA to issue the emergency order was a tough call, but it was the right call to make. It also demonstrates the FAA's continuing commitment to safety. 
As Administrator Garvey said `Safety is our highest transportation priority'. Her actions and words are to be commended. I wanted to come to the floor to recognize the actions of FAA Administrator Garvey. She and her staff acted quickly and decisively. Many of us around here have often taken to the floor to say that the FAA's first priority should be safety. And the actions taken by Administrator Garvey are a clear demonstration to all of us that the FAA is vigilant in improving safety within the aviation industry. The actions are also clear evidence of a change in the culture of the FAA--that the agency is proactive in enforcing safety standards. 
We should also acknowledge the actions taken by the airlines and the Boeing Company. Working in partnership with the FAA, these inspections were undertaken quickly and as a result, a potentially disastrous situation was averted. 
I, for one, feel re-assured this morning because of the actions taken by the FAA. I have always been confident that FAA Administrator Garvey would do an outstanding job. Her actions over the weekend have only deepened my confidence in and respect for her, and for the agency.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, as April draws to a close this week I want to remind my colleagues of Alcohol Awareness Month. I think the tireless efforts of many types of groups have raised our awareness about alcohol consumption. This includes efforts made by federal and state governments, citizen action groups, and the beverage alcohol industry itself. More than ever, Americans deplore the devastation of drunk driving. More than ever, Americans understand the consequences of failing to deal responsibly with alcoholic beverages. 
Americans also need to understand that alcohol is alcohol. A standard serving of beer, wine, and distilled spirits contain the same amount of alcohol. Some fear that teaching alcohol equivalence would be paramount to promoting alcohol consumption. But I think it can actually have the opposite effect, promoting a rational approach to this topic and encouraging moderation The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Agriculture, and Education, as well as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans all define a drink as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, and 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. And the federal government is not alone is recognizing alcohol equivalence. Many leading organizations involved in this debate do as well. 
Yet as recently as 1996, one survey found that only 39% of Americans understand that a 12 ounce can of beer, a 5 ounce glass of wine, and a mixed drink with 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits contain the same amount of alcohol. We owe it to Americans to do a better job of disseminating this information and providing basic facts on this topic. In recognition of Alcohol Awareness Month, it is the very least we can do.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on May 2-4, while their friends are celebrating the 124th running of the Kentucky Derby, some students from my home state will be answering questions about the Constitution, here in Washington, in a mock Congressional hearing. These students will be competing in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that the class from Louisville Male High School will represent Kentucky. These young people have worked long and hard to reach the national finals, winning local competitions to get here. 
I would like to recognize these students for their achievements. The members of this class representing Kentucky are Angela Adams, Perry Bacon, Katherine Breeding, Will Carle, Eric Coatley, Courtney Coffee, Brian Davis, Mary Fleming, Matt Gilbert, Amanda Holloway, Holly Jessie, Heath Lambert, Gwen Malone, Kristy Martin, Brian Palmer, Lauren Reynolds, Shane Skoner, LaVonda Willis, Bryan Wilson, Darreisha Wilson, Beth Wilson, Janelle Winfree, Treva Winlock, and Jodie Zeller. 
I would also like to recognize their teacher, Mrs. Sandy Hoover, who clearly deserves a lot of the credit for the class' success. The district coordinator, Dianne Meredith, and the state coordinators, Deborah Williamson and Jennifer Van Hoose, also contributed their time and effort to help the class reach the national finals. 
The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing. Students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional issues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral presentation by the students before panels of adult judges. 
The We the People . . . program is run by the Center for Civic Education. The program has provided teaching materials to upper elementary, middle, and high schools for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students across the nation. Members of Congress and staff also contribute by discussing current constitutional issues with program participants. 
This special program is designed to help students understand and appreciate the values and principles that unite us as Americans. The program also promotes the notion of citizenship--that the rights and benefits are tempered by the responsibilities of participation in effective government. 
I wish these young people the best of luck testing their constitutional knowledge in the upcoming national finals of the We the People . . . program. I also congratulate them on reaching this level of competition.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is the time of the year when we are certain to hear more ideas for tax reform. We're certain to hear many colleagues discuss the unfairness of our current tax code. Although taxes in this country remain lower than major competitors like the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany, many families feel their tax burden has been increasing. 
One of the interesting reasons why some individuals feel squeezed is the changing nature of the tax burden over the last few decades. For example, individual income taxes--both as a percentage of all federal taxes paid and as a percentage of gross domestic product--are at roughly the same levels as they were in 1970. Yet during that same time period the so-called social insurance taxes or payroll taxes have risen dramatically, primarily to fund Social Security and Medicare. And the portion of revenues collected from corporate income taxes has fallen by an equally dramatic amount. For example, in 1960, we collected $1.89 in individual income taxes for every $1.00 in corporate income taxes. By 1980 this ratio has risen to $3.78 in individual income taxes for every $1.00 in corporate income taxes. And today we collect $4.02 in individual income taxes for every $1.00 in corporate income taxes. It is no wonder individuals feel squeezed. 
As we begin to debate several tax reform proposals this year, perhaps none will receive as much attention as the so-called marriage penalty. The marriage penalty refers to the aspect of the tax code, which results in many married couples paying more in taxes than they would if both spouses remained single. Yet few will discuss--and I found this to be very interesting--that 51 percent of married couples actually receive a marriage `bonus', meaning they pay less in federal taxes as a result of being married. 
Let me repeat that. Fifty-one percent of married couples--a majority of married couples--pay less in federal taxes than they would if both spouses remained single. Last June CBO found that 51 percent of married couples receive a marriage bonus averaging $1,300 per couple. If they were required to file as single individuals, federal revenues would be $32.9 billion greater each year. 
CBO also found that 42 percent of married couples are subject to a marriage penalty, paying an average of $1,400 more per couple in taxes than if both were single, for a total of $28.8 billion per year in additional revenues. In other words, fully eliminating the marriage penalty costs $28.8 billion per year. However, if both marriage penalties and marriage bonuses were eliminated, there would actually be a net increase in federal revenues of $4.1 billion per year. Forty-two percent of married couples would receive a tax cut, but 51 percent of married couples would receive a tax increase. 
There is no way to make a statement about income tax exciting. There is nothing you can talk about that brings you out on the edge of your seat. I am not going to try to do that. So I am going to put into the Record several examples of how couples, both making $20,000 a year and filing jointly or filing single, and then one breadwinner making $200,000 while his spouse stays home and cares for the children--how much less they would pay than the married couple making $40,000. 
I think you can already see the trend is to try to take care of that lower income and not increase the bonus, as S. 1285 does. 
CBO found numerous causes for these differentials in tax treatment. However, two major factors explain most of the reason why married couples are treated differently: (1) the standard deduction, and (2) the tax rate schedules. In each case, the cutoff for married couples is about two-thirds higher than for single individuals. 
For example, in 1998, the standard deduction is $4,250 for singles and $7,100 for married joint filers--about 67% higher, but applying to two people instead of one. This has significant implications for married couples who do not itemize their deductions. For a couple where one spouse earns all the income, this means a deduction of $2,850 more than if both spouses were single, giving them a marriage bonus. However, for a couple where both spouses have significant income, the result is a deduction of $1,400 less than if both were single. 
Similar results occur when comparing tax rates. In 1998 the 15% bracket extends to incomes of $25,350 for singles, and $42,350 for married joint filers--about 67% higher. Most one-income couples receive a marriage bonus because an additional $17,000 is taxed at the lower 15% level. However, many dual-income married couples will find that less of their income is taxed at the 15% level. 
So it is far more complex than some have been led to believe. For instance, many married couples currently receiving a marriage bonus have the impression that all married couples are penalized. Many married couples are unaware that there is such a thing as a marriage bonus. But remember--51 percent of all married couples currently receive a marriage `bonus' and pay an average of $1,300 LESS in taxes than if they were single, according to CBO. 
They tried to eliminate the so-called marriage penalty. But they increased the marriage bonus we now have for over 50 percent of our filers. Therefore, I think that is a little bit unfair for a $200,000-a-year filer to receive an additional tax cut where we are just trying to make it even for those who make $40,000 or less. 
I believe we should consider taking reasonable steps to address the marriage penalty. However, I strongly disagree with the approach taken in the leading Senate bill proposed on this topic--S. 1285. S. 1285 would allow married couples to file `combined' returns where income can be split 50-50, and each spouse taxed at single rates.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Air Service Restoration Act. Over the last several months, there has been a growing debate about the airline industry, competition, slots and service. This Act seeks to reshape this debate by focusing on problems that small communities have with a deregulated aviation system. Deregulation has provided many benefits to many communities. But, as the General Accounting Office has noted, there are many small communities which have been left behind. 
Some of these communities, these `pockets of pain' as noted by the GAO, would like nothing better than for the Congress to re-regulate the industry. However, Mr. President, I do not believe that is the answer--and that is not what this bill seeks to do. Rather, our legislation proposes to facilitate public-private actions which focus on developing market opportunities for small communities. In this way, communities can develop air service that fits the needs and desires of the community; rather than Washington regulating service. 
This bill is not about competition, but rather the lack of service. As the General Accounting Office noted, since deregulation, communities have seen a decline in the types of service and quality of service. That decline can be attributed to a variety of factors: airports nearby with better, or cheaper, service, the loss of a major employer in the community, or a lack of information about what it takes to create a market. 
But, there are ways to reverse these trends. Let me give you an example. One town in Virginia had about 18,000 enplanements annually, but gradually declined to under 10,000. The airport set out very aggressively to find out what happened, and why. Ultimately, the enplanements went back up, and service is now increasing. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, not all our communities have the resources to aggressively pursue or create market needs. The Federal government must play a role in helping our small communities. It can not stand by as communities lose service, or get cut off from the national air transportation system. Travel, tourism and businesses are too dependent on the system, and each of our small communities must be a part of the system. 
This legislation brings together the Federal government, local government, airports, air carriers and the business communities in partnership to develop ways to increase the use of our nation's small airports. Without these services, small communities can not attract new jobs. It is that simple. We have too much invested in our small towns to let them simply lose their access to the national air transportation system. 
In Owensboro, Kentucky, our airport, in conjunction with community business leaders, is developing an air park: attracting businesses, and creating jobs. That type of activity should be encouraged. 
There are a number of carriers that will not like some of the provisions in the bill--for example, the bill gives DOT the authority to require joint fares and interlining. These provisions may be necessary to make sure that a small community has the ability to connect with major hubs. Such authority would only be required in limited circumstances. 
Mr. President, we need to begin to look at solutions to the problems faced by our small communities--and the need for these communities to have access to our national aviation transportation system. The economic survival of these communities in a global marketplace depends on the ability to connect to the marketplace. It is my hope and belief that this legislation re-focuses the debate on this issue--connecting America's small communities to the greatest, most efficient, and safest air transportation system in the world.

Mr. FORD. Madam President, on April 22nd, Louisville will honor one of its foremost, but often forgotten leaders, James Guthrie. Guthrie, was one of Louisville's most prominent citizens in the 19th Century, described as the city's `first and foremost mover and shaker.' 
During his distinguished business and political career, he served as President of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and the University of Louisville. As a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, he successfully ushered through Kentucky's first city charter elevating Louisville from a town to a city. He was instrumental in the founding of Cave Hill Cemetery, lighting the streets with gas lights, building the first bridge across the Ohio River, and founding what would become the University of Louisville's medical college. 
Mr. Guthrie left his mark on the national level as well. Under President Franklin Pierce he served as Secretary to the U.S. Treasury and in 1865 he was elected to the U.S. Senate. 
A 19th Century railroad tycoon, Guthrie was a product of the frontier. Born in Bardstown, Kentucky, he rose from modest means to a position of great prominence, including building a reputation as an outstanding lawyer. And while he may have failed in his efforts to see Louisville named the state capital, there is little else at which he didn't succeed once setting his mind to it. 
One of his most noted accomplishments was improving transportation, including development of railroad transportation from Louisville to Frankfort, Nashville, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati, even when it meant playing hardball to reach his goal. 
Despite his long list of contributions to Louisville, the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the nation as a whole, there is relatively little in the way of historical markers to remind people of his tremendous influence. To remedy that situation, an historic marker will be dedicated at the intersection of Fourth and Guthrie Streets. 
Madam President, it certainly seems fitting that we take time to assure someone who contributed so much is remembered by future generations. And I know I join all Kentuckians in lending my support to the City of Louisville's efforts at memorializing a man so committed to Kentucky and the nation.

Mr. FORD. I thank the Chairman. There is one point I want to make about the bill. The report accompanying the House version of H.R. 2843, House Report 105-456, notes that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has the discretion not to require defibrillators on aircraft with a payload capacity of more than 7,500 pounds, or at small airports. The report goes on to indicate that the smaller aircraft, less than the size of major carrier jets, typically have `relatively narrow aisles and limited open floor space at the entry door and in the service areas.' Is it the Senator's understanding that the FAA has the discretion not to require defibrillators on small aircraft typically used by the regional airlines? 
Senator McCAIN. That is my understanding. 
Senator FORD. So for example, the FAA could require the use of defibrillators on board a Boeing 747, but has the discretion not to do so for classes of aircraft, like regional jets or turbo prop aircraft. Is that correct? 
Senator FRIST. If I could indicate to the Chairman and other members, it is the intention of the authors of the bill to provide the FAA with the ability to make just that sort of determination. The bill clearly gives the FAA the ability to use its judgement, to take into account many factors, in determining the size and type of aircraft, subject to any defibrillator requirement. For example, the report accompanying the House bill talks about the ability of smaller aircraft to land in the event of an emergency more quickly than larger aircraft because they need shorter runways. The report `urges the FAA to consider these factors in deciding where to draw the the line'. 
Senator McCAIN. I appreciate the comments of my colleagues to clarify the intent of the bill. 
Senator FORD. I thank the Chairman and my colleagues.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I join Senator Bond, my fellow co-chairman of the National Guard Caucus, in introducing legislation to allow the Secretary of Defense to increase the number of National Guard and reserve generals on active duty. 
Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre brought it to our attention that under current law, guard and reserve general officers brought on active duty for more than 180 days count against the service's active duty ceilings specified in 10 U.S.C. 526. Our proposed legislation would exempt full-time active duty guard and reserve general officers from the limit in title 10. But we only allow the exemption so it does not exceed 3 percent of the current limit of 877 general officers. 
This legislation will encourage the military services to assign guard/reserve general officers to a wider variety of non-traditional assignments allowing these general officers to gain a greater depth of experience. The legislation will greatly enhance the total force idea, by providing a more seamless integration of the reserve and active component senior leadership. Senator Bond and I also believe this legislation will foster a greater appreciation by the active duty service leadership of the expertise available from the guard and reserve community. 
This legislation would eliminate the disincentive to expand guard and reserve general officers assignments by easing the one-for-one reserve component versus active component offset. There are currently 22 Guard and Reserve general officers on full time active duty. All but three of those officers are serving in assignment directly related to Guard and Reserve matters. This legislation would exempt up to 25 Guard and Reserve general officers from counting against active duty general officer end strength. 
Senator Bond and I would encourage the Senate Armed Services Committee to include this legislation in the fiscal year 1999 defense authorization bill.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I wanted to let my Senate colleagues know of the retirement of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Wilson, III, a truly outstanding soldier in the United States Army. Colonel Wilson is most deserving of our attention. His career accomplishments reflect the type of military leader this nation was depended upon for two hundred years during peace and war. 
Colonel Wilson has distinguished himself throughout his 23-year career as a soldier and officer in the United States Army. A native of Bowling Green, Kentucky, Charles began his service as a Military Police enlisted soldier in October 1969. As a young soldier, Charles's Battalion Commander recognized his special skills in leading and working with fellow soldiers. He received responsibility for key positions in his company, earning promotion quickly. 
Within his first year he was already selected for leadership responsibility within his military police platoon. Colonel Wilson only served as a military policeman for two years before he was honorably discharged in September 1971, to pursue his college degree, which included studies as a Reserve Officer Training Corps cadet. During this short period of duty, Charles had earned the rank of sergeant. He graduated from the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga and the ROTC program as a distinguished military graduate, and he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Infantry in May 1977. After graduation as an Infantry Lieutenant, he was assigned to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Again, Charles' inherent leadership skills were soon recognized. As a junior Second Lieutenant, his Brigade Commander selected him to command Bravo Company, 5th Battalion, 3rd Basic Training Brigade. 
Because of his mature and talented leadership and his competence, the Commanding General later designated Charles' company as the first at Fort Leonard Wood to integrate women trainees into the basic training program. His hard work and enthusiasm as a company commander ensured that his unit successfully accomplished the challenging task. 
Subsequent assignments found Lieutenant Colonel Wilson with increasing amounts of responsibility to include duties as a Company Commander with 197th Separate Infantry Brigade, Fort Benning, Georgia; G3 for Operations and Plans, Schweinfurt Military Community, 3d Infantry Division, Germany; and Deputy Division Comptroller for the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. 
In September 1990, Charles deployed with the `Screaming Eagles' to Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He was one of only five Combat Comptrollers in the desert. His expertise in resource management and contracting was invaluable. The Division's units and soldiers had the items they needed to go to war and the items they needed to maintain quality of life at Camp Eagle, Saudi Arabia. 
The Army reassigned Colonel Wilson in 1993 to the Pentagon to work in the Inspections Division of the Office of the Inspector General and later with the Army Budget Office as the `point man' for developing and validating the Army's cost of conducting contingency operations. His current and final assignment has been as the Deputy Chief of the Congressional Budget Liaison Office, Army Budget Office. Through his tireless effort and positive `can do' personality, Wilson ensured that soldiers were well represented on Capitol Hill. 
Speaking for Kentucky and the nation, I wish to thank this distinguished soldier, his wife Melissa, sons Jason, Andy and daughter Kathryne, and to wish him continued success in future endeavors.

<TEXT>
Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank the clerk for reading it. I apologize for imposing upon him, but I wanted that to be a part of the Record. Not many people will read the Record back home. I would like for them to see and hear it. On behalf of the fans and the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, it is a great pleasure for me to come to the Senate floor today to brag on a group of young men that refused to give up, a team that showed us all the best about teamwork, selflessness, and dedication--the 1998 NCAA National Champion University of Kentucky Wildcats. 
The University of Kentucky has a storied tradition of outstanding basketball teams; the `Fabulous Five,' the `Fiddlin Five,' `Rupp's Runts,' and more recently, `The Unforgettables,' to name just a few. But today, we have a new team to add to that list: `The Comeback Cats.' 
Faced with a 10-point half-time deficit, the Cats overcame that deficit and rallied to beat Utah, a team of outstanding athletes playing under a fine coach. And by doing so, they broke the all-time record for the largest half-time deficit overcome in the NCAA Title game. 
But this was not the first time the Wildcats had to make a rally in this tournament. Down to Duke by 17 in the Elite Eight and down by 10 points to Stanford in the National Semifinal, the Wildcats did what we've become accustomed to in Kentucky. They turned up the defense, they hit the offensive boards and they hit the `threes' when they counted. 
And they did it on a team that can best be described as a celestial body--a team with no individual stars. As Washington Post sportswriter Michael Wilbon noted this morning, `This is one of the few Kentucky basketball teams that is completely without a star player. But Coach Tubby Smith convinced the players many games ago they don't need one.' 
This is a team with three seniors as tri-captains who have all sacrificed: Cameron Mills, a player who'll be long remembered for his clutch three-pointers, came to the team as a walk-on after passing up scholarships to play at other schools; Allen Edwards, a three-position player fighting on after the loss of his mother; and Jeff Sheppard, a red shirted player last year who became this year's Most Valuable Player in the Tournament. 
Of course all of this would not have been possible without the guidance and steady hand of Coach Tubby Smith, a man filling the shoes of a coach who became a legend in Kentucky over a few short years, Rick Pitino. 
Today in Kentucky they're talking about a man who led this team to the Championship and has shown, as a local paper noted, that `skill, intelligence and a self-effacing gentlemanliness are enough to win games--and hearts.' Tubby Smith has shown us that nice guys do, indeed, finish first. 
For all the players, the coaches, the managers--and anyone else associated with the team--let me say congratulations on a job well done, and please know there are thousands of Kentuckians who are very proud of you. 
Mr. President, I might say that of the three times the Tennessee women will have been at the White House to be honored, Kentucky will have been there two of those, and they had to go into overtime to lose the third one. I think we have an outstanding group of people. 
I ask for approval of the resolution.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, as has been obvious last Friday and today, this Senator succeeded the service of the distinguished Kentucky statesman, Alben Barkley. It is an extraordinary gift that the people of my State have given to me, because it is a gift only they have to give; that is, through their votes. If there is any significance to this period of service, it is that I have served my people well, have voted the way they would have hoped I would vote, and they understand that I work hard even though I do not accomplish everything that I hope to. 
Mr. President, on Friday, one of the finest young men that I have known in a long time, Senator Daschle, said some very kind words about me and our association. I am grateful to him. John Glenn, whom everybody knows--and you want to stand close to him so you can get your picture made--John and his wife Ann and Mrs. Ford and I have become very close personal friends. John is going to do what he feels he can still make a contribution to, and that is how we can prevent aging. I wish him all the success in the world. After I leave here, I intend to form the Government Education Center in my hometown for high school students. The John Glenns of this world will do what they can do best. I hope that Wendell Ford can do what he does best and try to encourage young people to take an interest in government, whether it is local, State, or Federal. Maybe we can find another Henry Clay, or Henrietta Clay, as the times would dictate, in the class of high school students. We will begin that in January of next year when I leave the Senate. 
Harry Reid, who talked about Searchlight, NV, a very small community, reminds me of Yellow Creek, KY, where I came from; the little town of Thruston. 
Senator Kennedy, for the remarks he made on Friday, I am grateful to him. 
We have just listened to some words from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd. As he said, he was the whip when I came to the Senate, and he was almost a `third Senator' for Kentucky, because we had so much in common between West Virginia and Kentucky, particularly in eastern Kentucky. 
I thought I knew the love of this institution until I met Senator Robert Byrd and understood his love for this institution. I thought I understood `to defend and support the Constitution' of these United States until I met Robert C. Byrd and saw his tenacious support of the Constitution and how sometimes he would stand alone in his defense of it. So the years with Senator Robert Byrd have been very meaningful to me. We need people such as him to give us the legislative history not only of our beginning and prior to that but so that we understand why we are here and how we work. 
Mr. President, I may have formal remarks later on in this session before we leave, but I could not let this time pass without thanking my friends for their kind words and hope that somehow I may be able to develop and encourage young people to come and be a future Robert C. Byrd or a Tom Daschle or a Harry Reid or a Ted Kennedy. 
I thank all of them for their kind words, and particularly the people of my State who have been so kind to me in the years we have worked together for its betterment. Maybe I ought to apologize to some of my colleagues for being so tenacious at times in trying to serve the people in my State, whom I love so much. A lot of them I love I have never seen or met, but the relationship is still there. As we go through this trying time as it relates to support for the farmer in my State, I probably have been more tenacious than I have ever been because it is the largest political problem I have had since I have been in politics some 35 years. 
Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak. There being no Senator wishing to be recognized, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

But I do thank my colleague for a bit of history as it relates to my political career. His is somewhat akin to mine. When he ran for office, he was not expected to win, and he did. So I think we can relate to those periods in our lives and our political tenure. I do thank him for his kind words today, and I look forward to working with him to accomplish things for our Commonwealth and this country in the next few months we will serve together. I am grateful to him. 
I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, once again, I rise to discuss an issue that in the recent past has generated lots of talk and not much action--campaign finance reform. But thanks to the hard work of my colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--we are once again at the brink of doing something to address the many problems we have with our system for financing election campaigns. 
Thanks to the tireless efforts of our colleagues, Senators McCain and Feingold, we now know that the question is not whether a bill will come to the floor, but whether we will pass the bill that they have brought us. Keeping that in mind, I want to speak a bit today on why I support the measure before us. 
As an original co-sponsor of McCain-Feingold, I agree that what is necessary is a comprehensive overhaul of the way we conduct our campaign business. If we have learned anything from our experiences in the last few elections, it is that money has become too important in our campaigns. Mr. President, in the last election federal candidates and their allies spent over $2 billion--$2 billion--in support of their campaigns. The McCain-Feingold bill currently before us, I believe, is the sort of sweeping reform that we must pass if we are to restore public trust and return a measure of sanity to the way we finance elections. 
Now each of us has his or her own perspective on what's wrong with the system. For me, Mr. President, it's the explosive cost of campaigning. When I announced in March 1997 that I would not seek reelection, I said: `Democracy as we know it will be lost if we continue to allow government to become one bought by the highest bidder, for the highest bidder. Candidates will simply become bit players and pawns in a campaign managed and manipulated by paid consultants and hired guns.' The problem becomes clearer when you look at specifics. In my case, when I first was elected to the Senate, I spent less than $450,000--actually, $437,482--on my campaign. Back then, I thought that was a lot of money. If only I'd known. Mr. President, if I hadn't decided to retire, for next year's election I would have had to raise $4.5 million. Now, I know all about inflation but that's not inflation--that's madness. What's worse, I understand that if we continue on this path, by the year 2025 it will cost $145 million to run for a single Senate seat. Can any of us imagine what our country will look like when the only people who can afford public service are people who have--or can raise--tens of millions of dollars for their campaigns? I can't imagine such a future, Mr. President--and the time is now to make sure things never get that bad. McCain-Feingold won't cure everything that ails the current system, but I support it because it represents a real, meaningful first step toward restoring a sense of balance in our campaigns by ensuring that people and ideas--not money--are what matters. Specifically, I support McCain-Feingold because it deals with a series of disturbing issues that have grown in importance in recent years. 
I also agree that a primary problem with the current system is the flood of `soft money.' But when I speak of soft money, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that we are talking about more than just the fundraising of the national parties. True--in 1996, the parties raised over a quarter billion dollars in soft money, which they then used in various ways to support their candidates at every level of the ballot. That's a lot of money, but it's only a small part of the total so-called `soft money' picture. That's because soft money is any money that is not regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act. That includes national party money, of course, but it also includes millions of dollars raised and spent by independent groups on so-called `issue ads.' Thanks to the excellent work of our colleagues on the Government Affairs Committee, we now know that many of these so-called independent organizations, many claiming tax-exempt status, are established, operated, and financed by parties and candidates themselves--and their finances are totally unregulated. Therefore, McCain-Feingold is meaningful reform because it recognizes that the problem is not just `soft' money, it is `unregulated' money. 
The McCain-Feingold bill is also valuable because it recognizes that closing the party soft money loophole is not enough. The bill also addresses the problem of so-called `issue advocacy' advertising. These so-called issue ads have developed as a new--and sometimes devious--way that unregulated money is issued to affect elections. Lawyers might call it `issue advocacy', but I'm not a lawyer so I call it what it really is, `handoff funding'. `Handoff funding' is where a candidate `hands off' spending, usually on hard-hitting negative ads, to a supposedly neutral third party whose finances are completely unregulated and not disclosed. Now I know there are those who call these ads free speech. But this isn't free speech, it's paid speech. Of course we need to respect the Constitution, but we can't let people hide behind the Constitution for their own personal or partisan gain. McCain-Feingold draws this paid speech into the light where not the lawyers but the jury--the American people--can decide which issues and which candidates they will support. 
Mr. President, I want to respond just a moment to the claim of many of my Republican colleagues that McCain-Feingold's issue advocacy reform somehow limits free speech. That simply is not true. When this bill passes, not one ad that ran in the last election--not one, not even the worst attack ad--will be illegal. What McCain-Feingold would do is say to those candidates and groups who have been using `handoff funding' to puff themselves up or tear down their opponents--all the while claiming that they were simply, quote, `advocating issues'--is that within 60 days of the election they must take credit for their work, dirty or otherwise. The only people whose speech will be prevented by this law are people who are afraid to step into the light and be seen for who they are. That, Mr. President, is what I call reform--and I think the American people would agree. 
Another critical issue addressed in McCain-Feingold--and this is one area, I think, where we all are in nearly unanimous agreement--is the question of disclosure. Currently there is too much campaign activity--contributions and spending--that is not disclosed to the public on a regular, timely basis. We must commit ourselves, as does McCain-Feingold, to providing the American people with timely and full disclosure to information about political spending, and the means by which they can access that information. Like many colleagues, I believe that the Internet and electronic filing is the way to make this happen; but I hope we will make it clear that all campaign finances--including third-party issue advocacy--are to be disclosed before we get too worried about how such disclosure would take place. 
Mr. President, all these reforms will be meaningless unless we are willing to do right by the Federal Election Commission. If the FEC really is the toothless tiger that many people said it is, we must take at least some of the blame for removing its teeth. Any bill that makes changes to the campaign finance laws without restoring the FEC's funding and improving its ability to publicize, investigate, and punish violations cannot truly claim the title of `reform.' 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I know that we will not have an easy road to passage of campaign finance reform legislation. In this body there are a number of colleagues who are opposed to reform and aren't afraid to speak their minds about the quote, `danger,' of reform. Mr. President, I can't blame them. If I had the advantage of millions of dollars from wealthy folks and millions more from corporations and special interests, I would think reform was dangerous, too, and I would have to think twice before supporting a bill that took away that advantage. Their opposition--whether in the public interest or their self-interest--means that the debate on this issue will get more than a few of us into a real lather. I'll take that challenge, Mr. President. Just because campaign finance reform will be difficult, and might require each party to give up things it cares about or simply has gotten used to, is no reason not to pass McCain-Feingold, and soon. 
All we need to do is to roll up our selves and remember the wisdom of that great Kentuckian Henry Clay, who called compromise `mutual sacrifice.' Our way is clear, if not easy, but I have confidence that we will do what is right to restore public confidence in the way we fund our campaigns. I look forward to the continuing debate, and to demonstrate to the American people that we are serious about cleaning up the system by voting for comprehensive campaign finance reform.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to exempt certain disabled individuals from mandated managed care coverage under Medicaid. During consideration of last year's budget legislation, this issue arose but was not addressed in a satisfactory manner. That legislation provided a broad grant of authority to states to require individuals eligible for Medicaid to enroll in managed care plans. Prior to this change, states were required to obtain waivers from the federal government in order to initiate such cost savings measures which would shift large portions of their Medicaid populations into managed care. 
However, states have generally not been interested in shifting certain categories of individuals into managed care, such as individuals in nursing homes or special needs children. In fact, last year's legislation specifically exempted certain categories of special needs children under age nineteen. 
Mr. President, I believe for certain categories of individuals it does not make sense to limit this exemption to individuals under age nineteen. For example, mentally retarded individuals receiving Medicaid benefits do not enter into a new health care category once they reach their nineteenth birthday. I believe limiting the exemption for such individuals is arbitrary and unwise policy. My legislation would simply remove the age limitation for severely disabled individuals. 
I want to express my thanks to the Voice of the Retarded for their leadership on this issue and their willingness to bring it to my attention. I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of this legislation from that organization be inserted into the Record. I also want to thank Louise Underwood, a constituent of mine who has been a tireless advocate over the years for the rights of mentally retarded and other disabled individuals. It is my hope that this straightforward correction to last year's legislation will be viewed as noncontroversial, and can be enacted into law in the months ahead.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I add my name as an original cosponsor of a constitutional amendment to prohibit the physical desecration of the American flag. 
I know that there are many who believe that the desecration of our country's flag is the ultimate expression of their political freedoms, but I do not believe all speech is free. Our country pays a price when we see demonstrations which tear down our standard bearer of national integrity. Our flag represents the values upon which this nation was founded and our charter of government established in Philadelphia in 1787. When we no longer value the flag as a symbol of national unity and allegiance to this compact, our Republic is weakened. 
Burning our country's flag is not political free speech, it is political garbage. As a society, we have placed parameters on free speech. A person who shouts fire in a crowded theater does not enjoy the protection of freedom of speech. A person whose words incite violence does not enjoy the protection of the First Amendment. I firmly believe that no legitimate act of political protest should be suppressed. Nor should we ever discourage debate and discussion about the Federal government. However, to allow the physical desecration of our national symbol is to allow the ties that bind us as a country, the ties that bind one generation to the next in their love and respect for this country, to be weakened. When we no longer value our flag, we lose value for our country, our government, and each other. 
Over two hundred years after the ratification of our nation's Bill of Rights, the United States Supreme Court erroneously ruled that the desecration of our national symbol is protected speech in the case of Texas vs. Johnson. In response to this decision, the United States Senate overwhelmingly passed the Flag Protection Act, which was also declared unconstitutional by the high court. The Supreme Court's action has made it clear that a constitutional amendment is necessary for enactment of any binding protection of the flag. Up to this point, neither House of Congress has been able to garner the two-thirds super majority necessary for passage of a constitutional amendment. But because grassroots support for this amendment continues to grow, I have joined with members on both sides of the aisle to again try passing this amendment. I am hopeful that this time we will get the necessary votes. 
Let me close by recalling the words of a Union Soldier in his last letter to his wife dated July 14, 1861. He said, `my courage does not halt or falter. I know how American civilization now bears upon the triumph of the government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution, and I am willing, perfectly willing, to lay down all my joys in this life to help maintain this government and pay that debt.' 
Today, our task here in the Senate seems trivial in comparison. But if we want the flag that hangs in school rooms, over courthouses, in sports stadiums and off front porches all across America, to continue symbolizing that same commitment to country, then it is a challenge we cannot fail to meet. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

Mr. FORD. Madam President, we are developing a position here that I don't particularly like, as it relates to naming an airport after one of our great Presidents. One of the things that concerns me most is what Ronald Reagan did as President. When he wrote his federalist papers, the Executive Order, I believe, 12612, it related to States rights and local authority. 
I want to explain my views on this legislation to rename the Washington National Airport. This airport has been named the Washington National Airport since 1941. Franklin Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for the airport. The airport is on property that once belonged to the family of Martha Washington and the stepson of George Washington. What we are about to do is not an appropriate way to honor, in my opinion, one of our Presidents. In fact, in a sense, it dishonors our first President. 
Ronald Reagan will have his place in history, having served two terms as President. His name is already etched on the second-largest Government building in this community. And in April, his lovely wife Nancy will be here to celebrate and dedicate the opening of that building. President Reagan clearly believed that State and local governments should be given the power to act, wherever possible, rather than the Federal Government. In fact, he issued an Executive order so that all Federal agencies made sure that local decisions were respected. 
Each of our major airports named after a President was accomplished because of local decisions. In Houston, George Bush's name was added to the name of the airport because of a decision by the mayor and the city council. In New York, the mayor, city council, and port authority honored John F. Kennedy. Here, we have objections, not support, from local communities. We may all agree that it should be renamed, but should we run roughshod over the views of the local citizenry? That would be contrary to President Reagan's papers, the Executive Order 12612. 
One year prior to signing the executive order on federalism, Congress enacted legislation, championed by President Reagan's Secretary of Transportation, that created a multi-State airport authority to run and operate the two Washington-area airports. We turned over the keys to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which we refer to as MWAA. On March 1, 1987, Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole signed a 50-year lease with MWAA. Lock, stock and barrel, subject to certain limitations, we gave them the keys to the Washington National Airport. 
Section after section of the 1986 act recognizes the independence of MWAA from the Federal Government for the purposes of running the airport. The lease also has similar language. 
It is not clear to me that we can clearly usurp the local airport authority's power and merely rename the airport. Yet, this bill does just that. In 1990--just think back a few short years ago--Senator Dole appropriately introduced a resolution to rename the Dulles Airport after former President Eisenhower. Now, Eisenhower was a very good President. He was a very good military leader; World War II was won by his genius. The Dole bill, however, recognized the local operating authority, and rather than usurping that authority, it urged the airport authority to make the name change. That was done appropriately and by the law and by President Reagan's federalist papers, where he said local authority 
should be the uppermost. 
If we had worked this issue properly, Madam President, I suspect we would have come to a similar conclusion and found a way to recognize our former President. Instead, we will rename the airport by fiat and let the lawyers have their day in court. The legality may be challenged and, in my view, the lawyers may have an excellent chance of winning. We are running over local authority with this piece of legislation. They say that closer to the runway are those who are associated with this area, and those who operate the airport would prefer that the 56-year-old airport stay Washington National. And joining officials from Alexandria, who are opposed, and Arlington, who have previously said they oppose the change, the Greater Washington Board of Trade weighed in against this change last week. `With all due respect to President Reagan, we believe that renaming the airport would be very confusing to air travelers, visitors, and local residents alike,' the chairman of the Board's Transportation and Environment Committee said. 
Let me quote the first Republican Governor of Virginia this century--and I served with him--A. Linwood Holton, Jr.: 
I also urge Congress not to impose the change on the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, which oversees National and Dulles International Airport under this 50-year lease from the Federal Government. 
Linwood Holton says: 
I hate to see even something as politically popular as this begin to chip away at the independence of local authority. 
It's not easy to stand up here and be opposed to having the name of a famous and well-liked President on an airport. But someone, somehow has to understand that we are usurping local authority and the local people do not want it, and we would be giving them something they don't want, and that is typically Federal Government. 
My colleague from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, read a letter from the former President announcing his problems with having Alzheimer's and his wife having a problem as it relates to breast cancer. 
And if the Gipper could tell us today what he would rather have, I believe he would rather have something named on behalf of his wife as it relates to the fight against breast cancer in this country today. That would be meaningful. That would be helpful. And it would be something that I think you would find 100-percent support for. 
So, Madam President, I regret that I must oppose this piece of legislation. You can go across the country. I named Houston for President George Bush, New York for President Kennedy, Denver--they decided to name the airport after a former mayor. And Las Vegas named it after a former Senator. 
So it is on and on, and all of the decisions were made by the people of those communities. President Reagan would not want us to violate his principles in the process of naming something in his honor. 
Let's think about that just a minute. President Reagan would not want us to violate his principles in the process of naming something in his honor. 
The law states that the airport assumes all rights and obligations as an airport. And it should be treated like all other airports. Can we mandate a renaming of any other airport? I don't think so. 
So, Madam President, I hope that something can be worked out rather than having the resolution amended to add other names; the resolution be amended to take care of the IRS, the resolution be amended to do a lot of other things. 
So let's look at the ownership of this property for a moment, if we may. 
Originally it was owned by the Alexandria family, for which the city of Alexandria is named. That is who owned this property. 
The property was later owned by the Custis family. John Parke Custis acquired the land from the Alexandria family. John Parke Custis was the son of Martha Washington, and the stepson of George Washington. 
George Washington was close to John Custis, and following John's death adopted his two children. The children then lived at Mount Vernon. And the airport was designed after Mount Vernon. 
The Abington Plantation was returned later to the Alexandria family. 
In the 1920's, the land was owned by Lewis Smoot, and later sold to the Richmond, Fredricksburg, and Potomac Railroad. 
Two airports were located near the Virginia side of the 14th Street Bridge; one the Hoover Field. That was after a President, which opened in 1926, and Washington Airport opened in 1927. The airports merged because of the Depression. 
The decision to build Washington National Airport did not occur until 1938 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt effectively bypassed this body and began construction. 
Following a series of disputes over who actually owned the land, the District of Columbia and Virginia claimed title. The Federal Government asserted jurisdiction in 1946. 
So not only has the George Washington family--the first--of these United States been involved in this property in this area for the lifetime of this country but I think that leaving the name as it is, or changing the name to whatever should be, as President Reagan insisted that we do back in the 1986 when he wrote his Federal Executive order, I think it would be much better to honor his wife since his name is already etched in the second-largest building in this area, second only to the Pentagon. I hope that a way can be found rather than to make it look partisan, and some will take my position because they think it is right. Others will take an opposite view because of the political arena. Some will take the same view I have because of politics. I have taken the view because of what President Reagan said in his papers, Executive Order 16612, that said that communities and the States and in their judgment should be respected. And I think we ought to do what the former President asked us to do. 
I see no one wanting the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this will be next to my last end-of-session period, and at the end of next year and the 105th Congress I will be joining my family back in Kentucky. 
But let me say that in all of my 23 years so far here I have never enjoyed so much the friendship and watched the work of the Democratic leader to be any more outstanding or any more caring, developed with integrity and character. He is one individual who I think, when you look back at his theme of `families first'--that was the view of all of the 100 Senators--that not only would this Chamber be covered with accolades for the job he has done, but we would see this country progress in a much better and finer fashion. 
So to the Democratic leader, I pay my respect, and my everlasting thanks for his courtesy in working with me during the year. 
Having said that, I want to say that he has developed one of the finest staffs not only on the floor but in his office that anyone could work with. All of us are anxious to do good. All of us are anxious to say the right things. But we have to have the right kind of support. 
So as we observe the Senate floor and see who is doing the work and putting the package together, we all understand that we have chosen well in the staff on both sides. 
So, Mr. President, I didn't want to leave here without saying to my friend from South Dakota when he reached out to help all families that he reached out to my family and to my family's family. And I see what good will come from his efforts and his desire and his hope and vision for the future. 
Also, I want to say that I think he has worked very well with the majority leader. The majority leader has had some tremendous stress and strain. But had it not been for the cooperation and effort of the Democratic leader, the first session of the 105th Congress would not be ending on the high note that I believe it is. 
I thank the Chair. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the legislation before us would authorize the Architect of the Capitol to accept a gift of approximately 41 acres of property and buildings in Culpeper, Virginia for use by the Library of Congress as a national audiovisual conservation center. The purchase price of this facility is $5.5 million. The private foundation which has offered to purchase this property and donate it for the Library's use has also agreed to provide the Library with an additional $4.5 million for the renovation of this property, making a total gift of $10 million. The renovations to the property will be made by the Architect of the Capitol, as approved by the appropriate oversight and appropriations committees. 
The Library's film collection is currently stored in several Library or government-leased sites. With this gift, the Library intends to consolidate the storage of its audio-visual collection, specifically its acetate film collection. However, the facility at Culpeper cannot currently house the nitrate-based film collection. While I will not object to passage of this legislation, I am concerned by both the manner in which the Library presented this issue to Congress and by a number of precedent-setting issues this gift raises which have not been fully aired. 
It is my understanding that the Library first identified the Culpeper property as a potential site for storage of a portion of its film collection several years ago. And yet, this legislation before us today was shared with my office only last week, and was introduced in the House and Senate over the week-end. While it is not unusual this time of year to see legislation flying past the Congress on its way to the White House for signature, this measure raises a number of concerns that should, and could, have been fully debated by those who ultimately will be responsible to the taxpayer for the cost of its maintenance and upkeep in the years to come. 
First, and most importantly, is the issue of whether the government, particularly the Library, should be in the business of acquiring real estate. It is rather ironic that this is being proposed at a time when the leadership in the Congress is calling for privatization of many legislative branch functions and the sale of certain legislative branch properties. It is particularly true of this property which includes about 41 acres, but insufficient buildings and improvements to house all of the Library's audiovisual collection. I don't want to assume what the Library plans to do with all this property, but I got a pretty good idea by reading the study the Library commissioned from Abacus Technology Corporation. 
The current buildings on the Culpeper property can house only the acetate film collection. In order to consolidate the nitrate film collection at the Culpeper site, the Abacus study recommends constructing new buildings to house the nitrate collection. And how much would such facilities cost? Over $16 million over the next 4 years. But a hefty building and expansion program is not all that is planned for these 41 acres. The Abacus study describes the Library's vision with regard to this audiovisual center as offering, subject to the approval of Congress, a cost-effective conservation service for other libraries and archives. Whether this will require additional buildings or is included in the Abacus cost estimates already is not disclosed. 
A second concern that this issue raises is the ultimate cost to the taxpayer of accepting this gift. According to the Abacus study, the total cost for renovating, maintaining and expanding the Culpeper property over the 25 year life cycle of the facility is $47 million. Other alternatives identified by Abacus and the Library range from about $54 million to $86 million. However, the Abacus study does not include cost estimates for the Architect of the Capitol for the on-going maintenance and repair of the 41 acres of grounds and buildings that would now be owned by the government. 
Thirdly, as currently structured, it is not clear how this property and facilities will be managed. By statute, the Architect of the Capitol is responsible for only the structural work on buildings and grounds of Library property, including the maintenance and care of the grounds and certain mechanical equipment. Since this site is over 70 miles away from Washington, it may require that the Architect physically locate maintenance personnel there. But the Architect will not manage these 41 acres and buildings--that will now be the responsibility of the Library--hardly a task they have much experience with. Moreover, as my colleagues know, the Library has its own security force. Presumably, this facility will also need to be secure. However, in recent years, there have been discussions about the possibility of transferring certain exterior security functions of the Library security force to the Capitol Police. I'm not sure I want our Capitol police responsible for taking care of the security of 41 acres in Culpeper. 
I appreciate the pressure the Librarian feels to raise private funds to provide core Library functions. However, any gift that the Librarian solicits ultimately becomes the responsibility of the American taxpayers. Before we saddle them with the maintenance, upkeep, and overhead of additional federal buildings and prime real estate, there should an opportunity to fully air these issues. Changes I sought in this legislation will do that, even if after the fact. 
Being from Kentucky, I know better than to look a gift horse in the mouth. But being from west Kentucky, which is hog country, I also know a pig-in-a-poke when I see it. The Library may not be asking the American taxpayers to accept a pig-in-a-poke, but with all the unanswered questions, this Culpeper property is pretty darn close to it. I'll be sticking close to the farm over the next year, and as provided by this legislation, will be looking for answers to these questions before approving improvements and expansions on this gift.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on August 5, 1997, Korean Air flight 801 crashed into a hillside on Guam, killing 228. We worked with Chairman McCain and our House colleagues last year to enact legislation requiring U.S. air carriers to develop plans to address the needs of families following an aviation disaster. The 1996 Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] Reauthorization Act (P.L. 104-264), however, did not impose a similar requirement on foreign carriers serving the United States. 
Section 703 of the FAA Reauthorization Act specifically requires that the air carrier submit disaster plans to the Secretary of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board. The plans must include items such as a means to publicize toll-free telephone numbers for the families, a process for notifying families, an assurance that the families be consulted on the disposition of remains and personal effects, and a requirement that the carrier work with other organizations in dealing with the disaster. 
Congressman Underwood of Guam originally introduced H.R. 2834 on the House side, and a corresponding bill, S. 1196, was introduced in the Senate to subject foreign carriers serving the United States to the requirements mentioned above. The Senate bill was considered and reported by the Commerce Committee. 
I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 2834 so the President can sign this bill.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to explain to my colleagues the need for H.R. 2626, a bill to make clarifications to the Pilot Records Improvement Act of 1996. Last year, we worked diligently with the airlines, ALPA and the Independent Pilots Association, to craft a bill that requires air carriers to share pilot records before a pilot could be employed. The change in law was necessitated by a safety recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board. 
H.R. 2626 modifies the law to let the air carriers hire a pilot prior to final check of the records, but the pilot can not operate a commercial flight until the records are checked. Thus, the carriers can begin training new employees, and when the records are cleared, put the pilot to work. Because there have been problems in expeditiously providing records, the hiring process will not be impeded. 
For small aircraft that are not used in scheduled service, for example, an on-demand cargo charter aircraft with a maximum payload capacity of less than 7,500 pounds, a fully certified pilot can operate such aircraft for a limited period while the records are being reviewed. The requirement on the cargo operator is not changed--the records must be obtained and checked, but the pilot can fly for a 90-day period. Finally, the bill provides a narrow good faith exception for a carrier seeking the records of a pilot from another carrier that has ceased to exist. All other requirements for the pilot--licenses, medical tests, for example--are unchanged. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senate is in the process of considering fast-track legislation--a take-it-or-leave-it procedure for any trade agreements the administration sends to the Congress for approval. This procedure, created back in 1974, prevents Congress from taking any steps to improve trade agreements, even if there is unanimous agreement to do so. 
While it has only been used five times since its creation, Americans need to understand that it amounts to an abdication of Congress' power, granted under article I, section 8 of the Constitution: `to regulate commerce with foreign nations.' 
Fast track does not provide the President with negotiating authority. The President already has that authority. Agreements are then submitted to Congress for its approval. 
In fact, this President has concluded over 200 trade agreements since taking office, only 2 of which were approved by Congress under fast-track procedures. 
Mr. President, much is at stake in this debate. The issue today is how we can best ensure that all Americans--corporate chiefs, shareholders, and workers--can benefit from expanded trade. 
Supporters of fast-track legislation are misleading the American public when they claim our economic leadership is at stake. Last month's turmoil in the financial markets provided new evidence that the entire world takes its economic cues largely from what happens here in America. 
This is also not a battle that pits free traders versus protectionists. With exports a key part of the U.S. economy, no one is discounting our economy's global nature. But the fact remains that this Nation is already the most open market on the Earth. And no one opposing fast track today is seeking to raise a tariff wall against goods from other nations. 
The real issue is what America's trade policy should be for the 21st century. Do we continue doing things the way we have been doing them for the last 20 years? Or do we find the courage to develop a trade policy that benefits all Americans, from the corporate office to the assembly line to the storefront. And do we finally forge a true partnership between the executive and legislative branch to develop trade policy? 
Fast-track supporters maintain that, without the fast-track procedure, Congress will simply amend any trade agreement to death. They say trade agreements involve too many players, are too complicated, and are too delicate to risk bringing before a Congress where most Members didn't have direct involvement in the negotiations. 
This is nonsense. There are many, very complicated and delicate issues passed by Congress through the normal legislative process. This year's budget deal is a prime example, There were many players involved. The subject matter was broad and complex. Most Members did not play a direct role in the negotiations. And the final 
resolution involved a delicate compromise that could have easily fallen apart. 
But Congress took up the entire package and passed it. The President signed it and we are now on our way to a balanced budget. I believe the same model could be applied to trade talks. 
Mr. President, aside from the basic philosophical differences over how this Nation should approach trade policy, the fast-track bill reported by the Finance Committee forces the President to negotiate trade agreements in a vacuum. Under this legislation, the President is forced to ignore the lack of fair labor standards or adequate environmental standards in other countries. 
We should not simply accept the premise that labor and environmental standards have nothing to do with trade. Any business in America recognizes that labor and environmental policy is, in fact, competitiveness policy. If they didn't believe it, they wouldn't oppose even modest increases in the minimum wage. If they didn't believe it, they wouldn't be concerned about new EPA regulations on clean air. 
But the fact is, they do believe it. And so should Congress when it comes to the labor and environmental policies of our trading partners. They make a difference wherever goods are made, bought, or sold. 
My colleagues should also be aware that the committee bill requires the President to ignore environmental and labor policy, while at the same time requiring him to negotiate on several other nontrade areas. 
Patent and copyright law. Monetary policy. Food safety issues. Government procurement policies. All of these are included in the bill's principal negotiating objectives because the committee recognizes that these nontrade areas have an impact on trade. 
We do use trade agreements to promote more consistent and more equitable regulatory systems around the world. And we need to recognize, once and for all, that the nonenforcement--or nonexistence--of labor and environmental standards jeopardizes American jobs and industry just as much as the nonenforcement and nonexistence of intellectual property laws. 
One of the first agreements that would come before the Senate under fast track would be the accession of Chile to the NAFTA. So, it's fair to ask how well this agreement, negotiated and adopted under fast-track procedures, has operated for our country. 
One year before the implementation of NAFTA, the United States had a trade surplus with Mexico of about $2 billion. Last year, the United States had a trade deficit with Mexico of nearly $17 billion--a $19 billion shift in trade over a 3-year period. The administration claims that 120,000 to 160,000 jobs have been created as a result of NAFTA. But the Labor Department's NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance Program has certified 136,000 workers as having lost their jobs as a result of NAFTA. Other estimates, including a recent one by the Economic Policy Institute, put the number at 400,000 jobs lost. 
By far, the hardest hit has been the apparel sector, which has lost 158,000 workers in the last 28 months as apparel imports from Mexico have doubled. 
NAFTA certainly has been a success--for Mexico. Unfortunately, America has fared much worse under the agreement. 
Fast-track supporters argue that if we don't act now to expand the NAFTA to include Chile, and, ultimately, other South American countries, we will cede our leadership and fall behind to other trading partners. 
But listen to what the pro-NAFTA 20th Century Fund has to say about the cost of not expanding NAFTA: 
What are the costs to the United States if NAFTA is not expanded? . . . Despite the growth of intraregional trade outside the NAFTA, the costs to the United States of failing to expand NAFTA are not high in strictly economic terms. Whatever occurs on the trade front, the United States will remain the region's dominant economy. NAFTA represents 75% of trade in the hemisphere. . .And NAFTA's exports and imports are more than ten times those of Mercosur, the next largest regional organization. 
And the facts bear out what the 20th Century Fund says. In the past year, without fast track and without new trade agreements, our trade surplus with South America has doubled, to $3.6 billion. 
As bad as the national numbers are, they are still worse for my own State of Kentucky. Exports to Mexico account for just 3 percent of all Kentucky's exports and support just 950 jobs, according to the pro-NAFTA Council of the Americas. NAFTA resulted in an increase of just 4 million dollars' worth of exports to Mexico from Kentucky. 
Unfortunately, the other side of the equation--imports from Mexico--has had a much more immediate and devastating impact on Kentucky. In 1993, over 30,000 Kentuckians worked in the apparel industry. Today, there are just 25,000 Kentucky apparel workers. The layoffs began soon after NAFTA passed and continue to this day. Just this past August, a major apparel manufacturer in my State laid off 2,000 workers. 
When these jobs are lost and plants close, it is simply devastating to whole communities in Kentucky. I'd like to share with my colleagues an account of the plant closings we've suffered in Kentucky. 
An August 8 story in the Louisville Courier-Journal talked about the latest blow to Kentucky's garment industry. Layoffs by Fruit of the Loom of 2,000 workers represents the latest loss to what the paper described as the `hemorrhaging garment-industry' in Kentucky. `At Fruit of the Loom alone, employment will have fallen from 11,000 2 years ago to 5,000 by the time the latest round of layoffs is completed * * *.' 
The vice president of Fruit of the Loom was blunt in his assessment. `We're being impacted by global competition resulting from international trade barriers. We can do the same work cheaper somewhere else.' 
Bill Parsons, executive director of the Lake Cumberland Area Development District where Fruit of the Loom is located, agrees.  
Why would any good businessman want to stay in the U.S., where its going to cost $8.48 an hour to make a garment you can make for 48 cents somewhere else? It makes a lot of business sense when you're looking at the bottom line. 
David and NaDena Agee know first-hand about the bottom-line. Another Courier-Journal story tells how they `have a mortgage on a house they bought two 
years ago when they were both making good salaries at the Fruit of the Loom Plant in Campbellsville. They also have a 19-month-old son who is growing up fast. But after October 8, neither David nor NaDena will have a job because of continuing layoffs at the plant. They are worried about how they will provide for their son.' 
Instead of telling hardworking Americans like the Agees how fast track will assure them of a stable future, supporters of fast track are simply looking the other way. 
Mr. President, I understand that international trade is not just confined to NAFTA. But proponents of fast track won't find a convincing argument on the other side of the world either. 
Our trade deficit is enormous and growing. In 1995, our trade deficit rang in at $105 billion. Last year's deficit was still higher--$114 billion. And this year we are on our way to our fourth consecutive year of record high trade deficits. The monthly trade deficit has increased each month this year except June. 
Why do we have such enormous deficit? In the past, the experts have chalked it up to our persistent and large budget deficits. But now that we are in our fifth year of declining budget deficits and on our way to a balanced budget, that explanation has fallen out of favor. 
Now, the experts are prepared to tell us the reason is a low savings rate compared to other countries--even though many of those other countries with higher savings rates don't have a Social Security system, as we do. 
It seems any explanation of a trade deficit will do, so long as it has no connection to our trade policy. But that, in this Senator's mind, is where the problem is: our trade policy seems too often to be crafted for the benefit of other nations. 
Month after month, I receive letters from Kentucky businesses asking for an end to a trade barrier an international trade agreement was supposed to resolve. This year, for example, I have received letters that: called for an end to Canada's exploitation of a NAFTA loophole to inundate the U.S. with wool suits made of Chinese fabric; demanded the Philippines implement a WTO decision against that country's system of using import licenses to keep American pork out; decried China's de facto ban on pork and tobacco products; called for better enforcement of our flat glass agreement with Japan; and, opposed the EU's proposal to accelerate the phase out of CFC's in an effort to disadvantage U.S. exports. 
Mr. President, violations of existing agreements are particularly costly in the textile and apparel sector, where 4 to 10 billion dollars' worth of goods are illegally shipped to the United States. Countries like China and India routinely illegally label and ship their products through a third country in order to avoid an agreed upon quota. 
Let me share a specific example of the noncompliance I'm talking about. After the enactment of the Uruguay round, the United States brought a case against Japan. Japan maintained a tax system designed to discourage the sale of imported distilled spirits, including Kentucky bourbon. 
In November, 1996, the WTO found that the Japanese system violated the principal of national treatment--that a participating nation must accord imported and domestic products the same treatment. 
How did Japan respond? Japan agreed to make the necessary changes to its tax law--by the year 2001, five years after the WTO decision! So now, the Japanese and American Governments are in negotiations over how long it's going to take Japan to fix a law it should never have adopted in the first place. What's more, there is now talk that the United States may accept `compensation' for Japan's refusal to amend its law. This would mean that U.S. distilled spirits exporters won't get a thing out of an agreement that was supposed to win them market access. 
Mr. President, I want to close by reiterating what brings me and other fast-track opponents to the floor. It's not because we want to raise up new tariff walls. It's not because we are isolationists. It's not because we want to protect jobs from any competition whatsoever. It's simply because our trade policy has not been a good one for the people of my State, nor the vast majority of States. It's because there ought to be a way to negotiate trade agreements that make Congress a partner every step of the way. And it's because there are so many problems in the agreements we have today that demand to be fixed. 
So let's work together to forge a new trade policy that truly opens markets overseas, that benefits all Americans and that includes important issues, like labor laws and environmental regulation. 
Mr. President, let's put fast track on the right track.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I'm honored today to salute one of Kentucky's and this nation's finest business leaders and statesmen, David A. Jones. David will soon be retiring as Chief Executive Officer of Humana Inc., the company he co-founded over 36 years ago. 
David is one of this country's all-time great business leaders. His career has been marked by a deep commitment to high principles and community service and he will leave behind a very distinguished history of service to Kentucky and the nation. Fortunately, Kentucky and the health care industry won't be losing his guidance entirely as David continues as chairman of the board of directors of Humana. 
A native of Louisville, David earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Louisville in 1954, where he won the outstanding senior award. He also became a Certified Public Accountant that same year. After three years of service in the U.S. Navy, he entered Yale University, earning a law degree (JD) in 1960, while also serving on the economics faculty from 1958 to 1960. David also holds honorary doctorates from the Chicago Medical School, the University of Louisville, Transylvania University and the Claremont Graduate School. 
In 1961, David and another young lawyer, Wendell Cherry, discussed ways to build and operate a new kind of nursing home--one that would treat its elderly patients not only with dignity and respect, but with a kind of personal attention rarely seen in nursing homes of that time. The nursing home was called Heritage House and was located in Louisville. The company began to grow and add additional facilities. Eventually, the company, then known as Extendicare, became the largest nursing home company in America with more than 40 facilities. As the company continued to grow, it eventually divested itself of all nursing homes to concentrate on the hospital business. 
To reflect the company's new direction, the corporate name was changed to Humana Inc. in January of 1974. During David's tenure as chief executive, Humana Inc. became one of the nation's leading health care companies. The company pioneered the measurement of hospital quality and productivity to achieve consistent care for every patient. 
In 1982, Humana established its Centers of Excellence program, designating hospitals that offered unsurpassed specialty care by combining research and education with state-of-the-art treatment. While the Humana Heart Institute International at Humana Hospital-Audubon became renowned for its pioneering research into the artificial heart, other Centers of Excellence were developed in the specialties of diabetes, neuroscience, orthopedics, and spinal injury care. 
David continued to lead Humana as dramatic changes occurred in the hospital industry in the 1980s. In 1984, Humana created a family of flexible health care plans. The health insurance side of the company grew and matured, and in 1993, Humana separated its hospital and health insurance divisions. Although no longer in the hospital business, Humana Inc. continues to be one of the leading health care companies in the nation. 
In addition to his outstanding business acumen, David is also a deeply committed humanitarian who created the Humana Foundation, a charitable organization committed to the arts, education and other causes around the world. In part because of that support, the Humana Foundation won the 1996 Business in the Arts Award given by the Business Committee for the Arts and Forbes Magazine. 
David has helped build affordable housing in marginal neighborhoods, put computers in schools, supported an international theater festival in Louisville, helped launch an African-American business venture fund, helped attract the Presbyterian Church USA headquarters to the river front, and for a brief time in the 1970s, brought professional basketball to Louisville. More recently, he helped raise nearly $750,000 in flood aid for Louisville residents and businesses by pledging to match contributions from local companies or business leaders. 
During his tenure as Chief Executive Officer of Humana, David worked hard for his employees, fought for his beliefs, and strived to make our nation an even better place. He has been a tireless promoter of business in Kentucky, and his efforts undoubtedly helped to make the state an important part of the burgeoning national economy. 
Nationally, his opinions and actions help set the direct for health care policy, not just in this country, but all over the world. He has been the architect of many initiatives in this country, but has also been a leader in improving and expanding health care delivery in Romania. In a joint venture with Baylor Medical Center in Texas, Humana is helping rebuild the health care system in Romania, which is struggling to survive as a new democracy. 
A compassionate heart has kept him humble and grounded, his path straight, his words true, and his conviction undiminished. The career of David Jones should be an model to all those who aspire to succeed in business. Indeed, David is a man of integrity, ability, and dedication, and we commend him for the great service he has rendered this Nation. 
Mr. President, I know that all the Members of the Kentucky delegation, and my colleagues in the Senate, wish David good health and great happiness in the years to come.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I wanted to take just a moment to commend David E. Larkin for his extraordinary leadership, motivation and direction in the development of the Dan Beard Council, Boy Scouts of America. 
Larkin has recruited, developed and motivated the Executive Board of the Dan Beard Council, BSA, representing one of the most prestigious philanthropic Youth Service Organizations in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky. 
During his tenure on the council, he succeeded in improving the quality of life among the youth of that area by creating Challenge Camp, where more than 1,000 `at risk' youth were able to experience the cherished values of Scouting. 
His imagination and creativity brought into being `The Scout Family Jamboree,' an event attracting some 45,000 attendees, showcasing not only Scouting, but numerous community activities and events. 
Over the years, Larkin has served the greater community by enriching the relationships between the Scouts, the United Way and Community Chest, increasing both awareness and funding. He also created alliances between the Boy Scouts and the Greater Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky Schools and Educational Institutions, resulting in `Learning for Life' and Career Explorer programs. 
His exceptional leadership and vision provided to be the catalyst for approval of a comprehensive $14.5 million Camp Re-Development Capital Campaign to construct a 25 acre lake, Cub World and Boy Scout Camp. 
Larkin has provided the leadership, high standards, the means and the methods necessary to expand the Scouting program to where it now involves a record 65,000 youths and adults annually throughout Southwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky. He has dedicated his life to the concepts of duty, honor and country central to the mission of the Boy Scouts and I know that the entire community will miss his guiding force. 
Mr. President, let me close by thanking David Larkin for his commitment over the years to instilling the values of this country through the Boy Scout program. I know I speak for all Kentuckians when I say that his work will be felt by generations of Boy Scouts to come. We wish your much luck in all your future endeavors.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Committee on Rules and Administration has the responsibility of ensuring that everything runs smoothly in the Senate. We have to stay current on the latest technology to be responsive to the needs of Senators and committees, and to make sure that we are using taxpayers' dollars wisely. There is a very delicate balance to strike between taking care of Members' individual needs and ensuring that the overall administration of the Senate functions in a coordinated and efficient manner. 
To help the Rules Committee meet our responsibilities under the Standing Rules, the Committee solicited the advice of the consulting firm of Booz-Allen & Hamilton. Booz-Allen came before the Committee and presented their recommendations for how the Committee, and the Senate as a whole, can ensure that information technology and infrastructure support are more effectively and efficiently delivered in the Senate. Their recommendations include applying concepts that have worked in the private sector to bring efficiencies to technology and infrastructure support delivery. Specifically, Booz-Allen recommends that the Senate implement a strategic planning process for the delivery of information technology and infrastructure support. 
This resolution provides for the creation of a strategic planning process in the Senate. I urge adoption of the resolution.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to provide some limited protections for the owners and operators of low-power television, or LPTV. 
Mr. President, when the Federal Communications Commission created low-power television licenses in the early 1980's, it did so with a simple premise: television stations unable to reach a large area, can still offer a valuable service to our communities. Low-power television stations operate at the higher ends of the broadcast spectrum and serve a more limited area, generally a coverage area of approximately 12 to 15 miles. In addition, LPTV licensees operate as a `secondary status'. That is, they cannot interfere with the transmission of full power television stations. 
Since their creation almost 20 years ago, LPTV stations have flourished. As entrepreneurs, LPTV owners and operators have experimented with various kinds of programming. Many have been extremely successful as local, community broadcasters, providing regional news and sports coverage. In fact, LPTV stations have much in common with full power stations. Many offer a full service daily program schedule. Other LPTV stations have predominantly religious, all news, all sports, or all movie formats. Still, many other LPTV stations offer more local and `niche' programming because their service areas are smaller, their audiences more targeted. 
Unfortunately, the transition to the digital television era threatens the viability of many LPTV stations. As their spectrum is reclaimed by the FCC for the purpose of providing the second channel for digital television, some of the LPTV stations may face darkness during the transition to digital television, or afterwards. 
Let me say, Mr. President, that I have been and continue to be, a supporter of the transition to digital television. I believe the move to digital television is a prudent use of modern technology for the use of a scarce public resource, the electromagnetic spectrum. But I also believe that as we make this transition, good public policy must support the investments made by LPTV licensees. I would note, Mr. President, that a majority of Members of the Senate agreed with me on this point as a number of Members joined me on a March 6, 1997 letter to then FCC Chairman Reed Hundt in which we expressed concerns about the plans for the transition to digital television. 
And while the FCC agrees that LPTV licensees have been successful and offer a valuable enterprise, there remains regulatory uncertainty for LPTV licensees in the digital age. That is why I have introduced the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1997. This legislation will elevate some LPTV stations from their current secondary status to a newly created Class A license. In so doing, Class A LPTV licensees would be treated under law and FCC regulations like a full power television station. That is, Class A LPTV licensees would assume the same duties and responsibilities as their full power counterparts. 
To qualify for a Class A license, an LPTV station must broadcast a minimum of 18 hours per day, and broadcast an average of at least 3 hours per week of programming produced within the market area served by the LPTV station. LPTV stations must be operating under these conditions within the last 2 years before enactment of this legislation and within 6 months of filing for the license. Once an LPTV station obtains a Class A license, the FCC would be required to find spectrum for the station in the new digital television era. Like its full power counterparts, a Class A licensee could not be forced off the air by having its license terminated or rescinded. However, in those instances where the FCC cannot accommodate an LPTV licensee in one market, because of the potential for interference with full power digital transmissions, the FCC is authorized to award the LPTV Class A licensee another license in an adjacent community, or if that is not available, in another community acceptable to the licensee. 
Lower-power television licensees are willing and prepared to join their full power counterparts in the transition to digital television--a transition which is technically complex and potentially costly for both full power and low-power broadcasters. But as long as there remains a regulatory uncertainty about the future of LPTV, they will not be able to obtain the investments and capital to make that transition. 
It is an interesting historic footnote, that at the time LPTV was authorized by the FCC, then FCC Chairman Charles Ferris suggested that one day, LPTV could develop into full power television stations. While this legislation does not elevate LPTV to full power status, I do believe that this legislation addresses a critical issue for LPTV supporters--the development of adequate protections in the digital age for broadcasters who provide a significant benefit to the public. I hope my colleagues, who are also supporters of their community broadcasters agree with me and will lend their support to move this legislation forward towards enactment.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee a provision in the DOD authorization bill conference report. These provisions concern depot-level activities and are contained in subtitle D of title III. As the chairman and ranking member know, Louisville is the home to the former Naval Surface Warfare Center Detachment which was closed by the 1995 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. However, in its recommendation, the Commission directed that the workload, equipment and facilities be transferred to the private sector if the private sector could accommodate the workload onsite. The Commission's recommendation has been followed and the former Navy depot was privatized in 1996. The current contract runs through the year 2000 if all the options are exercised. My understanding is that the competition requirements in section 359 of the conference bill would not apply to any workload already privatized at the former depot in Louisville under the current contract or under any recompetition once the current contract expires. Is my understanding correct?

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating the Senate Armed Services Committee for completing their work on the National Defense Authorization Act conference report for fiscal year 1998. Nevertheless, I'm very disappointed that the conference committee was unable to agree on the amendment by Senator Stevens, and 49 of his colleagues, to make the Director of the National Guard Bureau a four-star general and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
When I spoke before the Reserve Forces Policy Board back in September, I began my speech talking about Union general, `fighting Phil Sheridan.' Sheridan didn't strike people as having the stature of a war hero. He was a bit on the short side. Yet at the head of the cavalry, he was an invaluable leader, helping General Grant win many key battles during the Civil War. His battlefield successes led Abraham Lincoln to joke that at the beginning of the war he thought a cavalry man had to be 64". `But now,' he said, `I've seen 54" will do `just fine' in a pinch. 
I tell that story because all too often the National Guard is being dismissed out of hand for being nothing more than `weekend warriors.' But after seeing their work in international hot spots like Kuwait, Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti, it's clear the Guard will do more than `just fine' in a pinch. 
I think we all agree that as we enter the 21st century the common goal of the U.S. military should be to create and maintain a seamless total force that provides our military leaders with the necessary flexibility and strength to address whatever conflicts that might arise. 
The QDR should have been the vehicle to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, it fell far short. And one analyst went so far as to describe it as `another banal defense of the status quo.' 
There are close to one-half million men and women in the National Guard, accounting for about 20 percent of this Nation's Armed Forces. Because of their dual Federal-State mission, National Guardsmen and women are on hand to serve in both the international arena and in our own backyards. Perhaps more than any other soldier, Guardsmen embody our forefathers' vision of the citizen-soldier. That's because the citizen-soldiers of the National Guard find their roots not only in the history of this country, but equally important, in the communities of this country. 
The Army National Guard alone provides more than 55 percent of the ground combat forces, 45 percent of the combat support forces, and 25 percent of the Army's combat support units--all while using only 2 percent of the Department of Defense budget. 
But if you look at the QDR process you would think the Guard has outlived its usefulness * * * that their cost-effectiveness, their flexibility, their readiness are all figments of this Senator's imagination. 
Experts have called QDR a `cold war relic,' and I agree with them, especially when it comes to the Army. Back in July, the Senate was forced to add $437 million to the Pentagon's budget request just to meet the minimum spending needs of the Army National Guard. 
While both the Marine Corps and the Air Force have successfully integrated their reserve fighting units into their total combat force, the Army continues to fail to include its National Guard combat troops in national military strategy. To this day, none of the Guard's eight combat divisions is in the Nation's war plans, despite the fact that they have undergone the same training as their active duty counterparts. 
This contentious relationship got even hotter, last spring when leaders of the National Guard expressed outrage at never being given the opportunity to present their case before the QDR and over the Army's failure to be up-front about how deeply they wanted to cut the Army Guard. 
The outrage was well placed. The Washington times was right on target when they wrote back in June that `the Guard has a greater relevance today than during the cold war--exactly the kind of relevance the Founding Fathers envisioned when they elected to place the preponderance of the Nation's military strength in the State militias.' 
As a classic dual use system the Guard is not a relic of the past, rather the wave of the future. That same article said, `There is no inherent reason the Guard cannot perform adequately across the range of missions. The Marine Corps and Air Force have demonstrated what can be accomplished when reserves are treated as assets, not rivals * * *. In short, the Guard's proficiency is limited only by resources and creativity--by a standing Army that, for reasons of its own, prefers not to acknowledge it.' 
This is not a new battle. And the QDR is just another symptom of a dysfunctional relationship that must change. 
That's why I believe that after assuring the Reserve forces needs are met in this year's budget. Our biggest priority was to make the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a four-star general and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I was proud to cosponsor Senator Stevens amendment to the Defense authorization bill doing just that. 
As Senator Stevens said during debate on the amendment, this change `will help ensure that the National Guard's needs will be met during the formulation of the Department's budget and not solely by the interventions of Congress * * *. It has taken the intervention of Congress each year to get the Guard the money it needs to perform its job.' The amendment would have gone a long way towards changing that status. 
When you compare the National Guard with the U.S. Coast Guard, the inequity becomes even more clear. There are an average of 10,000 men and women deployed outside the continental United States by the National Guard every day. And working with an annual budget of $10 billion, the National Guard manages a tremendous amount of equipment and runs 3,360 facilities in 3,200 communities touching every State in the Nation. 
The Coast Guard, which also has a dual mission, runs an efficient, tight ship. At the head of that ship is a four-star admiral. But what is startling to me is that the Coast Guard is a fraction of the size, with a fraction of the budget of the National Guard. 
Look at the Marine Corps. Like the National Guard, they serve as a free standing force, maintained under a parent service. Again, with a budget and a troop strength smaller than the Guard, they are under the leadership of a four-star general, and have a seat on the Joint Chiefs. Those changes were made after the Marine Corps came before Congress arguing that to be heard they needed a general's rank, not a colonel's, when dealing with the other services. 
The Pentagon must recognize that the Reserve components are the only contact the majority of Americans have with the military. When they see a neighbor, a child's teacher, or their family doctor on hand when natural disasters strike or representing the United States in the international arena, they have a direct link to the military. 
That bond has remained strong for more than 200 years. And despite resistance from the Pentagon, I believe Congress has no intention of seeing that bond damaged through insufficient funds or a lack of resources. 
But passage of Senator Stevens amendment in the Senate was a sign that we're no longer willing to accept the status quo either. We believe it's a critical first step not only toward giving our citizen-soldiers a seat at the decisionmaking table, but toward creating a Total Force. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, the conference committee disagreed with the Senate position of making the National Guard Director a four-star general. Instead the conference `split the baby' by establishing what they thought was a new position for the Army Guard and Army Reserve--two new two-star general positions serving as advisors to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
The problem with this decision is that the National Guard already has such a position within the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This new language won't solve the problem faced by the National Guard. I hope my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee understand that the issue of a four-star position on the Joint Chiefs of Staff is not going to go away. 
I'm also disturbed by the conference committee's decision to cut the National Guard by 5,000 spaces without any corresponding cuts in the Active Duty Army or the Army Reserve. This cut for the National Guard isn't right and it isn't consistent with what we've done on the Defense appropriations bill. That bill, which was just signed by the President, fully funded the Army National Guard. 
General Sheridan might have been on the short side, but when the smoke cleared at the end of the battle, he sat very tall in his saddle. While detractors might refer disparagingly to our National Guard Forces as weekend warriors, I hope my colleagues will remember that at the end of the day, whether helping families return to their homes after a devastating flood or flying in supplies to war torn countries, they stand just as tall.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant [PGDP] in Paducah, KY. On October 20, 1997, Industry Week Magazine recognized the Paducah facility as one of `America's 10 Best Plants' from among 275 plants nominated for the honor in 1997. 
According to Industry Week, a national publication which annually salutes the top performing manufacturing facilities in North America, the dual purposes of the competition are `to recognize plants that are on the leading edge of North American efforts to increase competitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction, and create stimulating and rewarding work environments; and, to encourage other North American managers and work teams to emulate the honorees by adopting world-class practices, technologies, and improvement strategies.' 
There is no question that the Paducah facility, a federally owned nuclear fuel enrichment plant managed by Lockheed Martin Utility Services, meets these criteria. In fact, it is a model for any manufacturing plant in any industry in the country. Over the past 10 years, the Paducah plant has nearly tripled output from 2.3 million units per year to 6.8 million units per year. And this amazing increase in productivity was achieved using existing equipment and machinery. Similarly, the percentage of production units in-line has risen from 57 percent of capacity in August 1993, to an impressive 96.9 percent in April 1997. To top it all off, the Paducah facility boasts 100 percent on-time delivery for the past 5 years with a zero product defect rate. Now that, Mr. President, is what quality American manufacturing is all about. 
On July 25, the Clinton administration gave formal approval to move forward with privatization for the U.S. Enrichment Corporation [USEC], the Government entity that currently owns PGDP. Hopefully, this process will be completed early in 1998. As I have maintained for the better part of 10 years, privatization will not only enable Paducah to utilize cutting edge technologies to keep it competitive in the world uranium market, it will also keep thousands of productive employees on the job well into the next century.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago President Clinton vetoed 38 projects in the military construction appropriations bill. Two of those projects were in Kentucky, one at Fort Knox and one at Fort Campbell. These projects were included despite the fact that neither one fell within the administration's criteria for a veto. 
That criteria included projects not requested in the budget, that would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families, and that would not begin construction in 1998 because the Department of Defense reported that no architectural and engineering design work had been done. 
Both the qualification range at Fort Knox and the tactical equipment shop at Fort Campbell were requested in the Army's 5-year plan, both have well over the necessary amount of design work completed, and both could begin construction in 1998. 
Over 50 percent of the design work is completed at Fort Knox and with funding, construction would begin in 1998. This project replaces 10 1940 vintage multipurpose small arms training ranges which generate high costs for maintenance and use--into one modern multipurpose range. This project was the number two construction priority for Fort Knox. 
The Fort Campbell tactical equipment shop project is in the second phase of an effort to replace World War II era buildings. With 90 percent of the design work completed, construction can also begin as soon as the money is made available. 
Mr. President, the projects at Fort Campbell and Fort Knox were included in the appropriations bill because the Army considered them priorities. And while I am for getting rid of government waste as much as anyone else, these two projects clearly do not meet that criterion.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in voicing my strong support for the nomination of William Kennard to serve as Chairman and member of the Federal Communications Commission. 
With the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Federal Communications Commission faces the daunting challenge of being a regulatory agency that will promote a deregulated telecommunications industry. The FCC requires a leader who will be able to charter the agency and the industry through these unchartered waters. 
Mr. Kennard brings a keen understanding of the telecommunications industry and superb academic credentials to the agency. His years of experience as the FCC's general counsel have provided him with the experience and insight to hit the ground running. I am confident that he has the leadership qualities to effectively lead the multi-member agency and to forge the consensus needed for the FCC to accomplish the goals of the 1996 act. He will being keen intellect, good judgment, and common sense to the office of Chairman and to the agency as a whole. 
I believe that Mr. Kennard is an outstanding nominee. I am convinced, through my personal experiences of meeting him as well as from discussions from around the entire telecommunications industry, that he will serve with distinction. I strongly support his nomination and encourage my colleagues to do the same. I look forward to working with Chairman Kennard in the future and offer him my congratulations on his confirmation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on June 20, the attorneys general of several States emerged from a Washington hotel conference room to announce a proposed national tobacco settlement. The announcement sent Washington spin doctors to work, pronouncing the defeat of public enemy number one--the tobacco industry. Press release after press release painted a picture of fat cat tobacco executives, rich at the expense of public health, finally being called to account. 
But this picture of tobacco is not what I see when I go home to Kentucky. There I see hard-working farmers trying to make an honest living off a crop that has helped hundreds of communities in my State thrive for centuries. 
Maybe you've forgotten about the farmer. That wouldn't surprise me. They weren't in the room during the tobacco negotiations. They were not included in the final settlement, and to date, the only plan that mentions them would put them out of business. 
Mr. President, it is as if the thousands of men and women who have been the bedrock of hundreds of communities simply no longer have any value. 
Sixty thousand farm families produce tobacco in 119 of 120 counties in my State. While tobacco uses only 1 to 2 percent of their acreage, it produces 20 to 25 percent of their farm income. Along with these farm families are tens of thousands of workers who warehouse, process and manufacture tobacco. They all live in communities where every tobacco dollar has a multiplier effect on the local economy, rolling over three to four times. 
And they're the reason I am here today. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join several of my colleagues in introducing legislation which addresses the needs of tobacco farmers, tobacco workers, and their communities and should provide the framework for taking care of them in any comprehensive legislation. 
First and foremost, `taking care of them' means protecting the tobacco program. 
Opponents of the program claim they're not attacking farmers, but with the program goes stability, with the program goes the small family farmer, and with the program goes hundreds of small rural communities. 
Mr. President, the program is the key to preventing fence row to fence row production. 
It is the key to keeping tobacco prices high. 
And it is the key to keeping tobacco production in the hands of small family farms and keeping rural communities alive. 
Without the program, look for cheap cigarettes, look for the size of farms--at the very least--to triple in size. Look for family farms to go out of business, and look for the rural communities they sustain, to shut down. 
What are the benefits of killing the program? For hard-working family farmers there simply are none. 
That is why killing the program is a nonstarter. And even though criticisms are based either on misconceptions or misrepresentations of the program, we're willing to address them by covering all these costs with our legislation. But make no mistake, we're not willing to eliminate the program. 
The legislation we're introducing today follows the principles every one of my colleagues went on record supporting in a September 9 Sense of the Senate amendment. We all agreed that tobacco growers should be fairly compensated as part of any Federal legislation to implement the tobacco settlement. We all agreed tobacco growing communities should be provided sufficient resources to adjust to the economic impact of any settlement legislation. We all agreed compensation to farmers and their communities should come from funds provided within the parameters of the national settlement, as paid by tobacco manufacturers. And we all agreed the tobacco program should be maintained and operated at no net cost to the taxpayer. 
These four simple principles will mean the difference between a productive future for tobacco farmers and a `for sale' sign up at the end of the driveway--the difference between communities where a farmer's children stay to raise their children and a ghost town. 
At the core of the legislation is the establishment of a Tobacco Community Revitalization Trust Fund. The trust fund will provide compensation for farmers, investment funds for communities, and education and retraining funds, all within the parameters of the tobacco program and the national tobacco settlement dollar figure. 
First, the fund will provide tobacco quota holders with `Payments for Lost Tobacco Quota' based on the drop in the amount of tobacco they can grow. The national tobacco settlement could cause consumption to drop substantially, which would translate into deep cuts in each farm's tobacco quota and each farmer's income. Under our bill, quota holders will receive $4 per pound per year for every pound by which the quota drops below their base quota. A maximum lifetime limit on payments will be set for quota holders at $8 times the number of pounds in their base quota. Those who lease quota or grow tobacco as a tenant farmer will receive $2 per pound, with a life time cap of $4 per pound. 
Second, the trust fund will make payments to cover all administrative costs associated with the production of tobacco. This will include salaries at USDA to administer the tobacco program, and any shortfall in the provision of crop insurance for tobacco farmers. This should finally put a stop to false claims that tobacco growers receive subsidies from the Federal Government. 
Third, the trust fund will provide Farmer Opportunity grants for higher education. Tobacco farmers and their dependents will be eligible for higher education grants of up to $1,700 per year--which is the current average size of a Pell grant--to attend a university, community college, vocational school, or other recognized institution. Academic eligibility standards will be modeled after Pell grants, including requirements that students maintain satisfactory progress toward the completion of their degree, and maintain at least a C average. Funding will be provided to cover up to 25,000 individuals from tobacco farm families. 
Mr. President, the tobacco program has long meant the difference between whether a family can afford to send their children to college or whether their education stops after grade 12. We need to do everything we can to preserve a farm family's ability to provide their children with access to higher education opportunities. 
Fourth, the fund will provide benefits to displaced workers from tobacco warehousing, processing, and manufacturing operations. This program is modeled after the NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance Program for Displaced Workers. Under these provisions, workers who lose their jobs can receive tobacco readjustment allowances, employment services, job training, job search allowances, and relocation allowances, all of which are modeled after the NAFTA benefits and services. 
And fifth, the fund will provide economic development assistance to tobacco growing communities hit hard by the national tobacco settlement. 
The economic development fund will begin at $400 million per year minus the amount used for administrative costs of the tobacco program, distributed through block grants to tobacco growing States. 
States can use the funding to provide several types of assistance including rural business enterprise grants, farm ownership loans, activities which create farm and off-farm employment, activities which expand infrastructure facilities, and services which help diversify local economies, long-term business technical assistance, grants to agricultural organizations to help tobacco growers find supplemental agricultural activities, and activities which create or expand locally owned value-added agricultural processing and marketing operations. 
Providing stability, preserving traditions, keeping farms in the hands of families, protecting hundreds of communities, Mr. President, I believe this legislation will give tobacco farmers, tobacco industry workers and tobacco growing communities the resources to deal with the national tobacco settlement likely to impact them. 
With the tobacco program completely funded by tobacco growers or the industry itself, antitobacco advocates can no longer take aim at the farmer under the pretense of fiscal responsibility. And with a sense of stability and predictability, farmers can begin to prepare for the future in a responsible and thoughtful way. 
I plan on sharing this proposal with my colleagues involved in writing comprehensive legislative proposals to implement the national tobacco settlement, but I hope all my colleagues interested in this issue and interested in preserving a farming tradition will take a close look at this program so that we can move forward in helping tobacco farm families and their communities. 
Mr. President, we have not just singled out the farmer. We have included the total community, from education to job opportunity, whatever it might be, so we have taken in the whole community. I am very pleased with the hard work and support that has been given to me by Senator McConnell, Senator Faircloth, Senator Helms, and others to make this introduction so important today.

Mr. FORD. Let me thank my colleagues for their remarks. One of the things that we have to take into consideration is that this bill is a bill that looks not only to the farmer but to his family, his children for education, and economic development in the community. I hope people understand, I hope my colleagues understand, that this bill incorporates payment for everything, even the shortfall in the crop insurance. So there should not be these so-called cheap shots, as my colleague from Kentucky explained, as it relates to the tobacco farmer, under this proposal. If you take a look, I would hope Senators will understand that. We have worked very hard putting this package together and hopefully it will be accepted within the parameters of any agreement.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the intent of a portion of the Commerce Committee's ISTEA amendment that deals with State one-call (`call-before-you-dig') programs. I'm interested in this language as it relates to the treatment of railroads. I understand that the provisions proposed to be added to the ISTEA legislation are the same as the provisions of S. 1115, the `Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1997.' 
The Leader, together with the Minority Leader, introduced this bill as S. 1115 in July, and the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation already held a hearing on this bill in September.

Mr. FORD. Among the minimum standards required for a program to be eligible for federal assistance is the requirement for `appropriate participation by all excavators.' However, the bill does not define these terms. Isn't that going to lead to a variety of inconsistent outcomes?

Mr. FORD. While there is not a definition of `excavation' in the bill, some definitions in other bills on this subject would have covered routine railroad maintenance. I am concerned that railroads might be required to participate in a program that places an undue burden on activities that pose little threats to underground facilities. How would the bill before us affect this matter?

Mr. FORD. Railroads also raised the issue of whether it is appropriate to require them to participate in one-call systems as `underground operators' because railroads own their right-of-ways and know the location of their own facilities within those right-of-ways.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment today to talk about some hard working Kentuckians. Earlier this month marked the close of the 1997 year for car models. With that closing came the news that the Toyota Camry was the best-selling car in the United States and that Ford's F-Series trucks are the number one selling trucks in the nation for the 16th year in a row. Also at the top were the Ford Explorer as the number one sports utility vehicle and the Ranger as the number one compact pickup. 
I'm proud to say that the number one car, truck and sports utility vehicle all have `made in Kentucky' stamped inside. The Camry is built in Georgetown and two of the Ford trucks--the F-250 and the F-350--along with both the Ranger and the Explorer, are all made in Louisville. About 80 percent of the Camrys sold in the nation come from Kentucky, while the Kentucky-made Ford trucks account for about 26 percent of the F-Series sales. 
Behind those impressive sales figures are thousands of hard-working Kentuckians committed to doing the best job possible. 
Their hard work not only put Toyota and Ford at the top of the charts, but their local communities and the state come out winners as well. A strong company with productive workers is a boost to the local economy and a successful plant is a powerful recruitment tool for the state. 
Mr. President, number one sales mean a number one production team. I know I speak for my fellow Kentuckians when I say we're awfully proud of all the hard work that put the Toyota and Ford vehicles at the top. 
Keep up the good work and know that you've made all Kentuckians proud.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I hear a lot of interesting talk. It amuses me some but it also bothers me. In the hearing in the Governmental Affairs Committee today--we heard the majority leader talking about tapes. They don't want to impugn the integrity of the President, but they kind of scorn the tapes suddenly showing up. After everyone made a statement all morning --never got to witness, talked about tapes all morning--they tried to get to Mr. Ruff, I believe his name is, who is the counsel for the White House, who came down to the meeting, came in the audience, and the ranking member tried to get him before the committee to answer their questions. And he was gaveled down and the committee recessed. 
Something about this does not ring true. If you can come out here and just bash somebody and bash them, and they have no opportunity to defend themselves, and then you recess the meeting--something like that is what is happening here on the Senate floor. We see a campaign finance reform bill that comes up and we do what we refer to as filling the tree, and that means no one else can put up an amendment, and they say we have an opportunity to debate the bill? That is like the man trying to answer in the Governmental Affairs Committee about the tapes that were released, and they wouldn't let him talk. 
So, we are trying to get to a campaign finance bill here today and you can't talk. Oh, you can talk, but you can't vote. And they talk about this amendment of the majority leader's, that is so great--why is it that they will not accept a more comprehensive bill in the same light that covers everybody? No, they want their own bill, because it is harder on labor than it is on business. It is harder on labor than it is on associations. So, that is the reason that amendment has been cloistered and we cannot get to it. 
I understand we have a couple of more minutes. This is a little bit like they talk about the laws, that everything is fine. It is like being opposed to the IRS. Oh, we have had all these hearings about IRS, we are going to get rid of IRS, we are going to do all that--but the Republicans are in the majority. They are the ones who are bashing IRS. But they passed a bill, a tax bill, of almost 900 pages--900 pages, and they are trying to say we want to get rid of the IRS. Sure they are going to get rid of the IRS. They are going to overload them. When IRS is overloaded the constituents are overloaded. 
Come on, now, give us a break. If you are against the IRS, don't pass 900 pages of new tax law. And, when a man wants to come to answer the questions that they are asking, let him talk, let him answer the questions. If you have an amendment that is comprehensive, that applies to all PAC's, all organizations, why not talk about it, why not let us vote on it? We are being gagged. We are being gagged by the majority. They don't want us to vote. They have the ability to do that. That is the rules of the Senate. I am in the minority. But we are going to protect the rights of the minority. We will protect the rights of the minority and that is the reason we are a great country, we listen to the minority's voice. We have a right and we exercise that right. We represent a State and we have that right, representing that State. We are U.S. Senators and we have that right. 
So, therefore, that right is going to be exercised if I have anything to do with it and can stand on my feet. 
I yield the floor at 4 o'clock.

<TEXT>
Mr. FORD. Mr. President, once again, I rise to discuss an issue that in the recent past has generated lots of talk and not much action--campaign finance reform. But thanks to the hard work of my colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--we may finally be on the brink of actually doing something to address the many problems we have with our system for financing election campaigns. 
Thanks to the tireless efforts of our colleagues, Senators McCain and Feingold, we now know that the question is not whether a bill will come to the floor, but whether we will pass the bill that they have brought us. Keeping that in mind, I want to speak a bit today on why I will support the measure currently before us. 
As an original cosponsor of McCain-Feingold, I agree that what is necessary is a comprehensive overhaul of the way we conduct our campaign business. If we have learned anything from our experiences in the last few elections, it is that money has become too important in our campaigns. Mr. President, in the last election Federal candidates and their allies spent over $2 billion--$2 billion--in support of their campaigns. The McCain-Feingold bill currently before us, I believe, is the sort of sweeping reform that we must pass if we are to restore public trust and return a measure of sanity to the way we finance elections. 
Now each of us has his or her own perspective on what's wrong with the system. For me, Mr. President, it's the explosive cost of campaigning. When I announced in March that I would not seek reelection, I said: Democracy as we know it will be lost if we continue to allow Government to become one bought by the highest bidder, for the highest bidder. Candidates will simply become bit players and pawns in a campaign managed and manipulated by paid consultants and hired guns. The problem becomes clearer when you look at specifics. In my case, when I first was elected to the Senate, I spent less than $450,000--actually, $437,482--on my campaign. Back them, I thought that was a lot of money. If only I'd known. Mr. President, if I hadn't decided to retire, for next year's election I would have had to raise $4.5 million. Now, I know all about inflation but that's not inflation--that's madness. What's worse, I understand that if we continue on this path, by the year 2025 it will cost $145 million to run for a single Senate seat. Can any of us imagine what our country will look like when the only people who can afford public service are people who have--or can raise--tens of millions of dollars for their campaigns? I can't imagine such a future, Mr. President--and the time is now to make sure things never get that bad. McCain-Feingold won't cure everything that ails the current system, but I support it because it represents a real, meaningful first step toward restoring a sense of balance in our campaigns by ensuring that people and ideas--not money--are what matters. Specifically, I support McCain-Feingold because it deals with a series of disturbing issues that have grown in importance in recent years. 
I also agree that a primary problem with the current system is the flood of soft money. But when I speak of soft money, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that we are talking about more than just the fundraising of the national parties. True--in 1996, the parties raised over a quarter billion dollars in soft money, which they then used in various ways to support their 
candidates at every level of the ballot. That's a lot of money, but it's only a small part of the total so-called soft money picture. That's because soft money, is any money that is not regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act. That includes national party money, of course, but it also includes the millions of dollars raised and spent by corporations, unions, interest groups, and tax-exempt organizations. Our recent experience shows that these organizations are established, operated, and financed by parties and candidates themselves--and their finances are totally unregulated. Therefore, McCain-Feingold is meaningful reform because it recognizes that the problem is not just soft money, it is unregulated money. 
The McCain-Feingold bill currently before us is also valuable because it recognizes that closing the party soft money loophole is not enough. The bill also addresses the problem of so-called issue advoacy advertising. These so-called issue ads have developed as a new--and sometimes devious--way that unregulated money is used to affect elections. Lawyers might call it issue advocacy, but I'm not a lawyer so I call it what it really is, handoff funding. Handoff funding is where a candidate hands off spending, usually on hardhitting negative ads, to a supposedly neutral third party whose finances are completely unregulated and not disclosed. Now I know there are those who call these ads free speech. But this isn't free speech, it's paid speech. Of course we need to respect the Constitution, but we can't let people hide behind the Constitution for their own personal or partisan gain. McCain-Feingold draws this paid speech into the light where not the lawyers but the jury--the American people--can decide which issues and which candidates they will support. 
Mr. President, I want to respond just a moment to the claim of many of my Republican colleagues that McCain-Feingold's issue advocacy reform somehow limits free speech. That simply is not true. When this bill passes, not one ad that ran in the last election--not one, not even the worst attack ad--will be illegal. What McCain-Feingold would do is say to those candidates and groups who have been using handoff funding to puff themselves up or tear down their opponents--all the while claiming that they were simply, quote, advocating issues--is that within 60 days of the election they must take credit for their work, dirty or otherwise. The only people whose speech will be prevented by this law are people who are afraid to step into the light and be seen for who they are. That, Mr. President, is what I call reform--and I think the American people would agree. 
Another critical issue addressed in McCain-Feingold--and this is one area, I think, where we all are in nearly unanimous agreement--is the question of disclosure. Currently there is too much campaign activity--contributions and spending--that is not disclosed to the public on a regular, timely basis. We must commit ourselves, as does McCain-Feingold, to providing the American people with timely and full disclosure to information about political spending, and the means by which they can access that information. Like many colleagues, I 
believe that the Internet and electronic filing is the way to make this happen; but I hope we will make it clear that all campaign finances--including third-party issue advocacy--are to be disclosed before we get too worried about how such disclosure would take place. 
Mr. President, all these reforms will be meaningless unless we are willing to do right by the Federal Election Commission. If the FEC really is the toothless tiger that many people say it is, we must take at least some of the blame for removing its teeth. Any bill that makes changes to the campaign finance laws without restoring the FEC's funding and improving its ability to publicize, investigate, and punish violations cannot truly claim the title of reform. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I know that we will not have an easy road to passage of campaign finance reform legislation. In this body there are a number of colleagues who are opposed to reform and aren't afraid to speak their minds about the quote, danger, of reform. Mr. President, I can't blame them. If I had the advantage of millions of dollars from wealthy folks and millions more from corporations and special interests, I would think reform was dangerous, too, and I would have to think twice before supporting a bill that took away that advantage. Their opposition--whether in the public interest or their self-interest--means that the debate on this issue will get more than a few of us into a real lather. I'll take that challenge, Mr. president. Just because campaign finance reform will be difficult, and might require each party to give up things it cares about or simply has gotten used to, is no reason not to pass McCain-Feingold, and soon. 
All we need to do is to rollup our sleeves and remember the wisdom of that great Kentuckian Henry Clay, who called compromise `mutual sacrifice.' Our way is clear, if not easy, but I have confidence that we will do what is right to restore public confidence in the way we fund our campaigns. I look forward to the continuing debate, and to demonstrate to the American people that we are serious about cleaning up the system by voting for comprehensive campaign finance reform.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in sponsoring the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act. The bill, which I hope will be considered shortly by the Commerce Committee, is intended to close a loophole in law. Last year, we passed legislation requiring U.S. air carriers to file plans with the Secretary and NTSB outlining how they would address the needs of the families of victims of aviation disasters. The bill today will require foreign airlines that serve the United States. In light of the tragic crash in Guam, this bill will make sure that carriers like Korean Air are prepared to deal with the families of victims when a crash occurs on U.S. soil. 
The bill is supported by the administration and I hope that we can pass it quickly.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great friend and a great Kentuckian. This month, Ronnie Abrams will retire from Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. after 40 years of dedicated service. I first met Ronnie and his wife Marie when I was Governor of Kentucky. Since then, I've not only had the pleasure of working with him on many Kentucky projects, but I've also come to count on his advice and counsel over the years. 
Ronnie has made many contributions to his hometown of Louisville through his work with a wide range of groups including Adath Israel B'Rith Sholom, the Jewish Community Federation, Metro United Way, and the Louisville Chamber of Commerce. In each of these organizations, Ronnie has served in leadership positions and devoted countless hours of volunteer service. In recognition of his efforts to make the community a better place for everyone, the B'nai Brith honored him with the 1992 Person of the Year Award. 
Ronnie has also been an active member of his profession through the American Institute of CPA's tax division, the Louisville Chamber of Commerce's State tax committee, the Estate Planning Council of Louisville, and as chairman of the Kentucky Society of CPA's State taxation committee. 
Beyond his community and professional activities, Ronnie has been an invaluable advisor to many political leaders, myself included. He has shared his expertise in tax matters with policy makers at the State, local, and Federal level, providing both is expertise and old-fashioned commonsense. 
During his four decades and Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., Ronnie has provided solutions on tax planning and compliance matters to a large clientele in the manufacturing, retail, financial service, and health care sectors. He began his career with the firm in 1957 after graduating from Vanderbilt University and the University of Louisville. A partner since 1971, he retires as the tax market leader for Kentucky. 
Mr. President, I hope all my colleagues will join me in thanking Ronnie for his hard work over the years, wishing him and his family the best of luck in the future. I know that no matter what he chooses to do, he will continue to excel and to be an asset to the community.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from South Dakota, our Democratic leader, for this initiative. 
I think you have to understand that the momentum is there because people are concerned, Senators are concerned, politicians are concerned with the turnout, with the cynicism, with all the problems we are facing in this political arena. 
In 1974, when I ran for the U.S. Senate the first time, the average cost of a Senate race in this country was $425,000. In 1996, it was $4.4 million. The race in Kentucky would probably be a $5 million race on each side--$10 million or more, to run for the U.S. Senate from a small State like Kentucky. 
There is not a Senator that I know of, not a Senator, that enjoys raising money--enjoys raising money--making calls, calling people they have never heard of before. Some group organized to help with a fundraiser gives you a list to call. These are what we referred to as `cold calls' when I was growing up. A cold call is calling somebody you never heard of and asking for money so that you can run your race. 
I think we ought to take the M and M's out of politics--money and meanness, money and meanness. The more money you have, the meaner you can become. I listened to a Senator who was defeated who had a lot of mean ads run against him. He said by the end of the campaign he did not like himself. It gets pretty rough, so we need to take the money out. 
We hear a lot about free speech. I understand it. I can go outside and start talking. That is free speech. I can go over to Courthouse Square in my hometown and make a speech to nobody. That is free speech. I can do all of those things. But what we are talking about here is paid speech, paid speech. The more money you have, the more speech you have, but it is paid speech. It is television, it is radio, it is newspapers. Why, some places they make more money off of a political campaign--they want one every year, every 6 months, because we will raise the money to be competitive. Let's be competitive as individuals. Let's be competitive on the issues. Let's be competitive by seeing people and convincing them that your position and what you want to do is right, that you represent a party of principles--families first. Get out there and talk to people. 
In Kentucky, we had our first election last year in the Governor's race where you had a limited amount of money you could spend. With all of its warts, the two candidates stayed on the road. They did not fly in airplanes because it cost too much. They were looking for every Kiwanis Club, every Rotary Club, every Jaycees, every Lion's Club they could get to. There were an unprecedented 41 joint appearances. We used to have a joint appearance on television. It was on Kentucky educational television. It was a night Kentucky played for the championship of the NCAA basketball. They even sent the cubs out there to cover it, so no one really watched it. But when we limited the amount of money and limited what they could do, they had to see people, they had to talk about issues, they had to believe in what they were saying. 
Mr. President, now is the time to say to this country, `Let us get back to the people. Let us get back to issues. Let us get back to shaking hands and saying, `I want your vote.' Look them in the eye and they can ask you questions. That is the way we ought to run political campaigns. That is the kind of political campaign I like to run. 
Now we have that opportunity. We can touch it with our fingernails. We can touch it with our fingernails. If only two more Republicans will join, we will have the 50 votes necessary to say we have a comprehensive campaign finance reform bill that will be so important not only to the American people but to us as representatives of the American people. We will not be beholden to people we have never known. 
Mr. President, I hope we will join together now and give the American people what I believe they want--less money in politics, more personal contact. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we are hearing now States rights, and I have tried to be on that side for some 23 years now. But the attorneys general are here asking us to approve their pact, to pass a Federal law and to have so-called protocols or side agreements that we would wind into the package. So it appears to me that it is no longer a States rights agreement. In Minnesota it may be somewhat different. But now they have come to the Congress and said here is our deal; you approve it and don't ask any questions. 
Well, back home we call that a mailbox job. You get a job and go out to the mailbox the first of each month and get your check. Am I correct it has reached a higher level than it would be under normal circumstances since we are asked to make the judgment? We are attempting to make the judgment now, and in making that judgment we say we are trampling on States rights. You can't have it both ways. Am I correct?

<TEXT>
Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator Robb, Senator Hollings, Senator McConnell, Senator Faircloth, Senator Helms, and Senator Thompson. 
As many of my colleagues already know, I have been extremely disappointed that the national tobacco settlement includes no provisions whatsoever to help the tobacco farmer. There is no question that this proposal will affect them. Yet there is nothing in the proposal for them. They were not invited to the negotiations. They were not consulted about the negotiations. They were not even briefed about what was going on during the negotiations. 
The proposed settlement contains money to compensate promoters of the NASCAR races who lose tobacco sponsorship. It contains money to compensate promoters of rodeo events who lose tobacco sponsorship. It contains money for other events, teams, or entries in such events who lose tobacco sponsorship. It contains money, big money, for a tobacco counteradvertising program. It contains money for smoking cessation programs. It contains money for individual lawsuits. It contains money for Medicaid lawsuits filed by the State. 
Mr. President, the proposed tobacco settlement contains compensation for just about everything you can think of, everything except the tobacco farmer. 
The negotiators found a way to compensate promoters of sporting events, but they completely ignored a 200-year tradition that is the cornerstone of many small communities in my State. In other words, the farmers got the shaft. 
I intend to do everything I can to keep any legislation from passing unless there is a fair compensation for tobacco farmers included in the $368.5 billion package. We have to take into account the future of these small families. We have to take into account the future of these small farm communities. 
There are about 60,000 tobacco farms in my State alone, Mr. President. Most of them grow a couple acres of tobacco, but they get about one-fourth of their farm income from tobacco. The national tobacco settlement leaves them out in the cold. It leaves the local economies of entire communities in shambles. We must do something about it. 
I have been working with my farmers and with other tobacco State Senators to develop a package that will provide fair compensation to tobacco farmers and tobacco-growing communities. We intend to have such a package included in any legislation to implement the tobacco settlement. I think other Senators from tobacco States share my view that we will simply not support any future legislation which does not address the tobacco farmers' future. 
So, Mr. President, all my amendment says is that farmers ought to be taken into account. We should not forget them. My amendment is a second-degree amendment which expresses the sense of the Senate that tobacco growers and tobacco-growing communities should be fairly compensated as a part of any Federal legislation for the adverse impact which will follow from enactment of a national tobacco settlement. I think this is a reasonable request, and I believe my colleagues are prepared to accept my amendment by unanimous consent. I am perfectly willing to do that without asking my colleagues to vote. I yield the floor. 
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

As I understand it, your amendment applies to the $368.5 billion settlement?

Mr. FORD. All right. 
Now, that is not the bill. That is not the total bill here. There is also added on to that about $24 billion more for tort liability. That is in addition to that. And then the lookback penalties, which is if the reduction of youth smoking is not sufficient to meet the criteria set, there will be another $42 billion. So we are talking about $435 billion here now, not $368.5 billion. 
So I want to be sure that we all understand where we are going. We are beginning to put so much weight on this agreement that it is going to fall, and then we will lose, I think, all those goals that we have set for ourselves. 
But one of the items yet to be decided is the plaintiff attorney's fees. 
Your amendment does not get to that?

Mr. FORD. So private litigants, their attorneys are yet to be compensated. So you add those on to the $435 billion. Now, if you are talking about $10 to $14 billion in the other place, I wonder if we could just add a low figure $10 billion, so we are now getting to around $495 billion, almost $500 billion. So I want to be sure that we all are on the same wavelength. 
Then we are talking about the new taxes. That is another $50 billion. That is another $50 billion. That is just over a few years. That is not over the term of the contract. So you add that on and you are at about $530 billion. So if there is a possible doubling of lookback penalties, we are talking about another $42 billion. 
So I want to be sure everybody understands that $368.5 billion is just within a range for the States for those Medicaid payments. The Federal Government will get about 60 percent; States will get about 40 percent. 
There are a lot of things here I thought we ought to be sure about. 
The Senator's amendment, I wanted to be sure that it was in the $368 billion, and not in addition to.

It is now, in my judgment, at about $525 to $530 billion. And we have not talked about the private litigants' attorney's fees, which are an add-on. You are not bothering that. 
I think it might be well, Mr. President, if I submit these figures, have them on a per year basis and with some question marks. There are other add-ons that will be question marks. And the attorney's fees are question marks. I think I will just put this in for a matter of the Record just so everybody will understand.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, last week when I filed this amendment regarding the application of the process of safety management to distilleries, I started working with the Labor Department and particularly the OSHA division of the Department of Labor. 
When PSM regulations were developed as part of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, however, I don't believe these regulations were meant to apply to the distilled spirits industry. Clearly, OSHA disagrees with my position, but after discussing the issue with OSHA and Labor Department officials, I have decided to withdraw my amendment. 
I want to clearly thank Secretary of Labor Herman for her leadership--and she exercised it very well--in finding a way to resolve this issue. So, under the compromise we have reached today, the Secretary has agreed to make a review of the PSM's as it relates to distilleries, a key part of OSHA's revision of the PSM contract. During the review, OSHA has agreed not to cite the industry under this standard. 
I also want to commend the distilled spirits industry, whose exemplary record on safety helped make this compromise possible. It is my hope that OSHA and the industry will put this temporary suspension to good use by working together to determine the extent to which PSM should apply to this industry. 
So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be withdrawn.

Mr. FORD. Can the Senator help me a little bit in the position that I find myself? We are sitting here with the Federal judges--almost 100 vacancies around the country. And they have to pass a litmus test before we can ever get them to the floor so we might approve them so that justice might be done and not delayed. Now we find this amendment before us saying that we want to interfere in the courts that are already there. 
My fear is that democracy, as we know it, is being deleted, in my opinion, because of the meddling with the Federal courts and the delay of the appointment of judges and the interference of statutory provisions that would tell the judge what to do and what not to do. That is not what this country was founded on. It was founded on justice by judges, and you have the ability to go to court. Now we are saying you can't. 
Am I right or wrong? Have I lost something here, or have I found something on which my fear might be substantiated?

The issue is emotional. No question about it. But we are going to interfere with the courts, and we will diminish the courts. Isn't it time for thoughtful people to try to protect the judiciary here so that even though the question may be sensitive it may be a tough vote--we have had tough votes before. A lot of times they are not easy votes. But this is one I think we have to look beyond to the long-term harm that might be done to the judiciary. 
Am I all wrong in this?

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I questioned earlier the distinguished Senator from Maryland as to a real problem that I have as it relates to the amendment that has now been submitted by the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Idaho. My friend from Alabama, the junior Senator, has been a prosecutor. He has a great case. All of a sudden the Congress of the United States blows him out of the water because we don't believe what he is pursuing there is in the best interests of politics. 
So, now we are confronted with a question that is in the courts and we are trying to make a judgment here to supersede what might be in the courts. Do we have a right to do that? I am sure we do. But in this Senator's feeling about this institution and this country, we have three separate branches. And those branches must set on their own bottom, as we would say down in west Kentucky. We should let them make their decision. 
I think this is a very dangerous position. The emotion of the amendment is good. We have a big, bad union here that we don't want to spend any more taxpayers' dollars to see that they have a noncorrupt election. We want a noncorrupt election, but we don't want to spend any money. We made an agreement in 1989 under the Bush administration. There is no question about that. Let it be under President x's administration. The question still flies: Do we then, by our actions here, micromanage the courts? We are about a hundred judges short in this country now. The majority will not let those judges come to the floor. Maybe 1 or 2 or 3, hopefully 4 we might get out, with 35 to 50 being held hostage. 
So, what we have done, what we are doing tonight, even though the image here is one thing, the end result is another. If there ever was a question that you must put aside, however you feel, I think it is important that we support the system that has made this country great. And that is not micromanaging the Federal courts. 
One of the things the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has always attempted to do is follow the procedure and the precedent on the separation of powers. He just has helped take a piece of legislation through the courts on line-item veto. And we are getting ready to do it again. So the courts will make a decision on what this body has been able to do. Now we are trying to take the position that we want to do this ourselves, in lieu of what the courts are about to do. 
I know the big bad union, and spending taxpayers' money and all that, is a pretty good issue. But, to me, to this Senator, there is a much deeper question as it relates to the three branches of Government and the strength of this great land of ours in that we are attempting now to usurp those things that we will go out and beat our chests about back to our constituents how great we have been doing to try to protect them as consumers, those in our States or districts, as our constituents. Yet we are tonight, in my judgment, trying to usurp the power of the judiciary. In my opinion, if I sign a contract, it ought to be valid. Then to have a valid contract canceled by the legislative body just doesn't seem to me to be in the right direction. 
I hope my colleagues will look beyond the emotion of the question and be sure that their judgment does not usurp the strength and foundation of this great country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to recognize an organization who has represented the visually impaired for 50 years. Members of the National Federation of the Blind of Kentucky will convene on September 5 and 6 to celebrate their work and commitment to improving the lives of visually impaired citizens in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
The organization's first president, Harold L. Reagan, lived his life not as a blind person, but as an American citizen with a dream. Not only was Reagan blind, but he also lost his arm. In the 1930's this was not easy to overcome. However, this did not stop Reagan. He created an enterprise selling candy, soft drinks and cigarettes over a counter at the Jefferson County Courthouse in Louisville, KY. Reagan was the first visually impaired person to manage this type of business in Kentucky and inspired many others to follow in his footsteps. 
Reagan faced adversity with courage and strength. Along with fellow supporters, Reagan helped shape a small organization that became known as the Kentucky Federation of the Blind. This group challenged society to set aside their biases, and opened doors for the visually impaired. Their efforts led to the establishment of a separate agency for the blind in Kentucky which improved services to the blind through additional resources and the elimination of bureaucratic hurdles. 
In 1947 Kentucky became the 27th State affiliated with the National Federation of the Blind. In 1979 Betty Niceley filled the shoes of her mentor as President of the Kentucky chapter. 
Visually impaired Kentuckians, family, friends and citizens now reap the benefits of current information, education, and a forceful advocate on State and Federal issues. 
Ongoing activities and constant public contact continues to make the National Federation of the Blind of Kentucky a united force. Their efforts have distinguished Kentucky as a leader throughout the country for its research and promotion of technology assisting visually impaired users in obtaining highly sought after computer jobs. 
As times change, so do biases and expectations. This year the U.S. Senate saw a staffer join us on the floor to assist with important legislation. While this is not unusual, it was unusual to see this aid assisted by her guide dog. This same aid and guide dog assisted my office a little over a year ago. 
I would never say the road that Reagan and other visually impaired Kentuckians have traveled was an easy one to travel, but a necessary journey to benefit generations to come. As friends and family gather today and tomorrow, it will not only be a time to reflect on the past, but toward the future. 
I am proud to stand before you and say the world is changing for the better. I know you will join me in congratulating the National Federation of the Blind of Kentucky for 50 years of dedication and service in our quest for a better future.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the honor today of paying tribute to Joe R. Christian who will be retiring on August 19 from the U.S. Capitol Police after 20 years of service to the force. 
As the officer on duty with the Capitol Third Division, Joe has given Members and staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence a sense of safety and well-being that few others could. His warm smile, good sense of humor and welcoming words have endeared him to his colleagues as well. 
Officer Joe Christian has demonstrated that he is a true Kentuckian by his commitment to serving the public good. While he may no longer live in the Commonwealth, Joe has roots back home in Elkton, KY. I know that his friends and family there are proud of his service to the U.S. Capitol Police and his service to the U.S. Navy. Joe joined the Navy at 18 and for over 20 years, he flew all over the world with different squadrons, earning an Honorable Discharge as well as a Good Conduct Medal with a five oak leaf cluster. 
I am proud of Joe, too, and extend my best wishes to him as he begins this new phase of his life.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the President's nomination of a new Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], Ms. Jane Garvey. Ms. Garvey comes to us with over a decade of distinguished public service. 
From 1991 to 1993, Ms. Garvey served as director of aviation for the Massachusetts Port Authority. Before that, Ms. Garvey served as the commissioner and associate commissioner for the Massachusetts Department of Public Works from 1983 to 1991. Ms. Garvey's experience in public office is impressive. That experience will prove invaluable in her ability to manage a complex agency like the FAA. 
Over the last several years, Linda Daschle and David Hinson worked hard to change the direction of the FAA. Ms. Garvey, if confirmed, will need to continue those efforts. Ms. Garvey comes to this position as a proven manager with outstanding leadership skills. She will need those skills to navigate the FAA through some choppy waters over the next 5 years. 
During the confirmation hearing, the chairman expressed concern about Ms. Garvey's involvement with the cost overruns for the central artery/third harbor tunnel project in Boston. I want to take a moment to address the chairman's concerns. Let me suggest that, from what we have been able to piece together, Ms. Garvey took several proactive steps to try and keep that project within budget. First and foremost, a significant reason for the cost overrun is because of inflation. The original cost estimate of $2.6 billion was based on 1982 dollars, which, at the time, was a standard method for calculating project costs at FHWA. The project is now expected to be completed at $10.4 billion. Of that increase, approximately $4.1 billion is a result of inflation. 
The scope of the project has changed over the past 15 years as well. The total cost of the project now includes several new interchanges, additional pavement work, bridge work, in addition to the cost of relocating a toll plaza. Many of these items were not funded by the highway administration, but were still included in the total cost of the project. Ms. Garvey has noted that, as deputy administrator for FHWA, these additional costs would not be borne by the Federal Government--the State of Massachusetts must assume these costs. 
It strikes me that--from what the committee has been able to gather--that Ms. Garvey has been proactive in trying to contain the costs of this project. For example, Ms. Garvey, while deputy at FHWA, imposed caps that limited Federal spending 
on this project. This is the kind of proactive leadership we need to ensure that Federal resources are used wisely. 
I believe Ms. Garvey's experience with the central artery project will help her manage the sizable effort now underway at the FAA to modernize the air traffic control system. These are large, complex efforts, similar in scope to the central artery/third harbor tunnel project. One of those efforts is the replacement of several critical air traffic control computer systems. This effort must run smoothly and within budget, and the nominee's leadership will provide much needed guidance in achieving this critical objective. 
Another FAA effort will be the transition to a global positioning system [GPS]. By moving to GPS, the industry expects to save billions of dollars every year from more efficient navigation. Like replacing the air traffic control systems, the transition to GPS must also be managed smoothly. I expect Ms. Garvey's dedication and leadership will help FAA succeed in this effort. 
Let us also not forget the critical role FAA plays in ensuring that air transportation remains the safest way to travel. Every day, 365 days a year, thousands of aircraft make their way safely thanks in part to the nationals air traffic control system. The FAA manages this system admirably, but there is always room for improvement. I anticipate Ms. Garvey will bring her ingenuity and creativity to the task of improving safety. If approved, I pledge to work with Ms. Garvey to make air travel as safe as it can be. 
I know Secretary Slater holds a similar philosophy on safety--and I also know Ms. Garvey and Mr. Slater have an excellent working relationship. By working together, I expect the team of Slater and Garvey to effectively manage a safe and efficient national air system. 
Ms. Garvey comes to us having won high marks as Deputy Director for the Highway Administration. Those who worked with her at the Agency and those from outside the Agency all credit Ms. Garvey with strong leadership, dedication, and ingenuity. 
I urge my colleagues to support this nomination. Thank you, Mr. President.

<TEXT>
Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is always good to work with my longtime friend, Senator Byrd, on a project that we both believe very strongly in, and it is good to work with a newfound friend. 
I have had an affection for people from Nebraska for a long time, and Jim Exon and I worked together as Governors and then here. I appreciate the Senator's friendship and getting to know each other. And so I thank him for his cooperation and help here this morning. 
Mr. President, there is an old saying that when you run out of luck, you better get a new pair of dice. As far as I am concerned, we have lost every roll of the dice during the climate change negotiations, and we better get ourselves a new pair. Otherwise, American workers will be out of luck. That is why I rise today to support Senate Resolution 98 which Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel now have before the Senate. 
If you take a good look at the global climate change treaty currently being negotiated, you will discover that developing nations are the high rollers while the developed nations keep coming up with snake eyes and the big loser is the global environment. That is because only developed nations would be legally bound by the treaty hammered out by negotiators, the so-called `Berlin Mandate' produced back in 1995. Developing nations are off the hook. 
That decision contained two glaring errors. First, negotiators agreed to complete negotiations for the post-2000 period by the artificial deadline of 1997 before they began implementation of the 1992 convention and before there was an understanding of the complexity of those negotiations. 
Second, negotiators succumbed to the demands of China and other developing countries that any agreement reached in Kyoto in 1997 for post-2000 commitments must exempt Asian economies such as China and India and the rest of the developing world. Right now, developed nations and developing nations have about equal levels of carbon emissions, but within 5 years of the deadline developing nations will have more than 1 1/2 times the 1990 level of the developing world. 
So because of those bad rolls of the dice, the treaty is heavily weighted against America and especially against American workers. That is because the U.S. will have to make the steepest reductions and suffer the costliest and most damaging consequences. Preliminary estimates put the loss as high as 600,000 American jobs each year. And 600,000 jobs is probably a low estimate because the treaty creates an enormous incentive for American businesses to shift more and more jobs overseas to avoid the expensive emission reductions that U.S. businesses will have to meet. 
The impact in Kentucky would be especially bad. Not only miners working in the coal fields of eastern and western Kentucky suffer job losses but many of the businesses and factories that have created a `golden triangle,' as we refer to it, between northern Kentucky, Louisville and Lexington would be forced to close, and every single Kentuckian will experience and face higher electric bills and higher gas prices. The sad thing is we will not even get a cleaner environment. That is the sad thing. We will not stop global warming. We will not even reduce carbon emissions. That is because every ton of reduced emissions in the United States and other developed nations will be made up and then some in the developing world. 
The way I see it we have been stuck in a game with loaded dice. You have a treaty with devastating consequences for the American economy. You end up with virtually no environmental benefit. It looks like nothing more than a massive foreign aid package paid for with American jobs. 
It is clear that many American interests are being neglected by our negotiators and that we must come up with a better solution for the problem of global emissions. But time is limited for the Senate to send a message that the treaty as currently reported is not acceptable. 
The answer is clearly not, as proposed by the State Department, a Kyoto protocol and then a second agreement of some kind after Kyoto in 2005 or even later. That scenario ignores the fact that we have no assurances China and other developing countries will become parties to any agreement with a commitment to simply start discussions for a third agreement. 
I believe Senator Byrd's and Senator Hagel's resolution is the right method. It sets commonsense parameters for our negotiators to work from and assures that any treaty meets the goal of reduced emissions without penalizing one country over another. 
I hope my colleagues will join us in sending this important message, not only to our negotiators, but to the American people that both the global environment and our national interests must be protected. 
I thank my friends and yield the floor. 
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a Senate resolution submitted by the distinguished Senator from Idaho. Senate Resolution 96 sponsored by Senator Larry Craig would designate the week of March 15 through March 21, 1998 as `National Safe Place Week.' 
Project Safe Place is a creative approach to serving youth and families in crisis. I am particularly pleased to cosponsor this resolution on behalf of the first program started in my home State of Kentucky. Project Safe Place began in a firehouse in Louisville, KY in 1983, providing a safe haven from various negative influences such as child abuse, substance abuse, and crime. Safe Places put distressed children and families in touch with the resources they need to keep them safe. This assistance often comes in the form of counseling and a safe and secure place to stay. 
Today, the Safe Place Program has spread to 34 States across the country. More than 6,000 business locations displaying the black and yellow Safe Place sign indicating that those in need can seek help from those inside. 
The Safe Place Program exemplifies the best in our local communities. Project Safe Place is about community businesses and volunteers working together to help the most vulnerable in our society. It is essential that we bring this valuable program to every community, because those in need feel more comfortable in turning to resources in their own neighborhoods and communities. 
By designating March 15 through March 21, 1998 as `National Safe Place Week,' we not only bring public awareness to this outstanding program, but recognize those volunteers and businesses who give so much to make our communities a truly safe place. I urge my colleagues to lend their names to this worthwhile legislation.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about a dedicated Senate employee, Carole Stevenson, who is retiring after 30 years of Federal service. Carole worked for me when I served as chairman of the Rules Committee. She currently works on the staff of our colleague, Tim Johnson. 
Carole held a number of jobs as she went about acquiring her 30 years of service. She worked for Senators Capehart and Kefauver in the fifties, the Architect of the Capitol and the executive branch in the sixties, and the Office of Technology Assessment in the mid-seventies. She even took off a decade to have and raise a family. 
Carole joined the staff of the Senate Rules Committee in 1977 and stayed for 20 years. She held a variety of jobs, moving from front office receptionist, to room reservationist, to secretary and staff assistant in the Technical Services section of the Rules Committee. 
To put it simply, Carole was a hard worker who took pride in her work. She always wanted to do a good job for her employer, and she did. She loves the Senate, so she did her best. 
I want to personally thank Carole for her service to the Senate. Her many friends in this great institution will miss her. All of us wish her well in her retirement.

Mr. FORD. And there will not be for a while. 
Mr. President, there is a lot of tobacco bashing going on and I understand that better than anybody in this Chamber. An agreement that has been negotiated--and my good friend from Illinois, even though we disagree on this, we are friends, understands--that negotiation is continuing and we will be called upon to make the ultimate decision as to whether that negotiated package will fly, will be passed, worked out, whatever. 
Many parts of that negotiated agreement take care of everything that has been said by my two colleagues, except the farmer. The farmer was never at the table. You say you will hear a lot about protecting farmers, the little farm. You are darn right; you will hear a lot about it. They were not at the table, they were not considered, and so therefore, here we come, bashing the farmer again. 
You say it is a lucrative crop. Well, let's look at something here. Kentucky's average farm size is 159 acres. The average farm size of Illinois is 370--that is the difference. Kentucky's average gross income per farm is $42,000 and the net to that farm is $11,000. The Illinois average gross income per farm is $128,000, three times what Kentucky's average farm income is, and their gross profit is more than double, $25,000 net profit. That is an Illinois farm compared to a Kentucky farm. 
We talk about the gross net profit from one crop which is about an acre, 1 acre, you get $1,800. But the farmer has to be considered. The package has not. I am trying to figure out a way that I can be flat so when the steamroller comes, it won't hurt. But it is another attack on the tobacco farmer, even though there is no tobacco subsidy--no tobacco subsidy, and I underscore that. 
Tobacco farmers participate--and my friend from Illinois said it--participate in a price support system that is completely paid for. In fact, tobacco farmers are unique in that they actually contribute millions of dollars each year toward deficit reduction--$31 million last year. There is not another crop or another farmer that is assessed to pay money into the general fund for deficit reduction. 
Last year, the tobacco farmer alone paid over $31 million. I hear your loss is only 34--maybe it is only 3, because the farmer is paying almost all of that in an assessment for every pound he sells, and that is deducted from his check before he gets it, before he goes to the bank to pay his loan. Crop insurance is not a subsidy. It is not a subsidy. It is not unique to tobacco. The Durbin amendment does not hit the tobacco companies. 
We hear all about the health. This amendment will not stop one person from smoking. What it will do is ensure that tobacco farmers will slowly but surely go out of business. That is what they want. Tobacco is a culture and it will take a while. 
Before we became a nation, if you want to read history, it said that Mr. Jones came for his spring planting, his seed for his spring planting, and he paid for it with some of the finest tobacco I have ever seen. Tobacco was money. Referring to the 
Mother State, Virginia, the pages of Virginia history are splattered with tobacco juice. So tobacco has been here for a long, long time. 
Over 60 percent, Mr. President, of every acre farmed in the United States is covered by crop insurance, and the number is higher for individual crops. Corn: 85 percent of every acre is covered by crop insurance. Sugar beets: 89 percent of every acre grown is covered. Wheat: 90 percent of every acre grown is covered by crop insurance. Cotton: 94 percent is covered by crop insurance. 
Farmers will tell you what tobacco farmers know--all of these farmers will. Without crop insurance, there is no farm. That is because without crop insurance, banks will not make loans to growers for their farming operations. Farmers in my State do not just borrow money to grow tobacco, they borrow money to grow other crops. Their average income is $25,000, and their net profit is $11,000. But they would not have that if they could not get the crop insurance to lay down to the banker to support the loan. 
No legitimate lender--and I say that, legitimate lender--will take the risk of lending to an uninsured operation. You cannot even borrow money on a house without an insurance policy, and there will not be a private-sector substitute for crop insurance, either. Talk about private sector. One of the reasons the USDA extends crop insurance to a particular crop is because a private-sector alternative does not exist. You say, `Go out and get insurance.' Well, you can't go out and get it; it doesn't exist. You can get hail insurance on tobacco at 7 percent of the loss. That is all you get from private carriers. I used to do it, I understand it. 
This is what the American Association of Crop Insurers say: 
Privately, underwriting multiple peril insurance has been tried in the past and it has failed miserably. This is true for tobacco, as well. Hail, the only peril wholly privately underwritten, accounts for less than 7 percent of crop losses in tobacco-growing States. The private sector would be incapable of insuring the remaining 93 percent risk of loss on a multiple peril universal base without some form of catastrophic reinsurance from the Government, but while there is no farm without crop insurance, discriminating against tobacco farmers won't do anything to reduce tobacco use. 
Won't do anything to reduce tobacco use. 
Crop insurance doesn't promote increased use of tobacco any more than automobile insurance promotes an increase in car sales. The bottom line of the Durbin amendment is this: American farmers go out of business and whole communities in the South die. The big tobacco companies continue to make and sell cigarettes. While communities die, the manufacturers continue to make and sell cigarettes. If we are going to talk about making changes to the crop insurance system, it should not target the family farmer. 
Before we get through, I will have a second-degree amendment to the amendment of the Senator from Illinois. My second-degree amendment would reform the crop insurance to make sure it supports family farms, not corporate farms. Let me repeat that. My second-degree amendment would reform the crop insurance to make sure it supports family farmers, not corporate farms. I'm prepared to fight this battle. If we are going to be changing crop insurance, I am prepared to offer second-degree after second-degree to make sure the changes are comprehensive and don't single out a commodity or a single type of farmer, because that is what the Durbin amendment does: It singles out one commodity grown in one part of the country by one type of farmer, a small family farmer. 
Now, Mr. President, we just heard my friend from Illinois talk about the loss from tobacco insurance. Well, stand back. Here are all the losses from other crops. Wheat, since 1984, $288.7 million lost to the Federal Government--a 
subsidy to wheat farmers. I don't believe you would vote today to do away with crop insurance for the wheat farmer, because you say it is health. Well, everything Kentucky farmers or North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, or Tennessee farmers grow--even Wisconsin farmers grow tobacco--they get insurance. But they borrow money and insure other crops. Think about almonds. That was the very first one the Senator said--almonds. Almost $50 million in loss to the Federal Government. That is a lot more than tobacco. We could go down the list. Grain sorghum. I don't know where grain sorghum comes from--maybe from Illinois, maybe Wyoming, I don't know. But they lost $36.1 million. So we can get into even sunflowers lost, which is $22 million. 
These are losses to other crops, and my friend would not vote to reduce the loss on wheat or almonds or barley or grain sorghum or these others, but he would on tobacco because he says tobacco is dangerous. 
I am trying to help. I am trying to work out a package. I am trying to help negotiate. I have listened in every meeting. I have been to every meeting and we even had one group yesterday that the only thing they want in the negotiated agreement is some way to eliminate the addiction. That is fine. The biggest argument in the tobacco negotiated package will be what percentage of that package the trial lawyers are going to get. That will be most contentious. It is not in there. That is to be negotiated yet. 
The result of this elimination of the ability to secure crop insurance will be devastating to the farmers in my area. Yet, this is not the biggest loss to agriculture crop insurance. Mr. President, I have a letter from the Department of Agriculture addressed to Senator Thad Cochran, chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations, and I read just a couple of items. There were 89,000 tobacco growers--89,000 tobacco growers--with crop insurance policies in 1996. Tobacco growers in three States--North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia--received $77.8 million in indemnities for losses due to back-to-back hurricanes that hit the east coast last year. These funds helped communities recover from disaster and were paid for in part by the producers themselves. 
The significance of a program that encourages producers to assess their individual risk management needs and allows them to pay part of a cost for coverage must not be lost at a time when fewer dollars--fewer dollars--are available for other types of assistance. Elimination of tobacco crop insurance would place a greater burden on other sources of relief. So when you take it away from one place, you place the burden on other sources in case of a hurricane or tornado or flood. 
But if you have insurance, that lifts the burden from these other areas that hasn't been offset in your figure here yet. The $77 million paid last year in three States hasn't been offset from the $34 million. So it makes a little bit of difference, I think, when you look at it in the true light. This idea of me crying crocodile tears for the small farmer, if that's what it takes, I will give you 30 minutes to draw a crowd to stop this amendment. This amendment is absolutely no different and the speech is no different than it was in 1992 or 1993 or 1994, or whenever it was. 
So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will understand that, yes, we grow tobacco in Kentucky, yes, we grow a little corn, a little soybeans, a little wheat. We do the things that other small farmers do. I want you to remember that the farms in Illinois are almost three times as large as my average farm, and the net income to the farmer in the State of Illinois is more than twice what my farmers' net income would be. Yet, they do grow tobacco. 
So, Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor soon so my colleague from Kentucky can have some time. But I want to make one final point. The distinguished Senator from Illinois said that all these other crops are not covered. I think about 1,600, something like that. First, they haven't petitioned the Federal Government for it. They haven't asked to participate. A lot of them have private insurance. So you have to be in a position of requesting it before the Government will consider it. I don't believe they have petitioned. So it's a little bit unusual. 
We don't get anything in tobacco as it relates to the farm bill--not a dime. Corn gets crop insurance, and we have lost over $288 million. Yet, they get a check every year as a subsidy. They don't even have to grow it. That is what we call back in Kentucky a mailbox job. Just go out to the mailbox and get your check. Everybody lost that. So for every acre that they have and they signed up, they get a check every year for so much per acre, whether they grow it or not. The tobacco farmer doesn't get that. 
So there is a bit of fairness here, I think, that ought to be given. As we work through the problems of the tobacco industry, we need to be sure that we understand that those who grow tobacco are just as human, just as religious, just as American, just as needy, just as hard working as the farmers 
that grow wheat or corn or granola or whatever. They are good Americans. I can take you anywhere in my State, in any town where we have a circle with a courthouse. Usually, on that courthouse is a monument of some kind to those tobacco farmers who gave their lives for this country in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. 
So, let's try to work through this and understand that the people I represent have no control, basically, over what we are doing here. We are after the manufacturers, but we are getting at the farmer. Somehow, some way, we ought not make a farmer in my State who will net $1,800 off of an acre, which is labor intensive, to $4,000, and about half of that is expense. There is not as much work in corn, soybeans, or others. The weather works on all of them. But my people are just as hard working, just as sincere and, I think, need to be helped and looked after just as anybody else. 
This amendment, according to the Secretary of Agriculture, would have a particular detrimental effect on thousands of small farmers in tobacco-producing States, not to mention the toll it would take on the economic stability of many rural communities. Just let me read that one sentence again. This amendment would have a particularly detrimental effect on thousands of small farmers in tobacco-producing States, not to mention the toll it would take on the economic stability of many rural communities. 
An overwhelming majority of crop insurance policies in this area are sold to small farmers. It seems to me, rather than to cut the cord of economic stability on the farmer to get after something else, we ought to be sure that that farmer has an opportunity, and we will get around to others. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, what I have done here, as I said earlier, is to try to make crop insurance more comprehensive. So what this does is, it says that any farm with more than 400 acres that can be farmed not be eligible for crop insurance. The idea here is to let the corporate farmers pay for themselves, and try to protect the small farmer. 
So I think that this amendment will make it fairer. It protects the small farmers. The corporate farmers, then, the big farmers, those over 400 acres of land that can be farmed--by the way, this does nothing out West as far as grazing land. It doesn't touch that part of it at all. It is land that can be farmed. 
I yield the floor.

So the enforcement is there from the States certifying to SAMHSA that they are complying with the law. And $1 billion is there, as I recall, for the enforcement because, if you don't enforce it and you don't certify it, then you lose your block grants. And that is pretty tough enforcement, in my opinion.

Mr. FORD. Under the Synar amendment, the States have passed laws to comply with SAMHSA. And, under that compliance they are required to enforce the law. And they are to so certify. They are to so certify to HHS that they are doing it. And part of that requirement is the so-called sting operations, that you wouldn't notify an operation that you are going to inspect them. 
So, this to me is double jeopardy on the States. You are taking SAMHSA that can take away their block grants and you have FDA, that you are trying to give money to, to enforce something that you already have the enforcement mechanism to do. 
We may disagree on this, but $1 billion is a lot of money. It is not an unfunded mandate.

Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair. And I might get a few more minutes here. 
The motion to table the Harkin amendment is significant because the Senator from Iowa talked about the goals; there were no goals under the SAMHSA amendment or what we refer to as the Synar amendment. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-ford-ky-21-19970723</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. FORD. I thank my neighbor. I have in my hand the 
explanation and rationale for the budget request of FDA as it relates to tobacco. There is not a goal in here. There is not a goal in here. So if SAMHSA does not have a goal, then FDA does not have one. So if the teeth are not in the SAMHSA amendment, there are no teeth in the FDA amendment that the Senator from Iowa said there were. 
So it is a little bit confusing to me for him to say that FDA has a goal and they have teeth, and yet when you look at the explanation of the program, the rationale for the budget request, there is no goal in here, none whatsoever. None whatsoever. We hear a lot about health, but the enforcement is there. The enforcement under SAMHSA is there. The ability to take from the States is there--that is enforcement--to carry out and comply with the law. 
Now, this is double jeopardy. We have SAMHSA on one side telling the States what to do. They passed a law. Now we are trying to give FDA $34 million, taken directly from the farmers' pocket--whether you want to agree with that or not--and say FDA is going to get involved, also. It just does not seem fair. Then the $34 million that we have, that the Senator is asking for, is the budget request of the administration prior to the court case which threw out several of these items and, therefore, $34 million would not be needed anyhow. 
So, I say to my colleagues, tobacco is something that everybody wants to shoot at. But what we forget about is the farmer. He is sitting there. He does not set a price on anything. What will you give me? So they say the manufacturers will pay all of it. They just reduce the price of tobacco, and the farmer pays for it. He pays for the warehouse; he pays for the grading; he pays the deficit reduction charge. All these are paid by the farmer before he gets the check. So now we find ourselves saying FDA has rules to go by. There are no rules. The Senator from Iowa gave me this piece of paper, and there are no criteria in here that say the States have to do anything, if they want to give them money to enforce it. Well, it is already there, and the States have already passed the laws. 
So, Madam President, I will yield the floor and I still have the opportunity to get 2 1/2 minutes, I understand. I thank the Chair.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, nearly 3 months ago, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration voted to begin a preliminary investigation to determine the factual basis, if any, for a contest of the 1996 Senate election in Louisiana. I want to take a few minutes today to review where the committee stands in this matter, how we got there, and why I believe it is past the time to bring an end to this investigation and to dismiss the petition of Louis `Woody' Jenkins contesting the November 1996 Senate election in Louisiana. 
The Rules Committee is currently faced with a decision: whether or not to allow an election contest to proceed, under the Senate's authority and duty under the Constitution, without any evidence of fraud or irregularities affecting the outcome. 
This is not the first such decision the committee has faced in this matter. Senators will recall that the initial bipartisan report of the committee's outside counsel found no evidence to support the claims in the petition, and suggested only the most limited review to determine whether or not Mr. Jenkins' more sensational claims of paid multiple voting had any merit. My colleagues will also recall that the committee, on a party-line vote, rejected that recommendation and moved forward with a substantially broader investigation at dramatically increased costs. Subject to a protocol negotiated by outside counsel for the majority and the minority, committee Democrats agreed to participate in a joint investigation. 
Two teams of attorneys, accompanied by active duty and retired FBI agents, were dispatched to New Orleans, while here in Washington a pair of highly skilled Government Accounting Office [GAO] detailees reviewed tens of thousands of documents subpoenaed from state and local election officials in Louisiana. In addition, Committee staff spent countless hours conferring with counsel, establishing procedures for the investigation, assisting GAO with its review, and managing the day-to-day operations in New Orleans. 
In the course of the joint investigation, over 130 subpoenas were issued; key witnesses were interviewed, in some instances more than once; voters were contacted in an effort to validate their election day sign-in at the polls; numerous election officials were interviewed; and hundreds of documents were produced by both Mr. Jenkins' and Senator Landrieu's campaign organizations. 
What has the committee learned as a result of all this effort, which has cost the taxpayers well in excess of the $250,000 originally budgeted, Mr. President? 
We have learned that there is no evidence--I repeat, no evidence, Mr. President--of any fraud or irregularity on election day in Louisiana that would have affected the outcome of this election. 
We have learned that key witnesses to alleged vote buying and multiple voting were paid and schooled in fabricating their stories--none of which were confirmed by other records--and may have even been threatened once they revealed the truth about the attempt to mislead this committee. Those allegations of witness tampering which occurred after the election have been referred to the proper law enforcement officials for review. 
We have learned that virtually none of the thousands of so-called `phantom votes' identified by Mr. Jenkins exist, nor are they corroborated by the mounds of election documents subpoenaed. 
We have learned that numerous other so-called irregularities in the election are not violations of the Louisiana Election Code, but are simply technical violations or are so insignificant that Louisiana State law would not recognize them as a valid basis for overturning an election. 
Some have suggested that the committee suspend the investigation until such time as the law enforcement authorities conclude their separate investigations into allegations of witness tampering. I believe such sentiment--which I would like to believe is the product of caution and not partisanship--is misguided. 
Investigations of criminal tampering with committee witnesses are not designed to turn up evidence that is relevant to, let alone sufficient for, a finding by the Senate that but 
for fraud or irregularity, the 1996 Louisiana Senate election would have been decided differently. Specifically, evidence that witnesses were paid after the election to lie about illegal activities that did not occur, did not affect the outcome of the election itself, and would not be a basis for overturning the election. 
I would like to respond to the allegation, made by Mr. Jenkins, at least one of my Republican colleagues on the committee, and Mr. Jenkins' attorney that the Democrats on the committee are hostile to this investigation and have decided to kill it for partisan reasons. In response, let me remind my colleagues and everyone else present about the time line in this case: 
After his defeat on November 5, 1996, Mr. Jenkins claimed that his loss was due to massive voting by dead or incompetent voters. He also alleged that certain African-American precincts in New Orleans had turned out at greater than 90 percent--in one case at more than 100 percent--and in support of Senator Landrieu. Both allegations proved false after petitioner sought a court order for death and incompetency records--which yielded nothing--and after an Orleans Parish official revealed that no precinct had turned out at more than 82 percent and that 8 of the top 10 precincts had been majority-white and supported Jenkins in the election. 
On November 14, 1996, Jenkins then brought a State law election challenge, making no mention of dead or incompetent voters or abnormally high turnouts. Instead, he alleged that so-called precinct audits prepared by volunteers from election records--which themselves were produced under court order--yielded thousands of phantom votes and mismatched signatures on election documents, plus evidence of improper assistance by poll workers. Jenkins dismissed his own suit, citing an inability to gather sufficient evidence--despite the judge's offer to extend the statutory deadline for filing an amended complaint. 
On December 5, 1996, Jenkins filed a contest petition with the Senate--which he then amended on December 17--in which he restated his allegations of phantom voting and mismatched signatures, adding a serious of sensational allegations of vote buying, multiple voting, fraudulent voter registration and other election fraud, as well as a laundry list of other complaints including vote hauling, malfunctioning voting machines, failure of poll workers to identify voters, and campaign finance violations. After Senator Landrieu responded on January 17, 1997, Mr. Jenkins filed a response on February 7, 1997, reiterating his earlier allegations and presenting more supporting material to the committee. Eventually, Mr. Jenkins' submissions to this committee totaled over 9,000 pages. Key portions of this material were blacked out by Jenkins to obscure the names of individuals claiming to have participated in or having witnessed fraud on election day. 
In response to these extensive submissions, the Rules Committee retained two outside counsels to wade through the material and make a recommendation to the committee regarding the sufficiency of the petition. On April 8, 1997, counsel presented the committee with a report recommending dismissal of the bulk of Jenkins' allegations, with counsel to conduct a limited investigation into the most sensational allegations of vote buying, multiple voting, and fraudulent voter registration. On April 15, 1997, Mr. Jenkins testified against the bipartisan report, claiming that it would result in the committee overlooking or ignoring serious evidence of fraud and irregularity in the November 1996 election. 
On April 17, the Rules Committee--on a party-line vote--rejected the counsels' report and instead initiated a wide-ranging investigation. Although the committee Democrats disagreed strenuously with the decision to open up the scope of the investigation, we agreed to continue to participate in a bipartisan investigation. 
Beginning the next week, our outside counsel met with the majority's choice of outside counsel, and together they drafted a protocol not only to guide our investigation but to serve as a basis for the detail of FBI agents and GAO personnel to the committee on a nonpartisan basis. The agents were especially important, because Mr. Jenkins refused to turn over his documents to the committee or our outside counsel--including the crucial names of his fraud witnesses--until he was assured that they would be delivered to FBI agents detailed to the committee. 
On May 12, the majority and minority chief counsels traveled to New Orleans to select space in the Federal building to serve as temporary committee office space. Chairman Warner subsequently requested a 60-day lease of the space which expires on July 31. 
On May 13, committee staff were joined in Louisiana by members of both the majority and minority outside counsel teams. The group conducted interviews with the Governor, the leadership of the Louisiana Legislature, the secretary of state, the commissioner of elections, and the State district attorney for East Baton Rouge. It was during these interviews that the then-lead attorney, Richard Cullen, advised that the 45-day investigative period began that day. 
During the week of May 19, with the concurrence of committee Democrats, Chairman Warner issued over 130 subpoenas to Louisiana election officials. The vast majority of the subpoenas were answered in a timely manner. 
On May 30, 1997, again with concurrence of committee Democrats, Chairman Warner issued subpoenas to political committees affiliated with both Senator Landrieu and Mr. Jenkins. Senator Landrieu delivered her documents on June 3, the deadline for delivery in New Orleans, but Mr. Jenkins--despite having months to prepare documents in support of a case brought at his behest--sought and received an extension until Monday, June 9. 
Meanwhile, GAO evaluators detailed to the committee had begun work on June 2, 1997, reviewing petitioner's allegations of the existence of more than 7,400 so-called phantom votes in the November 1996 Louisiana senate election. Included in the materials Mr. Jenkins submitted on June 9 was a substantial revision of the phantom vote totals downward to just over 5,700 votes--less than the margin of difference in the November election. Nevertheless, Mr. Jenkins continued to express the belief that upon further scrutiny, the election records would yield enough phantom votes to more than make up the difference. As has been widely reported, we now know from the GAO evaluators detailed to the committee that this is not true. In fact, GAO detailees have concluded that further investigation of the allegations they have reviewed to date would be unwarranted. 
Back in New Orleans, investigators were interviewing individuals named in the unredacted materials finally provided to the committee by Mr. Jenkins on June 9. Within a week, a disturbing pattern emerged. Not only were the allegations of fraud untrue, the witnesses revealed that they had been paid by agents of the petitioner to tell their stories. 
Subsequently, on June 20, committee investigators discovered that at least one of these witnesses had been threatened, by agents of Mr. Jenkins, and told to reaffirm their original stories of fraud. For his part, Mr. Jenkins denies paying any witness and claims no knowledge of any payments by his agents for testimony. 
Once I learned that the only evidence of election fraud in this matter was clearly false and purchased by agents of Mr. Jenkins, I decided that I could not, in good conscience, continue Democratic participation in the joint investigation. On June 23 I advised Chairman Warner of my concerns. On June 25, the committee Democrats announced our withdrawal from the investigation. 
On that same day, June 25, I asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate whether the witnesses were threatened in violation of Federal law, 18 U.S.C. 1505, which prohibits obstruction of a Senate investigation. 
It is my understanding that Chairman Warner subsequently made a similar referral to the Republican district attorney for East Baton Rouge Parish, Mr. Doug Moreau, who has scheduled interviews with both the witnesses and the agents of Mr. Jenkins who allegedly paid them to lie. According to press reports, Mr. Moreau and his staff are also currently reviewing allegations that poll workers may not have followed the Louisiana Election Code to the letter. Mr. Jenkins has said that he supports these parallel investigations, but believes that the Rules Committee should continue its probe as well. 
I should add that when committee staff and the two teams of outside counsel met with Mr. Moreau on May 13, he advised them that his office had neither the resources nor the expertise to conduct a full-scale investigation of alleged election fraud that may have occurred in the 1996 Senate 
election fraud that may have occurred in the 1996 Senate election. Mr. Moreau was also reluctant to state unequivocally that his office, located in Baton Rouge, had jurisdiction over alleged criminal activity in New Orleans Parish. And yet, that is exactly what Chairman Warner has requested Mr. Moreau to investigate. 
Based upon the review of evidence to date, it is unfair for petitioner or anyone else to claim that Democrats want to kill this probe prematurely. This case has consumed over 7 months, hundreds of thousands of dollars--not to mention hundreds of thousands more in the parties' legal fees, a portion of which they are customarily reimbursed by the Senate--and countless hours of staff time. After all this expenditure, the investigation has produced no evidence--none at all--that would support continued investigation, let alone action by the Senate to overturn the election. 
Finally, in the interest of fairness I believe we should remember our colleague Senator Landrieu, who has faithfully continued serving the people of Louisiana while patiently enduring countless allegations and months of uncertainty in order for the Rules Committee to pursue each and every one of Mr. Jenkins' charges--none of which have produced a shred of credible evidence. 
As has been widely reported, I am currently involved in negotiations with Chairman Warner and other members of his caucus regarding the appropriate way to close this investigation in an orderly fashion. Whatever resolution we reach on this issue should, in my opinion, first, acknowledge that the investigation to date has produced no evidence of any fraud, error, or irregularity in the 1996 Louisiana Senate election, and second, set a fixed, firm date on which the Rules Committee will meet to vote on whether to terminate the investigation and dismiss the petition of Mr. Jenkins. 
I join my entire Caucus in expressing our full and complete support for our colleague, Senator Mary Landrieu, and call on Chairman Warner and members of the majority to end this investigation and remove the unjustified cloud of doubt overshadowing Senator Landrieu and the elected officials and good people of Louisiana.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank my good friend from Alaska. As he says, this will not be an easy decision, but he is not one that backs off when he thinks it is right. So, Mr. President, as cochairman of the Senate National Guard Caucus, I rise to ask my colleagues to support the amendment of the senior Senator from Alaska, elevating the National Guard Bureau to a four-star general and including that position as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Just a few weeks ago, I pointed out to my colleagues the Army's refusal to consult with the leadership of the National Guard Bureau or the leadership of the Army Guard during the consideration of the QDR. When asked about this oversight by the press, the Army spokesman responded, `There is an Army Reserve colonel and a Guard colonel here in our offices. They get to weigh in on the issues.' 
You do not need extensive knowledge of military affairs to realize that a colonel does not pull much weight against a group of active duty Army generals protecting their turf. Mr. President, there is no excuse for the poor working relationship between the active Army and the Army National Guard. However, I believe the leadership of the active Army does not consider members of the Army National Guard as soldiers on equal footing. Instead, they treat the men and women of the Army National Guard with indifference. The active duty generals seem to forget that the men and women of the Army Guard have undergone the same--I repeat, the same--training as their counterparts. The situation is even more ridiculous when you consider that 50 percent of the entire Army National Guard are men and women coming off active duty with the Army. 
I also believe that, if this amendment becomes law, there would not be a constant need for offsite agreements between the Army and the National Guard. Just recently, I was briefed by the Army on the latest offsite meeting between the Army and the Guard--an off-site meeting that was held after it was brought to Secretary Cohen's attention by Senator Bond and I that the Guard had been left out of the QDR process. In that briefing, I was told the Army and the Guard had reached an agreement. But I pointed out to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, who briefed me, `I have little faith in the outcome of such an agreement when the Army still hasn't lived up to the 1993 off-site agreement.' Of course, that point may be moot, as I now have been informed that the Chief of Staff of the Army is unhappy with the agreement and, to date, has refused to sign off. 
So, Mr. President, this kind of runaround is exactly why we need Senator Stevens' amendment. The Army National Guard currently--I want my colleagues to listen to this--provides more than 55 percent of the ground combat forces, 45 percent of the combat support forces, 25 percent of the Army's combat supply units, while receiving--guess what?--only 2 percent of the Department of Defense budget. Now, let me repeat that. The Army National Guard currently provides more than 55 percent of the ground combat forces, 45 percent of the combat support forces, and 25 percent of the Army's combat supply units, while receiving only 2 percent of the Department of Defense budget. 
You will hear from some of our colleagues that the Army National Guard divisions have no fighting missions. They will be telling the truth, but they won't be telling all the truth. That is because the active duty Army leadership has simply refused to give the Guard a war fighting mission. They have refused to do so despite the fact that the active Army's attrition rate--get this--is 36 percent. About half of those are joining the National Guard. They have been trained. The attrition rate in the Army Guard is somewhere around 15 percent. The question my colleagues should be asking is, How many active duty Army divisions are at full strength versus the Army Guard divisions? 
So, Mr. President, this amendment will ensure that the National Guard and all its attendant forces will have a voice in the Department of Defense's senior decisionmaking process when it comes to defense strategy, force readiness, and allocation of resources. In the end, I hope that when my colleagues hear arguments like, `there are two colonels here in our offices that weigh in on issues,' they will remember that their simply being in the room isn't enough. You have to have a seat at the table and a voice that carries some weight. That is exactly what this amendment we have before us today does. 
So I hope my colleagues will support the amendment and help us pull up a chair for the National Guard Bureau and give them a voice that can be heard loud and clear at the Defense Department's decisionmaking table. 
I want to underscore one other thing. Already 47 Senators have cosponsored this amendment, and many more will come on board. I hope that we understand that the overwhelming sentiment of this body is to support Senator Stevens' amendment. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

the bill and the entire committee agreed that we needed a Commission to provide a blueprint for how to fund the FAA. The FAA bill last year restructured the agency and gave the FAA the ability to do some creative things. Now the Commission must give us their best advice on how to meet the needs of the FAA, or how to cut spending. Those are the dilemmas facing the Commission. I know all of us share a desire to ensure that the work of the Commission is debated and fully aired.

Mr. FORD. My other colleague will need some time, too. I thank the chairman. 
You know, Mr. President, this has been an interesting week. We had a negotiation with the attorneys general around the country, and the tobacco industry is stuck for almost $370 billion. The price of cigarettes go up. How much more do you want? And then the Finance Committee puts on 20 cents more, and that raises the price of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. And now we want to put on 11 cents more. Why? To help the small businessman get a deductible on his health insurance? 
At the same time, you are putting 65,000 farm families out of work in my State. You say you are going to help. You may never get the bill to help. I think it is time to stop it. It is time we quit. My farmers have to survive. And we hear all the States have an excise tax. Well, we had a good many here in the past that would vote against any excise tax because they thought it all should go to the States. It is their prerogative. But when you add 20 cents onto the State, and you add another 11 cents onto the State, then you add 75 cents on, if you get the negotiated agreement out there, the income to the community and to the Federal Government are going to go straight down. They are playing with funny money, because the more you increase it, the less income you are going to have. When you increase the tax, the less income you are going to have. So now you say you have all this income coming in--you are playing with funny money. 
One other point, Mr. President. You talk about low income--59.5 percent of this tax will come out of those who make less than $30,000 a year--$30,000 a year--and 34 percent of the money the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Missouri want will come from those that make less than $15,000. Talk about the little man--you are talking away from the man that makes $15,000 and a man with a family that makes less than $30,000. You are going to take 60, 65 percent of that money from that group. What do they benefit? You put them out of business.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let's be fair. We had a negotiated agreement. It wasn't good enough. That may be the floor. So here we come with 20 cents more, and then 11 cents more. I have 65,000 farm families that this legislation will put out of business. Oh, we are going to take care of them. Well, you take care of them, then I will talk about taxes. You take care of my farmers and I will talk about taxes after that. I will talk about how much you get from the tobacco industry. I will talk about how much you are going to do for this group or that group. So take care of my farmers, take care of my people. I have stood by and watched these people be run over long enough. Oh, you can come out here with crocodile tears. I can tell you all the sad stories. But small businessmen are small businessmen, and a small farmer is still a small farmer. And 69 percent of my farmers have another job. It becomes a husband, wife, and family occupation. You want to put them out of work. 
I understand smoking. I have been smoking for 54 years and I am still here, thank God. I understand smoking. My grandchildren don't smoke, and I understand all of that. But then, a while ago, we didn't put a little deductible, or eliminate the deductible on the distilled spirits industry--beer, wine, and distilled spirits. Here we have tobacco and you pile on and pile on and pile on. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will do the best they can to help in this case. It is an additional tax. It is putting my people out of work. It is saying to children on the farm--children on the farm--that you are going to have less income next year. You are going to have less next year. Substitute another crop. That indicates that you don't know what tobacco brings, you don't know what corn brings, or what soybeans brings--$1,844 net profit for an acre of tobacco, and $100 from soybeans. You have to plant acres and acres and acres of soybeans and one acre of tobacco.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to inform my colleagues that as ranking member on the Committee on Rules and Administration, committee Democrats can no longer participate in a joint investigation of allegations of election fraud in the 1996 Louisiana Senate race as alleged by Louis `Woody' Jenkins. 
We reached this decision, because what we have learned to date suggests a possible fraud on the U.S. Senate and illegal tampering with witnesses by agents of Mr. Jenkins. This is nothing short of an embarrassment to the Senate and an affront to the people of Louisiana. 
This investigation is over budget, it has exceeded the timeframe agreed to, and none of Mr. Jenkins' claims have been substantiated by any credible witnesses. 
We come to this decision after waiting 7 months for Mr. Jenkins to provide the committee with credible evidence of multiple voting and of thousands phantom votes, which he has failed to do. 
Not only have agents to the committee been unable to locate credible witnesses, but Government Accounting Office auditors have also been unable to substantiate Mr. Jenkins' claims of phantom votes. 
Most disturbing, committee members have learned today that there has been continued interference with witnesses to the investigation in Louisiana by agents of Mr. Jenkins. I can't imagine any Member of the Senate, regardless of the party, who would not find this alarming, unacceptable, and certainly nothing the Senate should be party to. 
On behalf of Democratic Rules Committee members, I have referred information to the U.S. Department of Justice and asked for an investigation into the incidents of witness tampering and interference with the U.S. Senate investigation. 
The results to date have shown that the fraud on which Mr. Jenkins' allegations rest, were not only solicited by a convicted criminal, but involved payment for testimony and are otherwise not credible. There is no way that we, in good conscience, can or should proceed with this investigation. 
Mr. President, the fraud has been committed against the U.S. Senate, not against Mr. Jenkins, and the investigation should be terminated now and stop any waste of taxpayers dollars.

Mr. FORD. Two minutes. 
Mr. President, no one here in the Chamber is opposed to helping children. We have tried our best over the years, and we are trying our best now. It seems like every time you want some money you go to tobacco. We have had Senators from the other side of the aisle that voted against tax on tobacco or any other excise tax because they thought that was the prerogative of the State, and the Senator from Illinois just laid out how much additional tax is going on. So we have a negotiated agreement that people are getting something they never thought they would be able to get. We have to get that through Congress. 
Now, if we had 10 cents from this committee, and 20 cents there, and 43 cents tomorrow, we have killed the agreement and there is no way the income can equal the projection because with a dollar additional on a pack of cigarettes we lose 20 percent of production and have a 20 percent reduction. 
We are trying to get in this package reduction of teen smoking or underage smoking. We have a criteria there if they do not do it, they pay more money. Yet we are putting it where they cannot do that. 
I say to my friends, I am from a tobacco State, absolutely, and I plead guilty to that. I am going to represent them the best I can, but pile on, pile on, pile on--you are not going to have any money left. The States won't be able to get any money and their budgets will be behind, our projections will not reach that total, we will be behind, so everybody piles on tobacco. 
I hope you will take a step back with all these crocodile tears I see around here. I understand those. But there is some point where we have to meet reality, and reality is do you want to complete a job that is started or do you want to do something that will unbalance this budget within a very short period of time. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator for allowing me the time.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues and other interested persons, a letter from the campaign finance Project. As my colleagues are aware, this project is being led by two of our former colleagues, Nancy Kassebaum Baker and former Vice President Walter Mondale. They were asked by President Clinton earlier this year to lead a bipartisan effort to develop a solution for reforming our campaign finance laws. 
Last week, they issued an open letter to the President and to the Congress about their observations and what they believe should constitute real and meaningful reform. They have identified several key areas that they believe are essential to these reform efforts: a complete ban on `soft money;' refine and sharpen the definitions of `issue advocacy' and `independent expenditures;' improve disclosure of campaign finances; and strengthen enforcement and leadership at the Federal Election Commission.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, when we start debating tax legislation on the floor, I hope our debate will be governed by a few basic principles. Let me state those questions which are most important to me personally. Each of these questions needs a satisfactory answer. 
Are the tax benefits spread evenly across all income levels? 
Is the tax legislation consistent with the budget agreement? 
Does the tax package undermine a balanced budget after 10 years? 
We need answers which meet basic standards of fairness and sound public policy. These are the standards I think we should use to judge any tax bill that comes to this floor. 
Today, I would like to talk a little more about the first concern I have mentioned how evenly the benefits of the proposed tax bills will fall across income levels. 
A distribution table put out by the Senate Finance Committee claims that 74 percent of the tax benefits in the proposal pending before that Committee go to those making under $75,000; 74 percent. That sounds pretty good. 
On the other hand, our analysis shows that 43 percent of the benefits go to the wealthiest 10 percent, and two-thirds of the benefits go to the top 20 percent. 
How can the two analysis be so different? Well, let's look at some of the differences. 
First, the Republican claims about who gets the tax cuts are based only on 5-year projections--before many of the backloaded tax breaks are fully implemented. Our analysis looks at the tax cuts when fully implemented. Let me repeat that. They cut their analysis off after 5 years, before many of the tax breaks are fully implemented. You can play a lot of games by cutting off the analysis after 5 years. What happens after 10 years? Under the Republican income distribution, they will never tell you. But why not? 
Our income distribution looks at these new tax breaks when they are fully implemented. What a difference it makes. Apparently the most backloaded tax breaks provide very little benefit for low and middle income workers. 
Second, because the Republican claims are only based on 5 years, they treat capital gains cut as hardly any tax cuts at all. In fact, the Republican analysis of the House tax package claims that the capital gains tax cut is actually a tax increase for upper income taxpayers during the first 5 years. Imagine that--a capital gains cut that counts as a tax increase. 
Third, the Republican claims about who gets the tax cuts ignore the impact that estate tax cuts will have in individual taxpayers. It simply ignores them. They don't count estate tax benefits at all. 
The Republican claims about who gets the tax cuts ignore the fact that many of the proposed tax cuts are backloaded--meaning that the full impact is not felt until well after the first 5 years, and in some cases not until well after 10 years. This means they have essentially ignored not only the impact of capital gains cuts, but also the backloaded IRA's, and the phase-in of estates taxes.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let's not cook the books. Let's have a straightforward debate about who is getting the tax breaks that have been proposed, and whether we can do better. We hear a lot about income tax, but what about payroll tax? 
Let's not ignore payroll taxes when we talk about who is carrying the tax burden today. Workers in this country pay a 7.65-percent payroll tax to finance the Social Security Program. They pay an additional 1.45 percent payroll tax to finance the Medicare Program. Social Security taxes are collected on the first dollar earned--up to $62,700. Medicare taxes are collected on all earned income. 
The majority of workers in this country pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. So it is insulting for many of these workers to hear some around here talk about low income workers as if they pay no taxes. You will actually hear some Members come to this floor and argue that lower income workers do not get much of a tax break because they do not pay many taxes. They will say lower income workers do not get a full $500 per child tax credit because they do not pay enough in taxes. 
This is just not true. A tax is a tax for most folks--whether they are income taxes or payroll taxes or estate taxes or something else. But by counting only income taxes and ignoring payroll taxes, it means that upper income taxpayers get more of the tax breaks, while lower and middle income workers get less. 
So we have to do better. 
Now, we will also hear that the top 10 or 20 percent get most of the tax benefit because they generate most of the income. Well, let's put that in perspective as well. According to the Congressional Budget Office, in 1994 the wealthiest 20 percent of families made about 48.1 percent of family income in this country. Yet under the Senate Finance Committee bill, they get 67 percent of the tax breaks. 
Or let me put it another way--from a middle class perspective. Again according to CBO, in 1994 the bottom 60 percent of families made 27.3 percent of the income. Yet under the Senate Finance Committee bill, they get only 12 percent of the tax benefit. So I think we are a little out of balance. When the bill reaches the floor, I hope we can do better. I hope we can make it a little more fair. It is the least we can do. 
Last, Mr. President, when we talk about the fairness of this package, we need to talk about how the revenue raisers in the Senate Finance Committee tax package affect different income groups. 
Last night, the Finance Committee voted to increase excise taxes on cigarettes by 20 cents per pack. I understand that it's politically correct to attack the tobacco industry. And we're going to see plenty of piling on over the next few months regarding tobacco. 
But let's talk for a minute about how this cigarette tax affects various income groups. It's well documented that cigarette excise taxes are the most regressive of all taxes--meaning they hit poor folks a lot harder than they hit upper income folks. According to a 1997 KPMG Peat Marwick study, U.S. families earning about $30,000 or less earned about 16 percent of all income generated, but paid 47 percent of all tobacco taxes. Let me say it again. Families earning less than $30,000 pay 47 percent of all cigarette excise taxes. 
The changes in the tax bill made last night will make the disparity among poor families even greater. 
On average, low income persons pay 15 times more in tobacco taxes than upper income individuals. 
And what was this tax increase on low income people going to be used for? To accelerate the increase in estate tax relief, which goes primarily to upper income individuals. This is a reverse-Robin Hood amendment. We are taxing the poor to help the wealthy. 
The amendment will also reportedly be used to provide $8 billion in additional spending for health insurance. Just a couple of weeks ago we heard how this would violate the budget agreement. We voted 55 to 45 against an amendment that would raise taxes in order to raise spending on health insurance. Phone calls were made to the President of the United States to tell him how this would violate the budget agreement and how he better announce he was opposed to the amendment. Yet last night, some of the very same Senators who made those arguments on the floor a few weeks ago apparently voted in favor of a very similar amendment. How could it violate the budget agreement a few weeks ago and not now? 
Last, Mr. President, the timing of this tax increase is most interesting. Later today we may hear an announcement of a `global settlement' of tobacco litigation. The agreement will require congressional action. As I understand it, this agreement completely fails to address the interests of tobacco farmers and factory workers, nearly all of whom are low to moderate income workers. But we will have that debate on another day. 
What is interesting today, however, is the impact of that agreement on all these proposed cigarette tax increases. The tobacco settlement, if implemented, will have an immediate impact on prices, raising the price of a pack of cigarettes by somewhere in the neighborhood of a dollar. This, of course, will depress consumption--which in turn will reduce revenues by about 20 to 25 percent, or maybe even higher. So any proposals in the reconciliation bill to raise revenues by raising cigarette taxes will prove to be overly optimistic as soon as any global settlement is implemented. This means less revenue will actually be raised, and our deficit problems will be worse--particularly in the out years. So there is a great ripple effect as work here if these tax increase proposals succeed. 
But last, Mr. President, let me return to my initial point. The tax package considered by the Finance Committee benefits upper income individuals too heavily. The cigarette tax adopted last night makes matters even worse, because it is primarily a tax on low income individuals. So not only do low income folks get virtually none of the tax breaks--but they will now get a tax increase. 
I hope my colleagues who claim great concern for low income people will keep this in mind as they prepare to vote on the tax reconciliation bill. As for this Senator, I think a bad bill was made worse by the Finance Committee last night, and it is simply not a package I can support in its current form. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on Sunday, May 18, a soldier was laid to rest in a small Kentucky community along the banks of the Ohio River. But this wasn't to be any small affair. Billy Stephens had served his country and community with distinction and he would be honored for those contributions by a 17-man team from Ft. Knox. 
Once the rifles were fired, the bugle sounded taps, and the flag from the casket was presented to his widow, those present couldn't help but feel the enormity of his life. A son of Hawesville in Hancock County, if you met Billy Stephens on the street, you might not suspect him of greatness. 
But it is because of him and others like him, that you and I enjoy freedom today. 
In 1940, he joined the Army and served for the duration of the war. Before the war ended, he would participate in seven campaigns and earn seven battle stars. In addition to the EAME theater with seven Bronze Stars, his military decorations included the American Defense Service Medal and the Good Conduct Ribbon. 
When he left the Army his commitment to service continued, not only as the Hancock County Sheriff, but also in his dedication to seeing the community grow, while preserving its solid rural values. It was that unyielding devotion that earned him the Citizen of the Year award in 1992 by the Hancock County Chamber of Commerce. 
Perhaps his commitment to country should come as no surprise. His father served in the Army during World War One, and both of his brothers served in World War II, where one narrowly escaped death at Pearl Harbor. Both of his sons served in Viet Nam, as did his daughter's husband. His grandson continues the tradition as an Air Force Academy graduate. 
Mr. President, Billy Stephen's contributions will be felt for generations, both as soldier and community leader. He was a good father, husband, friend, and fighter for America, and his presence will be sorely missed.

I am trying to fill in as best I can, and hopefully we can be accommodating. And I am sure the majority leader will be accommodating to us. We both have to work together. I think Monday we can work out something that would be amenable to both sides. Hopefully, tomorrow we might look at the DOD authorization bill with amazement.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Byrd's sense of the Senate Resolution on the issue of climate change. A few weeks ago I was back in Kentucky and my youngest grandson, Morgan, wanted some help on his math homework. At first we were both stumped over the list of word problems his teacher had assigned. Then, after all those years, a lesson one of my teachers taught me came back. She taught us to cut out all the extraneous words in those problems. Once we'd stripped it down, she promised we'd have a clear-cut math problem we could recognize how to solve. It wasn't long before Morgan and I had zipped right through those problems. 
I think my colleagues will find the same method will work with the Global Climate Change Treaty that's currently being negotiated. It sounds complicated and impressive when you first look it over, but once you strip away all the extraneous language, it comes down to this simple equation. Rules benefitting the economies of developing nations plus rules penalizing the economies of developed nations add up to a big fat zero in net gains for the global environment. 
That's because only developed nations would be legally bound by the treaty hammered out by negotiators--the so-called Berlin Mandate. Developing nations are off the hook. 
Right now, developed nations and developing nations have about equal levels of carbon emissions. But within five years of the deadline, developing nations will have more than 1 1/2 times the 1990 level of the developed world. 
So when you subtract all the half-baked environmental promises, you find the equation is heavily weighted against America and especially against American workers. That's because the United States will have to make the steepest reductions and suffer the costliest and most damaging consequences. Preliminary estimates put the loss at 600,000 jobs each year. 
And 600,000 jobs is probably a low estimate, because the treaty creates an enormous incentive for American businesses to shift more and more jobs overseas, to avoid the expensive emission reductions that U.S. businesses will have to meet. 
The impact in Kentucky could be especially bad. Not only would miners working in the coalfields of Eastern and Western Kentucky suffer job loss, but many of the businesses and factories that have created a golden triangle in Northern Kentucky would be forced to close. And every single Kentuckian will face higher electric bills and higher gas prices. 
But what should really make you scratch your head over this puzzler is that when you add it all up, we won't get a cleaner environment. We won't stop global warming. We won't even get reduced carbon emissions. 
That's because every ton of reduced emissions in the United States and other developed nations will be made up--and then some--in the developing world. 
So, here's a quick math review. You've got a treaty with devastating consequences for the American economy. You end up with virtually no environmental benefit. Stripped down it looks like nothing more than a massive foreign aid package paid for with American jobs. 
It's clear that many American interests are being neglected by our negotiators and that we must come up with a better solution for the problem of global emissions. 
Time is limited for the Senate to act to make it clear that the treaty, as currently reported, will get a failing grade. A December signing ceremony is already set for December in Kyoto, Japan. 
Mr. President, I believe my colleague, Senator Byrd's resolution is the right method. It sets commonsense parameters for our negotiators to work from to assure that any treaty meets the goal of reduced emissions without penalizing one country over another. 
And next time my grandson grumbles about why he has to learn things he'll probably never use again, I'll just remind him that when you get right down to it, even the most complicated global policy problems can be solved with some simple math.

Mr. FORD. Madam President, we are all familiar with the parameters of the upcoming tax debate. The budget deal provides for $85 billion in net tax cuts over 5 years, and $250 billion in net tax cuts over 10 years. 
Within those dollar limits, there's a strong desire to provide tax cuts in four areas: first, capital gains relief, second, estate tax relief, third, a $500-per-child tax credit, and fourth, education tax initiatives. But if you add up all the current proposals in each of these areas, you go way over the $250 billion mark set by the budget deal. Cheaper alternatives must be found. 
I have had an interest for several years in providing capital gains relief for family farmers and small family businesses where the parents wish to pass along to their children the operation of the farm or the business. 
Earlier this year, Senator Gregg and I each introduced capital gains tax reduction legislation which was based on a similar objective: The longer you have held an asset, the lower your capital gains rate will be. We call this the sliding scale capital gains tax reduction. Since then, we have gotten together, and produced a product which we believe combines the vest features of both of our bills. And we're introducing that legislation today. 
The Ford-Gregg approach is a bipartisan compromise that will allow the tax cut package to move forward consistent with the budget deal. 
The Ford-Gregg bill achieves the following objectives shared by all capital gains cut advocates: 
First, it cuts the capital gains rate in half for individuals; second, it does not discriminate among types of assets; and third, it keeps things relatively simple. 
In addition, the Ford-Gregg bill meets the following additional objectives: 
First, it costs less than half as much as the major capital gains proposals; second, it rewards long-term investment over short-term speculation; and third, it's bipartisan. 
Remember, the budget agreement calls for $250 billion in net tax cuts over 10 years. According to the Joint Tax Committee, the major capital gains proposal pending in the Senate (S. 2) would cost $129 billion over 10 years--eating up more than one-half of the net tax cut amount. On the other hand, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that the Ford-Gregg sliding scale proposal would cost only $45.2 billion over 10 years. 
This is a better approach. It is a bipartisan approach. It's better public policy because it rewards long-term investment. It costs less than half as much. And it will make life a whole lot easier for the tax writing committees in the weeks ahead. And that is the message we will be delivering as the final tax package is being written.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, over the last few days, I have been reading in newspapers and hearing on radio and television about the Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR] and the so called National Defense Panel [NDP]. The QDR is supposed to be a comprehensive assessment of current military strategy and force structure, as well as outlining a vision for the future. However, experts have called this QDR `A Cold War Relic' and when it comes to the Army, I agree with them. 
I truly believe the citizens of Kentucky and the American people deserve the best national defense strategy the Nation can afford. Yet the Active Army wants to cling to their 10 divisions, while simultaneously calling for a new Base Closure Commission. This is especially ironic when you consider that during the 1995 Base Closure Commission, the Active Duty Army leadership insisted the Army could not afford to close any more bases. This was just 2 years ago. The Base Closure Commission said not to have another Commission until the year 2001. 
Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to read page 3-2 of the 1995 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission's report to the President, which says ` * * * The Defense Department will be implementing the closures and realignments of the 1995 and prior Commissions through the end of this decade. The requirement in the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act that all Closures be completed within 6 years means that the closures from the 1995 round will not be completed until 2001. For that reason, the Commission recommends that the Congress authorize another Base Closure Commission for the year 2001 similar to the 1991, 1993, and 1995 Commissions.' I understand this is still the view of our former colleague Alan J. Dixon, the Chairman of the 1995 Base Closure and Realignment Commission. 
The Active Army argues that they are going to cut the Active Force by 15,000 men and women. But my colleagues shouldn't be fooled. When you look closely, you will see that the 15,000 troops the Army wants to cut are nothing more than ghosts. What you have are 15,000 positions in the Active Army that have been left empty the last few years. 
So the question remains: where does the Army plan to put these ten divisions--with no real reductions--if they close bases? How do they meet their budget target, while simultaneously protecting their general officer slots and keeping their 10 active divisions? Their answer? Cut the Army National Guard by approximately 38,000 people. That is a 10 percent reduction of the entire Army National Guard Force Structure. 
This is the very same Army National Guard, Mr. President, that currently provides more than 55 percent of the ground combat forces, 45 percent of the combat 
support forces and 25 percent of the Army's combat support units, while only using 2 percent of the Department of Defense budget. 
Why, my colleagues might ask, would the Active Duty Army leadership do such a thing? Well lets look. First, the Army leadership argues that the Guard divisions have no war fighting missions. This is true. But the Guard divisions have no war fighting missions because the Active Duty Army leadership has failed to give them a war fighting mission. And the reason they don't give them a war fighting mission is because then they would have to explain why they still wanted to keep 10 active duty divisions. 
Also the Active Army does not consider members of the Army National Guard as soldiers. Instead they treat the men and women of the Army National Guard with contempt. These Active Duty types seem to forget that the men and women of the Army National Guard have undergone the same training as the active duty forces. Fifty percent of the entire Army National Guard are men and women coming off active duty with the Army. 
The generals in the Active Army should look at their own figures regarding retention of their active duty members. The annual attrition of the Active Army is 36 percent, the attrition in the Army Reserve is 34 percent, while the attrition in the Army Guard is only 18 percent. 
Perhaps what is most frustrating to me is the fact that the Active Army refused to consult with the Army Guard during the QDR. When asked about this oversight by the press, the Army spokesperson responded that `there is an Army Reserve colonel and a Guard colonel here in our offices. They get to weigh in on the issues.' You don't need an extensive knowledge of military affairs to realize that a colonel doesn't pull much weight against a group of active duty Army generals protecting their turf. 
Mr. President, there should be no reason for the poor working relationship between the Active Army and the Army National Guard. I look at the strong working relationship between the Active Air Force and Air National Guard and wonder why can't the Army have this kind of relationship. I look at the great relationship the Active Duty Marine Corps has with its reserve units and wonder why not the Army and the Guard? 
Mr. President, Company A, 4th Tank Battalion, 4th Marine Division [REIN] which was deployed to Saudi Arabia in December 1990 is stationed at Fort Knox. This company of outstanding reservists was selected to lead the attack by the 6th Marine Regiment into the battle for Kuwait. This outstanding Marine Corps Reserve unit fought along side their active duty comrades and did a great job. 
They were able to work side by side with their active duty counterparts because the Marine Corps Reserves play a vital role in the Marine Corps military strategy and because the Marine Corps integrates both reserve training and education with their active counterparts. 
There are a number of plans I have been told about which could save more than $2.5 billion a year for the Army. They envision elimination of two Active Divisions. Two divisions could come out of Europe, and the Army could fly brigades from the United States to Europe on a rotational basis to serve a 3-month tour. The Army could take the equipment from these divisions and modernize Guard Divisions and give the Guard Divisions the war fighting missions of the two eliminated active divisions. 
Remember, Mr. President we have a Marine Corps that we can send anywhere in the world. We can do the same with the Army. Look at the 101st, the 82d, the 10th Mountain, and the 3d Infantry Division. These are tough Active Duty Forces that the 15 enhanced National Guard Brigades and the 8 National Guard Divisions can support. 
Given these tight fiscal times, I hope all my colleagues remember that an Army Guardsman can be kept combat ready for an annual cost of $17,000, while an active duty soldier costs more than $80,000. The Army Guard, just like its Active Duty counterpart, is trained for combat. 
Up to this point, I have tolerated the Active Army's all-too-obvious bias. Yet the QDR represents the final straw. Some of my colleagues want to wait for the National Defense Panel to do their review and report to Congress. I was a cosponsor of the amendment that called for this panel. When Senator Bond and I agreed to cosponsor the amendment creating the Defense Panel, we did so only after we had received assurances that someone with a Guard background would be on the panel. 
Mr. President, the National Defense Panel has been turned into a joke. It is nothing more than a warmed-over version of the failed Roles and Mission Commission--a Commission that spent more money in 2 years than the Base Closure Commissions spent in 5 years. 
No one other than the outgoing Deputy Secretary of Defense has been interested in anything the Roles and Mission Commission reported and it should come as no surprise that this Commission also did not have a Guard representative. So what we have is a National Defense Panel appointed by the outgoing Deputy Secretary of Defense consisting of individuals from our cold war days who have no background in working day-to-day with the National Guard. 
Even my friend Senator McCain, an author of the amendment that created the National Defense Panel, expressed his disappointment with the lack of imagination in appointing the members of this Panel. 
I think it's high time we put a stop to this childish bickering between the Army and the National Guard. The Active Duty Army needs to get its act together and accept the National Guard as an equal partner so they all can be the best Army they can be.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Tom Clopton of Cave City, Kentucky, who has been selected as the Kentucky Small Business Person of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration. 
Tom is the President and CEO of Tekno, Inc., a manufacturing company in Cave City. He started the company in 1989 with nothing more than a home computer and his personal savings. Today Tekno is a premier designer and manufacturer of material handling, factory automation, and specialty machinery systems for industrial applications. 
Tekno's success is remarkable. Annual sales have grown from $354 thousand in 1989 to nearly $13.2 million in 1995. Revenues have increased nearly four thousand percent in just seven and a half years. This remarkable growth has resulted in Tekno being ranked as one of America's fastest growing privately owned companies for three consecutive years, 1994-1996. 
Not only have Tom's business and managerial skills fostered the growth of a productive company, his ingenuity and engineering skills have enabled him to acquire 13 patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, he has patents pending in both Canada and Mexico. 
And as any good boss will do, Tom attributes much of his success to his employees. He knows that happy employees are productive employees and he makes every effort to ensure that Tekno provides a pleasant working environment. In return, his employees take pride in their job and are quick to volunteer for extra hours when urgent tasks need to be completed. 
And finally, I want to say that Tom's dedication and commitment to his customers, employees and community sets an example for every small business. I am happy that Tom is being recognized for all of the good work he has done. I congratulate him on this significant accomplishment and wish him many future years of success.

Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I am quite proud of the record I have established over the years in support of programs that help children. No one in this Chamber is going to suggest that this Senator, this grandfather of five, takes second place to anyone when it comes to priorities affecting children. I have supported expanding educational opportunities ever since I came to the Senate. Nothing is more important for our children than education. I have supported full funding for Head Start and the WIC Program and expanding Medicaid coverage to poor children. I have supported child care programs. I have supported the expansion of the earned income tax credit. I have supported a child tax credit that will become, hopefully, a part of this budget. I have supported drug abuse funding to help children. I have supported reasonable environmental initiatives that improve the lives of our children. But this is not a debate about whether or not to provide funds for child health care. 
The budget agreement already includes $16 billion in additional funds for child health care. A vote for this budget agreement, as is, is a vote for this country's children. I support the budget agreement that was negotiated earlier because it strikes an important balance. It provides much-needed programs for children from education to health care. It provides much-needed tax relief for middle-income families, and it balances the budget by 2002. An enormous amount of what we spend in the Federal budget is about children, and I believe that is right because our children are the most important resource this country has. 
We have to balance a lot of competing priorities. There is virtually no end to what we could spend on educating our children, for instance, if money were no object, but money is an object, because we have to balance the size--and I underscore size--of Government with the appetite of our constituents to pay taxes. I thought the budget arrangement announced earlier struck a pretty fair balance. It protected a number of national priorities while balancing the budget. As I have always said, it includes $16 billion for children's health care over 5 years, an amount that we are told will cover approximately 5 million children. 
The budget deal assumes that there will be $135 billion in gross tax cuts offset by $50 billion in new revenues already. Now we look at the Kennedy-Hatch proposal. No matter how you look at it, this proposal undercuts the budget deal by changing the balance reached in that agreement. It requires the Federal Government to be $30 billion bigger in tax revenues and at least $20 billion bigger in spending programs. Tax-and-spend. 
So, with this amendment, there will only be $55 billion in net tax cuts. That is not the agreement I agreed to, the White House signed off on last week, and it is not the agreement that the American public has been led to believe they are getting. 
There are plenty of other problems with the substance of the Kennedy-Hatch amendment. I do not think the budget deal was about raising taxes. If this amendment is adopted, this budget deal will become more and more about raising taxes. Put another way, this amendment reduces the net tax cut in this bill by 35 percent, more than a third. It requires a 60-percent increase in revenue raisers in this bill over the next 5 years. Tax increase, revenue raisers. 
Let's quit talking about taxes a moment, and let's talk about the Kennedy-Hatch amendment. While it is true that States have the option of denying the new block grant under this amendment, once they decide to accept the money, several conditions and mandates--I underscore mandates--to the States apply. 
The Kennedy-Hatch proposal contains 27 separate provisions which state that a State `shall' or a State `must' or a State `may not' do something. States have restrictions on how to write their plan to cover children. Who must approve the plan before they receive the funds? HHS. Which children are eligible for health insurance subsidies? What must be covered under the health insurance policy? You have told the insurance companies what they have to write, who they can contract with--think about that now, who a State can contract with for policies 
and how--how much they must pay out of State funds to receive this money; what percentage of administrative costs they must cover--mandates on the States. 
Having been there and done that, I understand what a Governor has to do, but, if faced with a choice of stretching dollars, a Governor might prefer to provide a very basic policy but to cover more children. Under the Kennedy-Hatch amendment, the benefits that must be covered are specified in the bill. 
What is the cost to the States? The Kennedy-Hatch amendment will cost the States up to $5 billion in additional matching funds, requiring them to raise their money or their taxes. The Kennedy-Hatch amendment will cause cigarette consumption to decline by a minimum of 10 percent. This means that States could lose between $4 and $7 billion in excise taxes if they do not participate in the bill, meaning that even more money must be made up somewhere else. 
For weeks and weeks and months and months, there has been a bill filed to get rid of Joe Camel, to get rid of Marlboro Man, to do away with advertising, to do all those things that FDA has regulated, and then just ask FDA to get out of adult choice. But people who will not help prevent youth from smoking are here with an issue, not solving the problem, they are here with an issue, because if they wanted to solve the problem, they had an opportunity months ago to get on a piece of legislation that would do exactly what FDA is now saying will be in regulations. 
So, Mr. President, don't let anyone say that they want to solve the problem. They, by their own words, have let thousands upon thousands upon thousands of kids die because months and months and months ago, they would not get on a bill to help stop youth smoking. Now they have an issue: They want to raise taxes in order to stop youth from smoking. 
Well, it tells me something that they want the issue and not a solving of the problem. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me just make a couple of points if I may. 
Under the previous bills, not in this bill but I understand are included in this, they sunset the program at the end of 5 years. Now, in the budget program 5 years is fine which when you get in reconciliation is 10, and under the 5-year program the reason they sunset it is because they run out of money. The cost is greater than the income. So this is a budget buster in more ways than one. The cost goes well beyond the income. So it is a budget buster. 
You talk about whether this is an entitlement or not. All you have to do is read what the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire was trying to explain here this morning. It is section 2802. If the State accepts, they shall, they shall, they shall, they shall. And every child in the State shall have. You shall contract with an insurer that says certain things. 
So I hope States understand it is in the cover of children. I hope my record is as good as the next one. 
I hope we can work this out--I understand what is coming next--but, after today, at least we can keep a budget together that we agreed on. I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is interesting to listen to those who are now so interested in tobacco and kids. They say, `Will you support Joe Camel or Joey?' For months and months and months we have had a bill here that would embrace all of FDA regulations, that would do everything to prevent kids from smoking. Nobody wants to get on it. Nobody wants to help. We get rid of Joe Camel. We get rid of the Marlboro Man. 
All you want is an issue. You do not want to solve the problem. So, yes, we can get emotional about kids. I have voted for 22 long years for kids. I am a grandfather with five grandchildren, and I am not going to do anything to harm them. They do not smoke. I do. That is my business. I am an adult. They are underage. 
So why can't adults make a decision and let us go ahead and try to accomplish those things that will stop youth from smoking? Do you think a 43-cent-a-pack increase is going to stop kids from smoking? They will just find cheap tobacco and bring it in here and reduce the price of cigarettes. You want to do away with the program? Let them grow tobacco from fence row to fence row. Tobacco gets so cheap you cannot raise it, and cigarettes go to a quarter a pack. They are using kids here and not trying to solve a problem. 
That is what irritates me. I am from a tobacco-growing State. It is $3 billion every year to my farmers. And 69 percent of those farmers have other jobs. It is a husband, wife, and family income. But you do not want to do that. You want to try to eliminate all that. You do not want to try to stop kids from smoking. You want to stomp up here--`Every day 1,000 more will die.' 
Those are your words.

Mr. FORD. Where in the world have you been to try to stop it? Nowhere. You just want to increase the tax on a pack of cigarettes, on a pack of cigarettes to stop kids from smoking. That is it. That is what you are saying. But there is a bill here to get rid of it. No one wants to join in that effort. 
So it is kind of tough for me, coming from a tobacco State, trying to do what everybody here is talking about, except let 
the adults have a choice. I think that is what it ought to be. But, no, we want to add the tax on. We want to reduce by 35 percent--I heard the Senator from Massachusetts say it is only one-third of 1 percent of the budget. It reduces 35 percent of the tax cut. That is a pretty healthy hunk. 
One State gets $29 million under this bill of the so-called Kennedy-Hatch. And it is $1.4 billion additional taxes to that State. So they do not come out ahead. How do they come out ahead? They have to match if they voluntarily accept it. Under this bill, they have to match. And they are mandated--mandated--on what they do once they accept it. 
I do not understand. People talk about trying to save kids. You have an opportunity to do it. But, no, they want the issue. They want the issue. Bigger Government, less tax cuts, but they do not want to get at the real root of the thing and try to begin to work. 
For months now--month after month after month--you refuse to join with some of us, even from tobacco States, that want to stop kids from smoking. All you want to do is make an issue out of it and say, I want to choose between Joe Camel and Joey. That is not true, because I have given every Senator here an opportunity to put Mr. Joe Camel where he belongs, and the Marlboro Man. 
I have made my choice. I want the adults to have a choice and kids not to smoke. But all you want to do is have another issue and pound and pound and pound here to try to unravel a balanced budget amendment on the backs of the children on the basis you want to make a choice between Joe Camel and Joey. I have made my choice. I am for Joey. I have been for him for 22 years. But you act like I cannot join in trying to help reduce the ability of children to smoke. It is there. 
So I just want everyone to know that if you want--want--to help Joey, help me get rid of Joe Camel. This does not get rid of Joe Camel. This does not get rid of the Marlboro Man. It just increases the cost of smoking to the lower income, just increases the cost to the lower income and unravels a balanced budget. One-third of 1 percent--you reduce 35 percent of the tax cuts in this bill. 
I hope my 5 minutes are up. I am beginning to sweat.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, as it is commonly referred to. This legislation has had a long and difficult journey. The coalitions supporting this bill do not all agree on all of its points. In fact, there are a few things in this legislation that I would have preferred to have seen strengthened. However, as the great Kentucky statesman Henry Clay once said, `compromise is mutual sacrifice.' 
It is my understanding that modifications to this legislation will doom the bill to failure. While I have a few reservations, I am certain that this reauthorization is better than not reauthorizing the current statute. Therefore, this Senator will not vote for any amendment that will prevent this legislation from being signed into law. Let me repeat that. This Senator will not vote for any amendment that will prevent this legislation from being signed into law, and I hope others will follow that lead. We simply cannot fail to reauthorize this important statute. Our disabled children and our educators have waited long enough. 
A few years back, I read a journalist's observation that `We are defined by who we have lost.' It wasn't until this time last year, Mr. President, when I got word of the death of a young woman from Berea, KY, that I really understood the journalist's words. Twenty-three years ago, when I was Governor of Kentucky, Susy Riffe was just a child with Down's syndrome. But she became a symbol of great potential and great promise as she sat on my lap and helped me sign a bill guaranteeing public education for disabled children in Kentucky. 
Susy went on to lead a full and productive life, completing her education and giving back a great deal to the community as a volunteer, an employee, and a dear friend. Her life came to define the potential that exists for all Americans when the greater community provides them with the tools they need to succeed. They say that 250 people came to Susy Riffe's memorial service. But that number represents only a small fraction of the children and families she touched and the world of possibilities she helped define. 
Just 1 year after I signed that law onto the books in Kentucky, the Individuals With Disabilities Act was passed into law here in Washington, helping millions of children across this great land of ours. We must always remember that the mission of this law is that the right to a free and appropriate public education is the right of all American children. While IDEA provides critical education assistance from the Federal Government to the State and local education agencies, it is the guarantee of disabled children's rights to an education that makes this statute great. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues, the floor managers, members of the Labor Committee, the majority leader, and their staffs for their efforts in bringing this reauthorization to the Senate floor today. It is a herculean task that has not gone unnoticed by this Senator. 
Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a cosponsor to this legislation.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to draw special attention today to five young women from northern Kentucky. These five young women from the Licking Valley Girl Scout Council are recipients of the Girl Scout Gold Award--the highest achievement a Girl Scout can earn. Each one has demonstrated outstanding achievements in the area of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. 
Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. serves over 3.5 million girls and has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. Recipients of the award have not only earned patches for the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, and the Career Exploration Pin, but also designed and implemented a Girl Scout Gold Award project. 
But perhaps most important, these five Gold Award recipients have made a commitment to community that should not go unrecognized. 
Kelly Buten, Mary Jane Hendrickson, Alyssa Hensley, Mandy Radle, and Becky Thomas have put an extraordinary amount of work into earning these awards, and in the process have received the community's and the Commonwealth's respect and admiration for their dedication and commitment. Their projects included teaching beginning violin classes to local elementary school children, organizing a fundraising breakfast for local elementary schools and holding a children's Christmas party. 
For 85 years, the Girl Scouts have provided an informal educational program to inspire girls with the highest ideals of character, conduct, patriotism, and service so they will become resourceful, responsible citizens. The Licking Valley Girl Scouts alone serve over 5,000 girl and adult members. 
Mr. President, I know my colleagues share my enthusiasm and admiration for the Girl Scouts' commitment to excellence. And, I know you will agree with my belief that this award is just the beginning of a long list of accomplishments and successes from these five Girl Scouts.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I just want to take a moment to extend my personal thanks to the Kentucky Air National Guard for a job well done. When the U.S. Air Force chose the Kentucky Derby Festival's annual Thunder Over Louisville celebration as one of the high points in a year-long celebration of the Air Force's 50th anniversary, the Kentucky Air National Guard proved to be the perfect hosts. They not only brought in all the aircraft, but coordinated all the different services. 
Thunder Over Louisville has already gained a reputation as a one-of-a-kind air show and fireworks display. But I think everyone agreed that this year will be hard to top. The performances were truly spectacular, but much of the success is also due to the tremendous job the city, the Air Force, the Derby Festival and the Kentucky Air National Guard did to assure the event ran smoothly and safely. 
Called `Wild Blue Thunder' in tribute to the Air Force's 50th Anniversary, it was the world's largest show of its kind in America, both for the fireworks display and for the air performances. 
The fireworks were reported to be larger than the opening and closing of the Atlanta Olympics combined and of the Inaugural fireworks. The impressive show culminated in an 11,000 waterfall of fireworks off the Clark Memorial Bridge. 
The television and radio commercials for Thunder Over Louisville use the tag line `you haven't seen anything until you've seen everything.' The Air Force and other armed services certainly pulled out all the stops with air performances showcasing the `Thunderbirds USAF Aerobatic Team,' the F-117 A Stealth Fighter, the B-2 Stealth Bomber, the SR-71A Strategic Reconnaissance Plane, the B-1B Long Range Strategic Bomber, F-14 `Tomcat' jet fighter, the A-10 Warthog Tank Killer jet fighter, the F-15 `Eagle' jet fighter, the T-33 `Thunderbird,' and Apache and Blackhawk helicopters. 
The performances were not only a great source of entertainment, but also were a tremendous learning experience for spectators of all ages, especially about Kentucky's homegrown talent. 
Kentucky's 123rd already has an impressive list of accomplishments under their belt. And I've come to the Senate floor time and again to commend them on their exceptional work in places like Bosnia, Somalia, and Rwanda. 
But as part of the Derby Festival's spectacular display, the 123rd got to show off for the hometown crowd. 650,000 Kentuckians saw first-hand the 123rd's skill and expertise with the C-130Hs, getting a better idea of how important this unit is to the overall operations of this nation's active duty Air Force. And that will make my job much easier this year if Pentagon officials start making moves to pull any of the 123rd's C-130Hs. 
Mr. President, let me close by thanking the 123rd for their hard work and their hospitality. I know the true test of their abilities happens when they are far from home. But it's nice to remind everyone at home just how lucky we are to have such a talented, committed group of service people right here in Kentucky.

 Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the city of Louisville and the U.S. Air Force have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they know how to throw a party. On Saturday, April 20, 44 tons of fireworks were loaded onto barges in the Ohio River and 225 food booths dished up everything from corn dogs to barbecue to Cajun wings. The armed services brought 130 planes, including nearly every type of aircraft owned by the Air Force, helicopters, jets, and vintage planes. 
When the party began, as many as 650,000 people were given the performance of a lifetime. Thunder Over Louisville, part of the Kentucky Derby Festival, has already gained a reputation as a one-of-a-kind air show and fireworks display. But I think everyone agreed that this year will be hard to top. 
Called Wild Blue Thunder in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force, it was the world's largest show of its kind in America, both for the fireworks display and for the air performances. 
The fireworks were reported to be larger than the opening and closing of the Atlanta Olympics combined and of the Inaugural fireworks. The impressive show culminated in an 11,000-foot waterfall of fireworks off the Clark Memorial Bridge. 
The television and radio commercials for Thunder Over Louisville use the tag line `you haven't seen anything until you've seen everything.' The Air Force and other armed services certainly pulled out all the stops with air performances showcasing the `Thunderbirds USAF Aerobatic Team,' the F-117A stealth fighter, the B-2 stealth bomber, the SR-71A strategic reconnaissance plane, the B-1B long range strategic bomber, F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, the A-10 Warthog tank killer jet fighter, the F-15 Eagle jet fighter, the T-33 Thunderbird, and Apache and Blackhawk helicopters. 
The Louisville Courier Journal reported that the F-117 stealth fighter was a crowd pleaser, along with the Army's impressive helicopter assault demonstration on the two floating bridges in the middle of the Ohio River. And after the 123d's C-130H demonstration, I can assure my colleagues the Pentagon doesn't stand a chance of taking them out of Kentucky. 
I want to commend the city of Louisville, the Derby Festival, the U.S. Air Force, and Kentucky's 123d for putting on such an incredible show. Not only were the performances simply spectacular, but despite the magnitude of the crowd, I found the event to be managed with few glitches. 
This was truly a day for family. And from parking to crowd control, city, Air Force, and National Guard officials did everything possible to make sure Kentucky families could enjoy themselves safely and without hassles. 
Mr. President, let me close by congratulating the Air Force for their 50th anniversary. Their service to this country is immeasureable as is our gratitude to all our Air Force service men and women. A big thanks also goes to all those involved with Saturday's event. I look forward to going back next year and seeing the festival officials, the city, the armed services, and the National Guard try and top this year's sensational performance.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to pay tribute to a man who simply could not have worked any harder on behalf of the Kentucky college he has represented for the past 20 years. 
A native of Harrodsburg, KY, Dr. John Begley returned to Kentucky in 1977 as head of Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia. It's hard to believe that the school John leaves today is the same one he came to 20 years ago. 
Back then, Lindsey was just another struggling junior college. Today, it's the fastest growing liberal arts college in Kentucky. Back then, enrollment hovered around 222 students. Today, 1,372 students look to Lindsey for the tools to shape their futures. Back then, the school operated on a $600,000 a year budget and took in no more than $50,000 a year in donations. Today, Lindsey has a $14 million budget, pulls in $1.3 million annually in donations and raised $18 million in a 5-year capital campaign. 
But perhaps most remarkable is that under John's leadership, the college has in no way sacrificed quality. Instead, they have strived for, and by all accounts achieved excellence. 
In addition to 15 baccalaureate majors, the college instituted a masters in counseling and human development. Within just 2 years, the accrediting arm of the American Counseling Association ranked the masters program as one of the top 12 counseling programs in the Nation. 
In an area of the State struggling for economic advancement, John made sure the college met the unique needs of Appalachian families. That meant making sure the college was readily accessible to area residents looking for the resources they needed to better their lives. With eight satellite branches, south central Kentuckians of all ages and from all walks of life can take advantage of the educational and job training opportunities at Lindsey. 
In addition to academic excellence and steady financial growth, John always looked toward improving the quality of student life. One way he did that was through athletics. With 14 athletic teams and a men's soccer team that has won back to back NAIA national championships--the first Kentucky college to do so in 45 years--the college has struck an important balance between excellence in academics and student life. 
Clearly, John's successes came with the help of hundreds of hard working colleagues, a community receptive to the college's needs, and a student body that took pride in their college's successes. But there can be no doubt that John's leadership pulled those forces together and created something really wonderful--something all Kentuckians can look on with pride. 
Mr. President, I know I am not alone in wanting to thank John for leaving the college not only with a firm foundation from which to keep building, but a standard of excellence that will serve generations of students and faculty for years to come.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, last month in western Kentucky, about 200 citizens of Marshall County packed a junior high school auditorium, taking time out from their busy schedules, to learn more about the proposed Clarks River Wildlife Refuge. So many people were there because it marked the first time they had an opportunity to voice their opinions on a refuge that would go, literally, through their backyards. Backers of the refuge had crafted a proposal and sought funding without any input from the people who owned the land. 
I first called the Senate's attention to this refuge last year, during consideration of the omnibus appropriations bill. I made it clear that I'm not necessarily opposed to the creation of a wildlife refuge in western Kentucky. What concerned me then and concerns me now is that those who farm about 7,000 acres within the proposed boundaries of the refuge haven't been heard on whether they support the refuge. As one farmer said to me in a letter last year, `no one seems to listen to what the majority of the landowners and farmers, who are directly involved, are saying.' 
Well, Mr. President, I'm listening. During last month's hearing, one farmer asked for a show of hands, of the landowners present, who supported the refuge. Three hands went up. When he asked how many landowners opposed the refuge, about 60 hands went up. What's worse, when a farmer asked how many landowners had been contacted to determine support for the refuge, the Government officials admitted that not a single landowner had been contacted--despite the fact that the creation of the refuge will depend solely on the number of willing sellers. 
Today I am introducing legislation to correct this practice. My bill would require the Fish and Wildlife Service to contact for an independent, non-biased survey of landowners within the boundaries of any proposed refuge. If the survey shows that a majority of the landowners support the refuge, then the Service would be free to proceed with land acquisitions to create it. If not, then the Service would be prohibited from taking additional steps. 
Mr. President, my bill is simply common sense: Creating a wildlife refuge depends on the willingness of landowners to sell their property to the Federal Government. We should first determine if there are enough landowners willing to sell enough land to actually create the refuge before we begin to make purchases. It doesn't make sense to draw up plans for a wildlife refuge if there won't be enough land available to create it. 
Mr. President, the people of western Kentucky have asked, repeatedly, for their voices to be heard. My legislation will ensure that they will be, and that future refuges respect the wishes of affected communities.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me add my voice to this for just a moment. For many of us who have chemical weapons stored in our State--and there are a good many States--this piece of legislation becomes highly important because certain language we hope to be in this treaty will allow us to look for alternate sources other than burning or destroying by burning. And so particularly in my case, where we have the nerve gas, this treaty becomes vital to us. And to have it timely considered becomes a very important aspect of alternative sources under this international treaty. 
So I am here pleading for my constituency to eliminate the so-called chemical weapons. We are being held up for reorganization of the State Department, reorganization of United Nations, this thing or that thing. We are held up when we have a deadline of April 28 and we have people out there worried about chemical weapons and how you destroy them. We have the answer under this piece of legislation, but we cannot go forward with it. 
Mr. President, I hope you will listen to my friend from New Mexico, that there is going to be an effort to bring this piece of legislation up because of the deadline. If we worried about deadlines, we would have a budget. We do not have a budget. But this is an international treaty, and it has a deadline. And for one, I do not want to miss it because of the chemical weapons that need to be destroyed and the way they are to be destroyed so that we might protect your constituents. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, when the 94th Congress convened in January 1975, I was 93d in Senate seniority. When the 105th Congress convened this past January, I was 12th. What a difference 22 years make. 
My 22 years of service to the people of Kentucky, as their U.S. Senator, has been during a remarkable period in history. We have witnessed the end of the cold war and the fall of the Berlin Wall. We have witnessed a technological boom that was unthinkable 22 years ago and we've witnessed the growth of democracy in practically every underdeveloped nation in the world. 
We have also seen the cost of a college education skyrocket. We have seen the cost of medical care skyrocket. And last but not least, we've seen the cost of a political campaign skyrocket. 
The average cost of a U.S. Senate race in 1974, the first year I ran, was less than $450,000. In fact, $437,482. The average cost of a Senate race last year was approximately $4.5 million. There is no job, especially the job of public servant, that is worth or deserves the effort necessary to raise and spend that much money. 
The job of being a U.S. Senator today has unfortunately become a job of raising money to be reelected instead of a job doing the people's business. Traveling to New York, California, Texas, or basically any State in the country, weekend after weekend, for the next 2 years is what candidates must do if they hope to raise the money necessary to compete in a senatorial election. 
Democracy as we know it will be lost if we continue to allow government to become one bought by the highest bidder, for the highest bidder. Candidates will simply become bit players and pawns in a campaign managed and manipulated by paid consultants and hired guns. 
Because of the political money chase, Washington, DC is fast becoming the center of our lives, not our people back home. The money chase has got to stop. We must reform the system so that ordinary, everyday people, who want to run for political office and make our country a better place are able to do so. 
I have spent a good part of my Senate career and political life working to nudge and, occasionally shove our party back toward the center of the political road. I came to Washington as a moderate Democrat, believing then as I still do, that the will of the people comes first. I've tried to be a moderate voice and will continue to do so. I love our country too much to let the extremists ram their agenda down our throats. 
There are many challenges facing the Senate and our party as we march into the next millennium. More than ever, I want to be involved in addressing some of them. 
I am not in the business to get my name in lights or to appear on the national TV talk shows or make headlines in the national newspapers. My philosophy has always been and will continue to be keep a low profile, work behind the scenes with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and come up with a solution that benefits everyone. Compromise is not a dirty word. I plan on working this way in the months ahead. 
Now of a more immediate and personal concern. Do I run again for another term in 1998? My health is good, my mind is sharp, and I enjoy what I do as much as life itself. However, because my mind is sharp, it is quick to remind me that I am 72 years old and I will be 74 in November of 1998. The good Lord has a plan for every one of us, even me. My heart says that my love affair with the people of Kentucky is not over. My head says it has been a long ride and a good ride but now it is time to pass the reins on to a younger generation. 
Today I will lead with my head and not my heart. So the time has come for me to announce that I will not be a candidate for reelection in 1998. 
As you try to understand my decision, let me ask you to do something for me, if you will. Don't say that I'm ready to go because I'm not and, frankly, I never will be. I still get goose bumps every time I look up at the Capitol dome on my way to and from work. 
You can say that my reelection campaign would be my most expensive race ever. I do not relish--in fact, I detest--the idea of having to raise $5 million for a job that pays $133,000 a year. To reach that mark, I would have to raise $100,000 a week, starting today, for the next year. 
Please don't say that my time has passed and I should be put out to pasture, because I don't believe that it has. The political philosophy that I embrace is just as relevant today as it was when I first entered public life 30 years ago. It is a philosophy centered on the fact that most Kentuckians cherish personal freedom more than either a liberal agenda or a competing conservative agenda that just uses Government in a different way to promote its goals. 
I thank the people of Kentucky from the bottom of my heart for giving me the chance to be their voice for these four-plus terms here in the U.S. Senate. I have been blessed with good friends and dedicated supporters all around my State, who have been there time and time again when I have called for their help. 
No one serves the people alone. He or she must have a good, bright, hard-working staff for support. I have been blessed with an abundance of such a staff. They have proven themselves more than capable of handling any situation thrown at them. Their unequaled loyalty and total devotion to their work, especially in handling constituent services, both in my district offices and here in Washington, is proven time and time again. My staff is simply the best, as the thousands of constituents who have used them will attest. 
In announcing last month that he would not run again, my good friend and colleague, John Glenn, put it in perspective when he said, `There still is no cure for the common birthday.' I believe that 100 percent, and I want to leave here knowing that I have a lot more birthdays to celebrate with my family. 
Now, speaking of family, no one--and I repeat, no one--could ask for a more supportive and loving family than mine. My wife, Jean, has been my anchor for over 50 years. My children, Shirley and Steve, have had to grow up with an absentee father a lot of the time. But they know in their hearts how much I love them. I plan on helping them in the years to come the way they have been there for me all these many years. As for my grandchildren, I can't wait to spend more time with them and, hopefully, learn a thing or two from them. I'll finally have the time to dote on them and spoil them the way a grandfather is supposed to do. 
Mr. President, let me close by reading the last paragraph from a poem entitled `A Year,' which I have carried with me for many, many years. My son had it right when he wrote this back during his sophomore year at Frankfort High School. He is now married and has three lovely sons and, still, he had it right much earlier than I thought he did. This is the last of four paragraphs, referring to the seasons:  
Another year has passed, 
the days not slow or fast, 
Burned deep within our brain, 
its memories will ever remain, 
And although you look back and stood, 
wishing there had been more good, 
No one can change the seasons, 
'cept God, and he's had no reason. 
I thank the Chair for giving me this time. I yield the floor.

Muhammad Ali used to say that not only could he knock 'em out, but he could pick the round. There is no doubt in my mind that when the fight's over, we will knock 'em out on the issue of alternative technologies. Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of picking which round incineration goes down for good. That means every time we have an opportunity--or see an instance where the Army might try to bob and weave--we've got to be ready to get our punches in. 
I believe the passage of the Chemical Weapons Convention could present the Army with just such an opportunity to bob and weave on searching for alternatives to incineration. Fortunately, the White House has agreed to placing additional conditions on the treaty which should stop any of the Army's attempts to duck out on their responsibility. 
The head of the National Security Council, Sandy Berger, has sent me a letter agreeing to my language placing conditions on the Chemical Weapons Convention. The letter not only makes it clear to the world and to the Army the President's commitment to exploring alternatives to incineration, it further clarifies the relationship between the Chemical Weapons Convention and our Chemical Weapons Demilitarization Program. I also have a copy of a letter from the President to Secretary of Defense William Cohen reiterating his strong support for finding alternatives to incineration that are safe and environmentally sound. 
Why is this language so important? 
First, back in 1989, as part of the Defense authorization bill, Congress set an arbitrary deadline of 2004 for the destruction of all chemical weapons. That date conflicts with the Chemical Weapons Convention which calls for destruction 10 years from the date the treaty is signed, which would be 2007. While it should be clear to everyone involved that the treaty date supersedes the congressional mandate, we don't want to give the Army a reason to bob and weave. 
Second, 30 days from signing the treaty, signatories are required to submit their plan for destruction. Because the Army is already incinerating chemical weapons in the United States and has already invested billions in this method, this is the plan they will submit 30 days after the treaty has been signed. 
Under my language, this treaty requirement will not preclude the United States from going through with a different method than what is originally submitted. Without my language, we have no protection against the Army holding up the official plan as a defense against looking for alternatives. 
Third, many in the Nation were very concerned the Army would see the 10-year deadline as an excuse, claiming they simply wouldn't have the time to explore alternatives. In fact, the treaty allows any country to request a 5-year waiver. Under my language, the United States would automatically request that extension if an alternative method can be found. 
The condition to the treaty states that if `the President determines that alternatives to incineration are available which are safer and more environmentally sound, but whose use would preclude the United States from meeting the Convention time lines, the President shall consult with the Congress on whether to request to the Executive Council of the OPSW for an extension of the Convention's destruction deadline.' 
Finally, adding this condition to the treaty is crucial to the effort to find alternative methods because last year's appropriations language not only has to be renewed every single year, but fails to address the treaty's deadline. Year after year, we're going to be faced with fighting the funding aspect out on the House and Senate floor, with no guarantee of winning. 
But with my language attached to the treaty, the search for alternative methods won't be left entirely up to a yearly floor battle. That's because I will have effectively closed any loophole related to treaty deadlines that might allow the Army to avoid searching for alternative technologies. 
In closing, let me say that up until this point I have withheld support for the Chemical Weapons Convention. But because I have been able to negotiate these critical protections of the exploration of safe, affordable, and environmentally sound alternatives to chemical weapons incineration. I will not put my support behind the treaty.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, millions of people watch the Kentucky Derby because it is a spectacular moment of chance. 
When the 123rd Run for the Roses takes place May 3, that's what the spectators will see--a riveting 2 minutes when anything can happen. What they won't see are the thousands of small details that go into making that moment one that goes down in sport's history. 
While thousands of people work to make the Kentucky Derby and the festival events a success, Kentuckians know that for the past 17 years one man has stood out in his commitment and drive to nailing down every last derby festival detail. 
That man was Dan Mangeot, the Kentucky Derby Festival's long-time president. He died in February, leaving behind a legacy and equally important, many, many devoted friends and colleagues. 
Described by some as a `legend' and by others as a `father figure,' Dan did the impossible. He took a legendary event and somehow made it even better. 
Under his management, attendance at derby festival events doubled to 1.5 million, while the economic impact on the community grew from $17 million to $53 million. 
When Dan decided to focus on something, the outcome was inevitably a huge success. Whether it was selling more derby pins--going from a few thousand a year to 600,000 a year--or instituting a derby festival poster--a regular award winner--he knew how to deliver. 
But Dan was about more than ringing up financial successes. He knew how to create a sense of community ownership in an event. Every year the entire community not only had a sense of pride in the festival activities surrounding the derby, but a stake in seeing them succeed. 
Dan couldn't imagine doing things differently. Community ownership translated into a board of directors truly representative of Louisville's diversity. And when it came to awarding contracts, he worked to ensure that minority-owned firms weren't shut out. 
It's true the derby is about the fastest horses in the world. But for Kentuckians it's also about showing the world the Commonwealth at her finest. 
And thanks to Dan that's what the world saw. 
Mr. President, let me close by expressing my deepest thanks to Dan's family for sharing such a great man with us. I know I speak for all Kentuckians when I tell Dan's family how very sad we are for their loss.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to first thank Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, the entire Finance Committee, and its staff, for acting quickly on reinstating, for a short term, the taxes that fund the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA]. Many of you may not be aware of how the FAA is funded, or how critical its mission is to our economy. 
The FAA receives its funds from two sources--the general fund and the airport and airway trust fund. The trust fund, up until December 31, of last year, was supported by a series of excise taxes--a 10 percent ticket tax, a 6.25 percent freight waybill tax, a $6 international departure tax, and two noncommercial aviation fuel taxes. For Fiscal Year 1997, the appropriation for the FAA was $8.563 billion. A total of $3.1 billion comes from the general fund, and $5.3 billion from the trust fund. 
One thing many of us fail to really comprehend is how important aviation is to our economy. We know that a safe and efficient air traffic control system, and a well functioning FAA, are key components to our economy. The President recently recognized the importance of aviation to our country by stepping in to stop a strike at American Airlines.  
Let me put some numbers out to explain how critical aviation is--the total annual impact of aviation to our economy is $771 billion. That is a staggering figure, but we all know that travel for business and travel for tourism are key components of our local economies. 
Failure to reinstate this tax will bring the FAA effectively to a halt. Yes, the air traffic controllers would be paid, as would the other FAA staff. But, my colleagues should understand that no money--absolutely no money, would be available to buy new air traffic control equipment and to fund airport development. 
This is not a simple problem. The FAA has under contract billions of dollars for new equipment. If the FAA is not able to pay its contractors, it will have to give them adequate notice to shut down the programs. This means more than not buying a piece of equipment next week, but shutting down existing programs underway. The lawyers will be suing each other for years. 
I want to also state that last year, this body worked hard to pass an authorization bill for the FAA. As those of you that were here will recall, we stayed in session an extra week to get that bill through. That bill was and is important because it set a course for doing something different for the FAA--fundamentally changing the way it does business and how we fund that agency. 
The long-term funding question remains unanswered. To answer that question, this body voted to establish a 21-member Commission. The work of the Commission must move forward, and it must be done expeditiously. With reconciliation looming, any change in the current system--a new tax system or a new user fee system--must be worked out now. The entire aviation industry must agree to how much money the FAA needs, and who, and how to pay for it. 
I know that many of my colleagues share this view, and look forward to working this matter out with them. 
The lapse in the ticket tax and the uncertainty over funding, is something our high technology, safety organization--the FAA--cannot afford. Our constituents and families cannot afford it either.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada for allowing me the time to speak. I compliment him for his courage, for his ability, and for his tenacity. We have seen that before. We have never needed it any more than we do right now. 
Mr. President, just before I came up I was going through some letters that came into my office today. You always see something personal which just happened. Here is a fellow--I will not use his name--who said, `I truly am concerned about my future as a citizen of the United States of America.' He also adds, `I am worried about my future. Will there be any Social Security money left for me to have and live on after I am retired?' The concern is there. If you want a balanced budget, vote for the Reid amendment. 
Tomorrow you will have 70-some-odd votes. Now we are scrambling to get one more trying to pass it and force it down people's throats. 
In 1983, I had to cast a very, very hard vote. That is when we increased the taxes on Social Security. We did it so it would be there for the so-called baby boomers. We developed a surplus on purpose so they would be taken care of in the outyears. Now we find that, if this balanced budget amendment is passed as is without the Reid amendment, it will be a piggy bank that will not stand the crowbar of balancing the budget. They will break that piggy bank and use that Social Security money like it is going out of style. And I will not vote for a balanced budget amendment that desecrates the Social Security vote I cast in 1983. 
How many would have voted with Senator Dole when he came from that commission if he had told us that someday this money will go for welfare reform, that someday this money will go for foreign aid, and for other programs? I doubt seriously if it would have passed at that time. 
No. Here we are now with a balanced budget amendment that says to those that we have committed to--the senior citizens--that we are not going to cut them. But what happens to those that come after those that are on Social Security now? They are almost there. What about your children and my children that are 45 and 48 years old? They have been required to pay higher taxes. Some of them pay more Social Security than they pay withholding taxes. Now we are saying to them that in your older age for Social Security retirement it will not be there if this passes. 
There is one thing that ought to make everybody shiver. There is a possibility of the courts telling the legislative bodies to raise taxes and not to issue checks. So then we come subservient, and we are not a three-part Government any longer. Under this amendment the courts can tell a legislative body what to do. If that doesn't send chills up your spine, if that doesn't tell the people of this country that nonelected, appointed-for-life people, are going to tell a legislative body, the Congress, what to do--that ought to send shivers up and down the spine of every American. 
We have been here for over 200 years; the best and strongest country in the world. And we are about ready to say the system that brought us to this point is about to be eliminated; the system that brought us to this point today is about to be eliminated because of the possibility of the courts telling the Congress to raise taxes and not to issue checks; things of that nature. 
Oh, we will hear the crocodile tears, the Reagan-Bush memorial over here on my right, you know. We hear all of that. But I say to my friends that I made a commitment. It is called the Social Security trust fund, and I gave my word, and the trust of the people of this country in this Congress ought to be upheld. 
In the last Congress, the Senate voted 83 to 17 to adopt a sense-of-the-Senate amendment stating that Social Security should not be cut in order to balance the budget. 
Protecting the Social Security trust fund is not jut a seniors issue, according to this letter from this young person. We have promised not to reduce benefits for current Social Security beneficiaries in order to balance the budget, but what about this young person's concern about whether they will be able to secure Social Security based on what we have in this balanced budget amendment. 
Let me just go back to the possibility of what the courts might do. I do not think there is anyone in this body who wants the courts telling us what to do and how to do it. They will interpret whether it is constitutional or not. That is their prerogative. That is the way the system works. But I tell you when we pass an amendment that says the courts have the authority to run this country--unelected, appointed for life--I have some real concerns. 
`Will there be any Social Security money left for me when I retire?' this young person writes. `I am truly concerned about my future as a citizen of the United States.' I say to that young person, my vote will secure Social Security for her or him or whoever it might be out there, and I want their future as a citizen of the United States to be brighter. We can balance the budget, as the President says, if we cast the vote. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am introducing capital gains legislation which I believe has the possibility of breaking through the impasse we have had on this issue for the last several years. My proposal is based not on political rhetoric, but on conversations I have had with constituents who support a commonsense approach on this issue. 
My legislation would provide a sliding scale for capital gains relief, lowering the rate at which capital gains are taxed, based on how long the assets have been held. For every year an asset has been held, the applicable rate would be reduced by 2 percentage points. Assets held for more than 1 year would be taxed at no higher than the current 28 percent. Assets held for 2 years would be taxed at no higher than 26 percent. And so on, down to a rate of 14 percent. Assets held for more than 8 years would be taxed at a maximum rate of 14 percent. 
I am introducing the legislation with three objectives in mind. First, I believe our efforts should be directed toward helping family farms and small family businesses. We do not need additional proposals to assist real estate speculators or those who specialize in putting Wall Street deals together. Most capital gains proposals we have considered in recent years provide a disproportionate benefit to those making six-figure salaries and above. It should be clear by now that we cannot pass a capital gains proposal that primarily benefits the wealthy. In my experience, those middle-class families that should be the focus of the debate get lost in the shuffle. 
Second, using this proposal, I intend to work with others interested in the issue to attempt to develop a bipartisan coalition with middle class families in mind. There are few lasting legislative changes that have not been developed in a bipartisan way. This is particularly true in the area of tax policy. Capital gains reform has been a hot button campaign issue for several years, often being used in an attempt to secure partisan advantage. I think it is time to move beyond this stage. There are plenty of Members on both sides of the aisle interested in providing capital gains relief. I think we should attempt to find middle ground that takes into account the views of both Democrats and Republicans interested in this issue. 
Third, we must face budget realities. It appears likely that any capital gains proposal which can pass this Congress must be included in an overall balanced budget package as part of a reasonable level of tax relief. Some of the capital gains proposals considered during the last Congress were estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to result in more than $40 billion being added to the Federal deficit over 7 years, requiring enormous offsets. Even the modified proposal included in the reconciliation package vetoed by the President was scored by CBO at more than $35 billion. I believe this is more than we can afford in the context of balancing the budget. It also seems to be far more than what is needed to target relief to middle-class families, and especially farmers and small businesses. 
I am also aware of the criticism by some on the other side of the aisle that certain Democratic capital gains proposals are picking and choosing among certain types of assets, and therefore picking and choosing winners and losers. My proposal avoids that criticism. It would apply to all types of assets that are covered under current law. It is nondiscriminatory. However, because of the sliding-scale benefit based on the holding period, I believe the impact will be to provide the greatest benefit to middle-class families like those farm families and small businesses I have in mind.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on this the 188th anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States of America and one of Kentucky's greatest native sons, I am introducing legislation to expand the boundaries of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site to include Knob Creek Farm, Lincoln's boyhood home from the ages of 2 to nearly 8. Located in Larue County near Hodgenville, KY, Knob Creek Farm is where President Lincoln learned some of his earliest lessons of life; lessons which helped mold the man who would go on to lead our Nation through one of the most important and trying periods in American history. I feel it is appropriate to honor the legacy of this great leader by including Knob Creek Farm in the National Historic Site. 
Under this legislation, the cost of acquiring Knob Creek Farm would not fall to the American taxpayer, but would instead be borne by the private sector. The National Park Trust, a private land conservancy dedicated to protecting America's natural and historical treasures, has been raising private funds and is currently negotiating to purchase the 228-acre family-owned farm, located approximately 10 miles from the existing Historic Site. After acquiring the farm, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the trust would donate the land to the Park Service. 
Thomas Jefferson once wrote, `A morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable.' Well, Mr. President, I think Knob Creek Farm represents just such a morsel, and including it in the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site will allow current and future generations of Americans to share in the rare educational value of this historical property.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on Saturday, February 8, 1997, the community of West Point, KY held its annual Volunteer Fire Department and EMS Appreciation Banquet. Each year, this banquet honors and celebrates those in the community who have been instrumental in supporting the mission of the volunteer fire department and EMS services. This year, the community honored one man, Ralph W. Wright, who has given 50 years of his life to the safety of the citizens of West Point. 
Mr. Wright has been a member of the fire department for the last 50 years. He began as a firefighter and worked his way up through the ranks to chief, a position he held for 27 years. After a long and distinguished career in the fire department, Mr. Wright did not let retirement prevent him from fighting fires. In fact, in his retirement, Mr. Wright continues to serve as a firefighter--who still makes the first truck out of the station. In addition, to his service as a firefighter, he was a volunteer EMT on the ambulance service for several years. 
Because of his tireless efforts on behalf of the citizens of West Point, today's volunteer fire department is what it is today: dedicated to the safety of all its citizens; prepared to battle fires and hazardous material spills; responding to protect the community from floods and other natural disasters. 
In addition to his work on behalf of the safety of the citizens of West Point, Mr. Wright has been a strong and active supporter of the Crusade for Children. The citizens of West Point have been well served by Ralph Wright. He is an outstanding citizen and a shining example to all. I know that the community of West Point holds Ralph Wright in the highest of esteem. This is an honor that is long overdue and I am delighted to share this event with my colleagues. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Ralph Wright and to his family on this special occasion.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a person who has been honored by President Clinton to serve as the Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater. Last week, Mr. Slater testified before the Commerce Committee. He talked about his commitment to public service, his background, and his desire to make sure that the United States remains the leader in aviation. He talked about the challenges facing the Transportation Department, but more importantly, the challenges facing all of us and our constituents. 
Mr. Slater showed himself to be forthright and straightforward. In response to some tough questions, he did not flinch. He looked each of us in the eye and committed to work through difficult problems, to rebuild our Nation's roads and bridges, and to make our transportation system as safe as possible. He also said something else in response to a tough, but fair comment from our chairman, Senator McCain. He said he wanted to give people a reason to vote for someone, rather than against someone. Mr. Slater did that in his testimony. 
Mr. Slater also brings something else to DOT--he has served for 4 years as the head of the Federal Highway Administration. Mr. Slater's support before our committee was bipartisan, both Senators and Congressmen. Senator Warner talked of his first-hand experience with Mr. Slater in working with flood victims in Virginia. Mr. Slater has similarly responded to problems in Kentucky and other States. 
Mr. Slater is one of the first nominees for the Secretary's position to have worked for one of the modal administrations. That experience alone will benefit our communities. Mr. Slater understands, for example, that opening up foreign aviation markets to our carriers will benefit our communities. Mr. Slater understands the importance of developing a new ISTEA bill. Mr. Slater recognizes the need to appoint members to the National Civil Aviation Review Commission, so that we can move forward with improving the Federal Aviation Administration. Funding for the FAA, improving aviation safety, and continuing to make strides in aviation security are matters that the new Secretary will confront on day one. Let's make tomorrow day one. 
Mr. Slater has many challenges ahead of him. We should let him get to it as quickly as possible and I urge my colleagues to support this nomination.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act. I am a full-fledged supporter of a 2-year budget cycle--an issue I have been championing since 1981. I believe in its potential as strongly now as I did then. It's an idea whose time has come. 
There are several advantages to a 2-year budget cycle. Foremost, there will be a savings of time and money. Congress currently debates spending priorities and funding decisions not only every year, but several times within 1 year. By limiting budget action to only one session of each Congress, we eliminate repetitive votes on budget priorities and spending allocations. We also allow the executive branch and recipients of Federal aid, such as State and local governments, to better manage Federal dollars to get more cents out of the dollar. 
Biennial budgeting allows for greater planning and more deliberate spending decisions. Too often, Congress has padded the budget resolution with spending for anticipated reforms and new initiatives only to find that action is not completed on the authorization before the new fiscal year begins. Unfortunately, those funds provided in the budget cannot be deleted or reserved for the next fiscal year, but must be spent on other programs. 
A 2-year budget, with one session reserved specifically for oversight and authorizations, will give Congress the time to enact responsible spending proposals before the adoption of a budget resolution and appropriations bill. A 2-year budget cycle will give the executive branch and State and local governments, 2 years to plan for the most efficient use of Federal dollars. 
This legislation will give Congress the opportunity to review spending decisions, and allow the executive branch to conduct compliance review. Too often we hear that once a Federal program is created, it will be funded into eternity. Congress simply needs more time to review existing spending programs to determine whether they should be modified, expanded, or replaced. 
The Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act provides greater funding certainty for State and local governments. Our elected counterparts in the States must plan their budgets in large part around Federal spending decisions. As we know from last year's debate on the budget, Congress all too often misses deadlines and does not complete action before the beginning of the fiscal year. State and local governments simply cannot put their budget deliberations on automatic pilot while Congress completes its work and they cannot be expected to efficiently carry out Federal spending programs if they lack the certainty that funds will be provided on time. 
While a 2-year budget won't replace the tough decisionmaking necessary for deficit reduction, it will make our work on the deficit and the Federal budget more efficient and more effective. When I was Governor of Kentucky, 2-year budgeting helped us to lay out a master plan for the entire State. And that master plan enabled agencies, local governments, and constituency groups to do long-term planning--planning that led to greater efficiency, overall cost savings, and equally important, peace of mind about future funding. We need this sort of planning on the Federal level. Ask any constituent what some of their top concerns are, and most, if not all, will talk about wasteful Government spending. If we truly want to address their concerns, I say the 2-year budget is the way to go and I am pleased to join Senator Domenici and others in pushing it forward with renewed vigor this year.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today, I wish to extend my congratulations to the University of Kentucky, the Kentucky Transportation Center, the Great Lakes Composite Consortium, the U.S. Forest Service, and other composites manufacturers on the completion of the Clear Creek Composite Bridge in Bath County, KY, located in the Daniel Boone National Forest. This pedestrian bridge is the first of its kind in the world, and the successful creation of this bridge stems from a creative design, and a great deal of research. 
The Clear Creek Bridge is a 60-foot composite bridge, which is lightweight, maintenance free, and most importantly, unobtrusive in its environment. Dr. Issam E. Harik, a professor of civil engineering, along with graduate students Pete Szak and Brad Robson of the University of Kentucky, were the research team that designed and constructed this visually appealing and structurally sound bridge. 
The research and development of the technology which allowed the construction of this pedestrian bridge are essential for a competitive and strong economy, particularly with respect to the use of composite materials. The lightweight, maintenance-free bridges of the future are a welcomed change to current engineering practices, which will save taxpayers money. 
Construction material and maintenance costs surrounding today's infrastructure needs are significant, and increasing rapidly. Particularly in this year, as Congress begins discussion of the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, it is important to identify new processes which will allow the Nation to maintain our roadways and bridges at a more affordable rate than is currently possible. 
It is my understanding that a major reason for the creation of this pedestrian bridge was to validate the concept of construction of composite vehicular bridges. I encourage the dedicated engineers who worked on this project to remain committed to their research and it is my hope that the people of Kentucky and throughout the country, will be driving over composite bridges sometime in the very near future. These will truly be the bridges of and to, the 21st century. 
Other special recognition goes to Northwestern University in Evanston, IL; the Morison Molded Fiber Glass Co. of Bristol, VA; Owens Corning of Toledo, OH; Ashland Chemical in Columbus, OH, and Zoltek Corp. of St. Louis, MO. This is an example of the private sector, universities, and Federal Government working together to form a strong and successful partnership. 
I commend and thank the University of Kentucky team and U.S. Forest Service for their determination and hard work in building this historic bridge. Outdoor enthusiasts from communities all over the Commonwealth of Kentucky will now be better connected to the wilderness.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today marks the last day for one of the Senate's most competent and skilled legislative aides. Proctor Jones, staff director of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development has spent the last 36 years helping to assure the legislative process moves forward. I know I am just one of many who are grateful for his guidance on a wide array of energy issues. 
During his tenure in the Senate he has gained a reputation for doing his homework, having a deep understanding for the appropriations process, and perhaps most important, fairness. He was invaluable in securing major projects for my home State of Kentucky, and I feel certain his handprint can be found on important projects all across the country. 
Jones leaves the Senate with an incredible body of knowledge, expertise and institutional knowledge. He also leaves after literally being the right hand of such powerful chairmen as Senators Russell, Ellender, McClellan, Magnuson, Stennis, Byrd and Hatfield. 
It will be a huge loss to the Senate and to States like mine that have benefitted from his knowledge and expertise. But there's no doubt that Jones will continue to serve the greater community working with former Senator Johnston. 
Let me close by wishing him and his family the best of luck and by once again thanking him for his commitment not only to the U.S. Senate, but to the American people. His service will not be forgotten and will continue to impact generations to come.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in cosponsoring a bill to reinstate the aviation ticket tax through September 29, 1997. This tax goes directly into the aviation trust fund. The tax has already expired and we cannot allow the trust fund to go broke. If that occurs, then it will be very difficult for us to continue to maintain the safety and security initiatives that are needed in order to secure and ensure the safety of our aviation system. 
I do not need to remind my colleagues of the importance of aviation safety. Over the past year, we have seen too many headlines which have underscored the need for a safe and secure aviation system. I urge my colleagues to act expeditiously on this very important matter.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to designate the United States Courthouse in Paducah, KY as the Edward Huggins Johnstone United States Courthouse. There is much that I want to say about Edward Johnstone, a man known as `Big Ed' to his friends, and why this outstanding Kentuckian so richly deserves this accolade. 
Edward Johnstone is a man who has spent his entire life in service to his country and the people of western Kentucky. Edward Johnstone is a veteran who fought for his country at the Battle of the Bulge, but finds nothing remarkable in his decorations of honor--to him they are reminders of his duty to country and fellow countrymen who never returned home. Edward Johnstone is a distinguished legal scholar who earned his law degree from the University of Kentucky and put his skills to work as a country lawyer in his hometown of Princeton, KY. Edward Johnstone is a judge who has served 21 years on the bench doling out words of wisdom and sentences of justice to those who come before him. Edward Johnstone is a tough, fair, hard-working Federal judge who puts in a full day's work even though he is a senior judge. Edward Johnstone is a man who gives me faith in the judicial process and those chosen to uphold our laws. 
I am very proud to introduce legislation on behalf of myself and all of the western Kentuckians whose lives have been touched by this extraordinary individual. 
Let me end my remarks, Mr. President, by remembering something that George Washington once said, `The administration of justice is the firmest pillar of government.' As an administrator of justice, Edward Johnstone is our own marble column in the Western Kentucky community. 
Mr. President, I send to the desk a bill designating the courthouse in Paducah, KY, as the Edward Huggins Johnstone United States Courthouse, and I ask that it be appropriately referred.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, time magazine once referred to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University as The Harvard of the Sky, a designation truly honoring both institutions. I say this because unsurpassed standards, values and public contributions constantly are reflected in achievements by those representing both schools. 
On this occasion, however, my remarks are about Embry-Riddle, for it absolutely is one of our Nation's most intriguing centers of higher learning. 
Recently, the New York Times featured the selection of Embry-Riddle for English and operational proficiency training of China's air traffic controllers. 
ValuJet's crash in the Florida Everglades last May prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to name ERU alumnus, Greg Feith, as investigator-in-charge. The university's aviation safety role, through an extensive curriculum, real-situation training laboratories, research and issue guidance is unparalleled. Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady's amazing survival in Bosnia had as a postscript: ERU graduate. So it is with White House Fellow, David A. Moore. 
Although ERU graduates hold key positions throughout business and commerce, we find this especially prevalent among airlines and the aerospace and aircraft industry. Some are astronauts. NASA's Lt. Comdr. Susan Leigh Still, USN, who received her bachelor of science degree, is scheduled for a mission in space this spring. 
The school is a major contributor of pilots to military and civilian aviation for two reasons. One is the level of academics in engineering, aerospace science, aviation and related disciplines. The other is due to ERU's own air fleet, its own flight instruction, its own meteorology training, and its own aircraft and engine student maintenance programs. Under the critical eyes of certified instructors, undergraduates perform all engine and airframe maintenance. I understand there never has been a safety incident attributable to their work. 
By invitation of the U.S. Army in Europe, Embry-Riddle now offers college classes to our servicemen deployed north of Croatia in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. This newest service adds to the university's extensive network of more than 100 education centers throughout the United States and Europe. 
A late December item from the Kiplinger Washington Letter refers to global companies relying on associates who work in team settings or situations. Embry-Riddle student assignments routinely involve team involvement. They take it a step further--through distance learning. 
For a particular assignment we might find one student in Daytona Beach serving with another located at the university's Prescott, AZ, campus, while a third comes from an extended campus overseas. A sophisticated networking system allows students to connect electronically with other institutions and 
class members around the world. In addition, identical courses are taught concurrently by a single instructor from either the Daytona or Prescott campuses as students from both locations interact. 
ERU is ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of the top 20 undergraduate engineering programs in our Nation. It has the largest engineering-physics program in America. Undergraduates last year won the national design competition for general aviation, an intensely challenging venture sponsored by NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration. 
Quite often we hear the term, `student-athlete.' At Embry-Riddle that designation has a real, rather than shallow, meaning. No better example is found than with this season's basketball team. Under the guidance of athletic director and coach Steve Ridder, a Kentucky native, not only does the team consistently win on the court, it also wins in the classroom. 
For example, 11 of the squad's 17 members have a 3-point or better GPA. Of the five seniors this year, one has a 3.6 and another a 3.4 in aerospace engineering, one a 3.4 in engineering physics, one a 3.2 in aviation business, while the school's all-time leading scorer also carries a 3.2 in aviation business.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, if there ever was a statement that the American people should listen to, that was just given by my distinguished colleague from South Carolina. He is here with institutional memory about what transpired and why--the intent. Now we find ourselves where this couple of words, balance the budget, supersedes all the work that has been done, cuts it off at its knees, so to speak, the Social Security trust fund. I think the people of this country, once they understand what the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, has just said, they will not be so interested in passing this particular balance the budget amendment. 
I am one of those the other side criticized last time, I am one of the six. I changed my vote from balance the budget to against it. Why wouldn't I? Listen to Senator Hollings, that is the reason I changed my vote. I have a responsibility to the seniors. We promised them we would not cut it or increase it to balance the budget, and we voted 83 to 16 last year saying that. That was just last year. Was that a political gimmick? Was that a campaign slogan? Or did we really mean it? I hope 83 of us really meant it. But we voted 83 to 16, saying we shall not raise or cut the Social Security in order to balance the budget. 
I do not know where we are coming from. You may fool all of the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the time; but you can't fool all of the people all the time. So what we are trying to do here now is fool the American people, saying to balance the budget it is going to give tax cuts, it is going to give interest rates cuts, it is going to do all these fabulous things. But we turn right around and break our word to the American people. 
During the last debate on a balanced budget amendment, the other side of the aisle proposed not touching the Social Security trust fund until the year 2008. Don't touch it until 2008. That was a tacit admission that the Republicans planned to utilize the trust funds--and I make that plural--to balance the budget. 
As my distinguished friend from South Carolina said, the money in the Social Security surplus, $71 billion in this year alone and accumulating to nearly $3 trillion by the year 2019, will be too tempting, Mr. President, for a Congress bound by the Constitution to balance the budget. 
Once the Constitution is amended to require that, and I quote--and you heard it from the Senator from South Carolina--`total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.' 
Social Security, I say to my friends, is placed in imminent danger, and it is likely that any attempt to exclude Social Security trust funds by implementing legislation--statutory language, that is--would be deemed then unconstitutional. 
So, protecting the Social Security trust fund is not just a seniors issue. We promised not to reduce benefits--voted here for current Social Security beneficiaries--in order to balance the budget. We are just not going to do it. 
But what about future retirees? Using the trust fund to offset other spending undermines generational equity, because under this scenario, total Government expenditures in any year, including expenditures for Social Security benefits, could not exceed total revenues collected in the same year. That would mean that Social Security surpluses could not be used to cover the benefit costs of the baby-boom generation when it retires. 
We raised the taxes in 1983. We made a difference, so we would be able to cover. So now we say we can't expend more than we take in, and the trust fund is there so we can do it. So, therefore, we break our word to generations yet to come, as the Senator from South Carolina said to the occupant of the chair. The benefits, instead, would have to be financed in full by the taxes of those working in those years. 
Using the Social Security surplus to pay for other spending programs would not only bankrupt Social Security, but would leave a system that needs long-term reform in order to meet the growth of future retirees virtually worthless. We need to reform and protect the Social Security trust fund in order to fulfill our contract of retirement security to working Americans. 
You make a dollar and they take out your Social Security trust fund payments--all of it. Excluding the Social Security trust fund from a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is an important first step in fulfilling our contract with our working Americans and with those who want us to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, pertaining to that bill I have just sent to the desk, Mark Twain used to tell the story about a businessman known for his ruthlessness. The man once told him that before he died he wanted to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, climb Mount Sinai, and read the Ten Commandments aloud at the top. `I have a better idea,' Twain said. `Why don't you stay home and keep them.' 
As I reintroduce my legislation to combat youth smoking, that is the same message I would like to send to the antitobacco zealots. They are more than happy to shout from the mountaintop their message against youth smoking, but I have a better idea--sit down and make it happen. 
The antitobacco advocates talk forcefully about the numbers of teenagers who begin smoking every day. In citing those figures, those advocates are nothing short of negligent if they reject my legislation and allow this issue to be delayed indefinitely by a court fight. They will clearly be choosing delay over compromise, self-promotion over certain progress. 
The fact of the matter is that while they are willing to spend millions of dollars on glitzy ad campaigns, they are not willing to spend any energy forging a compromise. They will not even come to the table. That kind of hardheadedness may mean they can enjoy the limelight a little bit longer, but what about the kids they say they want to protect? 
Back in August, just a day after receiving word that the administration was set to sign off on FDA's new regulations on youth smoking, I stood before a gathering of the Kentucky State Farm Bureau and told them that this was an issue that would be decided either in the courts or in Congress. I told them that without a doubt, the voice of the Kentucky farmer stood a much better chance of being heard in Congress. 
But, what my colleagues and the American people need to understand is that our children also stand a much better chance if we solve it in Congress. That is why I am back to reintroduce legislation to solve the problem of youth smoking. 
Why legislation over regulation? Because FDA regulation is tantamount to years of court wrangling, creates an entire new bureaucracy at a time of Government downsizing, and perhaps most disturbing to farmers, goes well beyond what is needed to target youth smoking. 
The Federal Register notice accompanying the regulation says, `FDA intends to classify cigarettes and smokeless tobacco at a future time, and will impose any additional requirements that apply as a result of their classification * * *' If farmers look to FDA interpretation of that language, they see a grim future for tobacco. Bringing in the FDA also creates a whole new bureaucracy when tobacco is already regulated by at least seven Federal agencies. Listen to these. They are regulated by USDA, they are regulated by HHS, BATF, IRS, SAMHSA, EPA, and FTC. 
If you want to know all those initials, I would be glad to do that. SAMHSA is important. That is the so-called Synar amendment, our departed colleague from Oklahoma, that he passed, as it related to youth smoking and set up criteria for States. My State has passed a law to meet the requirements of the SAMHSA legislation produced for and by our late, departed Congressman. My legislation seeks to reach the same goal, but under the framework already in place, which is the SAMHSA law. 
But what should be most disturbing to all Americans about taking the regulatory route is the fact that the regulation will amount to nothing more than rhetoric, because it will inevitably be tied up in court for years and years over constitutional questions. What this problem calls for is reason, not more rhetoric. That is why I introduced legislation last year, and that is why I am introducing legislation this year. 
My legislation represents serious, enforceable measures to combat teenage smoking. But it does not interfere with the legal, private decisions of adults, nor does it trample on the first amendment's protection of free speech. The same cannot be said for FDA regulations, which have already sent advertising, tobacco industry and FDA lawyers scrambling to the courts, setting up for lengthy legal challenges, where the fight will go on for years and years. 
Even if FDA jurisdiction is upheld in the pending North Carolina lawsuit, litigation is still sure to go for years and years, with the problem of teen smoking continuing unabated. 
My legislation is an effort to reach what I believe should be our common goal, reducing youth smoking, but reaching that goal within the limits set down by the Constitution, without creating a new bureaucracy, and most important, reaching it today rather than tomorrow. 
The bill I introduced last year and the bill I am introducing today would ban outdoor advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products within 500 feet of schools, prevent advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products in publications with any significant youth subscribership, and prohibit sampling of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to young people. 
I believe the bill I introduced last year was sufficient to reach our common goal. However, this year I have broadened that legislation to accommodate many of the other provisions of the FDA regulations, including a ban on advertising at sports and entertainment events attended by youth, and requiring the presentation of photo ID for the purchase of tobacco products. Many of our stores today are requiring photo ID. This will make it a law that they must present a photo ID for the purchase of tobacco products. 
In many areas, my legislation actually goes beyond FDA regulations. For example, my bill bans both paid tobacco advertisements or props in movies and cigarettes or smokeless tobacco advertising in videos, video game machines, or family amusement centers. 
My legislation this year is different from last year's legislation in one other important way. I believe it can represent a bipartisan effort to solve the problem. In the end, that might be the most important difference because, as my colleagues are well aware, no major tobacco legislation has ever been approved without bipartisan support. 
Mr. President, antitobacco advocates--Democrats and Republicans--all share a common goal: reducing the number of youths smoking. If we put our collective efforts together resolving that problem rather than advancing personal agendas, I believe we can solve the problem. I look forward to doing so this year in the spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation. 
Mr. President, I know that I am suspect because I am here representing a tobacco-growing State. But let me tell you that the University of Kentucky commissioned a poll, and almost 90 percent of the people in my State oppose youth smoking. I am not here representing just tobacco people, I am here representing my constituents who say that youth should not smoke. 
All we are trying to do is make it an adult decision, trying not to create another layer of bureaucracy to stop youth smoking sooner than later. If these people who are antitobacco or antismoking want to really help, come to the table. Let's sit down and work these things out. Put it into law. The President will sign it, I have no question about that. But if we send this to the President, we get it signed, and it goes into force, we can stop it sooner than later. Five years from now it will still be in court. We have had some first-amendment questions before the Court recently--last year--that shook up the whole thrust of the FDA regulations. 
So I am here with an honest effort, only armed with the silver tongue of the truth, as I have heard it said, but I would like for everyone to know that this is a serious, honest effort on behalf of my constituents and on behalf of the youth of this country that we get on with the business that we were sent here to do and to make this effort meaningful, and meaningful in the direction I think all of us want to go.

Mr. FORD. Madam President, as we begin a new Congress, we begin with the hope that the bipartisanship that existed at the end of the 104th Congress will carry through the 105th Congress. 
Together, Democrats and Republicans were able to put aside partisan differences and pass meaningful and important legislation, from raising the minimum wage to the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care bill, to the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration and the airport improvement program, and adding additional funds to education. 
Madam President, I think in not only the minds of some in this body but the general public, one glaring example where we fail to come together is campaign finance reform. While the American people saw that we can work together to pass legislative solutions to everyday problems, the American people also saw our failure to restore integrity to our political system with the passage of campaign finance reform. 
Unfortunately, this last election cycle once again demonstrates that we need fundamental campaign finance reform. This last election cycle demonstrated that the money chase continues. Only this time, the pace was more intense. 
Preliminary figures from the Federal Election Commission for the 1996 cycle are astounding. Fundraising by the Republican and Democrat Parties--`parties' I underscore--in the period from January 1, 1995, through November 25, 1996, totaled $882 million. That represents a 73-percent increase over the same period for the 1992 Presidential election cycle. 
The largest increase in funding and spending by the parties was soft money. The Republican National Committee raised $141.2 million, a 183-percent increase over 1992's $49.8 million. Republicans spent $149.6 million compared to their spending in the 1992 election cycle, an increase of 224 percent. Democrats raised $122 million, a 237-percent increase over 1992's $36.5 million, and spent $117.3 million, a 250-percent increase over 1992 when Democrats spent $32.9 million. 
Madam President, the money chase does not stop there. Based on reports by the Federal Election Commission, congressional candidates--that includes the House and the Senate--spending may be at an all-time high. Totals for both the House and the Senate general election candidates show they raised $659.6 million, an 8-percent increase over 1994. That is in addition to the other money that I am talking about. So we are nearing the $2 billion figure as it relates to spending in campaign finance in campaigning. 
One thing we will become in the House and the Senate will be bit players in the political aspects of this country--bit players because money will put us on television and money will do the work for us. So the big player will become the consultant, will become television, become advertising, and so we will become bit players in this stage called the American political system. 
An average winning Senate candidate in all 34 races this past election spent $4.4 million. Compared to 1994, this represents, by the way, an 8-percent decrease. However, the States in which Senate races were held in 1996 included most of the smaller and less populated States. Nevertheless, when you break down the $4.4 million per race, that means the average a candidate would have to raise is approximately $13,969 each week for 6 years. Someone dismissed that figure by saying that most candidates raise approximately 80 percent of their funds in the 2 years prior to the election. If you accept that statistic, then the amount you have to raise each week occurring in that 2-year period is almost $34,000. With those statistics, one would be hard pressed to argue that there is no money chase. 
Some have suggested that we simply do not spend enough in our elections. They have even been so bold as to suggest that we should spend more. They say we spend more on bubble gum than we spend on elections. Well, this is not about bubble gum. This is about running this great country of ours and keeping it on the right track and a leader of the world. 
How much more can we spend, Madam President, when you have to raise $13,000 a week for every week of your Senate term? How can we say that we are truly doing the people's business? The more time that we have to devote to raising money, the less time we have to commit to our constituents. That is certainly the perception of the average citizen. I argue that this is one area where the perception is the reality. 
Furthermore, Madam President, I suggest that the more money raised and spent in our elections does not necessarily mean that we have better campaigns. Al Hunt recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal that there is enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that the more candidates spend, the more negative the campaign. No, Madam President, I do not believe the answer is more money in our election. Rather, I believe, that the solution for real and effective campaign finance reform must include spending limits. The terms of those limits should be open to negotiation and discussion. In the end, there cannot be any real and meaningful reform without spending limits. 
Changing the current system is difficult. You can understand why someone opposes changing the status quo because it is a system that got them in office, and by and large keeps them in office. I recognize that spending limits pose constitutional difficulties. I believe that we can craft a system of voluntary spending limits that will sustain constitutional scrutiny by the Supreme Court. I also believe that in order to restore the integrity of our political system, imposing spending limits is the right course of action. If we must--and I underscore if we must--then it might be worth the task to amend the Constitution. 
The fact is, Madam President, when it comes to putting an overall cap on candidate spending, the Congress is way behind the curve. Just this past November, I believe the voters in the great State of Maine passed a ballot initiative that would impose spending limits on their State races. 
I direct the attention of my colleagues to my own home State of Kentucky. In 1995, we had our first gubernatorial election with spending limits, $1.8 million. The previous election was $12 million. Overall, these reforms in my State worked well for the candidates and for the voters. The Kentucky system has a general election spending cap of $1.8 million. Everyone agrees the Kentucky system still has some problems and some loopholes that need to be addressed. But on the whole, I think the candidates and the electorate approved of the spending limit plan. In fact, spending limits in the Kentucky race changed the overall course of the election. With a limit on the amount they could spend, both the Republican and the Democrat candidates had to revise the campaign play book. 
Spending limits put a premium on debates. A premium on debates--think about that. You try not to debate your opponent in this day and age, you try to stay away from him because he is unknown, the people are not knowledgeable. So you do not want to give him any publicity, so you do not want to have debates, maybe one or two on educational television that maybe nobody would watch while there is a basketball game, football game, or baseball game going on at that time. I have seen it. I played that game. I am no spring chicken at this game. I am still spry, but no spring chicken. 
In fact, the spending limits put a premium on debates and joint appearances across our Commonwealth. The candidates didn't fly; they drove because it saved money. They were looking for every Rotary Club, Lion's Club, every J.C. Club, whatever groups were together. They were wanting to express their desires and hopes for the future of our great State. Overall, I think most Kentuckians were pleased with the results, because the candidates came and talked about issues rather than being on television. The net result was a better informed electorate and therefore a better campaign. 
So, Madam President, I believe that the terms of spending limits should be open to negotiation. All items should be on the table for discussion. But I believe that we simply cannot have effective and meaningful reform without the restriction of limits that one might spend in a campaign. 
In addition to spending limits for congressional campaigns, meaningful reform also requires us to close the soft money loophole. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a dramatic increase by the national parties in the raising and spending of soft money. 
We also need to address issues like independent expenditures and issue advocacy. Recent decisions by the Supreme Court require the Congress, I think, to reexamine the current law. We cannot prevent an individual or group of individuals from engaging in political activity independent of a candidate or political party. But we can make sure that such activities are truly independent and that those expenditures are adequately and fully disclosed to the Federal Election Commission. We will hear a little more about the hand-off funding as we proceed into the debate on campaign finance reform. If you don't understand hand-off funding, see me or listen to one of my speeches. I will try to tell you what that is. 
Finally, Madam President, I believe that we need to examine the structure and authority of the Federal Election Commission. If we are going to have an agency charged with a mission to enforce our campaign finance laws, then I believe it is incumbent upon us to make sure that the FEC has the authority and the means by which to execute that authority. 
As the former chairman of the Rules Committee and now ranking member, I have sat through countless hearings on the issue of campaign finance reform. I can go back to the archives of the Rules Committee and produce volumes and volumes and volumes of testimony and printed records of hearings where the committee received testimony from Members, from professors, from campaign consultants, and all the election experts you could ever think up. We can easily identify the problems. The question is, Are we ready to try to work on solutions? The problems are there and we understand them, but are we ready to work on solutions? 
Madam President, with all due respect, we do not need more hearings on these issues. We know all too well what the problems are. We need to sit down together--and I underscore together--to craft the solutions. In the past, campaign finance reform has been an issue that has received too much lip service. We can no longer afford to let the opportunity to enact meaningful reform pass us by. The time to act is now. I hope that we can move forward and make campaign finance reform one of the first and lasting accomplishments of the 105th Congress. I know that many of my colleagues share a similar commitment to reforming our campaign finance laws. I look forward to working with my colleagues. Hopefully, through this campaign finance reform, we can restore trust and we can restore integrity to our electoral system by enacting meaningful campaign finance reform legislation. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am proud to stand before you and my colleagues today to recognize the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Kentucky Dominican Sisters. They are the oldest group of Dominican Sisters in the United States and I am pleased they chose to put down roots in Kentucky. 
It was a time in our Commonwealth's history when the rural communities were sometimes forgotten. But nine pioneers took it upon themselves to help meet the needs of those in rural Kentucky. They made a commitment to the community to serve through service, prayers, and study--a commitment which has lasted 175 years. It was this group of women who laid the foundation for the Kentucky Dominican Sisters of today. 
The Sisters responded to the needs of their time. They nursed soldiers in Kentucky during the Civil War and established hospitals for residents who previously traveled miles for emergency care. As the times have changed so have the needs of citizens of Kentucky. But the Sisters are still answering those in distress. My regret today is that I can only highlight some of their recent work including working with persons living with AIDS, assisting refugees to resettle and advocating for food, shelters and health care for not only the people of Kentucky, but for those throughout our great United States. 
On April 4, 1997, Sisters from around the United States will gather at their Motherhouse in Springfield, KY, for a weekend of celebration. Mr. President, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in honoring the Kentucky Dominican Sisters for 175 years of service.

Mr. FORD. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming wishes to speak, and I don't want to get in his way, but I will need more than 5 minutes, so I will wait until others are through so I can get my time on the floor in addition to the 5 minutes. So I alert the Chair to that. Thank you. 
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Breast Cancer Protection Act introduced earlier today by my friend the Democratic Leader, Senator Tom Daschle. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation to provide women with breast cancer the best care and health coverage available. 
I come here not as an authority on this subject, but as one of the many Americans who have been touched by this disease. My own daughter is a breast cancer survivor, as is a former staff member. Unfortunately, another member of my staff for 18 years, Martha Moloney, was not so lucky. After a long battle with breast cancer, she died in November 1995. 
It is for these women, and the thousands of others affected by this disease, that I lend my support to this effort to ensure all women with breast cancer are treated with dignity and respect. Rather than being rushed out the door hours after a breast cancer surgery, women deserve to consult with their physician to determine the appropriate hospital stay. That is why I am supporting the Breast Cancer Protection Act to provide a minimum hospital stay of 48 hours for mastectomies and 24 hours for lymph node removals. 
Over the past 10 years, the length of hospitalization for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery has decreased significantly. Today, hospitalization time for patients undergoing mastectomies has dwindled to a mere 2-3 days, down from 4-6 days, 10 years ago. 
Under pressure to cut costs, surgeons have been instructed by managed care companies to perform lymph node dissections and even mastectomies as outpatient surgery. I have heard stories about companies that require patients to be sent home a few hours after their surgery, even though they may be in severe pain, groggy from anesthesia, and have surgical tubes still in place. Some companies have even denied women hospitalization on the day of their surgery. These situations place doctors in the difficult position of having to choose between delivering the quality care their patients deserve and a penalty for failing to follow an insurer's guidelines. 
Mr. President, women with breast cancer suffer not only from physical pain but also emotional and psychological trauma. They should not have to worry whether their physician is struggling to comply with an arbitrary length of stay guideline or their own best health interests. The Breast Cancer Protection Act will help ease their anxiety by ensuring that crucial health decisions are left in the hands of doctors and patients, not accountants. 
I am pleased to support this important effort to provide women with breast cancer the thorough health care coverage they deserve.
