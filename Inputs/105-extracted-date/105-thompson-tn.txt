Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the essentials of S. 2176 have been incorporated into the Omnibus Appropriations bill, H.R. 4328. I appreciate the work of my colleagues, Senator Byrd in particular, in seeing that this bill becomes law. 
Mr. President, I wish to address the changes that have been made to S. 2176 since it was reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. The legislative history of the bill is largely described in the Committee report, S. Rep. 105-250. However, this is the opportunity to discuss the subsequent changes made in the bill. 
The term `first assistant to the office' is incorporated into 5 U.S.C. 3345(a)(1), rather than `first assistant to the officer.' This change is made to `depersonalize' the first assistant. Questions have arisen concerning who might be the vacant officer's first assistant if the acting officer dies or if the acting officer resigns while a permanent nomination is pending. The term `first assistant to the officer' has been part of the Vacancies Act since 1868, however, and the change in wording is not intended to alter case law on the meaning of the term `first assistant.' 
A third category of `acting officer' is now permitted apart from first assistants and presidentially designated persons who have already received Senate-confirmation to hold another office. The President (and only the President) may also direct an officer or employee of the executive agency in which the vacancy arises to be the acting officer if that officer or employee served in that agency for 90 days preceding the vacancy caused by the departure of the prior Senate-confirmed officer and, the officer or employee has been paid at a rate at least equal to a GS-15. Concerns had been raised that, particularly early in a presidential administration, there will sometimes be vacancies in first assistant positions, and that there will not be a large number of Senate-confirmed officers in the government. In addition, concerns were raised about designating too many Senate-confirmed persons from other offices to serve as acting officers in additional positions. 
The 180 day period in 3345(b) governing the length of service prior to the onset of the vacancy that the first assistant must satisfy to be eligible to serve as the acting officer is reduced to 90 days. Under 3345(b)(1), the revised reference to 3345(a)(1) means that this subsection applies only when the acting officer is the first assistant, and not when the acting officer is designated by the President pursuant to 3345(a)(2) or 3345(a)(3). The 90 day service requirement is inapplicable to a first assistant who has already received Senate confirmation to serve in that position. 
New 3345(c) was added to address the special case of an executive department (not executive agency) officer who serves not at the pleasure of the President, but under a fixed term, and without a holdover provision that governs acting service in that office following expiration of the fixed term. In that situation, without passing judgment on the constitutionality of fixed term appointees within executive departments, if the person whose term expires is renominated without a break in service, that already Senate-confirmed officer may continue to serve in the position subject to the time limits contained in 3346 until the Senate confirms or rejects that person's renomination, notwithstanding the adjournment of the Senate sine die. The subsection does not apply until the incumbent officeholder is renominated, or when a person other than the previously appointed officeholder is nominated. 
In 3346(a), an exception is added for `sickness,' a narrower category than `unable to perform the functions and duties of the office.' If the Senate-confirmed officer cannot serve because he is sick for more than 210 days, the acting officer may continue to serve during the sickness, and no nominee need be submitted to the Senate to avoid the vacant office provisions of 3348. The office is not vacant if the Senate-confirmed officer is sick, and he may reclaim the office even after 210 days if he is no longer ill. However, the 210 day limit will apply if the Senate-confirmed officer is unable to perform the functions and duties of the office for other reasons. For instance, the Doolin court stated that the current language of the Vacancies Act does not apply when the officer is fired, and for similar reasons, it might not apply when the officer is in jail if he does not resign. To make the law cover all situations when the officer cannot perform his duties, the `unable to perform the functions and duties of the office' language was selected. Sickness is the only exception to the 210 day limit, since in other circumstances when the officer is unable to perform the functions and duties of the office, there is no reason to allow the officer to reclaim his duties sometime after 210 days. 
The 150 day period adopted in the Governmental Affairs Committee was lengthened to 210 days in each place it appeared in 3346 as an accommodation to the Administration in light of the increased time the vetting process now consumes. 
The amendment's striking of `in the case of a rejection or withdrawal' in 3346(b)(2) is to ensure that an acting officer can serve for 210 days if a second nomination is made of a person whose first nomination was returned by the Senate. 
The phrase `applicable to' is replaced by `the exclusive means for temporarily authorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties of' in 3347(a) to ensure that the Vacancies Act provides the sole means by which temporary officers may be appointed unless contrary statutory language as set forth by this legislation creates an explicit exception. 
The phrase `statutorily vested in that agency head' is added to 3347(b) to clarify that so-called `vesting and delegation' statutes that permit the agency head to delegate functions and duties to subordinates in the department whose positions lack defined statutory duties apart from assisting the agency head do not permit the agency head to appoint acting officials. Thus, the organic statutes of the Cabinet departments do not qualify as a statutory exception to this legislation's exclusivity in governing the appointment of temporary officers. 
Changes were made to 3348(b) to provide that the vacant office provisions of the legislation apply not only when an acting officer has served more than 210 days without a nomination for the office having been submitted to the Senate, but also prior to the 210 days after the vacancy occurs unless an officer of employee performs the functions of the vacant office in accordance with 3345, 3346, and 3347 of this legislation. 
The tolling period provided in 3348(c) when the 210th day falls on a day on which the Senate is not in session is extended from the first day that the Senate is next in session and receiving nominations to the second such day. 
The changes clarify 3348(d) to provide that actions taken by persons not acting under 3345, 3346, or 3347 or as provided by 3348(b) of any function of a vacant office to which 3346, 3347, 3348, 3349, 3349a, 3349b, and 3349c apply shall have no force or effect. 
Added to the list of positions in 3348(e) that are not subject to the vacant office provisions are any chief financial officer appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, since the head of the agency should not be permitted to execute the functions of such an official. The amendment also adds to the same list any other positions with duties that statutory provisions prohibit the agency head from performing. 
The Comptroller General's duties under 3349(b) are now to be performed `immediately' upon his or her determining that the 210 day period has been exceeded. 
Section 3349b is changed to preserve all statutory holdover provisions in independent establishments, not merely those independent establishments headed by a single officer. 
The list of excluded officers contained in 3349c is expanded to include any judge appointed by the President by and with the advice of the Senate to an Article I court. This includes the Court of Federal Claims, but this exclusion does not apply to administrative law judges, since they are not appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The list is also expanded to include members of the Surface Transportation Board, which, like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is denominated an `independent establishment' despite its location in an Executive department. 
New 3349d addresses the situation when the 210 day service period for an acting officer expires without a nominee having been submitted to the Senate, and the 211th day occurs during a Senate recess or adjournment of more than 15 days. Rather than wait until the Senate reconvenes to avoid the vacant office provisions of 3348 from taking effect, the President may submit to the Senate a written notification of intent to nominate a permanent officer for a particular office after the recess or adjournment. At that point, an acting officer qualified to serve as such by this law may begin to serve as the acting officer for that particular position. So long as the President actually submits the nomination of the person so designated in the written notification for that particular office within two days of the Senate's reconvening, the actions of the acting officer are valid from the date the acting officer begins service and so long as the nomination is pending. However, if the President does not actually nominate the person who was the subject of the written notification for the particular subject designated in the written notification within two days of the reconvening of the Senate, then the notification considered a nomination that permitted the acting officer's service shall be treated after the second day the Senate reconvenes as a withdrawn nomination is treated under this legislation. 
The effective date of this portion of the bill is 30 days after the date of its enactment. For any vacant office as of the date of enactment, the time limitations under 3346 apply as if the office became vacant as of the effective date of this section. 
If the President nominates a person after the effective date of this section for an office to which that person had been nominated before the effective date, that second nomination will be treated as a first nomination under this section. 
All other changes are intended to be purely technical.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for his hard work on and dedication to information technology issues. The Committee on Governmental Affairs which I chair has had a long and involved history with this issue. 
This bill which we are addressing today seeks to take advantage of the advances in modern technology to lessen the paperwork burdens on those who deal with the Federal Government. This is accomplished by requiring the Office of Management and Budget, through its existing responsibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act, to develop policies to promote the use of alternative information technologies, including the use of electronic maintenance, submission, or disclosure of information to substitute for paper, and the use of acceptance of electronic signatures. 
The Federal Government is lagging behind the rest of the nation in using new technologies. Individuals who deal with the Federal Government should be able to reduce the cumulative burden of meeting the Federal Government's information demands through the use of information technology. This bill hopefully will provide the motivation that the Federal Government needs to make this possible for our Nation's citizens. 
I thank Senator Abraham for offering us the opportunity to work with him on this important issue.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, in the closing days of the 105th Congress, the Senate passed two pieces of copyright legislation that will have enormous impact. As Charles Dickens might say, it is the best of times and the worst of times for those who create the property that is protected by copyright. 
First, the Senate passed S. 505, which extended the terms of copyrights by 20 years, to life plus 70 years from life plus fifty years. For a number of years, our trading partners and competitors have protected their copyrights for the life of the author plus 70 years. Under the rule of the shorter term, these nations protected American copyrights for only the life of the author plus 50 years. The United States is the world leader in copyright, and should afford the greatest protection for copyrighted works of any nation, both to encourage creativity that benefits all, and for our own national interest with respect to the balance of trade. 
The extension of copyright terms will be of enormous benefit to songwriters and others who create copyrighted works. It will benefit the public through enhanced creative activity, and the further public performance of already existing works to be enjoyed by future generations. 
But S. 505 contained a bitter pill to swallow, the so-called Fairness in Music Licensing Legislation. These provisions are terribly unfair to those who create music. When a person profits from a public performance of music, he or she should fairly compensate the creator of that music through royalty payments. This is an elemental necessity for the creation of music. To paraphrase Justice Holmes, if music did not pay, no one would write it. The average songwriter receives less than $5,000 per year in royalties, and the average restaurateur pays only a few hundred dollars a year to play music in his establishment, about 1% of revenues. At the same time, the restaurateur uses music to create an ambience that will cause people to come to his establishment, and to spend more time and money there than they would without the music. 
But the restaurateurs, retailers, and others wanted something for nothing. The songwriters were even willing to help out the mom and pop restaurants by exempting broadcast performances of their music in about two-thirds of the Nation's restaurants. But that was not good enough for the music users, who had the House pass outrageous legislation that amounted almost to stealing from the songwriters. A House that purports to defend property rights passed the most anti-property rights legislation in many years. 
We worked in the Senate to improve that House-passed bill. We preserved vicarious liability, a necessity to ensure that royalties are paid. We prevented retailers and restaurants from challenging their rates in any city they chose, which would have been an unacceptable burden on the ability of songwriters to protect their rights. We eliminated provisions that would have enabled department stores to use music for free. In addition, we increased enforcement of payments because a judge can award double the licensing fees for up to three years instead of current law's limits of statutory damages. 
But I still have major concerns about S. 505, even with these changes. Songwriters' property taken from them and used by others without payment. The exemptions are too generous, as they go well beyond the interest of small establishments. In fact, the vast majority of songwriters are smaller business people than many of the establishments that will be exempted from paying royalties by this bill. 
At the same time, this bill runs counter to our international treaty obligations under the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement. Those treaties benefit Americans more than any other country. We have the greatest interest in ensuring compliance by all signatory countries with these treaties. Yet we have passed a bill that is inconsistent with these treaty obligations. What will happen when foreign countries do not live up to their promises to protect intellectual property, citing our own example of this legislation back to us? Songwriters may not be the only losers; copyright protects computer software and other non-performing arts creative material. Some of the companies who may be hurt by international retaliation may be member companies of organizations that insisted on the music licensing provisions. 
Only time will tell if the World Trade Organization will find that this bill violates international treaties that are binding on this country. But there is a good chance that these unfair music licensing provisions will not be able to stand. 
It became clear in the final days of this Congressional session that in order to obtain copyright term extension and the WIPO implementing legislation, unfair music licensing legislation would have to be included. Although the music licensing provisions are considerably better than those contained in the House-passed bill, they are still unfair. However, the 20-year extension in copyright terms is a significant benefit to songwriters, and the WIPO Treaty implementing legislation will assist creative artists in the digital age, as well as enhance worldwide protection of copyrighted materials. In implementing this treaty, it is unfortunate that my colleagues have passed legislation that violates our existing treaty obligations. 
Mr. President, there are times when the bad has to be taken with the good. The music licensing provisions are indefensible, but a necessary cost of obtaining very important legislation for the benefit of creative artists. It should not have been this way. I am confident that the music licensing issue is not yet over, and I regret the likely embarrassment that will ultimately fall upon this body when the language it has passed is ruled to violate our treaty obligations.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Government for the 21st Century Act of 1998, a bill to establish a commission to bring the structure of our government in line with the needs of our Nation in the next century. This bipartisan legislation is the result of work over several months between myself and Senators Glenn, Brownback, Lieberman, Roth, and Stevens. It has been carefully crafted to address not just what our government should look like, but the more fundamental question of what it should do. 
We all know the old adage, `form follows function'--but in the case of our government, form too often impedes function. The federal infrastructure should enable it to respond to national needs and the needs of individual citizens quickly, efficiently, and successfully--but years of outmoded bureaucracies, procedures and red tape have impeded the kind of responsible service our citizens deserve and expect. The government we have today was designed for a world which has long since passed into history, a world in which personal computers did not exist, two-income families were the exception and no one had ever heard of a `sport utility vehicle'. In short, it is time to modernize the federal government, and there is no more appropriate time to do it than on the eve of the next century. 
It seems to me that the federal government is doing too many things to do them all well. I believe we must reevaluate the functions of government to improve government service where it is needed, redirect resources where it is necessary, and get the federal government out of activities in which it does not belong. Our Founding Fathers envisioned a government of defined and limited powers. I can imagine their dismay if they knew the size and scope of the federal government today. We need to return to the limited government that the Founders intended, and the Commission established in the legislation we are introducing today is a major step in that direction. 
The Government Restructuring and Reform Commission established by this legislation would take a hard look at federal departments, agencies and programs and ask-- 
Can and should we consolidate these agencies and programs to improve the implementation of their statutory missions, eliminate activities not essential to their statutory missions, and reduce duplication of activities while increasing accountability for performance? 
How can we improve management to maximize productivity, effectiveness and accountability? 
What criteria should we use in determining whether a federal activity should be privatized? 
Which departments or agencies should be eliminated because their functions are obsolete, redundant, or better performed by state and local governments or the private sector? 
We all want a federal government that is as innovative and responsive as the government we envision. Our challenge is to determine how to get there. We must start by asking ourselves what the essential functions of government will be in the next century, so we may tailor the scope and structure of the executive branch accordingly. Some activities now performed by the federal government may require more resources; others will surely require less. The Commission on Government Restructuring and Reform will give us a blueprint for designing a federal government to meet our Nation's needs now and in the future. 
I am pleased that Senators Lieberman, Brownback, Roth, and Stevens are joining me in introducing this bill today, and I thank them for the time and staff they have devoted to the effort. I look forward to working with them on this important legislation.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that we passed a regulatory accounting provision in the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill. I appreciate that the conferees retained the provision I introduced to the Senate bill. I believe that this legislation will help promote the public's right to know about the benefits and costs of regulatory programs; to increase the accountability of government to the people it serves; and ultimately, to improve the quality of our government. This amendment aims to provide better information on the performance of regulatory programs. This information should help us assess what benefits our regulatory system is delivering, at what costs, and help us understand what need to do to improve it. 
The American people deserve better results from the vast time and resources spent on regulation--$700 billion per year, or $7,000 for the average American household by some estimates. By regulating smarter, we could have a cleaner environment, safer workplaces, quality products, and a higher standard of living at the same time. As the Office of Management and Budget stated in its first Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations in 1997: 
[R]egulations (like other instruments of government policy) have enormous potential for both good and harm. . . . The only way we know how to distinguish between the regulations that do good and those that cause harm is through careful assessment and evaluation of their benefits and costs. Such analysis can also often be used to redesign harmful regulations so they produce more good than harm and redesign good regulations so they produce even more net benefits. 
I am pleased that there is broad support for this amendment, particularly from Majority Leader Lott and Senators Breaux, Robb, and Shelby, who cosponsored it. There is a broad bipartisan coalition in the House that supported this provision. And it continues the efforts of my precedessors. Senator Ted Stevens first passed a regulatory accounting amendment in 1996 when he was the Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Regulatory accounting also was a part of a regulatory reform bill that unanimously passed out of committee in 1995 when Bill Roth chaired Governmental Affairs. 
I added several new requirements to the Stevens amendment to improve the credibility and usefulness of the report. First, OMB is required to arrange for peer review of its draft report and draft guidelines. The peer review must be conducted by an organization independent and external from the government, with expertise in regulatory analysis and regulatory accounting. It is critical that the peer review be performed by experts who will critique the draft based on the state of the art--not by a partisan interest group. Last year, the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution sponsored a conference on OMB's first regulatory accounting report. A distinguished group of independent economists unanimously agreed that OMB had fallen short in many respects. That is the kind of constructive peer review we need. 
Second, OMB must take a more active role in ensuring the quality and credibility of information used in the report. OMB must issue guidelines to the agencies to standardize plausible measures of costs and benefits and the format of regulatory accounting statements. Third, OMB must provide more detailed information on the incremental costs and benefits of regulation, broken down by agency and by agency program. Thus far, OMB has failed to provide that information, despite repeated statements in legislative history and in correspondence to OMB. A great deal more information on the incremental costs and benefits of agency programs can be assembled by OMB, especially for programs run by big agencies such as EPA, DOT, OSHA, FDA and the Department of Labor. Fourth, OMB must count the paperwork burden. A 1995 report of the U.S. Small Business Administration, entitled The Changing Burden of Regulation, Paperwork, and Tax Compliance, estimated the process costs of regulation at $229 billion for 1998. Clearly, this must be accounted for. Finally, OMB must assess the direct and indirect impact of Federal regulation on small business; State, local and tribal government; wages; and economic growth. This provision addresses several important concerns. Regulation can have a disparate impact on small businesses. The 1995 SBA report found that, for companies with under 20 workers, regulation costs $5,500 per worker each year--far higher than the per worker cost for large companies. Many regulations also impose unfunded mandates on State, local and tribal government. Unfunded mandates are putting a severe strain on these governments, forcing them to raise taxes, reduce essential services, or even face bankruptcy. Finally, the public has a right to know that there is no free lunch. Regulation can reduce productivity, wages and economic growth. In the end, the public pays for regulatory programs through higher prices and taxes, reduced government services, and squandered opportunities to do better. 
It is time for the Government to come to grips with the good, the bad, and the ugly about regulation so we can design a smarter, more cost-effective regulatory process.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his cooperation on this matter. The Committee on Governmental Affairs, which I chair, has long been a supporter and friend of the Inspector General (IG) community. Twenty years ago, the Committee's leadership led to passage of the Inspector General Act, legislation which has served Congress, the executive branch, and the public well. As their primary committee of jurisdiction, the Committee has a longstanding and abiding interest in the IGs. 
Thus, the Committee has an interest in any legislation that affects the duties of the IGs. Portions of the `Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998' amend the IG Act by vesting the Defense Department and Justice Department IGs with authority to act upon allegations received from intelligence community whistleblowers who wish to complain to Congress about problems they see in certain sensitive areas. Recognizing the Committee's jurisdiction and interest in this matter, Senator Shelby solicited my views on how the whistleblower provisions fit within the existing IG statute. I thank Senator Shelby for offering me the opportunity to work with him on this important issue.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate's action in passing a joint resolution, S. J. Res. 58, recognizing the accomplishments of Inspectors General during the last 20 years. 
Inspectors General came into being in 1978, when with the leadership of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Congress passed the act creating these vital positions. The initial legislation was modified and expanded in 1988, and today there are IGs at nearly 60 Federal departments, agencies, and other entities. IGs are a unique institution. By design, they are independent voices that owe duties to both Congress and their agency heads. Their job, which is not easy, is to identify and report on waste, fraud, and abuse, and other problems in Federal Government and then recommend solutions. 
IGs have served the taxpayers of this country well. Every year, they make recommendations totaling billions of dollars on how our government should spend money more wisely. They return hundreds of millions of dollars to the Federal treasury annually through investigative recoveries. And they help protect the integrity of Federal Government operations by successfully prosecuting thousands of criminal cases and suspending or disbarring thousands of individuals and entities who have taken advantage of the government. 
Naturally, IGs are not always popular at their agencies. No official likes to hear that a policy proposal is going to cost too much money or that a favored program suffers from waste, fraud, or abuse. But delivering news about problems, while sometimes unpopular or unwelcome by an agency, is vital to responsive and wise government management. 
Thus, we did well to pass this resolution recognizing the achievements of the IGs and thanking them for their services. The Governmental Affairs Committee looks forward to working with the IGs in the future, including considering possible improvements to the IG act to ensure that they are afforded the necessary independence and authority.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the conference report we are considering today. This report includes a provision that will provide relief to approximately 2,000 citizens of my State of Tennessee who are being unfairly taxed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. These people are civilian employees at Fort Campbell who live in Tennessee and work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell. 
They are being required to pay income tax to Kentucky. But they receive no services from Kentucky. 
I understand that it has been stated on the floor this morning that Tennessee is taking unfair advantage of Kentucky, that perhaps we will bankrupt the State or do grievous harm to them--basically a conspiracy among Democrats and Republicans, apparently, Tennesseans and Kentuckians, to perpetrate somewhat of an outrage against the good folks of Kentucky. 
I am sorry that we can't debate it based strictly on the merits of the action being taken, because it is a very, very meritorious objective consideration of what we are doing here today. On any objective consideration in terms of sound policy, or in terms of fairness, this provision stands and survives. 
We are not taking unfair advantage of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, our good neighbors to the north. What we are doing, as attested to by a vote of 15-to-0 out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, is righting a wrong and correcting an inequity. 
The Commonwealth of Kentucky has gotten used to being able to tax Tennesseans--levy income tax on them--without providing any services to them. Weaning from a situation like that I guess perhaps can be somewhat painful, but I don't think it is going to do grievous harm to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, which I understand had a $306 million surplus last year, and is perhaps beside the point. 
But when we are talking about fairness and equity, and some of the other things we are discussing today, and the fact that we are discussing basic principles and so forth, and who looks out for the little guy, we are basically dealing with civilian employees working at Fort Campbell with average incomes of about $30,000 a year. So these Tennesseans are paying about $1,800 a year to Kentucky for nothing in return. So let's just put that in a little bit of perspective. 
Of course, it is not just the Tennessee-Kentucky situation, it is two other situations where the Federal facility straddles the State border. This provides relief for the State of Washington also. It also provides relief for the State of South Dakota. I don't see the Members of the State of Oregon, which is affected by it, or the State of Nebraska, which is affected by it, to seem to have any problems either with the constitutionality or the fairness of their situations. The situations are basically the same. 
But we have an issue here today with regard to Tennessee and Kentucky. So be it. 
As I said, these are civilian Federal employees. They work in Fort Campbell, KY. As it is well known, 80 percent of Fort Campbell is in the State of Tennessee. The mailbox is Kentucky. It is referred to as Fort Campbell, KY. There are several Federal civilian employees who live in Tennessee and who work on the Kentucky side. Some of them have worked on the Tennessee side for a long time and are assigned on the Kentucky side. They have nothing to do with that. It is not within their power, if they want to remain employed. And thereby Tennessee does not have an income tax. Kentucky does. They pay the maximum sales tax and other taxes in Tennessee, plus the income tax of Kentucky. They enter the Federal facilities on the Kentucky side by a Federal route. They do not go on the property of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to enter the place where they are working. 
As I said, there are no services provided. I understand there was some reference made to some resident facilities being provided with water or some services. Of course, these people do not avail themselves of that. I can't imagine anything other than a most dire emergency where fire, water, sewer, and police protection, and all of that is provided by the Federal Government. If the problem gets so big, I imagine folks in Tennessee and Kentucky would come in and try to help out. But basically, in terms of basic services--fire, police, sewer, and water--none of those services is provided by the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the benefit of these employees. Basically what they are doing is paying income taxes for nothing received. 
As I said, these people are not in the military. There is already an exemption for the military employees. They can only be taxed in their State of residence. 
This is a situation where literally some people have been transferred and moved across the street, or even down the hall in their own building, and become subject, just because of that move, to Federal income tax or to income tax from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. When people in that situation--who live in Tennessee, work in Kentucky, only go on Federal property to get to their job, come right back, no services--if those individuals go on unemployment, they can't go to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and get unemployment benefits. 
We had a witness before the Governmental Affairs Committee, when this was taken up, who makes $15,000 a year--$15,000 a year, and three kids--is a Federal civilian employee, lives in Tennessee, and works on the Kentucky side. When she went on hard times and had to apply for food stamps, she applied to the State of Kentucky and was turned down. 
There was another witness who appeared before our committee who had been in the Air Force for 20 years, grew up in Kentucky, and paid Kentucky taxes far 20 years; then he moved to Tennessee; then he was assigned at Fort Campbell on the Kentucky side while he was living in Tennessee--the typical kind of a situation we are addressing. His daughter applied to the University of Kentucky. He sought instate tuition rates. He was denied that. He was treated as out-of-State for purposes of tuition when his daughter wanted to go to the University of Kentucky. 
In other words, he is a Tennessean under some circumstances, when it benefits the Commonwealth, and a Kentuckian in other circumstances, when it benefits the Commonwealth. 
As I said, it is not just Tennessee that is involved here. Employees at the Gavin's Point Hydroelectric Dam are in a similar situation. This dam is a Federal facility maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and it straddles the Missouri River. The Missouri River is the border between South Dakota and Nebraska. The 35 South Dakotans who are employed at the dam are subject to Nebraska income tax on half their wages earned on the dam. Nebraska claims that because half of the Gavin's Point Dam is in the State of Nebraska, half the wages earned by South Dakotans on the dam are subject to Nebraska income tax. But these South Dakotans only travel into Nebraska while they are working on the Federal dam and they receive no benefits from Nebraska for the taxes that they are required to pay. They are ineligible for Nebraska unemployment benefits and accident insurance benefits. 
Likewise, Washingtonians employed at the Columbia River hydroelectric dams were subject to tax by the State of Oregon until just recently. 
These dams are Federal facilities maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. They straddle the Columbia River. The Columbia River is the border between Washington and Oregon. One-hundred and forty Washingtonians working on these dams only cross into Oregon when their work takes them across the midpoint of the dams. Oregon had required these employees to keep detailed records regarding the exact amount of the time they spent on the Oregon side of the dam in order to obtain a tax refund from Oregon for time worked on the Washington side of the dam. Oregon also required Washington residents to pay income tax on a prorated amount of their vacation pay based upon the percentage of time during the year worked on the Oregon side of the dam. Because employees at the dam cross back and forth multiple times a day, Oregonians' recordkeeping requirements forced the Federal employees to waste a good portion of their workday documenting their movements across the dam. 
The Washington residents working on the Columbia River Dam receive no benefits from the State of Oregon. They are not eligible for instate tuition rates at Oregon schools. They are not eligible for Oregon unemployment compensation benefits. In fact, when a Washingtonian who was laid off from Washington at one of the dams applied for Oregon unemployment compensation, he was denied. But when he later received unemployment benefits from Washington, Oregon tried to tax those benefits. 
I recognize that the Oregon State Legislature enacted a bill last year to exempt Washingtonians employed at the Columbia River Dam from Oregon income tax. But it appears that the State was only reacting to the other body's swift movement of H.R. 1953. Oregon is continuing to require Washington residents to file W-2 forms in Oregon. Therefore, Washingtonians fear that Oregon may repeal the recently enacted exemption in the absence of Federal legislation. 
Now, there is no question that with the passage of the Buck Act in 1940, States have the authority to tax Federal employees, but over a period of time, after due deliberation by Congress, there have been exceptions that have been made to this. There has been an exception for the military. There has been an exception for Members of Congress. There has been an exception for Amtrak employees, for example, employees who, of course, travel over several States. There was an exemption with regard to the ability to tax pension income from nonresidents. So these have been exemptions, and we can argue and debate the wisdom of each of these exemptions, but it has been long recognized. 
There is no question about the constitutionality, incidentally. The witnesses even before our committee who did not think that what we were doing was the best way to go, I don't think raised any questions concerning the constitutionality of what we were doing. 
Congress clearly has the right constitutionally to move in this regard. We can debate the merits of each of these exemptions, but there has been no question over the years after due deliberation there have been exemptions carved out on the basis of what is right and on the basis of fairness. This idea that we are opening up Pandora's box and it is going to affect anybody who works near a Federal facility or anything of that nature is certainly a misplaced concern. But that is not something that has been affected here--not employees who are near a border. We are talking about a specific situation where you have a Federal facility straddling two States. One State does not have a State income tax and the other State does. That is a very, very specific and narrow situation with which we are dealing. 
It does not affect national parks, for example, where local governments have much more to do with providing emergency services and things of that nature than the Commonwealth of Kentucky or the other two States affected here, the State of Oregon and the State of Nebraska, provide in these situations. 
I agree that Congress should tread carefully when it acts to limit the taxing authorities of States, but these three situations addressed by the conference report are exceptional, and I believe they meet the elevated threshold which has been set by Congress for preempting a State's taxing authority. 
At this time I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues who have served as conferees on the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for including this important provision in the final bill. I would also like to thank my friends from Tennessee, Congressman Bryant and Senator Frist, for their hard work on behalf of these 2,000 Tennesseans. I am pleased they are finally getting the tax relief they deserve. I urge all of my colleagues to support this conference report. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, just in response on some of the points that my friend from Kentucky made with regard to whether or not the other States need this and whether or not it is worked out permanently to their satisfaction, I think probably the Members of this body who represent those States would be the best witnesses. If the Oregon situation is worked out, then perhaps Senator Gorton and Senator Murray will oppose me on this. But I do not think they do. I think the two Senators from the State of Washington do not feel like it has been worked out. 
Just as the situation is with South Dakota. I think the distinguished minority leader of this body supports this provision in the legislation. So, regarding the Tennessee/Kentucky situation, the negotiations that my friend refers to, I think the result was a bit different than what has been alluded to. My understanding was there was one meeting in August and the suggestion was that Tennessee absorb the difference; that we give these Tennessee employees a credit and the State of Tennessee absorb the difference. That was not considered to be fair by the people in Tennessee, so those negotiations broke down. 
With regard to the college tuition situation, at issue here is not that this gentleman moved from Kentucky back to Tennessee; that is for sure. The issue is he was working on the Kentucky side and paying Kentucky income taxes and still not getting that benefit from Kentucky. That is the point. I believe, if my colleague will check--I suppose we cannot resolve it here this morning--but I think, if my colleague will check, he will see that when the situation is reversed, my understanding is when Kentuckians work on the Tennessee side, they get Tennessee instate tuition. 
I do not want to get into an extended battle between the States here. We enjoy a common border and friendly relationships and all that. But just on the basis of fairness, I believe we are doing a little bit better in that regard, in terms of comity, in terms of out-of-State tuition for workers who work at Fort Campbell. It is just simply based upon the proposition that a person should not have to go across the border, down the hall or down the street or across the street and so forth, when he is assigned new duties, not use any of the Kentucky facilities, and have to pay Kentucky income tax and not get any of the benefits, whether it be college instate tuition or not. 
I would also point out to my colleague with regard to Kentucky employees working at Fort Campbell who work on the Tennessee side, as far as `on the post' is concerned, they do not pay Tennessee sales tax. If they go off the post they will pay Tennessee sales tax, but then they are using Tennessee facilities. The point is just simply not well founded any way that you look at it. 
With regard to the States rights issue, that is something that, of course, is of concern to all of us. A lot of people strongly believe in federalism and that the proper role of the States should be preserved in the relationship between the State and the Federal Government. I would simply point out that with regard to most of these issues, it has to do with the relationship between the State governments and the Federal Government, and the Federal Government's relationship with the States and their policies vis a vis the Federal Government. 
This has to do with the way a State government is treating the citizens of another State. Ever since we have had the interstate commerce clause in the Constitution, that has been something that has been appropriately addressed by the Congress of the United States. 
So I do not want to beat a dead horse here either. I feel, as does my colleague from Kentucky, that we are not going to change very many votes on this debate. But, in closing, I hope our friends in Kentucky do not feel that this is some kind of a power grab, something that is unfair to them, something that we have them over the barrel on. 
This is something that is supported by Democrats and Republicans in this body. It is very narrowly tailored. My friend refers to 240 other situations. They are not similar. The only comparable or analogous situations would be those situations where Federal facilities straddle a State border, and there are only three of them, and those are the three that we deal with here. 
We are trying to do what we often do in this body, and that is finely tailor a remedy for something that doesn't affect many people. It doesn't affect many people at all. But with regard to those who are affected, it is important for those folks who on average are making $30,000 a year. It is something we have been trying to work out for 10 years. We have not been able to. I would rather not have to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate and resolve this matter this way, either. After trying all other avenues, we were left with no choice. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and extend my good wishes and respect to the senior Senator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who has fought so long and hard for his State. I never look forward to having to come to the floor and take him on in any circumstance, especially when he is defending or representing and taking the side of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, because I know his heart and soul is in it. I respectfully disagree with him on this. I think it is the right thing to do. I think it is fair to these employees, and I urge its adoption. I yield the floor. 
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this country will face an unprecedented problem on January 1, 2000, when many computer systems, in the form of software, hardware and embedded chips, will interpret the year as 1900 rather than 2000, potentially resulting in extensive failures of critical operations. The fix to this problem is not a technological challenge, but a management challenge due to its massive nature and the limited time we have to fix it. With less then 465 days until the new millennium, this problem will affect every level of government, every size of business, and literally every person in this great nation. 
Although the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act does not represent the silver bullet to remedy this problem, I rise today to voice my support for this legislation. This bill will encourage both public and private sector entities to disclose year 2000 related information, in the form of product readiness, proposed solutions and testing processes, thereby increasing the ability of governments and businesses to update their own systems and avoid potentially catastrophic failures. 
Mr. President, I had a number of concerns with this legislation in its original form. First of all, this legislation preempts state and local liability law. Typically, neither I nor many of my colleagues would support such preemption of state authority; however, this problem warrants drastic action. In fact, state and local government associations have expressed their support for this bill. 
Second, this legislation reduces the standard of care required in providing accurate information as currently defined in state and local statutes. Due to the critical nature of this problem, I can support this provision for cases where businesses are sharing information with the intent to identify a common solution and prevent a potentially catastrophic failure. However, in its original form, this bill would have extended this protection to sellers of year 2000 remediation products and services whose statements may be motivated solely by financial interests. 
Mr. President, to address these concerns I introduced an amendment in the Judiciary Committee which failed to pass. However, I worked with the Committee and other interested parties to develop language that achieved all the goals and intentions of my original amendment. This language has been adopted in section 6(b), and all interested parties agree we have strengthened the bill. My language will mitigate against false and inaccurate year 2000 solicitations while promoting the open sharing of information needed to solve the year 2000 problem. Further, it will expressly prevent vendors which sell year 2000 remediation products from taking advantage of unknowing customers by making the protections of the bill unavailable to any seller of these products who does not inform in writing any entity, including businesses, governments, and non-profit organizations, that its legal rights under state law are reduced by this bill. By imposing a higher duty of care in these instances, failures will be prevented. 
Since my concerns have been addressed, I support immediate passage of this bill.

Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, the Senate today will vote on whether to invoke cloture on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

Madam President, I request that I be allotted 20 minutes of our time.

Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I want to make sure that we reserve plenty of time for the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who is really in many ways the author of this legislation and has been such a guiding light and firm supporter for so long a period of time. 
Article II, section 2 of the Constitution provides that 
The President shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law, but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or the heads of departments. 
This is an important provision of the Constitution's system of checks and balances. 
The Supreme Court, in 1997, said that the appointments clause `is more than just a matter of etiquette or protocol; it is among the significant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme.' By requiring the participation of the Senate with the President and selecting officers, the framers believed that persons of higher quality would be appointed than if one person alone made those appointments. 
One of the ways in which those persons would be better would be in respecting individual liberties. 
So the appointments clause serves to protect better government administration and the rights of the American people. 
The appointments clause was also adopted because manipulation of official appointments was one of the revolutionary generation's greatest grievances against executive power. 
As participants in the appointments process, we Senators have an obligation, I believe, to ensure that the appointments clause functions as it was designed, and that manipulation of executive appointments not be permitted. Nonetheless, we also need to recognize that despite the appointments clause, there will be times when officers die or resign in office. Their duties should continue to be performed by someone else on a temporary basis. It may not be possible as a matter of logistics that each temporary official serving as an acting officer in a position subject to the appointments clause will 
himself or herself receive Senate confirmation. Early Congresses recognized the need for persons to serve temporarily in advice and consent positions when vacancies arose, even when the person had not received Senate confirmation. 
The Vacancies Act has existed one way or another since then, with length of temporary service increasing to 120 days in legislation that was passed in 1988. The 1886 Vacancies Act was intended to provide the exclusive means for filling temporary appointments. And it has operated that way for several years. 
However, in 1973, the Justice Department, in seeking to appoint a temporary FBI Director in the midst of the Watergate scandal, appointed L. Patrick Gray without complying with the terms of the Vacancies Act. The Department for the first time made a public declaration that its organic statute created an alternative method for designating temporary appointments at the Department of Justice not subject to any time limit was there position. Since 1973 the Department has continued to make acting appointments outside the strictures of the Vacancies Act. 
The Justice Department relies on its organic statute's `vesting and delegation' provision, which states that the Attorney General can designate certain other powers to whomever she chooses in the Department, since specific statutory functions were not given to the subordinate officials. The Department makes this claim although current law states that a 
. . . temporary appointment . . . to perform the duties of another under the Vacancies Act . . . may not be made otherwise than as provided by the Vacancies Act. 
But the Justice Department's organic statute was designed simply to coordinate all Federal Government litigation, and did not change the Vacancies Act. 
The legislative history of the Department's organic statute confirmed this. In 1988, Congress, recognizing that the Justice Department was not applying the Vacancies Act as Congress clearly intended, sought to amend the act to make it more clear. They changed the law to eliminate this unsupported position of the Justice Department largely through the efforts of Senator John Glenn of Ohio. The Department of Justice, however, refused to read the language as Congress intended, relying on its same old arguments. 
As a result, the Department of Justice believes that the Attorney General can designate acting officers for 2 or even 3 years. The head of the Criminal Division--an important position with respect to guidance in Federal prosecutions, including independent counsel--was vacant for 2 1/2 years without a nomination. 
An acting Solicitor General served an entire term at the Supreme Court, and no nomination for the position was ever sent to the Senate. Even the administration claims that an acting person can serve for only 120 days. But after an acting person served for 181 days, the administration designated another person to serve as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
Today all 14 Departments have similar language in their organic statutes. Now many Departments, at DOJ's urging, are claiming similarly that the Vacancies Act doesn't apply to them either as an exclusive means for filling vacancies. 
There is no time limit on temporary services. That has been adhered to under the organic statutes, making both the Vacancies Act and the appointments clause effective nullities, according to the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General disagrees with the Justice Department's reading of current law, and all of the other Departments who have tagged along after the Justice Department. 
Each Department has at least one temporary officer now who has served longer than 120 days, allowed by the Vacancies Act. The nomination should be able to be sent to the Senate within 4 months. Since the President lacks any inherent authority to make appointments for offices that require Senate confirmation, the President's noncompliance with the Vacancies Act means noncompliance with the Constitution. 
As of earlier this year, when the Governmental Affairs Committee held its hearing on oversight of the Vacancies Act, of the 320 executive Department's advice and consent positions, 64 were held by temporary officials. Of the 64, 43 served longer than 120 days before a nomination was even submitted to the Senate. Other Departments are following Justice's lead. 
The acting head of the Census Bureau is neither the first assistant, nor a person who has been confirmed by the Senate, which is what the Vacancies Act currently requires. 
Of the nine vacant advice and consent positions at Commerce, seven have been filled by acting officers for more than 120 days. And one had been acting temporarily for 3 years. 
It is true that the Senate has not always acted on nominees as soon as it should. But that issue should be addressed separately. 
Many of the criticisms of the Senate's handling of the nominations is unwarranted since vacancies often remain open for lengthy periods before nominations are submitted. 
The Senate is now being publicly criticized for holding up the confirmation of Richard Holbrooke to be the U.N. Ambassador, for example, when in fact the administration has not even submitted his nomination to the Senate. The fact is that the administration is under a current statutory duty to have acting officers serve for 120 days, which can be extended simply by the administration sending the Senate a nominee. 
That means that if the Senate does not act it has to bear the responsibility for an acting person's service at that point. Responsibility is clearly placed where it belongs if an acting person continues to serve. But since the administration does not follow existing law, the Senate in many instances never gets a chance to even consider a permanent nominee. 
Under the administration's view, the entire set of confirmed officials in our Government could resign the day after they were confirmed, and acting officials who have not received the advice and consent of the Senate can run the Government indefinitely. 
That situation is completely at odds with what constitutional scheme and the framers created to protect individual liberties. 
There is another reason this bill should be enacted--the Court ruling recently that undermines the Vacancies Act further. Under the current law, if a vacancy in a covered position occurs, the first assistant to that officer becomes the acting officer for up to 120 days. In the alternative, the President can designate another Senate confirmed officer to act as the acting officer for 120 days. The 120 days can be extended if the President submits a permanent nominee for the position to the Senate. That creates an incentive for the President to submit nominations to the Senate. Recent court interpretations have greatly confined the operation of the Vacancies Act. 
In March, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit approved the legality of actions taken by an acting director of the Office of Thrift Supervision who had served for 4 years without a nomination for the position ever having been submitted to this body. The Senate-confirmed director resigned in 1992 and purported to delegate all of his authority to OTS' deputy director for Washington operations. This person, who was neither the first assistant nor the Senate-confirmed individual, served as the acting director until October 1996. 
The President then invoked the Vacancies Act to designate a confirmed HUD official to serve as the acting director and submitted the nomination to the Senate for the position within 120 days. The bank challenging the legality of the acting officer's appointment argued that the 120 days had expired 120 days after the Senate-confirmed director's resignation created a vacancy, long before the Senate-confirmed person was named the acting officer. But the Court held that the 120 days is a limitation only on how long an acting officer can serve, not a limitation on how soon after the vacancy arises that the President must submit a nomination. 
It allowed the later Senate-confirmed director to ratify the actions of the prior acting director. Thus, if there is no first assistant, the President can wait for 4 years to send a nomination to the Senate while an acting official, in this case selected by the head of the agency, not the President, runs an important agency. This is not what the framers thought that they had established. It runs contrary to the Vacancies Act itself and corrective action therefore is necessary. 
In any case, this administration, as stated above, has allowed many acting officers to serve for more than 120 days as permitted by the Vacancies Act without submitting a nomination to the Senate. The Vacancies Act presently has no enforcement mechanism, so once again the Senate's constitutional advice and consent prerogative is undermined. In Federalist Paper 76 Hamilton cautioned that:  
A man, who had himself the sole disposition of offices, would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body; and that body, an entire branch of the legislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in proposing. 
So by disregard of the Vacancies Act and installing at its sole disposition numerous officials to important positions in the Government who escape the independent body's review is contrary to the original intent of the framers. Without a possibility of rejection, there is much less care taken in the proposing. S. 2176 will restore the constitutional balance and cloture should be invoked on the bill. 
Madam President, let me briefly discuss the provisions of S. 2176. Upon the death, resignation or inability to serve of an officer of an executive Agency, the first assistant to the officer becomes the acting officer subject to the bill's time limits. Because of additional background processing that is now required of nominees, the bill proposes lengthening the time of acting service from the current 120 days to 150 days. 
If the President so directs, a person who has already received Senate confirmation to another position can be made the acting officer in lieu of the first assistant. This is basically the framework, Madam President, that is currently the law except we are extending the time period that the President has within which to make his decision. The first assistant has to have served 180 days in the year preceding the vacancy in order to be the acting officer, in order for someone to be put in in a very short period of time to be the first assistant so that they may then be appointed the acting officer. 
The acting officer may serve 150 days beginning on the date the vacancy occurs. The acting officer may continue to serve beyond 150 days if the President submits a nomination for the position even if that occurs after the 150th day. So at the 150-day expiration, the President still has it within his sole discretion to make the nomination; just simply send the nomination up and the acting officer can come back once again and assume his duties. If a first or second nomination is withdrawn, rejected, or returned, the person can serve as the acting officer until 150 days after the withdrawal, rejection, or return. 
Recognizing the large number of positions that are to be 
filled in a new administration, the bill extends the 150-day period by 90 days for any vacancies that exist when a new President is inaugurated or that arise in the 60 days following a new Presidential inauguration. 
The bill will extend the provisions of the Vacancies Act to cover all advice and consent positions in executive Agencies except those that are covered by express specific statute that provide for acting officers to carry out the functions and duties of the office. Forty-one current statutes now allow the President or the head of an executive Department to designate or provide automatically for a particular officer to become an acting officer. The bill also exempts multimember commissions, and it retains holdover provisions of current law. 
The bill expressly states that vesting and delegation statutes do not constitute statutes that govern the appointment of acting officers to specific positions. The bill will thus end the specious argument of the Justice Department that it and other Departments' organic statutes provide an additional means, and really a superseding means of appointing acting officials apart from the Vacancies Act. 
The bill also creates an enforcement mechanism for the Vacancies Act, something that is also sorely needed. Today, acting officers regularly exceed the 120-day limitation without consequence. Under 2176, an office becomes vacant if 150 days after the vacancy arises no Presidential nomination for the position has been submitted to the Senate. For offices other than the heads of Agencies, the functions and duties that are specifically to be performed only by the vacant officer can be performed by the head of that particular agency. That means that all functions and duties of every position can be performed at all times. But if a nomination is not submitted within the Vacancies Act period, only the head of the Agency can perform the specific duties of the vacant offices. Hopefully, that will create an incentive for the President to go ahead and submit a nomination. As soon as the nomination is submitted, the acting officer can then resume performing the duties and functions of the vacant office. No one may ratify any actions taken in violation of the bill's vacant office provisions. 
Madam President, this approach will not penalize the acting person in any way, but it will encourage the submission of nominees within 150 days without jeopardizing the performance of any Government function if that deadline is missed. 
The Vacancies Reform Act also establishes a reporting procedure. Each Agency head will report to the General Accounting Office on the existence of vacancies, the person serving in an acting capacity, the names of any nominees, and the date of disposition of such nominee. The Comptroller General will then report to the Congress, the President, and the Office of Personnel Management on the existence of any violations of the Vacancies Act. This will provide useful information to the President so he will know the progress of the 150-day clock and will benefit the Senate as well. 
This bill has been modified to take into account objections raised by members of the committee and elsewhere as well as the administration. In committee, we lengthened the Presidential transition period. We permitted the President to name an acting officer by submitting a nomination even after the 150-day period has expired. We agreed to consider shortening the length of service prior to the vacancy a first assistant must satisfy to become an acting officer. This bill is institutional and not partisan. Members should vote for cloture in recognition of the fact that the Senate and the Presidency will not always be controlled by the parties that control these institutions today, and in recognition of the duty that we all share to uphold the Constitution and protect the legitimate prerogatives of this institution. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I have a couple of points. With regard to the desire for symmetry, I point out that the symmetry and the balance are provided for in the Constitution itself. It is not symmetrical to take a constitutional provision and our constitutional duties, on the one hand, and equate it with legislation that people might be for or against, on the other. The Constitution provides that the President has the power to make the appointment, but only with the advice and consent of the Senate. It is part of our separation of powers, part of our checks and balances. Therein is the balance. 
What we have today is a situation where the President, the current President, as Presidents in the past, has made nominations and figured out ways around the prerogatives of the Senate. We are in a situation today where we are not doing our duty. The U.S. Senate is not doing its duty in upholding its right and protecting and preserving its right. 
We can bring this matter back. We cannot have cloture and bring this matter back time and time again. But we must recognize, with the provision, of course, of being able to offer germane amendments, we must recognize that this situation is ongoing. We can debate legislation at any time. If it is deemed desirable to put a time limit on the U.S. Senate to consider appointments, we can debate that. 
I think it is very bad legislation. As most Senators, I think, know, there is more than one reason why nominations languish up here sometimes. Sometimes they languish for very good reasons. Sometimes it is an attempt to work with the White House with regard to someone who has problems. Instead of just saying no and sending it back or telling them to take it back, we find ways to work around the problems we have. There are many reasons why that would be bad legislation, but it is something that can be considered at any time. 
We have had this vacancies situation with us about 130 years now in terms of this legislation, and there are all kinds of things that can be added to it at this date, that it would probably be better if it were considered separately and invoke cloture today so we can address a problem that is really important in terms of the constitutional responsibilities of this body. 
With regard to the other objections of the bill and talking about that this is too confining on the front end, actually we either are continuing practices that have been with us for 130 years or we are making them more liberal. We are giving the President greater leeway. We are giving him 150 days instead of 120 under current law. If we do not pass this legislation, he will keep 120 days instead of the 150 we are trying to give him. People are concerned about a new President coming in. We have added an additional 90 days to the 150 days in which a new President will have to make his nominations. We also added another liberalizing provision that, if he lets the 150 days expire and then there is a period of time and then he makes the nomination, the acting person can go back and resume his duties. These are all liberalizing provisions. 
I understand the need to consider amendments. I was hoping that the possibility of germane amendments would get us through this, in light of the fact that we have spent a lot of time working on a bipartisan basis and making several changes. 
We have made changes since this legislation was introduced to allow the President to cure a vacancy by sending up a nomination even after 150 days; by modifying the exclusion provision to exclude chief financial officers, for example; to allow a 150-day period when it expires during a recess to be extended to the second day after the Senate reconvenes; to reduce from 180 days to 90 days the length of time a first assistant held that position and can be eligible to be a nominee; extended the transitional period following a new President's inauguration, as I said, from 180 days to 240 days. In most of these cases, we have worked out on a bipartisan basis extensions and liberalizations from what is the current law. 
While there would not be an opportunity to offer relevant amendments that are not germane, I suggest that this is something whose time has come and that we would be doing a disservice if we did not go ahead and move this legislation--something that, as I say, has to do--it is not just a normal piece of legislation, it has to do with the carrying out of our constitutional duties. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. A couple quick points. 
My friend from Connecticut makes good points, as usual. I point out, though, that the concern about, someone could not be a first assistant if they had not been there for so many days, that would not keep them from being the acting officer. If they were appointed to the permanent position, they would have needed to have been there for 90 days. But just to be the acting officer, anyone who serves in that position would become the acting officer without having been there any length of time. 
With regard to the second concern with regard to a new administration, my understanding is there is always a holdover person who is a Senate-confirmed person who traditionally takes care of those problems--essentially the same situation we have had for the last 130 years with regard to those concerns, I believe. 
I yield the Senator from West Virginia the remainder of my time, which I think is probably 2, 3 minutes.

Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin very much. 
Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment. I do so not only because of what I believe to be the inherent merits of the amendment but because I think it has broader implications for us today in the times that we live in. 
We have had good times in this country for some time now--economically, we have low unemployment, we have low inflation, and we have prosperity. When we look abroad, we have had peace. We are the lone remaining superpower in the world. 
It seems that during times like this, Washington becomes irrelevant to a lot of people, and in some ways perhaps that is good. But we are not very mindful of the need for leadership in times of trial and times of trouble. But the fact of the matter is that in more recent times we have seen the beginnings of such times of peril and trouble. Many people think that we have some serious chickens coming home to roost and that both peace and prosperity are at issue now. 
As we look at what is going on in this country and the fact that we cannot forever remain the only buying nation in a world of sellers--that we cannot be immune to what is going on in the Pacific rim, the Soviet Union, perhaps Japan and South America, and the troubling economic conditions there--we cannot forever be immune, and our economy cannot be immune, from what is going on in the rest of the world. 
We see, as we broaden our perspective, a foreign policy that is in shambles in many respects. We see that we are losing the respect in many ways that the United States has had around the world. It is evidenced by our troubled coalition with regard to Iraq. It is evidenced by a very, very troubling policy with regard to Iraq where the credibility of the Nation's leading figures is at issue. 
It is at issue when you look at a country such as North Korea, with whom we are supposed to have a nuclear understanding and agreement, as they send missiles across our ally in Japan. We are told by the Rumsfeld Commission that rogue outlaw nations are going to have the capability within just a few years of launching a missile containing biological or nuclear or chemical weapons to hit the continental United States. 
So all of this is before us now, and the American people, I think, are going through somewhat of a period of readjustment in their thinking because we have not only that, but we have very much of a troubled Presidency. We have seen for some time now that while nobody has been paying much attention to a lot of these things, the level of cynicism continues to go up in this country. 
We see the Pew report, for example, which shows that our confidence in the leadership in this country is low. We see that this lack of confidence is even greater among our young people. A lot of people used to attribute the growing cynicism and lack of confidence in many respects--and it is somewhat affected by the economy as it goes up and down--but fundamentally the cynicism grows and lot of people say because of Watergate, because of Iran Contra, because of various other things, the assassinations of one generation that we saw, Dr. King and the President, and so forth, but what we are seeing now in these reports is that the cynicism and the concern is the greatest among our young people who have never witnessed or had to experience many of these things. So it makes it even more troubling. 
So all of this goes to the point of now that we see the need for strong leadership, after we have done so much to destroy the confidence that the American people ought to be having in the leadership of this country, who is going to listen to our leaders? I have been saying for well over a year now that with peace and prosperity we can go on autopilot for a little bit. But if our people continue to be distrustful of their own Government and the cynicism levels rise, especially among our young people, when that pendulum swings back, as it invariably does, and we no longer have peace and we no longer have prosperity, where is the leadership going to be, and who is going to follow the leadership of those of us in Washington who stand up and say here is the way; here is what we need to do; this is the way out of this problem. We have been in problems before, and we can get out of this one if you follow us. Who is going to follow us? 
That is the question yet to be answered. We do not know what we have done to our institutions, in many cases by our own actions, in many cases for other reasons, but we don't know the answer to that. And when the tough times come, as they invariably will in the short term or the long term, I only hope that we are strong enough in our institutions, in the Presidency, in the Congress, and the respect for our court system to be able to lead the American people. 
Mr. President, that is why this issue that we are discussing today is doubly important. It has to do with the very fundamentals of our Government. It has to do with the way we finance campaigns in this country, the way we elect the elected leaders who in turn are supposed to lead us when we need that leadership. I must say, in my opinion, we now have the worst campaign finance system that we have ever had in this country. In fact, you cannot call it a campaign finance system at all. It is a situation that is an open invitation to abuse. It is an open invitation to corruption. It is an open invitation to cynicism. And after the scandal of the 1996 campaign, if we do not do something about it, the level of cynicism that I talked about earlier, I think, is going to be even higher. 
If people think that we have gotten over the hump and everyone loves Congress now, you wait until that economy dips just a little bit; it will come back to the trend it has been following for a long, long time. It is a scandal waiting to happen. It is a system that after all this time has come to the point where there is no limitation on big corporate contributions or big labor contributions, and we are spending more and more and more time going after more and more money from fewer and fewer people who have the millions of dollars that is fueling our system, the same people who come back before us wanting us to either pass or defeat legislation. 
Mr. President, I have said ever since I have been in the Senate, I say here again today, that is a system that cannot last. That is an inherently defective system that cannot last over any period of time. So now because of that system, everybody is onto it and the race is on, and we are seeing the millions go to tens of millions and the tens of millions go to the hundreds of millions being put in by the large corporations and the large labor unions and the large vested interests that have those kinds of dollars. 
It makes me wonder how the small donor, which has been the bedrock of my party, perceives himself in all this. We are not getting enough checkoff on the tax returns in the Presidential system right now, and that is probably going to fail. Voter turnout is getting down there now with some of the banana Republics, and I think part of that has to be due to the fact that in a system that I have just described the average person does not see that it has a whole lot to do with him or with her. 
The ironic part about it is that this is not even a system that we created in Congress. We could not. No one would ever come in here and offer a piece of legislation that would create the system that we have today. We can discuss that a little bit further in a moment. 
We have had a lot of good discussion about the details of the amendment and the details of the legislation and some discussion about the broader principles involved, but the crux of it all has to do with whether or not we think it is a good idea to have unlimited corporate, labor, and individual contributions to political candidates and to incumbents and to have those contributors come in and try to get legislation passed after they have given us all that money. I think asking the question answers it. When you put it out like that, I think it answers itself. I think the answer is, no, we do not want that even though that is what we have. 
Why do I say that I think we do not want that when people seem to be so afraid of reform? Well, it is because throughout our entire history we have indicated that we do not want that because we ourselves learn some things sometimes from history, and we look around the world and we see that almost 2,000 years ago scholars were saying that this is the sort of thing that brought down the Roman Empire. The Venetians imposed strict limitations on contributions and money that would go to public officials. 
In their system, if donors had favors to ask, they were not allowed to give anything. 
We have seen that political influence money brought down entire political systems in times past in Japan and Italy. We have seen corruption in South Korea and Mexico. It is all around us--at the end of the last century, influence buying scandals; the Watergate; campaign finance scandal--time and time again. 
So, we have seen that. And we also understand that it is a potential problem from our real world experience. People are sometimes surprised that a conservative Republican like myself would feel strongly about campaign finance reform, and they say: Why would that be? I say for the same reason Barry Goldwater was for campaign finance reform. We will talk about that in a minute, too. 
But I think it has more to do with the fact that up until 3 or 4 years ago I was not involved in the political system, I was not running for office or holding office. But I did prosecute cases. I did defend cases. And I am very familiar with the idea that if you have people making decisions, you have to be very careful about how those decisions are influenced. If you are a purchasing agent, for example, you cannot take favors from someone from whom you are considering to buy something. If you are a loan officer at a bank, you cannot take favors from people whom you are considering for a loan. People get prosecuted for things like that all day, whether or not it was the real reason that the loan was made. The point being--the analogy is not perfect--but the point being, we have always been very concerned about that. We have gratuity laws in this country where, regardless of whether or not it bought anything, there are some people under some circumstances that you cannot give gifts to, because we are very mindful of the appearances of that. 
We even do that with regard to our own activities. We passed gratuity laws that pertain to the Congress so now a friend cannot buy you dinner. He can go out here and raise $100,000 for a committee and, in turn, it will go to your benefit, he can bundle a few hundred thousand dollars for you, but he cannot buy you dinner. So at least we are paying some lip service to the idea that we have to be somewhat mindful of money going to those who are in positions of decisionmaking power. 
We recognized that in 1907 when, as a Congress, as a nation, we prohibited corporate contributions. We recognized it again in 1943 when, in the same manner, we prohibited labor contributions and set up political action committees. We recognized it further as a Congress when we set up the current system of $1,000 limitations and $5,000 limitations on PACs, and so on and so forth. 
You can argue over the amounts. I certainly think those amounts now are ridiculously low. They ought to be raised. The hard money limits ought to be raised. That is a debate for another time. But the fact of the matter is, we have been mindful of that. We addressed that. We always said, in this country, it is a bad idea to have wealthy individuals being able to give large amounts of money, unlimited amounts of money, to politicians. It is a bad idea to have big corporations who are usually involved in government contracts giving unlimited amounts to politicians or big labor unions. Yet that is what we have. 
By the same token, we are mindful of that, especially with regard to our Presidential campaigns and our Presidential elections. That is why we set up a public finance system for our Presidential elections. It is in shambles now because we have an Attorney General who is not doing her job and has a singular, a unique way of interpreting laws. But the fact of the matter is, we set up a system to take our candidates for President out of the money grubbing system. If you agree to take public financing, then you get public money, and the public, the taxpayers, were willing to run those campaigns on their own money, on their dime, in order to keep their candidates above and separate and apart from having to raise large amounts of money from these large contributors. 
We have always been mindful that large amounts of money and the decisionmaking of government are things that we have to be very, very careful about. We do allow some contributions. We do have a system--it takes money to run campaigns and all of that. We can argue over the amounts and so forth. But hardly ever has anybody, really, in this country, carried on a serious debate espousing the idea that all bets ought to be off, that any big corporation or any big labor union could give any amount that they wanted to regardless of whether or not they had legislation pending. 
So, if that is the case, how in the world did we get to where we are today, where, I say, there are no limitations anymore? You have to jump through a few hoops and you have to be hypocritical--which is no big hurdle to overcome--and you have to run it through the right kind of committee and so forth, and you have to word the ad a little bit correctly, and a few other things that 100 years from now we will look back on--somebody 
will look back on, and laugh at, as to how we ever had a deal like this. 
But essentially, whether you are running for President now--under the Attorney General's current interpretation, running for President now or to be a Member of Congress or a Member of the U.S. Senate, you can basically take any amount of money or get the benefit from any amount of money from anywhere, including the other side of the world. That has not been fully pushed yet, but I assure you, unless things change, that will be the next shoe to drop. There are people arguing in courts in this country right now that there is no limitation, under current law, on foreign contributions--foreign soft money contributions to our political parties. So that is the next step. 
So, how did we get here? If Congress, if we as a people, have always been mindful of this problem and Congress has legislatively set up a restrictive framework, then how did we get to where we are? It is really pretty simple when you distill it all down. It happened over a period of time, but essentially the FEC, Federal Election Commission, decided to open up a little soft money crack and said parties can use a little soft money in their party-building activities. Then they went a little bit further and said parties can use some soft money, a certain percentage of soft money, in their TV issue ads. 
And what happened then? The Clinton-Gore campaign took that crack and ran a Sherman tank through it and basically said, not only are we going to do that, but we are going to totally coordinate that entire activity so it will not be independent at all, and that we will sign the certification that we will take public financing and raise no more money, but we will really pretend like this is not money for our campaign.

Mr. THOMPSON. All right. I was not aware that there was a time agreement. So I apologize for the necessarily abbreviated nature of the rest of my remarks, which basically have to do with the fact that we have an interpretation now by the Attorney General which permits that. 
Therein lies part of the problem of those who advocate for campaign finance reform, because those who advocate it in many cases have lost the high ground. The President certainly lost the high ground because of his behavior, and I must say that after our congressional hearings on this subject where we saw foreign money coming in, people taking the fifth amendment, unlimited access to the White House, shakedowns with regard to American Indians and Buddhist nuns, use of the White House, setting people up in positions with classified information, and then raising money and all of the coverups attendant to that, while we need to address that from a campaign finance standpoint for the future, we have not adequately addressed what has gone on in the past. 
When we look around for blame to assess with regard to the fact we can't move this legislation, we have to come to terms with the fact that those who want to reform cannot be content with saying all we need is reform and forget about the past. We have not adequately addressed the past. Those who have let those things go by without blowing the whistle on them, without seeing anything wrong, without saying that is wrong conduct, as we saw for the last year in this country in our hearings, have lost the moral high ground with regard to this legislation. 
I am hoping we can do better in the future. I think those of us who want reform have to understand, yes, we need to clean up the past, but we cannot let this hold us hostage for what we need to do in the future. Those of us who promote campaign finance reform need to understand that before we can really have it, we have to have justice for the past. I thank the President and yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, last May, in the wake of India's nuclear weapons tests, the Senate rejected by one vote a motion to allow us to consider the need for a national missile defense. At that time I came to the floor and urged my colleagues to support defending our nation against missile attack. I recalled how the President, in his State of the Union address, underscored the importance of foresight and the need to prepare `for a far off storm.' The President wasn't talking about weapons proliferation and national missile defense, but I suggested he should have been--and that the thunder clouds of proliferation were gathering. 
Since that vote in May, the storm has picked up force and is not so `far off.' That weapons proliferation is a serious threat to our nation is more obvious today that even a few month ago. 
Allow me to remind my colleagues of a few developments since the Senate last considered missile defense: 
Following India's nuclear tests, Pakistan conducted six of its own tests. The South Asian subcontinent--rife with smoldering disputes--is now perched on the edge of a nuclear arms race. 
The following month, in June, North Korea blatantly announced that it was selling, and would continue to sell, ballistic missiles to any and all comers. The only requirement is cash on the barrel-head. 
In July, the Congress received stark warning of our under-preparedness from the Rumsfeld Commission. This distinguished, bi-partisan, group of experts concluded that our assessment of the missile threat to America was inadequate, and that hostile countries were closer to developing and deploying ballistic missiles than we thought. As if to prove the Rumsfeld Commission right, Iran test-launched its Shahab-3 missile that same month. This weapon was based on a North Korean design and updated with Russian and Chinese assistance. It is capable of striking U.S. allies and troops in the Middle East. Iran also continues its work on the Shahab-4, which will be able to reach central Europe. 
Then, just a few weeks ago, North Korea test-launched its Taepo-Dong 1 missile--and they shot it right over our key ally, Japan. The Taepo-Dong 1 is a huge breakthrough for North Korea. It is a multi-stage rocket that puts North Korea over a critical technology threshold. Their next missile, already under development, is the Taepo-Dong 2 which will be capable of striking American shores. 
When I spoke on this subject in May, I cautioned that developments such as these were on the horizon. Indeed, I noted a few of them specifically. But I truly did not expect to stand here this soon and recount that so many dangerous developments actually occurred. My friends, the past few months demonstrate that the threats from weapons of mass destruction and missiles with increasingly greater range are an imminent threat. We have consistently underestimated that threat and must proceed with development and deployment of a national missile defense as soon as possible. 
I do not know if there will be another proliferation development to report this month. Given the recent track record, it's very likely there will be. It's certain that missile development in hostile countries will continue apace. Moreover, world events are becoming more and more chaotic each day. The instability in Russia and Asia and the continuing proliferation activities of countries like China and North Korea only heightens the prospect that dangerous weapons technology will be sold to rogue actors. 
President Clinton was recently quoted in the press that requiring certification regarding other countries' actions only creates the need for the Administration to `fudge' its reporting. More recently, it appears the Administration took an active role to limit weapons inspections in Iraq, despite all its rhetoric to the contrary. Mr. President, events like these are highly worrisome because they suggest the President is less than forthcoming to the American people, to our allies and to our foes on issues of national defense and foreign policy. Perhaps even more worrisome, however, is the possibility that Administration policy makers may be fooling themselves. In the case of missile defense, this appears to be so. Their defense policy is based on hollow rhetoric and delusion. It is based on the hope of a three-year advanced warning. My friends, we're receiving our warnings now--over and over again. It's time to act. 
It's time to wake up and it's time to act. The technology to develop nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is widely available. If we do not prepare today, when the day arrives that America is paralyzed by our vulnerability to ballistic missile attack, or when an attack actually occurs, we will be reduced to telling the American people--and history--that we had hoped this would not happen. We will have to say we had ample evidence of a growing threat, but did not act for whatever reason. 
Mr. President, if we're going to err on this issue, we should err on the side of caution. If our choices are to deploy a missile defense either too early or too late, let's make it early. The first step in raising our guard is to pass S. 1873, the American Missile Protection Act, and commit the United States to a policy of deploying national missile defenses.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Federalism Enforcement Act, a bill to promote the principles of federalism and to restore the proper respect for State and local governments and the communities they serve. I am pleased that Senators Nickles, Craig, Thurmond, and Hutchinson have joined me as cosponsors of this legislation. 
Federalism is the cornerstone of our Democracy. It is the principle that the Federal Government has limited powers and that government closest to the people--States and localities--play a critical role in our governmental system. Our Founding Fathers had grave concerns about the tendency of a central government to aggrandize itself and thus encroach on State sovereignty, and ultimately, individual liberty. Federalism is our chief bulwark against Federal encroachment and individual liberty. Our Founders also knew that keeping decision making powers closer to home led to more accountable and effective government. Their federalist vision is clearly reflected in the 10th amendment, which states: 
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. 
The legislation I am introducing today requires agencies to respect this vision of federalism when formulating policies and implementing the laws passed by Congress. It will preserve the division of responsibilities between the States and the Federal Government envisioned by the Framers of the Constitution and established in Executive order by President Ronald Reagan. 
The Reagan order on federalism had it right. It directed Federal departments and agencies to refrain from imposing one-size-fits-all regulation on the States. It held that the laws passed by Congress were not presumed to preempt State law unless done so explicitly. It required agencies to assess the impact of agency action on federalism. But the people running the executive branch today, from the top on down, do not seem to feel the Reagan order applies to them. They made this abundantly clear when they tried to revoke it with Clinton Executive Order 13083. 
In May, President Clinton quietly signed Executive Order 13083, which by its terms claims to promote federalism. Ironically, this order that is supposed to promote better communication between Federal and local government was issued in secret--without even talking to State and local officials at all. Worse still, the order would seriously undermine federalism and effectively turn the 10th amendment on its head. The Reagan Executive Order 12612 promoted the 10th amendment and set a clear presumption against Federal meddling in local affairs. The new Clinton order would create, but not be limited to, nine new policy justifications for Federal meddling. The list is so ambiguous that it would give Federal bureaucrats free rein to trample on local matters. The new Clinton order also would revoke President Clinton's own 1993 Executive Order 12875 that directed Federal agencies not to impose unfunded mandates on the States. 
Understandably, State and local officials were deeply offended by the Clinton order and the White House snub in drafting it. On July 17, the major groups representing State and local officials sent a remarkable letter to the President, urging him to withdraw the order and to restore the Reagan federalism order and the 1993 unfunded mandates order. On July 22, several of my colleagues and I supported State and local officials by sponsoring a resolution calling on President Clinton to repeal his new order. That resolution passed the Senate unanimously. The House also has voiced opposition to the Clinton order. Congressman McIntosh held a hearing, and joined with six of his colleagues to introduce a bill nullifying Executive Order 13083. 
The White House had a chance to extinguish the firestorm of protest from Governors, State legislators, mayors, county executives, and other local officials around the country by permanently revoking Executive Order 13083. Instead, the White House chose to preserve some wiggle room by `suspending' the order on August 5, leading some to ask if that action is permanent or just an effort to delay the order until the opposition dies down. If the President can admit that he made a mistake in signing his federalism order, he should permanently revoke it, plain and simple. 
Unfortunately, the White House has yet to correct its insult to State and local officials and the communities they serve. Instead of revoking the Clinton order, the administration is preparing for belated consultations with State and 
local government representatives. This effort at damage control does not hide the fact that the Clinton order is an open invitation for Federal interference in local affairs, and in the administration's eyes, it is still on the table. 
In light of this threat to the tenth amendment principle of a limited Federal Government, Congress must stand ready to act. The Federalism Enforcement Act is necessary to ensure that the current administration exercises some restraint when regulating in areas that affect our States and communities, and respects the principles of State sovereignty and limited Federal Government on which our Nation was founded. 
First, the bill directs Federal agencies to adhere to constitutional principles and not to encroach on the constitutional authority of the States. The Clinton federalism order would have shifted the presumption against Federal intervention to provide new policy justifications for Federal interference in State and local affairs. My bill returns us to the language of the Reagan order. 
Second, the bill would restore the preemption standards established in the Reagan order. The Clinton order would have encouraged Federal agencies to intrude into State affairs and deleted the Reagan preemption principle that, when in doubt, agencies should err on the side of State sovereignty. 
Third, the bill would direct agencies to prepare a federalism assessment of certain agency actions, such as regulations that have significant federalism implications. The Clinton order would have deleted this requirement. 
Finally, the Federalism Enforcement Act would express the sense of the Congress that Federal agencies should not propose legislation that would regulate the States in ways that would interfere with their separate and independent functions, attach conditions to Federal grants which are unrelated to the purposes of the grant, or preempt State law in ways inconsistent with the act. Because only the President can enforce this requirement using his article II constitutional powers, it is expressed as a resolution urging him to do so. 
The principles of federalism rightly are being reinvigorated. Much of the innovation that has improved this country began at the State and local level. People want important decisions that affect their daily lives to be made in their community--not dictated on high from Washington. And federalism is blossoming in recent constitutional interpretations of the Supreme Court. The Federalism Enforcement Act I am introducing today will continue this restoration of the balance between national and State power as conceived by the Framers of the Constitution.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to share with the Senate a courageous story about two female Tennesseans who recently succeeded in their quest to retrace a historic flight around the world. 
Nikki Mitchell and Rhonda Miles landed their single-engine Maule M-5 plane at the Lebanon, Tennessee airport on Saturday, August 22, 1998. Their trip, dubbed the `Bridge of Wings Tour,' was completed 49 days after they took off from the same airport. 
Their flight commemorates the historical achievement of three female Russian pilots. That journey, known as the `Flight of the Rodina,' was a story of courage and stamina in the tradition of Lindbergh and Earhart. It took place in 1938, when the three Russians flew non-stop from Moscow to the southeastern tip of Siberia. 
The Russian pilots flew with virtually no radio transmission, through skies so overcast no landmarks were visible, yet they broke a world record and opened up the route across Siberia. They were cheered worldwide and received their country's highest award, the Gold Star of Hero of the Soviet Union. 
Sixty years later, Nikki and Rhonda celebrated the accomplishments of the Rodina on the anniversary of its flight. A portion of their 15,000 mile trip included retracing the steps of the three Soviet women from Moscow to the southeastern tip of Siberia. And for this leg of the route they were joined by two Russian women who flew their plane side by side with the American aircraft in a unified flight of honor and goodwill. 
As they flew over Russian territory, Nikki and Rhonda were met by crowds and cheers in villages across the Russian Far East. The level of excitement was such that a commercial airline canceled a flight so its fuel could be used for the continuation of their flight. 
Before returning to Tennessee, Nikki and Rhonda were also warmly welcomed in Alaska, Canada, and Des Moines, Iowa. It goes without saying that upon arrival in Lebanon, Tennessee, they were given a welcome fit for heroes. 
Nikki and Rhonda, dressed in blue flight suits and holding flowers, couldn't contain their excitement as they stepped out of the plane. Nikki showed how happy she was to be back in the Volunteer State by immediately kissing the Tennessee soil. Also thankful to be home, Rhonda could not stop smiling as friends rushed to greet her. 
Mr. President, I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in saluting Nikki and Rhonda for their courageous journey. These Tennesseans have recreated one of history's most daring and remarkable flights. Their trip will always be remembered as an international effort to honor one of aviation's most exciting moments. I have no doubt that the example set by these women will inspire others to strive toward achieving their own ambitions and goals.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, S. 314, originally sponsored by Senators Thomas, among others, and Congressman Duncan in the House, was ordered reported by the Governmental Affairs Committee on July 15, 1998. The original S. 314 has had long and contentious past. The bill reported by our Committee represents months of drafting and redrafting to create language which truly represents a consensus. 
I commend the original sponsors of this bill for their dedication to this issue and their willingness to accommodate the Governmental Affairs Committee's changes in order to develop legislation which could be supported by all sides. Interested industry groups have expressed their support of this legislation. And the Administration and the Federal employee unions, although opposed to the original S. 314, all have indicated they will not object to this legislation.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we brought up yesterday amendment No. 3353 to the bill. Senator Harkin had a situation he had to attend to yesterday, so we set it aside for the consideration of other business. Now Senator Harkin is here. I think he will be joining us momentarily. We wanted to take advantage of the opportunity at this time to bring it up. I have been discussing this item with Senator Harkin to see if we could reach an agreement. I don't believe that we are going to be able to. 
Just basically, in summary, Mr. President, this has to do with procurement legislation. This is a very complex area. I can't think of an area that is more boring and more complex than the procurement laws. For that reason, the staff of our committee--the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction generally over the procurement laws--spent many, many hours on this subject. The last two Congresses have produced reform legislation that balances the interest in the procurement field between the government and those who are selling goods and services to the government. 
This provision, section 642 in this Treasury-Postal bill, essentially is a procurement piece of legislation. It has to do with child labor. It essentially prohibits the Government from buying from those who use child labor any goods or services produced by child labor. That is a laudable goal. I support that. My amendment incorporates that goal. I point out that it is already against the law. But it is certainly fine with me if we put in this Treasury-Postal bill another law that says we cannot procure services or goods from those who do that sort of thing. 
My problem, other than the fact that I believe the best way to legislate in this matter is to have hearings on a complex subject like this, is that it sets up a procedure that basically is overreaching and unfair, and probably unconstitutional. Because with regard to this area, as in no others, a contractor is required to sign a statement with the Government that will allow a Government official at any time at his discretion to come in and look at the books and records, or talk to the individual at any time at his discretion to see whether or not a child labor law has been violated. He should not be required to give up the fourth amendment rights in order to contract with the Government. 
As I say, trafficking in those kinds of goods and services is against the criminal law. There is provision that prohibits such immoral activity by that company when dealing with the Federal Government as it is. But it certainly does not call for an abrogation of rights that we otherwise hold near and dear. 
It says that the Secretary of Labor shall publish a list of items that might have been produced by child labor. And then the contractor has to certify that he is not using any of those items. Evidently, it is difficult to determine sometimes whether or not child labor has been used. The Government's only responsibility is to determine whether or not they might have been used. And, yet, the contractor is required to certify that they have not been used. 
I am afraid this is a Catch-22 with regard to people in good faith who are out trying to do the right thing and certainly would not consider using child labor; but would allow unlimited access and unfettered access, under the language of this statute as it is now written, and would allow any Government official to come in and have unlimited access to books and records. 
One other feature of this provision that I think is erroneous is the exception. This does not apply to countries that have signed NAFTA, for example. There are a couple of other exceptions. But I will just concentrate on that. 
If a foreign country has signed the NAFTA agreement, then presumably companies of that country do not have this law applied to them. 
We are focusing in on our own companies. We signed NAFTA. But we are focusing in on our own companies requiring this kind of intrusion with regard to our own contractors, and we are not applying the same standard to contractors of another country who might be supplying child labor. 
I don't think that is right. I don't think that is fair. I do not want to make a mountain out of a molehill. 
I think this is important. I feel a responsibility, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, to bring this to the attention of the Senate, and simply say that in matters that are this complex that require a balancing of interests, we should go through the committee process. 
Senator Glenn had a piece of legislation that we considered last year. We have had the Clinger-Cohen Act, and lots and lots of working hours put into this in trying to reach the right balance. 
We should not come in with a provision in an appropriations bill that basically upsets that balance and places new responsibilities, new requirements, new intrusions on contractors that in the wisdom of their deliberations the committees, after considering this thing for years, have not decided to do. 
I respectfully urge the support of my colleagues with regard to my amendment. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, a couple of comments with regard to the remarks of my distinguished colleague from Iowa. 
First of all, let's keep in mind my amendment makes the use of child labor grounds for disbarment and suspension. We need to keep that in mind. We set it out in bold type. It is already against the law, and now we are saying in addition to that you can't do business with the Federal Government if you engage in that kind of activity. So we get that out of the way to start with. 
That is not the issue. The issue here is whether or not we want to set up a mechanism whereby some Federal official has unlimited access to your books and records and persons. Now, this whole area was entirely rewritten in 1994. Senator Glenn's bill, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, provided for very circumspect, specific audit authorities for agencies, and GAO provided some subpoena authority in a very limited way. All this was debated and considered on a bipartisan basis and the competing interests were balanced out over a period of several days, and we came up with a law that we have now. 
What we have here in the bill that we are seeking to amend departs from that substantially. There can be no comparison with the bill currently in force with existing law. Existing law under section 2313, chapter 137, procurement generally, is so long and detailed that I am not going to burden the record by going into it, but suffice it to say that there are very limited circumstances. Only certain kinds of contracts, certain circumstances are dealt with where subpoena authority is issued under certain kinds of contracts--limited authority, over contracts over $100,000. 
Compare that with what we have before us in the bill today that says a clause that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully to provide access for it says any official--I understand that will be changed--but you must agree to provide access for some Government official of the United States to the contractors' records, documents, persons, or premises, if requested by the official, for the purpose of determining whether forced child labor is being issued. It is a total fishing expedition. You are not only going to have to give unlimited access to your books and records, but unlimited access to your person. 
There is nothing I know of like this in law, much less procurement law. We are really doing something substantially different here. We can cover the child labor situation without opening up Pandora's box and running contractors away from us. 
One of the reforms that Senator Glenn and others carried out had to do with the fact that we want to bring more contractors in. It is better for the taxpayer to have more competition, more people coming in to compete for these things. 
My distinguished friend from Iowa suggests that we need to have a certification on the front end. Prior committee action got rid of all certification under the Governmental Affairs Committee and armed services jurisdiction for the simple reason, first, if you are going to violate the law, if you are going to use child labor, you are not going to certify something on the front end. It will not make you quit doing it. 
Secondly, we got tired of raising so many hoops and intruding so much that we were discouraging people from coming in and contracting with the Government. Therefore, costs of things are higher than they ought to be. This whole area has been addressed. It cannot even be discussed in a limited period of time because it is so extensive. 
But with regard to the question of opening up books and records and persons by some anonymous Federal official to see whether or not you might have done something wrong, and when they get in there they are not limited to look just for the thing that you say they are looking for. Their eyes can gaze on whatever it is they are to be gazed upon. 
When you deal with something like that, you are dealing with very, very, important constitutional rights and nobody is going to put up with that. Nobody is going to contract or agree to do business with the Government if they have that kind of burden. It has been well thought out, it has been considered, it has been deliberated upon for a long, long time, and we should not address something this important and this complex in this fashion. 
I respectfully urge this amendment be adopted.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to strengthen the regulatory accounting provision in Section 625 of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill. This amendment would require OMB to submit a biannual report to Congress on the costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. I ask unanimous consent that Majority Leader Lott and Senators Breaux, Shelby, and Robb be added as cosponsors to my amendment. We come from different political viewpoints, but we all agree that we need to improve our regulatory system and make it more open and accountable. 
This amendment continues the effort begun by Senator Stevens, the former Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, when he passed the Stevens Regulatory Accounting Amendment on the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill in 1996. Our goal is to promote the public's right to know about regulation, increase government accountability, and to improve the quality of regulatory programs. This amendment would not change any regulation or regulatory standard. It just provides important information for smarter and more accountable regulation. 
Under the Stevens Amendment, the Office of Management and Budget issued its first regulatory accounting report to the Congress in September 1997. While this first Report was an important step toward government accountability, it left a lot to be desired. Following that first Report, Senator Stevens and I wrote to the OMB Director expressing our concern that OMB was not fully complying with the Amendment. Several members of the House sent a similar letter. In addition, the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution held a workshop reviewing the first OMB Report in the fall of 1997. At that workshop, a distinguished group of economists unanimously agreed that OMB had fallen short on the Stevens Amendment. 
Now it's time to take another step toward a more open and accountable regulatory system. This amendment would add a few simple requirements to the Stevens regulatory accounting provision to ensure that: 
Regulatory Accounting is a permanent requirement. Every two years, OMB would submit the Report with the President's budget. 
The Report is more informative. To the extent feasible, agencies would provide cost and benefit estimates for agency programs. In addition, the Report will clearly cover paperwork costs, including the large costs of complying with our Byzantine tax system. That was always supposed to be covered. 
The Report is of higher quality. OMB guidelines to the agencies and peer review will improve future reports. 
As OMB said in their first regulatory accounting Report, `regulations (like other instruments of government policy) have enormous potential for both good and harm.' Better information will help us regulate smarter--to increase the benefits of regulation while reducing needless waste and redtape. This will help ensure the success of important programs, while enhancing the economic security and well-being of our families and our communities.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment addresses a certain provision in the Postal-Treasury appropriations bill at section 642. It is a section that deals with procurement policies. It is a section that deals with a problem of goods that are produced by child labor--a problem about which we are all sensitive. I do think that this provision should not be in this bill. I offer this amendment to amend the provision, leaving in the portion that addresses the child labor issue, but taking out certain portions that I believe are clearly unconstitutional and unneeded. 
In the first place, Mr. President, this is an area of some complexity--the procurement laws and regulations of this country. It is an area that is within the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee, of which I am chairman. Our committee has spent a good deal of time dealing with this issue. We have passed legislation over the last two Congresses that deal with our procurement policies in this country. We have passed the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994--this is a provision that Senator Glenn sponsored--and we passed the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996--all dealing, at least in part, with the problem of Government procurement, and procurement practices and policies. I think, as most people who deal with this realize, it is certainly a balancing act. There are considerations that have to be given to the contractors. There are considerations certainly that have to be given to the Government--what is fair. 
We want to place reasonable requirements and restrictions with regard to the practices and policies that the Government uses when they go out and acquire goods and services, and so forth. Everyone comes in and gets a seat at the table, and we hash those things out. We have been doing that in a free and open debate for some time now. 
We discover now that with regard to this provision, instead of it going through the regular process, instead of our having debate on the issue, and instead of us having a discussion on the issue, we find that it winds up being a substantive provision with regard to policies that apply across the board and winds up as a part of this appropriations bill. I do not believe that is a good way to legislate. 
We hear a lot of times complaints about amendments on appropriations bills. But here we actually have a provision within the appropriations bill which, as I say, really substantively addresses an issue not only under the jurisdiction of the committee that has been wrestling with this problem for some time but without any really public discussion or debate. 
What does this 642 require? 
First of all, it requires that the Secretary of Labor publish a list of items that might have been produced by child labor--`might have been produced' by child labor. I am not sure whether or not there is another provision in the law that places a requirement on people based upon the determination that certain items might have had a certain origin, or anything of that nature. But be that as it may, there is nothing wrong with putting something on a list in and of itself. 
Then the provision says that the Government may not require an item on that list unless the person or company providing the goods or services certify that it was not a product of child labor. 
In other words, apparently the best the Government can do, or the requirement that the Government has, is simply to come up with whether or not an item might have been produced by child labor. But then the supplier of the goods has to certify, based on that list, that in fact it was not produced by child labor. 
Then, 642 goes on to say that the contract may be terminated based upon violation of this provision and that the contractor may be disbarred. 
So far, so good, although this is, I believe, very, very troublesome language that is used here. But so far, so good. You are debarring someone. You are terminating the contract, if there is any indication that child labor is used. 
I must point out that this activity is already not only grounds for debarment but a crime. It is already a crime to place materials produced by child labor in interstate commerce, punishable by a $10,000 fine per child employee and 6 months imprisonment. 
In addition, under 18 U.S.C. 1581, whoever holds or returns any person to a condition of peonage shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both. 
As far as the criminal law is concerned, anyone who would be in a disbarment situation would be violating a very severe criminal law. 
But, be that as it may, so we are duplicative. So what? What is the big problem with that? 
The biggest problem with all of this is not what I have been discussing so far, although as we see troublesome language duplicative, it is already a criminal act in the Federal Acquisition Regulations. It already has cause for disbarment for the commission of any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the responsibility of the Government contractor or subcontractor. 
I can't think of anything that would be more indicative of a lack of business integrity than using child labor. 
So not only do we have a criminal act prohibiting this activity, but we have a regulation now saying that you can disbar on the basis of this activity. 
But, again, as I say, so far, so good, as far as I am concerned. So we are duplicative. So we use vague language. 
The problem that is the major one in this particular section has to do with the provision that is on CB, a capital B, which says the following: That an acquisition contract has to include the following language:  
A clause that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully and provide access for any official of the United States to the contractor's records, documents, persons, or premises, if requested by the official for the purpose of determining whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any item furnished under this contract. 
I believe this is clearly unconstitutional. I know the intent was good. We all have the same intent with regard to the end result here. But we have picked out a particular area--not drug dealing, not selling faulty parts for an airplane that crashes and kills our pilots, and not faulty parts that go on machines that kill our Armed Forces--all the terrible things that could happen. 
We have picked out one and have given some Government officials, any Government official, total, unlimited access to the books, records, and persons of anyone whom they choose to exercise that with regard to. 
There is a body of law, of course, with regard to unwarranted administrative searches. Under certain circumstances, warrantless administrative searches are permissible. But we have to keep in mind that under those circumstances, under the warrant clause of the Constitution, there is no probable cause requirement. 
So these are dangerous things that the courts have said you have to be careful with, and you have to have certain requirements in the statute giving you the right to carry out these warrantless searches, if they are going to be constitutional. 
First of all, the Government needs to have a substantial interest. I think that is covered here. 
Second, the regulation of the business had to serve that interest. I am willing to concede that. 
Third, statutory safeguards are needed to provide an adequate substitute for a warrant requirement. 
We have a warrant requirement. Whether we are dealing with the most heinous criminal activity imaginable, we have generally been speaking about a warrant requirement, a due process requirement, under the Constitution. But the courts have said that if you do not have that, if you are going to carry out a warrantless administrative search, you have to have certain statutory safeguards. 
They have discussed what they are. None of them is here, Mr. President. 
First of all, there is total discretion with regard to the Government official as to which business he decides to check on that day, or which individual. There is no probable cause requirement, or no evidentiary requirement at all. He has total and complete discretion under this language to decide which business he wants to check on. 
That is constitutionally suspect from the outset, according to the court cases. 
Second, any official of the United States can do it. 
I don't know if that includes me or not, or the staff. But any official of the United States, I guess from fire marshals to officials over at the Department of Energy, or whoever. 
Third, there is no statutory procedure for challenging of the warrant at all. Some of the statutes say that if the concern refuses to consent to this kind of process, search and seizure, there is a statute, a civil provision, whereby it can be contested. That is not here. 
Lastly, it is not just the premises that we are talking about here, but it has to do with all records and documents and persons apparently that are subject to this particular provision. It is a provision that has not been applied to and cannot constitutionally be applied to the most heinous criminal activities imaginable. And although these are certainly reprehensible activities we are dealing with, they cannot amend the Constitution of the United States with regard to all of the various things for which a person or a business can be debarred. Your imagination is the only limitation as to what those things might be. There could be some very, very terrible things, as I indicated, and this is one of them. But here we have selected this particular activity and placed a burden on the supplier of Government goods that, frankly, cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. 
The bill in section 642 has an exception, and it says that this section does not apply to a contract that is for the procurement of any product, article, material or supply containing a product that is mined, produced or manufactured in any foreign country or instrumentality if the foreign country or instrumentality is a party to the agreement on Government procurement annexed to the WTO agreement. 
In other words, this provision that I have just been talking about does not apply to a foreign country if it is a party to the WTO agreement or a party to the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement. As I understand this, if a country is a party to the WTO agreement or is a signatory or a party to NAFTA, they are not covered by this, and presumably goods coming from that country would not be covered by this, so a manufacturer in a country that is a part of NAFTA or WTO presumably would not be covered by this. 
The United States of America is a party to NAFTA, but goods emanating from this country would not be covered by this. Now, I am not sure in practical terms how this would work out or what kind of problems this would present, but I do not see why companies of a foreign country should be exempted from this law when companies from this country are targeted by this law and are having these, what I believe are fairly clearly unconstitutional, requirements and burdens placed on them. 
So the proper action would be to bring this language back to the Governmental Affairs Committee and consider it in the normal course of Senate business. But the fact remains that the language is pending before the Senate so we must deal with it. 
So, Mr. President, I am offering an amendment which will give Federal agencies the ability to debar or suspend companies. And I repeat that. This will give, if there is any question--I don't think there is any question that they have the ability to do that now. It is against the Federal law, and it is provided for in the FAR. But in case there is any question about that, my amendment will give Federal agencies the ability to debar or suspend companies which use forced or indentured child labor, but in a way that is consistent with the current procurement system of the delicate balance that has been worked out which has specific regulatory history and due process requirements, and not in the vague way that this language addresses it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in expressing my sincere condolences to the families of the two Capitol Police officers who gave their lives last Friday defending the Capitol and all of us who work here, as well as the many Americans who come here from around the country to see their government in action. 
Officers J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson are American heroes in the truest sense of the word. Their actions last week unquestionably prevented a terrible tragedy from becoming even more deadly. I know I speak for every member of Congress in expressing my respect and gratitude to them, their families, and their colleagues on the Capitol Police force. 
At the first sign of trouble, Officers Chestnut and Gibson acted on instinct, doing what they were trained to do and saving lives in the process. When an event like this happens, I think many of us react according to instinct, and our instincts differ depending on the varying experiences we've had. 
As most people know by now, my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist, also acted on instinct when he heard the news of Friday's shootings. Upon returning to his office from speaking on the Senate floor and learning what had happened, Senator Frist immediately called the Capitol physician's office to see if they needed assistance, and then rushed over to the scene of the shootings to lend a hand however he could. He assisted in treating one of the two fallen police officers, administered CPR, made sure that he made it safely to a waiting ambulance--and then went back inside to treat another of the victims. After restarting this second victim's heart, he rode with him to D.C. General Hospital to ensure that, if paramedics had to open up his chest on the way to the hospital, he would be there to provide assistance or do the procedure himself. 
Mr. President, Senator Frist's actions are both a reminder of the very different routes each of us took in coming to the United States Senate, and of the importance of preserving the diversity of backgrounds that we have in this body. His instinct as a heart surgeon and trauma specialist took over last Friday, and he rushed to the scene to provide whatever help he could--just as he's done hundreds of times before when patients were relying on him. 
I want to take this opportunity to salute my colleague from Tennessee for his heroic actions last Friday, and for all of the other times he's provided medical assistance since coming to the Senate three and a half years ago. Many people will remember that a couple of years ago, one of our constituents, a man from Cleveland, Tennessee, had a heart attack in the Dirksen Building, just outside of Senator Frist's office. Senator Frist immediately came to the rescue, and saved this Tennessean's life. Now that's what I call constituent service. 
Mr. President, the events of last Friday have affected all of us very deeply. We will not soon get over the memory of the tragedy that occurred inside `the people's house' or of the heroic sacrifice made by Officers Chestnut and Gibson. Again, I want to offer to their families and Capitol Police colleagues our sincere condolences and our deepest thanks.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to ask my colleagues for their help to bring much-needed improvements to our federal regulatory system. In March, the Governmental Affairs Committee favorably reported S. 981, the `Regulatory Improvement Act,' by a 10-5 vote. At the time of the markup, the administration sent a letter to me and Senator Levin expressing a number of concerns with the bill. Over the past few months, we have worked to resolve those concerns, which largely involved adding clarifying language to the bill. In addition, some sections of the bill were modified, and a couple were dropped. On July 16, we received a letter from Jack Lew, the Acting OMB Director, on behalf of the administration. The letter says the administration supports the legislation with the proposed changes and will cooperate with us to pass it. These changes are explained in the accompanying summary of the managers' amendment that Senator Levin and I would support. I am pleased that the President recognizes that we need this legislation to deliver the effective and efficient regulatory system that the American people expect and deserve. 
Most of us recall the partisan and ultimately destructive debate on this issue in the last Congress. Reforming regulation is an area fraught with distrust. It is tempting for opponents of reform to try to score political points by scare tactics. We have to set aside political posturing if we're going to get the job done. Just last week, former Majority Leader Howard Baker told us, `it ill behooves America's leaders to invent disputes for the sake of political advantage, or to inveigh carelessly against the motives and morals of one's political adversaries. America expects better of its leaders than this, and deserves better.' I hope we heed that good advice. 
There's no doubt that improving the regulatory process is one of the toughest challenges we face. Regulation affects virtually every aspect of our lives. There are over 130,000 pages of federal regulations, and 60 agencies continue to issue new rules at a rate of 4,000 a year. The costs are hundreds of billions of dollars annually, and the public expects better results. As the costs of regulation rise with public expectations of better results, the need is greater than ever for a smarter way of regulating. We have to find ways to do more good while reducing the waste in the current system. 
The evidence is overwhelming that we can achieve greater benefits at far less cost by regulating smarter. Hearings of the Governmental Affairs Committee, investigations of the General Accounting Office, the work of other congressional committees, and many scholarly studies show a striking consensus on this point. Our Committee also has found that the administration's Executive Order 12866 and other initiatives to reinvent regulation have not been as effective as was hoped. 
I want to thank the 19 cosponsors who have joined me and Senator Levin to improve the regulatory process. The Regulatory Improvement Act will promote the public's right to know, improve the quality of government decisions, and make government more accountable to the people it serves. Ultimately, it will help improve the quality of our lives. That is why we have the support of State and local government, businesses of all sizes, farmers, educational organizations, think tanks, scholars, and the administration. We have a rare opportunity to reform the regulatory process. Let's pull together and get the job done.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment is offered to protect and preserve federalism. If there is one concept in recent years that has gained in credence, it is the concept of federalism. We have seen a lot of innovation happen in this country that has started at the State and local level. We have paid credence to it with regard to welfare reform and other measures. 
The Supreme Court, in recent years, has struck down cases based upon the tenth amendment. The tenth amendment has been reinvigorated, and I think we have come together as a nation in many respects in our belief that many of our problems need to be addressed at the State and local level, and that is what our original framers of the Constitution had in mind. Not only is it constitutionally sound but it has worked in practice. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Majority Leader Lott and Assistant Leader Nickles be added as cosponsors. They have long fought for the principles of federalism.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, in May the President issued Executive Order 13803 which purported to set out a new definition of `federalism.' However, it explicitly replaced President Reagan's Executive order on federalism and, in reality, the new order undermines federalism. 
Furthermore, it was written in secret without even any consultation with State and local officials. Every major State and local government group opposes this so-called federalism order, and they have asked the President to withdraw it. 
My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the President revoke his May 14th order and help restore the proper respect for State and local government and in our Federal system by reinstating both President Reagan's and his own prior orders on this subject. 
The Founding Fathers believed that the Federal Government had limited powers. The tenth amendment states that the powers not delegated to the States are reserved to the States or to the people. The public clearly wants important decisions to be made closer to home and not dictated from Washington, DC. 
Unfortunately, President Clinton's order will undermine federalism and promote Federal meddling into local affairs. President Clinton's order revokes President Reagan's Executive Order 12612 which was a clear commitment to the tenth amendment principles of a limited Federal Government. The new Clinton order shifts the Reagan presumption against Federal involvement in State and local matters to a presumption for Federal intervention. President Clinton's new order also revokes his own 1993 Executive Order 12875 which directed the Federal Government to avoid unfunded mandates. 
To add insult to injury, the White House never talked with State or local governments while the new order was being developed. Ironically, it was issued from England. More ironically, White House officials did not consult with local officials on an Executive order which itself calls for more consultation with local officials. In a recent Washington Post article, one anonymous White House official admitted, `This was a mistake. We screwed up.' Mr. President, I agree. 
The White House belatedly has offered to delay the order and take comments from State and local officials, but the Clinton administration has shown no willingness to rescind this order, as State and local officials have requested. 
State and local officials were understandably irritated that the White House shut them out of this process. But more importantly, they immediately saw through the rhetoric that was coming out on this matter and saw the real purpose of the Executive order. State and local officials know that the order is basically a Government power grab at the Federal level that will undercut their ability to serve the public, and that is why they are so exercised about it. 
President Clinton was asked to rescind the order by the `big seven,' as they are called--big seven State and local government groups. They include the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislature, the Council of State Governments, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the International City/County Management Association. 
Mr. President, this order will promote Federal intrusion into local decisionmaking, and it shows contempt for the ability of State and local officials to manage their own affairs. We don't want that. That is not the message that has been coming out of this Congress. That is not even the message that has been coming out from prior Executive orders by this administration, as late as 1993. 
Even though, as I say, it was promoted as a concept that would enhance federalism, and it has a lot of good language in there about the principles of federalism, when you get right down to it, it rescinds the basic presumption that when Federal agencies look at a matter, it basically presumes, unless it is very clear, that the matters should be resolved at the State and local level. That is a presumption that has worked very well for us, and I urge the adoption of this amendment.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleagues today as an original cosponsor of an exciting new proposal to reform Social Security. 
We all know that the Social Security program gets in serious financial trouble when the Baby Boomers start retiring early in the next century. The Social Security actuaries tell us that, just 15 years from now, in 2013, Social Security will begin paying out more in benefits than it receives in taxes and will have to begin redeeming the treasury bonds issued to the Trust Funds. By 2032, the Trust Funds will be exhausted, and the program will be running annual cash deficits of hundreds of billions of dollars. 
As more and more people become aware of these financial realities, Social Security has quickly ceased to be the untouchable third rail of politics. In my view, it should soon become the brass ring of politics. Entitlement reform is one of the greatest challenges our nation faces, and we should all be reaching for the solution that will enable Social Security to provide for our grandchildren like it did for our grandparents. 
Fortunately, right now we have a tremendous window of opportunity for real reform. Our economy is strong; the federal budget is balanced for the first time in 30 years; and the Congressional Budget Office is actually projecting budget surpluses each year for the next decade. Just as important, the 76 million Baby Boomers are still in the workforce paying taxes into the Social Security system. If we wait until this enormous group stops paying taxes and instead begins drawing benefits, the fixes will have to be much more severe. 
Over the past 15 months, Senators Judd Gregg and John Breaux, along with Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Charles Stenholm, have served as congressional co-chairmen for the National Commission on Retirement Policy, sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This 24-member group of politicians, businessmen, and policy experts developed and unanimously approved a broad proposal for reforming Social Security. The Senators and Congressmen then crafted bipartisan legislation based on the commission's recommendations. 
The outline of the Gregg-Breaux plan is simple. It would reduce the Social Security payroll tax by 2 percentage points and divert the money into a mandatory savings account for every worker under age 55. The accounts would supplement--not replace--benefits guaranteed through the traditional system. Workers could pick from a limited number of investment funds dealing in stocks, government bonds, or a combination of the two, much like the Thrift Savings Plan available to members of Congress and federal employees. The benefits of current retirees and workers age 55 or older would not be affected by the private accounts, and benefits to survivors of deceased workers and the disabled would also be protected. 
Meanwhile, Gregg-Breaux would make changes to the remaining pay-as-you-go system to bring it into actuarial balance. It would accelerate the scheduled increase in the retirement age, raising the age for full benefits to 70 and the age for early retirement benefits to 65 by 2029. It would reduce the Consumer Price Index by half a percentage point so that it more accurately reflects the rate of inflation, and it would scale back benefits to wealthier retirees, who are likely to fare better with their individual accounts. Unlike several of the proposals that are on the table, however, the Gregg-Breaux plan does not raise taxes, period. In fact, the payroll tax is reduced from 12.4 to 10.4 percent and never rises above 10.4 percent again. 
Some groups continue to insist that only minor adjustments are needed to put Social Security back on sound financial footing. What they often won't tell you is that all of these adjustments would either raise taxes or cut benefits. For me, it's clear that `reforming' Social Security in this way will no longer suffice. These kinds of traditional reforms were last used by the 1983 Greenspan Commission to `fix' Social Security for 75 years. Today, we know the program will be in trouble again in 2013, when tax revenues are no longer sufficient to pay promised benefits. 
Instead of taxing Americans at ever-higher rates while scaling back their retirement benefits, our goal should be to enable all workers to accumulate a level of wealth that will allow them to retire with a basic level of economic security. That's why private accounts are a central part of the plan I support. 
Private accounts would give working-class Americans the same access to the power of compound interest that the rich enjoy today. This notion terrifies those who want to keep workers as dependent on government as possible, but more and more people acknowledge that private accounts are the best way to simultaneously solve the two crises facing Social Security--the impending insolvency of the program due to enormous demographic shifts, and the lower and lower rates of return for each new generation of workers. First, private accounts would allow younger workers to take advantage of the higher returns available to private investment. Second, because these workers would be giving up some of their future claims on traditional Social Security benefits, the unfunded liability of the program would be reduced. 
As the American people learn more about the issue of Social Security reform, public opinion on the issue of private accounts has clearly shifted. Depending on how the question is phrased, between 60 and 80 percent of Americans now say they favor letting workers invest some portion of their Social Security tax payments. Most of the current reform plans have an element of private investment, and I am pleased that several of our Democratic colleagues in the Senate have openly endorsed them. 
In my view, reforming Social Security is the most significant political issue on the horizon for the foreseeable future, and I am encouraged that the American people and elected officials on both sides of the aisle recognize its importance to our nation's continued prosperity. History has shown us that an issue of this magnitude can only be addressed successfully through a bipartisan process. The Gregg-Breaux plan is a thoughtful approach to reform, and I expect it to wield considerable influence in shaping the important debate that lies ahead.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for Senate approval of the conference report on the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act. This landmark legislation, which is the product of years of hard work by many parties, will make long-overdue reforms to the IRS. As a member of the Conference Committee responsible for crafting this agreement, I believe we have made great strides in developing a statutory framework to increase the accountability of the IRS and to protect the rights of taxpayers in their dealings with the IRS. 
There have been numerous congressional hearings over the past year that have clearly highlighted the need to overhaul IRS operations. In the course of these hearings, Congress has reviewed all aspects of the Service's operations and found an agency in serious need of reform and repair, especially in the area of taxpayer service. 
As the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I had a particular interest in how the IRS's management structure could be improved to better serve the American public. To that end, I am pleased that this conference agreement will overhaul the structure of the IRS and provide significant new management and personnel tools to assist the IRS Commissioner in restructuring the Service. Commissioner Rossotti has demonstrated his commitment to working with Congress to meet this mandate. 
The conference agreement creates a new Oversight Board for the IRS to direct these reform initiatives. The Board is composed primarily of private individuals with expertise in the areas of management, customer service, information technology and taxpayer compliance, and it has been granted wide-ranging authority to oversee management of the IRS and the administration of tax laws. 
Of great interest to me have been the issues surrounding membership on the Oversight Board of an IRS employee or employee representative. The conference agreement does provide for an IRS employee or employee representative to serve on the Oversight Board, and I am pleased that the conferees adopted my proposal to eliminate the Senate bill's blanket waiver of criminal conflict of interest ethics laws as they applied to the employee representative on the Board. However, I still oppose Congress giving the President the authority to waive these criminal laws for the employee board member. There are many individuals qualified to be an effective employee representative who would not need to be exempted from federal ethics laws in order to serve on the Board. Waiving criminal laws in order to accommodate one member of the Board establishes a troubling and dangerous precedent. 
The conference agreement also grants significant new personnel authorities to the IRS. These new authorities are intended to help Commissioner Rossotti bring in high-quality private sector professional, administrative and technical personnel to address the many management problems facing the agency. These authorities break new ground in terms of federal personnel pay and management policies. By granting these authorities to the IRS, Congress will have high expectations that the reform agenda is indeed carried through. 
Mr. President, the provisions I have noted are only a part of the important reforms contained in this restructuring bill. The conference agreement also contains many changes that will directly affect the relationship between the IRS and taxpayer to provide greater protections of the rights of taxpayers. For example, this legislation will shift the burden of proof in tax disputes from the taxpayer to the IRS, and it will increase penalties against the IRS for violations of these rights. The conference agreement would provide relief to so-called `innocent spouses' who, under current law, can be held responsible for huge tax bills incurred by a former spouse. The agreement also provides significant relief to taxpayers with regard to interest and penalties that are applied by the IRS. 
Finally, it should be noted that this legislation provides further tax relief for Americans. The conference agreement will eliminate the 18 month holding period that was included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 for assets in order to qualify for the lowest tax rate on capital gains. Under this agreement, any gain realized on the sale of assets held for at least one year will be taxed at a rate of 10 percent for taxpayers in the 15 percent tax bracket, and at a rate of 20 percent for all other taxpayers. In addition to reducing the tax burden on Americans, this provision will simplify the unnecessarily complex capital gains provision that was included in the 1997 bill. 
Mr. President, enacting these far-reaching reforms is only one step Congress can take to provide relief to taxpayers. Next, we need to do away with the current complex tax code and replace it with one that is simpler and fairer. In approving these reforms, we should also keep in mind that our ultimate goal is to reduce the tax burden on hard-working American families.

Mr. THOMPSON. I thank my colleagues from Kentucky and Delaware. 
Mr. President, just a couple of brief points that I think need to be made in order to put what we are doing in context. I think the legislation is good legislation and it is needed. However, I think what we are doing here is taking a step toward Congress intervening in the sanctions process, as we have sometimes, and I think that is good. But I think we need to keep in mind that most of these sanctions have been passed in times past because of concerns of nuclear proliferation. Proliferation has come about because of detonation by countries that have been carried out in their own countries, such as India and Pakistan. Proliferation has also come about because of exports from one country to another, to a troublesome country, to a rogue nation or a nation that we feel might pose some danger to us. 
So, while we are fashioning a particular remedy for a particular purpose with regard to these sanctions, we need to keep in mind that it is in a much larger context that we are going to have to address this. Because, while we want to liberalize the administration's discretion with regard to sanctions in this area, we need to keep in mind that what is also going on right now is the situation where Congress, time and time again, has expressed concern that the administration has not used the sanctions that are available to it. We have a situation right now where we have imposed sanctions on India because of detonations, and India's response is that they are doing so in large part because of our relationship with China. China, on the other hand, continues to be the world's greatest distributor of weapons of mass destruction around the world, and as they do so, the President waives sanctions on China. 
More recently, the administration has decided to exercise its waiver authority and not to sanction the Russian company Gazprom for energy investments in Iran which violate the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. 
So, while it may be appropriate and needed for Congress to intervene to liberalize the application of sanctions in the area that we are dealing with today, we need to keep in mind that while we are bashing sanctions--and I personally believe that they have been greatly overapplied, are indiscriminate, there has not been sufficient distinction with regard to countries that pose a threat or not----

We are going to have to address all of those issues and mainly we are going to have to address the question of whether or not we want to also intervene, as a Congress, with regard to those instances where the administration is not imposing sanctions when this Congress believes they should; where this administration is granting waivers to Russia and China time and time again with regard to their activities of proliferation.

I know the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee agrees with me that nuclear deterrence is the cornerstone of our national defense policy, and we should do everything we can to maintain a strong, viable nuclear deterrent in this country.

Mr. THOMPSON. As the Chairman knows, production activities at Y-12 were placed in a stand down mode on September 22, 1994, due to procedural and criticality safety concerns identified by the Defense Nuclear Safety Board. Since then, Y-12 has made significant progress improving its operations throughout the plant. Since the stand down, Y-12 personnel have worked tirelessly to restart operations in the following mission areas: Receipt and Shipment, Disassembly and Storage Operations, Depleted Uranium Operations, and Stockpile Surveillance, while continuing to meet all defense mission requirements.

Mr. THOMPSON. The Chairman is correct. On June 8, 1998, Y-12 cast its first enriched uranium part since September, 1994. This achievement is a credit to the dedication and commitment of everyone at Y-12, and is a testament to the leadership and management expertise of Lockheed Martin and their teammates at the Department of Energy. It is also critically important to our national security, because Y-12 operations are crucial to the success of our Stockpile Life Extension Program. In fact, Y-12 is currently involved in the life extension program for the Peacekeeper Missile warhead, called the W87. Initial delivery of key components of this weapon are due at the end of this year, and manufacturing will continue for several years. 
I am very pleased that operations at Y-12 are up and running again, so that these critical national security missions can continue on schedule and uninterrupted. In that vein, I want to express my concern about any action on the Department of Energy's part that would disrupt the progress that has been made at Y-12 and jeopardize the timely completion of this very important Stockpile Life Extension project.

Mr. THOMPSON. Daniel Smith's many and great accomplishments are far too numerous to list in this venue, but are celebrated daily in the freedom of our Nation and the struggles of the early Westward movement. Thomas Jefferson wrote of Smith after his death: 
For intelligence, well cultivated talents, for integrity, and usefulness, in soundness of judgement, in the practice of virtue and in shunning vice he was equaled by few men, and in the purity of motive, excelled by none. 
As Tennessee's United States Senators, we salute the vision of General Daniel Smith. He saw the vast potential in this young nation's early Westward movement, and his love of Tennessee is an inspiration to us all. We are proud to follow in his footsteps in the United States Senate, and we join our fellow Tennesseans in remembering this proud statesman on the 250th anniversary of his birth.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I was planning to offer an amendment to this bill that would provide relief to the 2,200 civilian Tennesseans working at Ft. Campbell who are being unfairly taxed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. My amendment would also provide relief to South Dakotans working on the Gavins Point Hydroelectric Dam who are being unfairly taxed by Nebraska, and the Washingtonians working on the Columbia River Hydroelectric Dams who are being unfairly treated by Oregon. I am joined in my efforts by Senators Frist, Gorton, Daschle, Murray, and Johnson. 
Mr. President, the folks working at these facilities may live in Tennessee or South Dakota, but they are being forced to pay state income tax to Kentucky and Nebraska, even though they receive absolutely no services or benefits from these states. These employees are being unfairly taxed by their non-resident state simply because their work takes them across the border into the neighboring state. 
The employees enter the neighboring state only on federal property. They do not travel on the neighboring states' roads during the course of their work. There is no reciprocal tax agreement between the two states to ensure that individuals pay tax only to one state (as is usually the case between neighboring states). So, these employees are fully supporting the governments of both their resident state and the neighboring state. 
At Fort Campbell, Tennessee civilians enter Fort Campbell on the Tennessee side of the post and cross into Kentucky on a Fort Campbell road that is maintained by the federal government. The Tennesseans do not travel on a Kentucky road to reach the Kentucky side of the post. And all emergency fire, police and medical services at Fort Campbell are provided by the federal government. 
We have a situation where Tennesseans are forced to pay the same Kentucky state income tax as a Kentucky resident, but they are not eligible to receive any benefits from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, such as unemployment compensation, in-state tuition, in-state hunting licenses or in-state fishing licenses. 
The federal employees working at the Gavins Point Dam and the Columbia River Dams face comparable situations. 
My amendment is very narrowly drawn so as not to establish a broad precedent. It would only affect the three listed facilities. In the past, Congress has acted to provide tax relief in similar extraordinary situations. Congress has exempted active duty military personnel, Members of Congress and their staffs, and Amtrak and other multi-state transportation employees from taxation except by their resident states. 
The legislation on which my amendment is based, H.R. 1953, has passed the other body twice this Congress and was reported by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs by a vote of 15 to 0. It is currently pending in the Senate Finance Committee. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, has expressed his support for this measure. 
Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Kentucky has clearly indicated his intention to prevent the Senate from voting on my amendment. It is not my intent to hold up action on the DOD Authorization bill. I want to ask my distinguished colleague from South Carolina, the Chairman of the Committee, then for an assurance that he will work with me and the other cosponsors of this amendment in the conference to retain the provision identical to my amendment that was included in the other body's version of the DOD Authorization bill. This is a very serious matter for my state of Tennessee, for South Dakota and for Washington state, which must be addressed.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, our democracy depends not just on our citizens exercising the franchise at every election. It also depends on the active participation of citizens in the operations of the government. To that end, the federal government has sought input and advice from citizens on a wide variety of issues by creating advisory committees. To solicit this input, however, costs the government around $180 million a year, and results in an accretion of advisory committees that continue long after their useful purpose is satisfied. 
The operations of advisory committees are governed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, commonly called `FACA.' This law was enacted out of a concern that federal advisory committees were proliferating without adequate review, oversight, or accountability. In adopting the FACA, Congress intended that the number of advisory committees be kept to the minimum necessary and that all advisory committees operate openly under uniform standards and procedures. 
Although the FACA was not enacted until 1972, agencies of the federal government had been using advisory committees for many years. For example, the Board of Visitors of the Naval Academy was established by Congress in 1879. There are four types of advisory committees used by federal agencies: committees mandated by Congress; committees authorized, but not mandated, by Congress; committees mandated by executive order of the President; and, finally, committees established by agencies under their organic statutes. Over the years, the number of advisory committees grew. In enacting the FACA, Congress mandated that all then-existing advisory committees terminate within two years but did not apply this mandate to advisory committees established directly by Congress, only to those created by agencies themselves. Despite this termination mandate, the number of advisory committees continued to increase after enactment of the FACA. Many of the advisory committees terminated two years after the FACA's enactment were simply reestablished, and many new committees have since come into existence. 
While allowing public participation in government, advisory committees cost the federal government money. According to the General Services Administration, the 968 federal advisory committees used by federal agencies cost the government $178 million in fiscal year 1997 and consumed 1254 full-time equivalent positions. Advisory committees are expected to cost the government $183 million this year. Even though the number of advisory committees has fallen from 1305 in 1993, their costs have continued to increase, even in constant dollars. In 1988, the cost to operate advisory committees was $93 million. The cost to operate fewer advisory committees in 1997 was about $136 million in 1988 dollars. 
The costs associated with advisory committees would be even higher were it not for initiatives taken to reduce the number of advisory committees created by executive branch agencies. The number of these `discretionary' committees, those created not at the direction of Congress or the President, is limited to 534. The GSA also conducts an annual review of advisory committees that no longer serve a useful purpose. Through this review, GSA has identified 61 advisory committees mandated by law that should be eliminated. The termination of these committees would save $8.4 million this year. 
The time has come for Congress to step up and do its part to achieve further cuts in current advisory committees. Unless Congress acts, the cost of advisory committees will continue to increase, as new committees are created and old, useless committees continue with no legitimate purpose. 
Today, joined by a bipartisan group of my colleagues on the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I am introducing the Advisory Committee Termination and Streamlining Act of 1998. I am pleased to be joined by the ranking member of the Committee, Senator Glenn, who has a long history of involvement with the FACA; Senator Cochran; Senator Levin, who formerly chaired the Subcommittee with oversight responsibility for the FACA; Senator Brownback, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and Restructuring; and Senator Lieberman, the ranking member on the Government Management and Restructuring Subcommittee. This bill has been developed with the assistance of the Administration, which proposed many of its provisions. 
Let me briefly lay out what this legislation would accomplish. The focus of the legislation is to force the reappraisal of the need for all current advisory committees. To achieve this goal, the bill would terminate all advisory committees within three years of the bill's enactment. This three-year window applies to all advisory committees, whether established by congressional or presidential mandate, congressional authorization, or agency decision. Any advisory committee established by presidential order or agency decision will be subject to continuation if an affirmative decision is made that the committee's continuation is warranted. Similarly, three years will allow Congress enough time to review the advisory committees it has mandated, determine which of these continue to serve useful functions, and reauthorize such committees. This provision will clear away many advisory committees that continue to exist from inertia but no longer serve a useful function. 
The bill excludes two categories of advisory committees. Advisory committees that provide peer review of grant applications, such as those used by the National Institutes of Health, will continue, whether or not they are reauthorized, as the termination provision does not apply to them. The second category exempt from the termination provision covers those committees that provide advice relating to the academic certification of federal institutions. This category includes the Boards of Visitors of the service academies. Finally, the bill exempts from the termination provision all advisory committees that `address critical needs relating to health, safety, national security, or other concerns as the President may certify.' This exemption allows sufficient flexibility to preserve those advisory committees that continue to serve useful purposes in areas deemed important by the President. 
The other provisions of the bill can be quickly summarized. First, the bill allows the GSA to issue binding regulations and not just administrative guidelines. This change, proposed by the Administration, is needed to promote consistent, uniform application of the FACA's requirements throughout the executive branch. Second, the bill changes the date on which the Administration's annual report on advisory committees must be submitted to Congress from December 31 to March 15. The GSA has consistently failed to meet the December 31 deadline, due largely to its inability to collect the necessary information from other agencies in a timely manner. This change will provide a more realistic date for submission of the report, and the GSA has assured us that it will be able to meet the new March 15 deadline. Finally, the bill will allow the GSA to promulgate regulations authorizing notice of advisory committee meetings through means other than publication in the Federal Register. Many who have an interest in the work of specific advisory committees do not read the Federal Register, and the Administration is interested in experimenting with providing notice of meetings through the Internet or other electronic formats in order to determine whether other forms of notice are more effective at reaching large numbers of interested persons. 
Mr. President, this bill would streamline the government and save us money. It will have the additional benefit of requiring Congress and the Administration to work jointly to revisit the charters of all advisory committees and evaluate the need for their continuation. I thank the Administration for working with us to develop this bill and my cosponsors for working towards a consensus on this matter.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, section 805 of the bill contains the `Defense Commercial Pricing Management Improvement Act,' which is designed to improve DoD's management practices and help address the spare parts pricing problems identified in the Armed Services Subcommittee on Acquisition & Technology hearing on March 18. Among other things, section 805 would require the Secretary of Defense to issue regulations clarifying the procedures and methods to be used in determining the reasonableness of prices charged for sole-source commercial items. 
The amendment would provide that the regulations should be issued on a government-wide basis, as a part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and applicable to all federal procurements, rather than being issued by the Secretary of Defense and applicable only to DoD procurements. This change is consistent with the Senate's ten-year effort to place DoD and civilian agency procurements on an equal statutory footing.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the Truth In Negotiations Act authorizes agencies to waive the requirement for contractors to provide certified cost or pricing data in `exceptional circumstances.' Under current law, however, a subcontractor under a contract or subcontract for which an exceptional circumstances waiver has been granted may still be subject to the requirement to provide certified cost or pricing data. 
The administration has requested a change to this law to provide that exceptional circumstances waivers extend not only to a contract or subcontract, but also to subcontractors under that contract or subcontract. The proposed amendment would give agencies the authority to grant waivers that extend to subcontractors under a contract or subcontract, but would not require that they do so in every case. In addition, it would make a technical change to correct a section reference. 
At the same time, the sponsors of the amendment are concerned by some of the statements made by the Administration in submitting the proposed amendment. The section-by-section analysis of the Administration proposal contains the following statements:  
The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act revised [the Truth in Negotiations Act] to permit the head of the procuring activity to grant waivers, rather than the head of the agency. In response to the legislative change, the Federal Acquisition Regulation was revised to encourage the use of waivers when the contracting officer can determine the contract price to be fair and reasonable without the submission of cost or pricing data. As a result, more waivers are being granted today than previously. 
If the government does not require certified cost or pricing data from a prime contractor because contract price can be determined to be fair and reasonable without the submission of such data, then it should be presumed that there is no need to collect the data from lower tiers. 
The sponsors disagree with the implication that a waiver is appropriate whenever a contracting officer thinks that he can determine the contract price to be fair and reasonable without the submission of cost or pricing data. The Truth In Negotiations Act, as amended, still specifies that a waiver may be granted only in `exceptional circumstances.' 
It is the view of the sponsors that the term `exceptional circumstances' requires more than the mere belief of the contracting officer that it may be possible to determine the contract price to be fair and reasonable without the submission of cost or pricing data. For example, a waiver may be appropriate in circumstances where it would be possible to determine price reasonableness without the submission of cost or pricing data and the contracting officer determines that it would not be possible to enter a contract with a particular contractor in the absence of a waiver. 
The amendment would give agencies the flexibility to extend exceptional circumstances waivers to subcontractors when it is appropriate to do so. However, it is the expectation of the sponsors that the executive branch will clarify the circumstances in which an `exceptional circumstances' waiver may be granted, consistent with the understanding of Congress, as expressed in this statement.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think that the premises on which this legislation began were faulty. And I think they still are. 
I think it is basically the premise that in order for us to express our hatred for the tobacco companies and in order for us to express our love for our children, we must pass a tax increase in excess of $800 billion a year over a 25-year period, which is three times our annual defense budget. 
That, Mr. President, is a faulty premise. It is based on the faulty premise that we can raise taxes and raise the price of cigarettes to a point that it will discourage youth smoking; we can raise it high enough to do that but not so high as to create a black market. I understand that one out of every five packs of cigarettes sold in the State of California today are black-market cigarettes. It is based upon the premise that if you will raise prices of cigarettes that the youth of America will substantially decrease smoking, even though there is no evidence to indicate that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. 
Mr. President, on behalf of myself and a bipartisan group of senators, I introduce today the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. This legislation is needed to preserve one of the Senate's most important powers: the duty to advise and consent on presidential nominees. 
The Framers of the Constitution established a procedure for the appointment of all government officers: they were to be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, unless Congress decided that the appointment of specified inferior officers was to be made by the President alone, the courts, or by department heads. The First Congress, however, recognized that vacancies would arise in executive positions, and enacted legislation providing for officials to temporarily exercise the powers of an office even without Senate confirmation. The law was adopted essentially in its current form in 1868, and was last amended in 1988. As amended, the first assistant or another Senate-confirmed individual can serve for 120 days after the vacancy, and, in addition, may serve beyond those 120 days if the President submits a nomination for that office to the Senate within those 120 days. 
Unfortunately, the Vacancies Act is honored more in the breach than in the observance. For the past 25 years, administrations of both parties have claimed that the Justice Department is exempt from the Vacancies Act. And since the Reagan Administration, other departments, at the behest of the Justice Department, make the same argument, purportedly based on the authority of the heads of each of the executive departments to delegate their authority to other department personnel. Following this argument to its logical end, none of the departments is bound by the Vacancies Act, so that the act is a dead letter. 
Certainly, this Administration has conducted itself as if the Vacancies Act applies to none of the departments. Each department has at least one temporary officer who has served more than 120 days before any nomination was sent to the Senate. Of the 320 executive department advise and consent positions, 64 are held by temporary officials. Of the 64, 43 have served longer than 120 days before any nomination was submitted to the Congress. The Commerce Department is the worst offender in number and in degree. For instance, the acting head of the Census Bureau is neither the first assistant nor a person who has been confirmed by the Senate, a mind-boggling violation of the law. Nor has a nomination been made, although the prior Census chief announced her departure more than five months ago. 
The government's important functions should be carried out by permanent officials. That means that the President must submit nominations and the Senate needs to provide its advice and consent. This administration seems not to want to subject its appointees to such scrutiny. Acting on that desire is unconstitutional and a violation of the Vacancies Act as well. The Appointments Clause is not a technical nicety. As the Supreme Court has stated, the Appointments Clause is designed to keep the Executive and Legislative Branches within their appropriate spheres, so as to better preserve individual liberty. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee recently held an oversight hearing on the Vacancies Act. In that hearing, it became apparent that the Administration was regularly acting in violation of the law, but faced no consequence for its actions. The Committee also heard testimony from Senators Byrd and Thurmond, who had each introduced bills designed to ensure compliance with the Vacancies Act through clarifying the scope of agencies covered and providing an enforcement mechanism. Our colleagues owe a debt of gratitude to Senators Byrd and Thurmond for raising these important issues and offering solutions to address them. 
I have found the approaches in the Byrd and Thurmond bills to have contributed importantly to the drafting of the legislation I introduce today. It is extremely important to ensure that the Vacancy Act period run from the date of the vacancy, to clarify that it covers all departments, and to impose a sanction for noncompliance. Subsequent to the introduction of the Byrd and Thurmond bills, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision on the meaning of the Vacancies Act, approving the four year service of an acting head of the Office of Thrift Supervision as appointed by the departing head of the agency. Overruling several portions of that decision have become a priority. 
The legislation I introduce today provides that in the event of a vacancy in a position in an executive agency requiring the advice and consent of the Senate, the officer's first assistant is allowed to perform the functions and duties of the office on an acting basis, for up to 150 days. Under current law, the period is 120 days, but the vicissitudes of the modern vetting process appear to require that the time be lengthened, to my regret. Alternatively, the President may direct another person who has already received Senate confirmation to serve as the acting official for 150 days. To prevent these restrictions from being gamed, the bill provides that the acting officer must have been the first assistant for 180 of the 365 days preceding the vacancy. 
The length of temporary service can be extended beyond the 150 days if the President submits a nomination to the Senate for the vacant position. If the nomination is withdrawn, or if the Senate rejects or returns it, the acting official can serve only for 150 days after that event. 
The bill makes clear that the Vacancies Act applies to all offices in executive agencies for which appointment is required to be made by the President by and with the advice and consent of 
the President. Nonetheless, we do not write on a clean slate. There are a number of laws already on the books that provide a process by which persons can serve as acting officers when particular offices are vacant. In most instances, these officials can serve until a successor is confirmed, without regard to the Vacancies Act. The bill preserves those specific statutes, but, to clearly reject the position of the Justice Department, it expressly repudiates the contention that a law authorizing the head of a department to delegate or reassign duties among other officers is a statute that provides for the temporary filling of a specific office. For the future, Congress will have to expressly provide that it is superseding the Vacancies Act if it wishes to override the Vacancies Act as to the temporary filling of advise and consent provisions. 
The bill also establishes a second enforcement mechanism. If a nominee is not submitted to the Senate within 150 days of the vacancy, then the office is vacant until a nominee is submitted. While the routine functions of the office would be allowed to continue, those functions and duties that are specified to be performed by that official could only be performed by the head of the department. In fact, no specified duty of the officeholder that existed by regulation for the 180 days preceding the vacancy could be diminished in an effort to avoid the bill's vacant office provisions. However, if the President submits a nomination at any point after the 150 days, the acting officer would again be allowed to serve while the nomination was pending in the Senate, until confirmation, or until 150 days after the rejection, withdrawal, or return of the nomination. Actions taken by any acting official in violation of these provisions would be of no effect, and no one would be permitted to ratify the actions of the acting official that were taken in violation of the vacant office provisions. 
Enforcement is further enhanced by requiring each executive agency to report to the Comptroller General the existence of vacancies, the names of persons serving as acting officers and when such service began, the name of any nominee and when such nomination was submitted to the Senate, and the final disposition of the nomination. The Comptroller General will then notify the Congress, the President, and the Office of Personnel Management when the 150 day limitations have been reached. 
Mr. President, the Framers established a system for appointing important officials in which the President and the Senate would each play a role. Not only did the Framers wish to ensure that more than one person's wisdom was brought to the appointment process, but that the President, in selecting nominees, would be aware that they would face scrutiny. When a vacancy occurs in such an office, it is important to establish a process that permits the routine operation of the government to continue, but that will not allow the evasion of the Senate's constitutional authority to advise and consent to nominations. I am pleased that a number of my colleagues are joining with me to formulate a structure that will achieve these ends. I look forward to the Senate's passage of this legislation in the near future.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the `Regulatory Right-to-Know Act' of 1998. I believe that this legislation will serve as an important tool to promote the public's right to know about the benefits and burdens of regulation; to increase the accountability of government to the people it serves; and, ultimately, to improve the quality of our government. 
This continues the effort begun by Senator Stevens, then the Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, when he passed the Stevens Regulatory Accounting Amendment in 1996. This legislation would not change any statutory or regulatory standard; it simply would provide information to help the public, Congress and the President to understand the scope and performance of our regulatory system. As OMB stated in its first report under the Stevens Amendment, `Over time, regulation . . . has become increasingly prevalent in our society, and the importance of our regulatory activities cannot be overstated.' It is my hope that more information on the benefits and costs of regulation will help us make smarter decisions to get more of the good things that sensible regulation can deliver, and reduce needless waste and redtape at the same time. That's plain common sense. 
Regulations have played an important role in improving our quality of life--cleaner air, quality products, safer workplaces, and reliable economic markets--to name a few of the good things that sensible regulation can produce. Achieving these benefits does not come without cost. In its first regulatory accounting report, OMB estimated that the annual cost of regulation of the environment, health, safety and the economy is about $300 billion. Other studies, which include the full costs of paperwork and economic transfers, estimate that regulation costs about $700 billion annually. Those costs are passed on to American consumers and taxpayers through higher prices, diminished wages, increased taxes, or reduced government services. The tab for the average American household is thousands of dollars each year--$7,000 per year by some estimates. At the same time, the public wants and deserves better results from our regulatory system. As the costs of regulation rise with public expectations of better results, the need is greater than ever to get a handle on how regulatory programs are performing, so we can find ways for our government to perform better. 
It's no surprise that the seriousness of this need is not widely appreciated, because the costs of regulation are not as obvious as many other costs of government, such as the taxes we pay each year; and the benefits of regulation often are diffuse. But there is substantial evidence that the current regulatory system often misses opportunities for greater benefits and lower costs. As noted by the President's chief spokesperson on regulatory policy, Sally Katzen: 
Regrettably, the regulatory system that has been built up over the past five decades . . . is subject to serious criticism . . . [on the grounds] that there are too many regulations, that many are excessively burdensome, [and] that many do not ultimately provide the intended benefits. 
Our regulatory goals are too important, and our resources are too precious, to miss out on opportunities to do better. 
It's time to move toward a more open and accountable regulatory system. I am pleased to be introducing this bill with Senator Breaux. It's important that members from both sides of the aisle work together to solve these problems. I appreciate that Chairman Tom Bliley introduced a similar bill in the House last fall, and I look forward to working with him. Finally, I appreciate the effort that a few dedicated professionals put into OMB's first regulatory accounting report. While this report is certainly not perfect, it shows that regulatory accounting is doable and can help us better understand the benefits and burdens of regulation. Now let's do better. This bill will promote some important improvements, including: 
Making regulatory accounting a permanent requirement. 
Adding requirements for a more complete picture, including, to the extent feasible, the costs and benefits of particular programs, not just an aggregate picture, as well as an analysis of regulation's impacts on the State and local government, the private sector, and the federal government. 
Ensuring higher quality of information. Requirements for OMB guidelines and peer review should improve future reports. 
Ensuring better compliance with basic legislative requirements which the first report neglected. These deficiencies include failing to recommend improvements to current programs; failing to assess the indirect effects of regulation; failing to provide information on specific programs where feasible; and failing to provide a full accounting of all mandates. This bill will help address these problems. 
As OMB said in their first regulatory accounting report, `regulations (like other instruments of government policy) have enormous potential for both good and harm.' I believe that better information will help us to increase the benefits of regulation and decrease unnecessary waste and red tape. I think we need to work together to contribute to the success of government programs the public values, while enhancing the economic security and well-being of our families and communities.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it gives us great pleasure to bring to the Senate's attention one of the new premier events in the world of music: Chet Atkins' Musician Days. 
Known by many as `Mr. Guitar,' Chet Atkins is the most recorded solo instrumentalist in music history. As a studio musician, his work has gilded the records of artists from Elvis Presley to the Everly Brothers to Hank Williams. Chet has been named Musician of the Year nine times by the Country Music Awards and has won thirteen Grammies, more than any other artist in the history of country music. 
Now it's no secret that the State of Tennessee has provided the world with more than its share of great music, from the blues of Memphis' Beale Street to the bluegrass of Appalachia to the country sounds of Nashville. But it's also true, even in Tennessee, that we sometimes forget the performers who stand just outside of the spotlight, the musicians who accompany the stars but rarely take center stage. That gave Chet Atkins an idea: organize an event to honor the musicians, or, as Chet puts it, `the people who make the singers sound good!' I now yield to my colleague from Tennessee.

Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment, not because I favor the underlying bill. I do not favor the underlying bill. 
I want to specifically address this amendment and what is going on with regard to this amendment. We need to get back to the basic question of what we are all doing here, why we came here, and what we ought to be doing as U.S. Senators. We who pretend to call ourselves conservatives ought to really ask the question, whether or not we want to get into lawsuits that have already been decided pursuant to contracts that have already been executed between private practitioners of the law and sovereign States, and to go in and say that we are going to abrogate what you have done to private citizens agreeing to cases that have already been decided and say we will undo all of that. We, the Federal Government, we, the U.S. Senate, are going to get right into the middle of that and we are going to require you to send billing records to the Judiciary Committee that I sit on. 
I did not come to the U.S. Senate to review billing records from lawyers in private lawsuits. 
Now, we need to get away from deciding who the good guys are and the bad guys are and just jumping on the bad guys. Nobody likes trial lawyers. You heard a defense already about how great contingent fees are and they are necessary, and all that is true, and so forth. It is beside the point with regard to this. 
The point is really us. This particular amendment has nothing to do with the tobacco deal. This applies whether or not a company is making a deal with the government or not. It applies to Federal lawsuits. It applies to State lawsuits. This has nothing to do with the tax money we are going to be raising if this bill passes, which I will oppose. It is dipping into a completely different area that has nothing to do with the tobacco legislation because we feel like trial lawyers are getting fees that are too great. 
Mr. President, I don't care what the trial lawyers get, if it is something that is agreed to by the parties and is something that is supervised by the courts. It has been pointed out that in one case in Florida the courts found that the fee was outrageous. That is the very point. If a court determines that a fee is outrageous, they can set it aside. It is regulated by the courts. It is regulated by the States. Every State in this Union regulates attorneys' fees. If it is outrageous, if it is not justified, people can take a claim to the States. 
Should the Federal Government and should we on our side of the aisle, of all people, be urging the Federal Government to get into the middle of private lawsuits and deciding what fees ought to be in cases where there is a Federal court or a State court that has already decided, and has nothing to do with Federal legislation otherwise? I think that is tremendously bad policy. 
I think this whole tobacco approach, quite frankly, is bad policy. I think this idea of taxing waitresses and cab drivers in order to give these same lawyers attorneys' fees of any kind is a bad idea. But the tobacco companies are bad guys, the trial lawyers are bad guys, and we are forgetting the principles that we came up here and are supposed to be supporting; that is, let the Federal Government do what they are supposed to be doing, let individuals have individual responsibility, let sovereign States make the laws, if they want to, and let private litigants go to court and fight it out before a jury of their peers. 
Therefore, I oppose the amendment. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, despite the respect that I have for Members who are co-sponsors of this legislation, I must oppose S. 1605. 
I do not oppose this legislation because I believe that encouraging local law enforcement officers to be provided body armor is a poor idea. Rather, it is not an appropriate activity of the federal government. 
If this new grant program passes, we will once again encourage people in communities all across the country to drive on past city hall, drive on past the state capitol, drive to the airport, fly to Washington and ask the Congress to help them solve a local problem. I believe that local problems can and should be solved by local people. There is hardly any more local issue than the equipment of local law enforcement officers. 
Some localities are enlightened and have provided money for body armor. This bill penalizes them. Under this bill, residents of those communities, who have already paid taxed for body armor for their own law enforcement agents, would be taxed to pay for 50 percent of the cost of body armor of law enforcement in communities that have not taxed their citizens to pay for it. Well, as George Bernard Shaw said, `Any government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always count on the support of Paul.' 
The only purpose for which this money can be used by local government is to provide body armor. Communities that have not provided body armor and communities that have not managed to reduce their crime rates receive first preference for the award of the money. That certainly creates an unfortunate incentive. And it means that in the future, localities may forego important law enforcement efforts on the hope that if they wait a bit, taxpayers in other parts of the country will pay 50 percent of the cost. 
Under this bill, taxpayer money will be returned to the people who paid it, less the carrying charges and with strings attached. What if the locality or state would like to spend the money on some other purpose than body armor? They are prohibited from doing so. Even if a community that has not provided body armor has a more pressing law enforcement need, they cannot spend the money on anything but body armor. This is an unwarranted intrusion on federalism. Maybe we would help more if we left more tax money to remain in localities in the first place. 
This is exactly why the federal government should stay out of this. The era of big government is over I keep hearing, but here is a proposal to make it bigger. And somebody will have to pay for it with money that could have stayed right in the community where it was raised. 
If this bill passes, there will be lots of opportunity to pass the buck. Municipalities that do not provide body armor can pass the buck to Washington, saying that the federal government now has the responsibility of doing so. The federal government will point out that most of the funds will have to come from the states and localities. Fingers will point everywhere and accountability will rest nowhere. This is undesirable in a democracy. 
Therefore, I record my opposition to this legislation.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S. 2037, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This legislation implementing the World Intellectual Property Organization Treaty is of vital importance to the American economy. 
No nation benefits more from the protection of intellectual property than the United States. We lead the world in the production and export of intellectual property, including the many forms of artistic intellectual property and computer software. These industries are among the fastest growing employers in our country. When the owners of intellectual property are not fairly compensated, that hurts Americans and it decreases incentives for creating additional intellectual property that educates, entertains, and does business for us. 
New technology creates exciting opportunities for intellectual property, but the digital environment also poses threats to this form of property. Unscrupulous copyright violators can use the Internet to more widely distribute copyrighted material without permission. To maintain fair compensation to the owners of intellectual property, a regime for copyright protection in the digital age must be created. Technology to protect access to copyrighted work must be safeguarded. Copyright management information that identifies the copyright owner and the terms and conditions of use of the copyrighted material must be secured. 
There are new issues with respect to copyright in the digital age that never were issues before. The bill addresses such issues as on-line service provider liability in a way that is fair to all parties. And it governs a number of other issues that have been accommodated in the new era. 
Passage of this bill is important if American intellectual property is to be protected in other countries. I was pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the initial bill, and to have supported the bill in the Judiciary Committee and now on the floor. I strongly support its enactment.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. 
Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address, President Clinton underscored the importance of foresight. He said, `preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead.' He was not talking about weapons proliferation and national missile defense, but he could have been--and he probably should have been. 
Well, we are hearing the thunder now. It is coming from Iran, where the Shahab-3 missile program made up years of development time in just one year, reminding us that some countries are more technically clever than we give them credit for, and that outside assistance can dramatically accelerate technical progress. 
It is coming from Pakistan which has now launched a missile with five times greater range than their next most capable missile, and five times what the United States had given them credit for just six months earlier. 
It's coming from North Korea, where the Taepo-Dong 2, capable of striking Alaska and Hawaii, is nearing flight testing, and where the No-Dong is now being deployed, despite the administration's assurances that North Korea would never deploy that missile after only one flight test. 
It is coming from Russia, where the government appears either disinclined, or incapable of controlling the flood of hardware and technical assistance flowing to rogue states around the globe. 
It is coming from India, where this week their government exploded five nuclear weapons, to the complete and admitted surprise of the United States policy-making and intelligence community. 
It is coming from China, where the government repeatedly breaks its nonproliferation promises, and is then rewarded with technology transfers from the U.S. 
Despite these and other ominous examples, the United States continues to maintain a non-proliferation policy of self-delusion and a missile defense policy of vain hope. For years, we convinced ourselves that developing countries could not, or would not, fully develop nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, or the missiles to effectively deliver. Now we know they have. They continue to hope that maybe rogue states will prove less clever than they have in the past, or that our intelligence community will prove more clever, or that our luck just holds out. 
My friends, it is time to wake up. The technology to develop nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is widely available. Many nations, some quite hostile to the U.S. now possess them and are on a crash course to acquire the missiles to carry them to America. And third countries, Russia and China in particular, appear happy to help. Weapons of mass destruction are not going away. The United States will soon face this threat and it's time to prepare. 
When the day arrives that America is handcuffed by our vulnerability to ballistic missile attack, when our world leadership is in question because of that vulnerability, or when--heaven help us--an attack actually occurs, what will we tell the American people? That we had hoped this would not happen? That we believed the threat was not so serious? 
It should now be clear to all that our present non-proliferation and missile defense policies are out-dated and insufficient. We must prepare now for that `far-off storm.' The first step in doing so is to pass S. 1873, the America Missile Protection Act, and commit the United States to a policy of deploying national missile defenses. I commend Senator Cochran for his thoughtful leadership on this bill and the many hours he has spent working as Chairman of the International Security and Proliferation Subcommittee to highlight America's vulnerabilities in this area.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to clarify the application of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. On its face, this legislation is necessary to correct the Congressional Budget Office's interpretation of the law as it applies to large entitlement programs. But more fundamentally, it is a bill to force Congress to abide by the spirit of the law we passed in 1995 to discourage Congress from imposing costly new mandates on States and local governments. 
CBO's performance in fulfilling its responsibilities under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act has been commendable. CBO cost estimates have been timely and sound, and analysts have been responsive. However, I have serious concern that CBO is misinterpreting the definition of `Federal intergovernmental mandate' as provided in the law. The result is a loophole that makes the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act inoperative for two-thirds of all federal aid to all governments for all purposes. Every State, every municipality is justifiably concerned; indeed, it is with the strong backing of the National Governors' Association that I introduce this bill today. 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act defined `federal intergovernmental mandate' with the intent to cover new requirements or a cap on the federal share of costs under Medicaid or other large entitlement programs--unless the legislation imposing the new mandates also provides new flexibility in the program to offset the cost. However, CBO has taken the position that existing flexibility is sufficient to offset the cost of new mandates. For example, CBO has determined that the current ability of States to reduce `optional' Medicaid services is, in effect, the flexibility called for in the law. If this had been the intent of the drafters, there would have been no reason for them to cover Medicaid under the Act in the first place. CBO's interpretation of the law largely removes the point of order as a tool to discourage new mandates or cost-shifts to States under the large entitlement programs where mandates tend to be the most burdensome and expensive. 
Let's stop for a moment and consider why it is so important that we act to correct this problem. Congress passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in 1995 with the recognition that State and local governments are not wayward subordinates who cannot be trusted to run their own affairs, nor are they just more entities for the Federal Government to regulate. They are our partners in government. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act was intended to force Congress to stop and think twice before violating this partnership. It does not preclude new mandates, but it does give any member the right to raise a point of order against new mandates which would cost States or localities more than fifty million dollars. 
To avoid the point of order, the House and Senate intended that the flexibility required under the Act be new flexibility, concomitant with the mandate-imposing legislation, for States to amend their responsibilities to provide `required services'--not optional services. CBO is not reading the law as Congress intended. The bill I am introducing today amends the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to clarify that new flexibility is required to offset any new federally-imposed costs that States or localities will incur under large entitlement programs. 
I am pleased that Senator Glenn, an original cosponsor and conferee on the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, has joined me in cosponsoring this bill to clarify its application.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, as you know, part of the IRS reform bill has to do with the creation of an IRS Oversight Board. One of the new members of the IRS Oversight Board is delineated as a representative of an IRS employees union. However, because of the inherent conflict of interest in this new member's position, the union representative was exempted from four essential ethics laws in the criminal code. That is what our amendment addresses, because the ethics experts in the Office of Government Ethics say these provisions are unprecedented and inadvisable and antithetical to sound Government ethics policy; thus, to sound Government. 
In an era in which we seem to receive an awful lot of very general and hazy messages from the bureaucracy, we are getting a quite definitive, clear-cut opinion out of the Office of Government Ethics with regard to this exemption, and that is that these provisions are unprecedented and, therefore, inadvisable. 
I think it makes common sense. I must say that my primary interest in this as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee has to do with the rules under which our Federal employees operate. We do have an Office of Government Ethics. We do have ethics provisions. They are for good reason. We could talk about these provisions in some detail, but, generally speaking, one of the main things they try to address is to keep people from being compensated by outside entities and outside groups while they are on the Federal Government's payroll. In other words, if an employee is going to be on the Federal Government payroll, they should not be compensated by some outside group when they come and lobby the Federal Government. That is just sound common sense. 
I understand that an agreement was reached, or at least it was voted on in the committee, to have this representative on this nine-member board. We could debate back and forth whether or not that is a good idea. But this amendment does not say that a person of this kind cannot be on the board. All it says is that this person is going to be treated like every other member of the board, and that is that they will not be exempt from the ethics laws. The private members who are on this board are certainly going to have to live under the ethics laws. 
For example, the day after appointment of the board, the private board member could not meet with representatives of the IRS or Treasury on behalf of a client or the board members' corporate employer with respect to proposed tax regulations. These prohibitions apply across the board to all members. It said that it creates somewhat of a hardship on the union representative. Perhaps in all cases there will not be a conflict. 
As I look at some of the provisions that were discussed in committee in terms of the reasons for the creation of the board and the various functions that the board will have, I see where part of the function is to review and approve IRS strategic plans; for example, including the establishment of mission and objectives and long-range plans. I can see an argument being made that this union representative would not have a conflict of interest regarding that particular function of this board. Another function is to review the operational functions of the IRS. Another is to recommend to the President candidates for the Commission. 
I can see an argument being made that this would not create a conflict of interest. So it is indeed arguable that there will be certain functions in which this board member could participate. It is not our position to sit and factually delineate every possibility that might come up. Quite frankly, it is going to be primarily on the board member to determine that themselves. I see other functions where, to me, there is a clear conflict of interest, and that is, to review the operation of the IRS to ensure the treatment of taxpayers, to review procedures of IRS relating to financial audits. 
I can see where someone representing the IRS employees union --a paid employee of the employees union would have a real problem in sitting on this board and trying to determine what the rules ought to be with regard to those employees concerning the way they conduct their audits. That is just common sense. 
Now, there is one thing I think we need to keep in mind. We all know that we have many--certainly the great majority--IRS employees who are loyal, dedicated public servants. But let's not forget the reason why we have this IRS reform bill on the floor to start with; and that is, we saw an absolutely appalling, unprecedented array of rogue activities, which you would not see in a lot of good police states, conducted by some of these IRS agents out in the field. We saw people like Howard Baker and Former Congressman Quillen, who were actually targeted, and they attempted to set up these individuals. These are the kinds of things that are part of the reason that we have the bill and part of the reason that we have this oversight board. 
So in order to say that a union member is going to have some problem some time about sitting on this board as they represent those very employees--the ones that are good, bad and indifferent--is no reason to carve them out and exempt them from these ethics provisions. 
So I think it is a bad step, Mr. President, if the very first thing we do in starting out and trying to reform IRS is to say that with regard to some of these employees we are going to exempt them from the ethics laws. I might point out also that as I read the bill, it doesn't seem to me like it necessarily has to be a paid employee, a paid union official of the IRS employees union. In other words, I would think that a member could serve on this board who would simply be a union member and could be a representative. If they were not taking payment and compensation from the union, as a professional union representative, then perhaps a lot of these conflicts would be alleviated. 
So we are trying to work out something reasonable here on the front end. But make no mistake about it, it would be a terrible mistake in the face of the clear advice of the Office of Government Ethics to say the first thing we are going to do is exempt these people who are, in some cases the source of their problem, from the ethics laws under which everybody else is going to have to live. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. I do not think it is wise to have such a representative on the board. That is another question. In fact, I think the Office of Government Ethics has the same opinion. They do not think it is wise to have a union member on the board. My position is that if there is a union member on the board, they should not be exempt from the ethics laws.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, very briefly, it is not unusual to have an oversight board or an agency or a panel that does not have on it the subjects of that panel's inquiry; in other words, the comparable situation with regard to this oversight board would be U.S. taxpayers. That is whose lives we are really affecting. We don't have any taxpayer members on this particular board. 
I would also point out, as the Senator from Alabama did, that these are criminal laws. We are waiving four primary criminal laws of title 18 of the United States Code with regard to one individual who represents some of those who have caused the problem.

Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, the amendment I am offering, with Senator Sessions and with the support of Chairman Roth, strikes the provision of title I of the bill which provides for a special waiver of the criminal conflict of interest laws for the employee organization representative on the newly organized oversight board. 
As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have a specific interest in the application of Government ethics laws and any waivers of these criminal statutes which might be granted to Federal employees. 
During markup of the measure, the Finance Committee adopted an amendment adding a member to the oversight board who would be a representative of an employee organization representing substantial numbers of IRS employees. However, because of the inherent conflict of interest in the new member's position, the committee adopted a subsequent amendment waiving four essential ethics laws as they would apply to this particular board member. 
It is this specific provision that I propose to strike. Under the waivers as granted, the employee organization representative would not be subject to the same ethics rules as the other members of the oversight board and would not be subject to the same ethics that apply to other public employees. The bill, as reported, exempts the employee organization representative from key ethics laws when the representative is acting on behalf of his or her organization. 
The Office of Government Ethics reviewed these waivers and found them very troubling. In a letter addressed to the majority leader, Senator Lott, minority leader Senator Daschle, and the floor managers of this bill, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, Stephen Potts, described these conflict of interest waivers as unprecedented and inadvisable and antithetical to sound Government ethics policies and, thus, to sound Government.

Mr. THOMPSON. It seems the criticism of the amendment, first of all, is that there is no conflict anyway with regard to these employees serving on this board. Of course, if that is the case, there was no reason for the exemption. So by having the exemption in there, it is an open admission there is an inherent and obvious conflict of interest. 
The question is whether we want to do something about it. Do we want to single out this particular individual and say, `With regard to you--nobody else, but with regard to you--these conflict of interest provisions will not apply; we don't care if you have a clear and obvious conflict of interest'? 
Secondly, it is said that this is very, very narrow as far as the exemption is concerned, but the bill, as reported, exempts a union representative from four key ethic laws when the representative is acting on behalf of his or her union. Those four laws are a part of chapter 11, title 18, United States Code, entitled `Bribery, Graft, and Conflicts of Interest.' 
What are those provisions that we are exempting here? Generally speaking, title 18, section 203, makes it a crime to `demand, seek, receive, accept, or agree to receive or accept' any compensation as an agent or attorney for a third party when a person is working as an officer or employee of the Federal Government. 
That is one of the things we would be exempting this employee from. 
The other section, section 205 of title 18, which is the criminal title, makes it a crime for any Federal employee to appear as an agent or attorney on behalf of anyone in a proceeding to which the United States is a party. 
So that is the second thing we would be exempting this particular member from. 
Thirdly, section 207, makes it a crime to make certain communications to an official of the Federal Government on behalf of any other person if the communications are made `with the intent to influence.' 
This is the third exemption that would apply. 
Lastly, section 208, which is a general conflict-of-interest provision which makes it a crime for a Federal employee to participate `personally and substantially' in any way in a matter where he, himself, his family, a partner, or certain others have `a financial interest.' 
So, one just has to make a decision as to whether or not you feel that this particular employee on this particular board--whether or not you feel the employee ought to be on the board or not; we are not taking them off the board by this amendment; presumably, there are some things that this member could decide that would not present a conflict of interest--but you simply have to decide whether or not you want to take this particular employee and treat him or her differently than anybody else in the Government. 
This is the sort of thing that we have spent substantial time in Governmental Affairs on with regard to the ethics provisions and their applicability to employees. 
I do not think it would be a good policy to have this exemption. As I say, if there is no particular conflict with regard to any particular matter that is before the board, all this is irrelevant anyway. There is no need for the exemption anyway. But if, in fact, they are on the board and they are seeking compensation from a third party while working for the Federal Government, or if they are appearing as an agent on behalf of anybody else who has a matter before the board, or if they are making communications with intent to influence when they are on the payroll of somebody else, this basically has to do with whether or not it is a good idea to put somebody on the board to make decisions with regard to themselves and their fellow employees, who they represent. Certainly, they would have the ability to give their input in lots of different ways. 
But as far as decisions are concerned, we have seen the problems that we have had with regard to IRS employees. Do we think we should place a representative of the IRS employees on this board to make decisions as to what to do with the people with the problem? Certainly they should be heard, but should they be on the board? Number one, OK, put them on the board; number two, should we exempt them from all of the ethical rules, or these four particular ethical conflict of interest provisions? I think we should not. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I refer to the position of the Office of Government Ethics on this. They have considered this matter and wrote to the minority leader. One provision of the bill provides for waivers of applicable conflict of interest laws for one member of that board. I am quoting now: 
We believe that this provision is antithetical to sound Government ethics policy and thus to sound Government. Such across-the-board statutory waivers for someone other than a mere advisor is unprecedented and, we believe, inadvisable. 
So the comparisons to Mr. Rossotti, who formerly had a position in the private sector, are inapplicable. As far as this body is concerned, we spent a great deal of time answering to perceived conflict of interest situations. I doubt if we would ever be in a situation of exempting ourselves from any of those considerations here. 
So this is a very narrowly tailored provision. I understand the sentiment of having some input, having as broad an input as possible. Hopefully, there would be a way to have that kind of input from the employees on perhaps a less formalbasis. But there is an overriding issue here, Mr. President. I don't think we can willy-nilly say that any time we want to make an exception to the ethics rules because we want to get the thing done. We can say that in almost every situation. 
So I must agree with the ethics letter that has been made part of this Record, which says it is unprecedented and antithetical to good Government ethics policy and therefore to good Government. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding victory of the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers in capturing their third consecutive national basketball championship. And I ask my colleagues to join me in formally recognizing the Lady Vols as our country's newest sports dynasty. 
Under the leadership of Coach Pat Summitt, the Lady Volunteers went undefeated this season. Only a few weeks ago, Sports Illustrated compared Coach Pat Summitt to the great John Wooden. I think the magazine was right on the mark. 
Of course, many of my colleagues had their own home-state favorites in the tournament. But Mr. President, I say that they shouldn't be too disappointed with the outcome. They might want to keep in mind that all those other teams were, after all, up against a basketball dynasty that just finished an undefeated season of 39 wins, coming off back-to-back national championships. Plus, we're talking about a Tennessee team here, so what else could you expect? Frankly, Mr. President, my heart goes out to anybody who would get between the UT players and the win that marks their third consecutive national championship. 
Back home in Tennessee we are very, very proud of this team. We're proud of the scholar-athletes. We're proud of the coaching staff. We're proud of the parents and the friends and the faculty who support them. We're proud of a program that has made women's basketball into a national phenomenon. And we're proud that at the end of this season, this team wrote itself into the sports history books with six championships in twelve years. 
This is just about as flawless a season of athletic performance as you're ever going to see, and we're fortunate in Tennessee to have this tremendous program and these gifted, talented young people. 
So today, I congratulate them. My colleagues have enjoyed this kind of excitement with teams from their own states. And I know they appreciate just how pleased we are in Tennessee to get bragging rights for 1998. Year after year, this tremendous program and these outstanding young people make us proud. So, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in declaring the University of Tennessee Women's Basketball program a certified, world-class sports dynasty.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today's vote for prosecuting Saddam Hussein as a war criminal is important for at least two reasons. First, it highlights again the outrageous and murderous actions Saddam Hussein has taken over the past seven years. Second, it injects new thinking into the U.S. approach toward Iraq--something that has been sorely lacking. 
Much commentary has been offered among the general public--and in this body--about the wisdom of the latest deal between U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Saddam Hussein. Much of this commentary has focused on whether or not that agreement is a `good' one--one that will really curb Saddam. In my view, this question is misdirected. Almost certainly, the latest deal will do little but buy time. As long as Saddam possesses weapons of mass destruction, there's going to be another showdown somewhere down the road. So the real question becomes what we are going to do in the meantime to develop a comprehensive, long-term policy to protect our interests even as Saddam uses the time to further build up his arsenal and weaken international resolve. Trying Saddam for war crimes could be a step in that direction. 
There is little doubt in most American's minds that Saddam Hussein negotiated the latest agreement to his own advantage. His standard M-O is to agree to some set of conditions, set himself up in the court of world opinion as some sort of victim, and then violate the agreements when it's advantageous for him to do so. He weakens the international coalition arrayed against him by creating, and then expanding, gray areas in the interpretation of international agreements in an effort to keep his most coveted weapons, while wiggling out of the economic sanctions imposed against his country--a strategy which, I am sorry to say, has worked pretty well for him so far. 
So far, Saddam Hussein has been in control of the situation. He decides what disputes arise and when they come about. And because the United States has developed no creative alternatives to direct conflict, and because we have few international supporters, Saddam forces the U.S. to deploy large amounts of military forces to the Gulf--each time further eroding international cohesion, costing American taxpayers billions of dollars, and weakening our ability to defend other interests. Then, at the last moment, Saddam promises to behave within certain parameters which he negotiates. Later, at a time of his choosing, he tests those parameters and another round of military buildup and feverish hand-wringing among the world's diplomats begins. 
Mr. President, Saddam is pretty much calling the shots. This is far too serious a business for us to settle for such little administration planning as we have seen. Iraqi weapons of mass destruction are quite real, and quite deadly, but our posture against this threat is almost entirely reactive. We engage in a loose strategy of containment, running pretty much on autopilot, until Saddam decides to challenge the status quo. Then we hear a lot of hot rhetoric about `a modern Hitler' and `grave consequences' accompanied by military deployments. But after a flurry of diplomatic activity, Americans are told there can be `peace in our time.' Mr. President, I am reminded of the boy who cried wolf, and I would remind the Administration that they can only go to the well so many times before the American people--and the rest of the world--ceases to take them seriously on this matter. 
Our credibility is one of our first lines of defense. We don't make idle threats or rattle sabers--or rather, we shouldn't make such threats. Otherwise, this roller coaster of international gamesmanship ends up putting dents in our credibility, and that's destructive to our security. And rather than advancing America's security and our interests in the Middle East, this cycle of military build-up and appeasement plays right into Saddam's hands. 
Our foreign policy needs to be made firmly and unequivocally by the President with the discrete counsel of Congress. Instead of forceful leadership in this matter, we have seen the administration attempt to insulate itself from the consequences that might come from a conflict with Iraq by staging public relations opportunities. The fiasco at Ohio State University marked a new low. Mr. President, this nation's foreign policy should not be set on the basis of pep rallies. When Americans are sent to war, it must be done on the basis of sober and rational decisions. Sadly, it appears that for this administration, we've reached the point where stagecraft has replaced statecraft. 
Americans are uneasy with the lack of a comprehensive plan for Iraq. Untended sanctions, followed by military build-ups, followed by a return to sanctions, do not constitute a serious foreign policy. The President needs to take action, and he needs to make the case for that action confidently and truthfully to the American people, and then he needs to carry out exactly what he says he'll do. 
Mr. President, Saddam Hussein is a brutal authoritarian who oppresses the Iraqi people, menaces his neighbors, and threatens the international community by developing weapons of mass destruction and potentially interrupting oil trade. Sadly, the United States currently has only two options for confronting him, both of them poor choices: (1) maintaining sanctions and continuing diplomacy in an environment of eroding international support, and; (2) launching military strikes, which Saddam has thus far been able to withstand. 
Obviously, Americans are always glad when loss of life can be avoided, and there's no question that military strikes would have cost lives. But if by putting off a confrontation with Saddam we have enabled him to grow stronger and perhaps emboldened him to use chemical or biological weapons somewhere in the world, then delaying strikes will have been short-sighted with tragic consequences for many, many innocent people. Given the lack of a comprehensive strategy for dealing with Iraq, however, the result of strikes would have been a collapse of any remaining international cooperation on Iraq, the end of weapons inspections, a politically strengthened Saddam Hussein, and the continuation of Iraq's WMD program. At least the current agreement buys time. It's now up to the Administration to use this window of opportunity to develop better options for the next time Saddam becomes belligerent. 
Building an international record of war crimes against Iraqi leaders could be one way to expand options for dealing with Iraq. Members of this body have also suggested other ideas like supporting an Iraqi opposition; developing, in cooperation with our Middle Eastern allies, better chemical and biological defenses; working more closely with allies to develop sustainable sanctions targeted against the Iraqi Government and its WMD program; and, working to convince other Gulf countries that, if we strike, they will not be left to confront a wounded but still-in-power Saddam who will grow even stronger. These may provide kernels of alternative policies. But Mr. President, every plan that works begins with leadership, accountability, and a seriousness of purpose. So far, these qualities have largely been lacking in the Administration's Iraq policy. I hope they take to heart the ideas offered today by the Senate. 
Whatever we do, the U.S. must have more options than sanctions and military strikes the next time Saddam flouts his agreements. If the Administration does not develop new alternatives, we will soon repeat the well-worn cycle of military build-up and stand-down, and the next time we're at these crossroads with Iraq, our options will be even fewer and support both at home and abroad will be even more scarce. Mr. President, we cannot afford to leave American interests open to that kind of risk. And we will have no excuse for our position if the administration comes to these crossroads again in six months or a year no better equipped--and with no better planning--than we have just seen. 
We must stand up to Saddam with confidence, clear goals, and resolute purpose. And we have to do it soon, or the time bought by the latest agreement will be solely to Saddam's advantage.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to talk about a man who served the people of Connecticut and America with dignity, honor and great style. Abraham Ribicoff spent most of his life in the public service. Before he became a Senator in 1962, he was a Congressman, the Governor of Connecticut, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the Kennedy administration. He was a true leader in the Senate on many issues and his style of leadership and public service will be greatly missed. 
During his time in the Senate, Senator Ribicoff served on the Government Operations Committee, which was renamed the Governmental Affairs Committee during his tenure. He began his service on the committee on February 25, 1963 and served as Chairman from 1977 to 1980. 
As Chairman, Senator Ribicoff oversaw the passage of many initiatives we now take for granted in the government. One such bill was the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was the first substantive reform of the Federal civil service in nearly 100 years. He also helped to enact the Ethics in Government Act, which mandates public disclosure for high-ranking officials in the three branches of the Federal Government. He navigated to passage legislation that created Inspectors General in each of the major federal agencies to serve as public watchdogs to combat waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs. 
During his tenure as Chairman of the Committee, Senator Ribicoff also oversaw the implementation of legislation that established a permanent, Cabinet-level Department of Energy in the executive branch. By doing so, all of the federal government's major energy programs were brought together in one place, including those programs relating to economic regulation of energy supply systems. He also worked closely with Senator Glenn to help enact the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, which established a more effective framework for international cooperation to meet the energy needs of nations. It also ensured that the worldwide development of peaceful nuclear activities and the export by any nation of nuclear materials, equipment, and nuclear technology intended for the use in peaceful nuclear activities did not contribute to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
An area in which Senator Ribicoff and I shared a great interest is that of federal regulation and how to make it more effective, and at the same time, less burdensome. On July 26, 1975, Senate Resolution 71, introduced by Senator Ribicoff and Senator Glenn, was agreed to by the Committee. This resolution authorized a study of Federal regulatory agencies to be undertaken jointly by the Committee on Commerce and the Committee on Government Operations. The first two of these studies which the Committee on Government Operations compiled were entitled `Study on Federal Regulation: The Regulatory Appointment Process,' and `Study on Federal Regulation: Congressional Oversight of Executive Agencies.' These two studies set the groundwork for the regulatory reform work that the committee undertook at that time and which we continue to pursue today. 
I want to acknowledge Senator Ribicoff for having the foresight, some twenty years ago, to examine the regulatory process. As I have found out this is not an easy task, but well worth the effort. While Senator Ribicoff's leadership and public service will be greatly missed, it is my hope that we can carry on his pioneering work and establish a better and smarter regulatory process.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the attention being given to the Government Secrecy Act, S. 712, by Senator Lott and Senator Daschle. I also wish to commend Senators Moynihan and Helms for the hard work they have put into this issue as Senate members of the Commission on Protection and Reducing Government Secrecy. 
To review the entire secrecy system, Congress established the Secrecy Commission in 1994. Last year, the Commission issued its final report. The Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on the Commission's recommendations when they were first issued. Among the recommendations of the Commission was establishing a statutory basis for our secrecy system. Apart from nuclear secrets, there has never been a coordinated statutory basis for establishing and maintaining government secrets. Consequently, there is little coordination among agencies on how information is determined to be secret, little accountability among classifying officials, and little Congressional oversight of the government's secrecy activities. 
The Commission also described how the secrecy system functions as a form of government regulation, imposing significant costs on the government and the private sector. It is time to begin reviewing these costs and identify which secrets really need to be kept and which do not. Like other areas of government regulation, we need to inject a cost/benefit analysis into the process to be sure that those secrets we do keep are worth the cost. 
The Government Secrecy Act is an issue of good government reform that needs consideration by Congress. I intend to work with Senator Glenn, the Ranking Member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, to report an amended S. 712 very soon. The United States needs a secrecy system that does a better job of identifying those secrets which truly must be kept, and which then can truly keep them secret.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I wish to take note of a woman of character and accomplishment who has recently been recognized in a unique and public way for her outstanding talent and tireless work. University of Tennessee Lady Vols Basketball Coach Pat Summitt is on the cover of the March 2, 1998 issue of Sports Illustrated, and I can't think of a better choice. On the caption of the cover, it asks what Coach Summitt's place in basketball history might be, and suggests that she is perhaps the greatest college basketball coach of all time. Mr. President, I think that's a pretty accurate assessment. 
As I have pointed out with more than a little pride before to the Senate, the Lady Vols have taken home the national championship trophy the last two years in a row, and five years out of the last eleven. Every one of those victories was both hard-fought and well-deserved, and Coach Summitt was always at the helm. In Tennessee, we're all very proud of what she's done, and fans everywhere have come to appreciate just how much of the success of women's basketball is owed to her efforts. She has helped to make women's basketball a major interest of sports fans, and she has helped create a great deal of opportunity for young scholar-athletes. 
Coach Summitt has never let `no' stand in the way of getting what she wanted. As the Sports Illustrated article tells it, Pat grew up on a farm where she learned to work hard and stick to a job until it was done--and done right. Later, after a potentially career-ending knee injury, she defied the odds and the predictions of her doctors not only to play again but to join the 1976 Women's Olympic Basketball team as the oldest player, and come home with a Silver Medal. 
Her rise is impressive. She was made head coach at age 22 at the University of Tennessee while she was finishing a graduate degree. And she rose to the task, doing more than she had to do in all her jobs. Anybody else might have settled for second best under the workload. Not Pat. She wanted to succeed. Pat didn't just show up for practice and blow the whistle while the players ran laps. She built the women's program from nearly the ground up. She drove the team to and from games, she made sure everyone had uniforms and towels, she swept the floor and she looked after her players' injuries. And she finished her degree. Pat did it all, and her dedication has paid off. 
Pat has spoiled us in Tennessee. We're more accustomed than most to winning the big games. But as long as Pat's in charge, and as long as she keeps bringing in the best young players out there and bringing out their potential, I think we can look forward to a long run of great teams, first-rate competition and championship seasons. So I am pleased that Sports Illustrated has acknowledged what so many of us already know. She's on the cover--for anyone involved in athletics, this is one of those moments that you never forget. 
Mr. President, we are proud of Coach Pat Summitt in Tennessee. We're honored to see her on the cover of Sports Illustrated. She deserves this recognition and I send along my best wishes to her.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill aimed at preventing private property owners from being caught by surprise when a private company asks the Federal Government for the power to take their land. 
We had a situation in Marion County, TN, recently where the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided to grant the power of eminent domain to a private company for the purpose of building a natural gas pipeline through the county and then into Alabama. 
This pipeline will exclusively serve a new wallboard plant that the company plans to build in the area. And that is fine. But in the process, about 50 private property owners--homeowners, businessmen, farmers--are being forced to allow their property to be used for the exclusive benefit--and profit--of this private company. 
Now, that in and of itself raises a serious question in my mind. I wonder whether some greater public benefit needs to be demonstrated than simply the economic value of having this plant in the community. Again, we are talking about a situation where a private company is essentially being allowed to stand in the shoes of the Federal Government and seize an interest in the property of ordinary citizens but without committing that property to the direct use and benefit of the larger public. Now, that is the law as it stands today, as permitted, but it is a very serious matter and one which should not be taken lightly. 
But what I find especially troubling is the fact that these private land owners--my constituents--were never given personal notice that their lands could be taken for this private pipeline. Current regulations require only that notice be published in the Federal Register. 
If you do not happen to read the Federal Register on a daily basis you will never know that your property is about to be taken. Quite frankly, the Federal Register is not likely read in Marion County, TN, not by them and not by me, either, I might add. If you do not read it, the fact that your land is in jeopardy might be news to you until it is too late for you to participate meaningfully in the process in order to protect yourself and your interests. I think that is wrong. 
This legislation is very simple and straightforward. It would simply guarantee that property owners get personal notice by certified mail whenever a private company is seeking to acquire an interest in their property through the power of eminent domain. This would at the very least allow the landowners to meaningfully participate in the Government's decisionmaking process. 
That is something they did not get in this case. I do not think it is right. I think it is pretty hard to argue that people should not have a right to know when the Federal Government is considering giving a private company the right to take their land. I do not think that anyone would argue that these folks should not be made aware of the rights they already have under the law. If you don't know about it, you can't protect it. That is what this bill would do. 
Just let me quickly mention a couple of things that this bill would not do. It would not affect State law. It only addresses a situation involving the Federal power of eminent domain. It would not restrict the Federal Government's ability to exercise the power of eminent domain itself. It only deals with situations where the Federal Government is considering whether or not to delegate the power of eminent domain to a private company. No Federal agency will find its right to acquire Federal lands through eminent domain restricted by this legislation. It would not cost the Federal Government any money. Under my bill the private companies seeking the right to exercise eminent domain--not the Government--would be responsible for notifying the property owners whose lands might be affected. 
What this bill does is state that property owners have the right to be notified when the Federal Government is considering giving a private company the right to take their land. It is basic fairness. They have a right to be notified at the outset of the proceedings in time for them to participate in the process. It gives them a chance to make sure that their voices are heard. 
That did not happen in Marion County. The folks there were not personally notified that their land was in jeopardy and they did not find out until it was too late. I just don't think that that is right. 
I hope the Senate will agree and will support this basic commonsense bill that I am introducing today.

Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, during a 3-month period, the Governmental Affairs Committee saw examples of clear violations of the law--money laundering, foreign campaign contributions, violations of the Hatch Act, possible sale of influence. These are simple, flat-out legal violations which require little debate or delay in terms of prosecuting the appropriate individuals. There has been considerable delay, however, but at least we now see three indictments and the request for one special council coming totally or in part from our committee activities. One would assume that several more are imminent, judging from the record laid out before our committee. 
There is another category of matters which up until 1996 were also considered to be violations of the law by most people--using the White House for fundraising purposes, a Presidential candidate actually controlling the expenditure of millions of dollars of soft money for TV ads containing electioneering messages placed specifically to advance his reelection prospects. 
I say `considered to be violations until recently' because the Attorney General and Justice Department apparently now take the position that these activities are legal for the final time. Although I believe that these are erroneous interpretations of the law, supported by neither the law or logic, the result is to give new arguments to those who would seek to circumvent the clear intent of the law. This along with court decisions, Federal Election Commission interpretations of the law, and piecemeal Congressional amendments has resulted in a campaign finance system that is in shambles. The loopholes are now bigger than the law and there are now effectively no limits on big corporate, big labor, big individual monies flowing into our political campaigns--a situation that Congress has said we do not want for almost a hundred years. 
And if people think the 1996 campaign set new records for the big money scramble, they only have to wait until the next election cycle, and especially the next Presidential race. At least the last time there was some concern among the candidates, and even the Clinton-Gore campaign, as to how far they could go in pushing the limits. Now that everyone has seen that the Justice Department is apparently willing to bless the most egregious of this activity and refuse to request the appointment of an independent counsel for what the Courts and FEC consider to be illegal activity, there will be no such hesitancy next time. 
And the Clinton-Gore example will be picked up and followed in the Senate and House races, one can only assume. Under the Attorney General's interpretation, I can see nothing wrong with a Congressional candidate raising unlimited amounts of soft money for use in TV ads praising the candidate or denigrating his opponent, so long as the ads do not contain the magic words of `vote for' or `vote against' a particular candidate. 
Congress must decide whether or not we are going to pass on this patchwork, swiss cheese system, which goes against the clear intent of Congress the last time they addressed these issues. If so then the implicit message will be that we are no longer concerned about the appearance of corruption; that we think that millions of dollars from 
companies, unions and individuals who are trying to get us to pass legislation is okay with the American people. I don't think it is and I don't think that is what we want to say. 
The McCain-Feingold bill addresses the worst of these problems. Also, many of my colleagues have amendments which would greatly improve our current situation, although they may never see the light of day. 
However, I would urge that we don't get so caught up in the details of a particular piece of legislation that we are oblivious to the fact that we are going to have to comprehensively address money in our political system eventually. We haven't really done it in 20 years and it shows. In many other areas we see that after a period of time laws that have been passed have resulted in unintended consequences, and there are court decisions and there are administrative rulings to point out weaknesses in the legislation and sometimes they go contrary to congressional intent and we conclude that we need to address the law again. That is clearly what we are going to have to do with regard to campaign finance legislation. 
It's important for us to understand how we got to where we are today. In 1907, Congress banned corporate contributions. In 1943, Congress banned labor union contributions. Congress comprehensively addressed how we finance our federal political campaigns in 1972 and 1974. Again, Congress was specifically concerned with the extent to which corporations, union, and individuals should be allowed to contribute to political candidates. Individuals were limited to $1,000 per election and limited to $25,000 in total annual contributions--$20,000 of this could go to party committees. Corporations and labor unions were strictly forbidden involvement in the federal campaign process, outside of $20,000 per election per candidate political action committee contributions. The underlying justification for allowing political action committees was to provide a mechanism to facilitate voluntary contributions from individual union members, corporate stockholders, and their administrative personnel. 
In 1972 and 1974 limitations were placed on expenditures but all of them were either repealed or deemed unconstitutional with the Buckley versus Valeo decision in 1976, except for the restrictions on party committees and publicly funded Presidential candidates. And the contribution limits were upheld. 
So we have been talking about Buckley v. Valeo. The Senator from Kentucky rightly pointed out that in Buckley the Court struck down most of the limits on expenditures. The Court did not strike down the limits on contributions because the Court recognized that, historically, governments of all kinds have been concerned with the amounts of big money that could be given to politicians who were in charge of public policy. And, as I said, Congress has been concerned about that since 1907. This is not a new concern or a new issue. 
Also, Congress eliminated private contributions to Presidential general election campaigns altogether for those who opted into the Presidential public financing program that was established. So for the last 25 years or so, Presidential nominees, who were willing to certify that they would not raise and spend additional funds, were given millions of dollars of tax payers money to fund their campaigns. That has been our system. Again, as with the idea of limiting corporate, union, and large individual contributions, the idea was to cut down on the corrupting influence or appearance of corruption of large sums of private money being given to Presidential candidates, or maybe Presidents who were already in office. Congress also believed this legislation would have the added benefit of pulling presidential candidates out of the fundraising chase, and instead allow them time to focus on issues and not so much on the money behind factions supporting those issues. 
So, for a long time, Mr. President--we talk about the Government being in charge and we don't want to put the Government in charge--for a long time in this country, many Members of this same body and many Members from both sides of the political spectrum, enough to get these laws passed for almost a century, the Government has been involved. I am not a big one for having the Government involved in a lot of things, but many of us have come to the conclusion that how we elect our Federal officers, how we elect our Federal officials, is one of those things that is legitimately the business of the Federal Government. And the Federal Government, and this Congress, has passed on specific contribution limitations in times past because of this notion that we need to kind of watch that carefully, because if you go out here in the private world and you see people in positions of decisionmaking receiving money from the people whom they are making the decision with regard to, that could be a problem. It is just kind of basic common sense. And the idea that the Government has kind of been oblivious to this and not involved in this for some time is really an invalid concept. 
For 25 years, the system that I have just described has worked pretty well. There hasn't been a major Presidential scandal. People talk about public financing. We are clearly not talking about public financing here. But on the Presidential level, many people may not realize it but we have had public financing for a long time, and it has been scandal free. It has operated about as well for incumbents as it has challengers. It has been more of a level playing field, people have opted into it, and it has worked pretty well. All the TV advertisements were paid for within this system. With all of this money that was raised within this system, with these limitations placed on them, people managed to buy television ads and have pretty decent television campaigns--with this money, we call it hard money now, but the money within the system that was carefully thought out and allowed to be given to those of us in political office--because they were reasonable amounts and it didn't feel like they were large enough to have any influence on us, is what it boils down to. 
However, things began to happen in the 1970s, with later more significant developments in the 1990s, that have totally transformed that system that Congress set up. 
There was concern in Congress, for example, that there be adequate funding for grassroots political activities. We are all concerned about that. So, in the late 1970's, Congress amended the campaign laws and the FEC interpreted those amendments to allow national parties to send unlimited amounts, but for voter registration, voter turnout, and so forth, without these moneys counting against the limitations placed on party expenditures. Buckley, by the way, said that you could place limitations on party expenditures. That was one of the expenditure areas that Buckley said it was right and proper for Congress to place limitations on. We have limitations on party expenditures today. 
Congress and the FEC also allowed part of these expenditures to be funded with money that might be referred to as `outside the system'--outside the system that we have just been discussing, the $1,000/$5,000 limitation system that we have just been discussing. We now call this other money outside the system soft money--unlimited moneys; no limitation on these moneys from corporations, labor unions, individuals. 
In 1991, now, moving along, the FEC--this is the Federal Election Commission, as we all know--decided that national parties could fund 35 percent of their generic voter-drive cost from soft money and 40 percent in an election year. So, now the soft money race was on. So now, we see, we were concerned about local grassroots participation. We let the parties send in more unlimited money for that purpose. Then we said OK, we can send some soft money in that you don't have to worry about limitations on, for that particular purpose. So the soft money drive was on and the public learned, in 1992, that the major party committees raised more than $83 million in soft money, which was 4 times the amount of soft money estimated to have been spent by the parties in 1984. 
In 1996 the explosion in soft money continued. Soft money receipts by the Republican National Party committees increased 178 percent over 1992, to $138 million; while Democratic Party committee receipts of soft money increased 242 percent over 1992 levels to $123 million. It is almost enough to make you long for the good old days back when many people were concerned about $5,000 PAC contributions. PACs were considered to be our greatest potential problem, not too long ago by many people. 
So, naturally with all this new money on hand there was a tremendous desire by people in the political system to marry up that money with the largest expenditure that we were all beginning to incur at that time, and of course that's television advertising. So, in the summer of 1995, Dick Morris fervently believed television advertisements comparing the President with the Republican Congress were keys to the President's reelection. He encouraged the President to opt out of the public financing program in order to run expensive TV ads that he felt were absolutely necessary. Because he understood at the time, under the public system, if you took the public money but you couldn't go out here and raise all this money on the side, all this soft money to run these additional programs--he said, `Mr. President, I wish you just wouldn't take the public money so we can have unlimited expenditures.' The President decided to take the money and figure out a way to get the unlimited expenditures anyway. He told Mr. Morris to come back with plan B. 
So, luckily for Mr. Morris, plan B was outlined for him in an advisory opinion, once again issued by the FEC. We talk about not putting the Government in this. The Government has been in this up to its eyebrows almost from the very beginning. Congress has been involved in it. Congress set up the Federal Election Commission. The Federal Election Commission comes with all these advisory opinions. They said you can use so much soft money for this, so much hard money for that, so many percentages for this purpose, so many percentages for the other purpose--that is the system we have now. The campaign finance reform bill would almost be a deregulation bill. This is not adding additional regulations on top of anything. This is doing away with some of this Rube Goldberg system that we have now. 
So, continuing on with this pattern, the FEC comes in again and, in August of 1995, they issued an opinion and, despite an attempt to use careful language, the clear result of this advisory opinion was to place the FEC stamp of approval for the first time on the use of soft money by national party committees to pay for broadcast media advertisements that directly reference Federal candidates. So, by lumping this candidate-specific but issue-based TV advertising with grassroots activity which, as we discussed a moment ago, was encouraged by the 1979 amendment, the FEC handed Mr. Morris his plan B on a silver, soft-money platter. 
The DNC and the Clinton-Gore campaign seized on the opportunity to use the FEC's hard/soft allocation regulations to run TV ads, using the 40 percent soft money. The first ones began running in October of 1995, shortly after this opinion was rendered. And so there we go. 
However, it is very important to note that the rules still prohibited soft money electioneering messages and coordination between the candidate and the committee. 
So, in summary, the national party could now spend soft money for a portion of its State-based party building, and it could directly spend soft money for a portion of its issue advocacy, or it could transfer soft money to the State parties. 
Again, this is the system we have today. Does this sound like a simple free-enterprise system that we are trying to somehow improperly mess with? This is the hopelessly complex, as we will see in a minute, ridiculous system that we have allowed to be created under our very noses. 
However, again, under the FEC rulings and court decisions, it should be noted that none of this soft money was supposed to go for activities that were to be coordinated with individual candidates. Nevertheless, by now the system had been haphazardly and without premeditation transformed from one which limited big money for Federal candidates into an attractive opportunity for anyone willing to push the soft money game to its next level and past what the law allowed. 
The Clinton-Gore campaign was willing. Briefly stated, their campaign circumvented the DNC's coordinated limit and used approximately $44 million in national committee soft money to their candidates' advantage through electioneering messages that they claimed to be `issue advertisements,' all the while certifying under our Presidential system, that they would not spend more than the public funding system was giving them. They were receiving the taxpayer funding all at the same time they were raising the $44 million outside the system. 
The President and the Vice President personally raised a lot of this money, putting them right back into the campaign fundraising chase that Congress specifically intended the campaign laws to put them above. The President personally reviewed and edited TV commercial scripts that the soft money went for and helped make the decision as to where the ads would be run. Again, soft money is not permitted to go to support individual candidates, and it is not supposed to be coordinated or directed by those candidates. Nevertheless, the Attorney General, through her opinion on this matter, permits this abuse, and we can fasten our seatbelts for the next elections unless we make some changes. 
The second large area that was exploited in the 1996 election cycle had to do with the transfer of large amounts of soft money from the national party to the State parties, which in turn would be directed by the national parties as to how to use the funds for national party purposes. In other words, the national party is just using the State parties as a passthrough. 
Under FEC rules, the amount of permissible soft money expenditures by State parties depends on the ratio of Federal to non-Federal candidates that is on the State's November ballot. For example, if there are two Federal races, say a Presidential and a congressional race, and eight non-Federal local races, the State party can pay for 80 percent of their generic activities with soft dollars. 
Again, this is the simple, deregulated system that we have today. 
Given that hard dollars raised in $1,000 increments are more difficult to raise, this gives an incentive to have the State party pay for as many activities as possible using soft money. In other words, now they have a system all contorted so that States can use more soft money than the Federal can, so you game the Federal system as much as you can through the party committee. The President raises the soft money, runs it through the DNC and spends the soft money additionally to what he is allowed to spend through the public financing. Then you go to the States, and because the States can use more soft money than you can, you run the rest of it through the States and have the States run the same ads that you are running at the Federal level for the same purpose, of reelecting the President. Now, that is the system that we have today. 
So to take advantage of the system, the national party committees began transferring soft money to State party committees to utilize their higher soft-money allowance. 
In the crucial 1995 pre-election year, according to the FEC reports, the DNC transferred almost $11.4 million of soft money to State parties, followed by another $6.4 million in the first quarter of 1996. The RNC shifted a little over $2.4 million to the States in about that same period of time. Ultimately, the DNC quietly transferred at least $32 million, and perhaps as much as $64 million by some estimates, to State Democratic Party committees in the 1996 election cycle. Of course, much of this money was used for television commercials. 
This transfer allowed, of course, the State party committees to use national party soft money in areas to help their Federal election goals more than if the national committee 
had made the expenditures directly. The DNC, on its own, would have had to purchase the same air time under the guidelines requiring a high percentage of hard dollars. 
Our hearings demonstrated that on some occasions, the very same ad would be run by both the national party and the State party, all created by the DNC Clinton-Gore consultants, Squier, Knapp & Ochs. Reports of the receipts and expenditures of a dozen State Democratic parties from July 1, 1995, to March 31, 1996, indicate the State entities operated as a little more than passthroughs for the DNC to pay for the production and broadcasting of ads by the Squier firm. The Squier firm, of course, was in the White House consulting with the President, was the paid media consultant for the DNC, for the Clinton-Gore campaign and, at the same time, was running these ads and creating these ads for these State parties, and, in many cases, they were the same ads. As we see, the DNC and Clinton-Gore campaign found a way to use the big corporate, union and individual soft money they could raise for the direct benefit of their own campaign. They could actually raise the soft money from the DNC, which would, in turn, spend it as they were directed by the Clinton-Gore campaign in order to benefit the national campaign. 
So it was all an obvious ruse to anybody who took a look at it, but it could work in a world where the FEC might take 4 or 5 years to impose a modest fine and where the Attorney General was willing to adopt a tortured Clinton-Gore legal defense theory in order to justify such actions. 
Of course, labor unions and 501(c)(4) tax-exempt independent groups supporting both parties have kept apace of these new developments. They, too, now systematically run ads supporting or targeting specific candidates while often coordinating their activities with the candidate they support as well as with each other. 
As with the national parties, they claim the ads they run are `issue ads' and, therefore, can't be regulated. Sometimes they are and sometimes maybe they are not. We have to decide that on an individual fact-by-fact basis. However, they take the position that, in most cases, they are not coordinating factual issues. But if they are coordinated with the candidate, it is considered to be a contribution to the candidate, according to Buckley. 
Buckley has been quoted, of course, as limiting the regulation that Congress can place on expenditures, but in the Buckley decision, it says, if you set up a kind of a sham deal where you are supposed to be making these independent expenditures but you are really doing it at the direction of the candidate, that is not independent and that is considered a contribution to the candidate. The FEC has, in many cases, supported that proposition. 
There is nothing in the court cases that would indicate that that is proper. In fact, quite the contrary. In fact, the FEC takes the position that even issue ads which are coordinated are illegal. National parties and independent groups seem to be taking the position that, `We didn't coordinate, but if we did, it may be legal anyway.' But the DNC and the Clinton-Gore campaign kind of stand alone on that issue because their soft-money expenditures were coordinated and directed by the President so openly and clearly and blatantly that they had no choice but to just adopt the idea, in the face of court decisions and in the face of FEC rulings, that it was still legal and proper, and the Attorney General has gone along with them on it. 
As I said, Buckley addressed the problems of would-be contributors avoiding the contribution limits by the simple expedient of paying directly for media advertisements for a candidate when the expenditures were controlled by or coordinated with the candidate. Buckley stated--and this is a quotation from the much-quoted Buckley--`. . . such controlled and coordinated expenditures are treated as contributions rather than expenditures under the Act's contributions ceilings [And this]. . . prevents attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions. . . .' 
That is the Buckley decision. But, of course, in the present environment, it prevents no such thing. Buckley says legally it prevents it. Practically we see that it does not. 
It certainly makes no difference that the person who wants to purchase the TV ads runs his contributions through the political parties instead of directly. The potential corrupting influence that people have been concerned with for many, many years in this country and others is there anyway. Nevertheless, the Attorney General seems to have adopted the Clinton-Gore campaign argument. 
The Attorney General's position will have many ramifications, Mr. President. Her position is based on the idea that soft money contributions are not `contributions' within the definition of the act, and she thinks since soft-money contributions really don't fall within that definition of contributions, then they are not regulated, so that you can have unlimited soft money over here, but we won't call them contributions, so they are not regulated. 
Well, if that blanket position is true, then foreign soft-money contributions are not illegal either, because they came under the same definition. If soft-money contributions of any kind are not really contributions as defined by the act, then that is going to apply to domestic or foreign. Under her interpretation, you could have unlimited amounts of foreign money brought in and put by a political campaign into a soft-money account and used for so-called issue ads, and it would be perfectly legal. 
These are the things we are going to see in the next election cycle. 
If Congress does not want to be bound by this absurd interpretation, then we are going to have to act. So, in summary, we see that the 1996 elections produced some clear violations of the criminal law, and Congress' job in this area is to exercise oversight over the Justice Department to make sure the laws are enforced. We need no changes in the law with regard to these matters. 
However, we also see that because of the way in which soft money, issue advocacy and coordination are being used and allowed to be used, as a practical matter, we are left with no campaign finance system at all, and we must decide if that is really what we want. 
Because all these loopholes have been opened up now, contrary to our original intent, we find ourselves with a situation where we weren't the ones who opened up the barn door, but all the horses are rapidly leaving. Do we want to fix it or do we want to take advantage of it, because it essentially helps all incumbents, and we go through this exercise every so often and get a pretty good vote, but not quite enough, and now we can have our cake and eat it, too. 
If we had come to this floor and passed a piece of legislation that allowed the current system, they would have laughed us out of town, and nobody here would have had the courage to do it. 
So the question is whether or not, if we find ourselves with it, we are going to take advantage of it because it benefits an incumbent. Some would welcome this turn of events. Some honestly believe there is not enough money in our political system and that large corporations, unions and others should be allowed to make unlimited contributions to candidates. 
I believe that those who hold this opinion have won the day so far, because I think that is exactly where we are now. And I think it is tragic, and I believe that those of us in both parties who support such a system because we think it might be beneficial to us as incumbents in some way are being very shortsighted, because I believe that no system that requires us or allows us as elected officials, including the President of the United States, to spend so much time raising so much money from so many people who have interests before us that we are passing legislation on, no such system will be allowed to survive indefinitely. 
Where does such a system leave the average citizen with his or her $100 contribution? Is there any doubt as to why the more money we raise the fewer people vote? 
Throughout history, people have recognized the inherent problems associated with large amounts of money going to those who make public policy. It does not require a very smart person to see the inherent problem with that. Nineteen centuries ago, the historian Plutarch thought that that was, more than anything else, what brought down the Roman Republic. Seven centuries ago, the Venetians imposed strict limitations on what could be given public officials. If the donors had favors to ask, they were not allowed to give anything. 
Political influence money brought down the entire political systems in Japan and Italy. We have had our own money scandals--the corporate influence-buying scandals at the end of the last century as well as the Watergate campaign finance scandal that in large part caused the legislation of 1974. So we do not have to look very far to see the relevant historical precedence of what we are dealing with. 
It is unlikely that we have recently abridged the laws of human nature or the corrupting influence of power or what people are willing to do to get it. In fact, that is what the 1996 scandals are all about. 
When you add all of this history, the fact that we now have spent--last time--$2.7 billion on our national elections, with all this amount of money involved, it is a virtual certainty we will have another major scandal in the not too distant future if we do nothing. 
There are some who would try to convince those of us who are somewhat new to these hallowed halls that campaign finance reform is somehow not conservative or it is anti-Republican. 
Well, I believe that the best witness on that is Mr. Republican himself, Barry Goldwater. In testifying before Congress in 1983, he said that big money `eats at the heart of the democratic process. It feeds the growth of special interest groups created solely to channel money into political campaigns. It creates the impression that every candidate is bought and owned by the biggest givers. And it causes elected officials to devote more time to raising money than to their public duties. If present trends continue, voter participation will drop significantly'--sound familiar?--`public respect will fall into an all-time low'--sound familiar?--`political campaigns will be controlled by slick packaging artists'--sound familiar?--`and neglect of public duties by absentee officials will undermine government operations.' 
Now, that is the man that we call `Mr. Republican.' Reading his `Conscience of a Conservative' as a college student had a lot to do with my becoming a Republican. And I do not think anybody ever accused Barry Goldwater of being an enemy of the first amendment. 
I would ask those who are rightfully concerned about maintaining the authority of Congress in our system of checks and balances, those of us who criticize the courts--and I am one of them--and who criticize our Federal agencies--and I am one of them--if we really want the way we elect the highest officials in our Federal system to be determined not by Congress but by the courts, and by the Federal Election Commission, and by the Attorney General, and by those running for office who have the most audacity. 
So while McCain-Feingold may achieve its predicted fate again this year--and maybe not--we need to realize that this overall issue is going to continue to stare Congress in the face. And as the next campaign makes the last one look like child's play, we are going to have to ultimately decide in this body, is this what we really want? And since it involves the very fundamentals of our democracy, don't we have an obligation to deal with it? 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMPSON. Absolutely, I would say to my friend from Arizona. Nobody ever knows for sure what is going to happen, 
but if the past is prologue, we have seen throughout history and in our own recent history, and certainly in the history of Europe, that when the money gets out of hand, the scandals come. 
And we have gone from a system now where we were arguing whether it should be a $1,000 limitation per individual or a little more or little less or whether it should be a $5,000 PAC limitation or not, and a big controversy whether that had a corrupting influence, to where now, instead of soliciting those amounts, we are soliciting $250,000 from these large entities. 
So if the past has brought those kinds of political problems and legal problems to us, I think we can almost rest assured that in the future, with those amounts involved, that we will have the same thing. 
As I said, I do not think that we have abridged the laws of human nature over the last few years. And I suppose that Lord Acton's admonition about the corrupting influence of power is still very much alive and well and with us. 
So I say to my friend, I regret to say it, but I know that you predicted it would take another one to get anybody's attention on this issue. Now we have had one. Your prediction has come true. I am afraid that I am just following up with the next prediction.

Mr. THOMPSON. As a practical matter, I think there are no restraints. I think under the present situation, with the FEC interpretations that have come down, with the Attorney General decisions and opinions that she has made, I literally think that you could call up someone, if you knew someone in Russia or China or Brazil, or wherever you wanted to--or California for that matter--get them to send a suitcase full of a million dollars cash, launder it, if you needed to, put it into a soft money account, and as long as you used issue ads and did not say `vote for' or `vote against' under this current ridiculous setup of interpretations we have now, that is permissible. That is the system we have currently.

Mr. THOMPSON. Well, I do not want to delve too deeply into the motivations of anyone. People can have different reasons for their thoughts. But it does puzzle me because, you know, in looking back at the history of this thing, some of the leading Republicans, some of the leading conservatives, as well as some of the leading liberals and Democrats in this body, have all joined together on some of these basic things. 
What I think the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin and I are trying to do here is kind of get back to where we were 20, 25 years ago. We do not have that situation now. I hope the answer to your question is not that we see this current situation as an opportunity for incumbents. And we know that most of the money goes to incumbents. I have been a challenger; I have been an incumbent, like we all have. And we know how the system works and operates. And that is fine. That will always be the case. 
We have some certain advantages, inherent advantages, in terms of news coverage and things of that nature that I have no intention of willingly giving up. And I think it is fine that I have those advantages. But the money situation has gotten out of hand, and incumbents have such an advantage there that about 90 percent of all the kind of money that we are talking about--well, that is not the correct figure either--but the great majority of the money we are talking about now goes into incumbents. 
In times past, in this body those considerations have not ruled, and I do not think ultimately they will here now. And I am not saying that that is the motivation. All I am saying is that I hope that is not the motivation. I am afraid that if we do not do some things--the Senator from Kentucky pointed out problems with Buckley that we have on the free speech side of things. He makes some valid points there. It is a problematic situation. It has to be either not dealt with at all, because of the Court interpretations, or it has to be dealt with very, very carefully. I do not know how far we can go constitutionally. 
But that has nothing to do with the contribution side. We decided back in 1907 that we did not want corporate contributions, large or small, and yet now we have effectively repealed that law, in my estimation.

Mr. THOMPSON. Well, I think if we do not do something about it, the big difference will be that people will not have to hide that activity anymore because it would be considered permissible. You might have some limitations on cash and things of that nature, but in terms of the amounts, you know, one of the Cabinet members of the President at that time allegedly was going around and, you know, hitting up these corporations for pretty good sums of money--at that point, $50,000, increments like that, some of it cash.

Mr. THOMPSON. So we decided that--I think the country decided, after that, that we needed to decide what we wanted to have corporations and large labor unions do. Clearly, they needed to participate. We set up political action committees and decided how much we wanted them to participate. And we said to corporations, labor unions, `You can't do any more than that in terms of direct political contribution.' We said to individuals, `You can't spend more than $1,000 per election per individual.' That was not indexed. I think that was a mistake. 
I think that $1,000, frankly, is ridiculously low nowadays, and if we had a higher hard money limitation that maybe so much money would not go into these independent ads and more money would go into hard money. But we sat down and consciously decided, I think, as a Congress and as a country, how much was appropriate for candidates to get their message out and to communicate with people and in what line did you get to a point where the influence might appear to be too great. These were all conscious decisions. 
All I am saying to this body now is that we at least need to recognize that we are now addressing whether or not we still adhere to that or not or are we going to a system where there are no limitations. 
Some people make an eloquent argument there should be no limitations at all. But it ought to be debated. We ought to hash that out here on the floor and not fool the American people into thinking that everything is basically just the way it was, and we do not want to encumber the system with additional regulations, and everything is fairly simple, and everything is fairly clean. 
The Government, as I said, has been up to its eyeballs in this from day one, sometimes beneficially and sometimes ridiculously. And this law, to me, is just like most other major pieces of legislation. After 20 years, you learn some things about it. 
You have unintended consequences. You have court interpretations that go against what you thought you were doing. 
So you have to sit down and revisit it and bring it up to date. I hope we don't avoid the responsibility of sitting down and revisiting this. If the majority sentiment is that we don't want any rules anymore, that we want to allow candidates to pick up the phone and raise $5 million, maybe run it through a committee but coordinate all of it and direct it so that you can slam somebody maybe 2 years in advance who might be a potential rival--if we really want to do that, say that is what we are doing and lay it out in a piece of legislation. 
It is a hodgepodge now. We argue about what is legal and illegal. We have had some people say it is just violations of the law, what we need to do is enforce the law. That is true. Other people say, `I don't see any violations of the law.' See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. All we need is reform. They are in part true. The biggest problem is the gray area that everybody has assumed up until this last election was against the law. 
The Clinton-Gore campaign primarily went way beyond that and the Attorney General is trying to back them up. We can stamp our feet about it--I think she is dead wrong-- or we can sit down and say no, this is not the way it is, Attorney General, this is not the way it is, FEC, or courts, within the Constitution. We can make our own determinations as to what the Federal Government should be doing with regard to the election of Federal candidates. 
You and I do not want the Federal Government involved in many aspects of people's lives. I decided a long time ago, the motivation has to do with lots of other things, like term limits and how long people stay when they are here, what their motivations are when they come here, what is primarily on their mind. All those kinds of things are the business of this body. That is Federal Government business. I make no apology for that. 
So whether it is by inaction or by action, we are going to be determining how we elect people for Federal offices in this country.

Everybody doesn't do it. Everybody doesn't do the things that we saw the Clinton-Gore campaign do last time.

Mr. THOMPSON. Is not being pushed hard enough, I don't think. We finally got a couple of indictments on matters that have been on the public record for a long, long time now. I am willing to reserve a certain amount of judgment to see what comes up. Based on the public record we have there could be a dozen indictments, based on things that have been on public record for a long, long time now. I expect there will be more indictments coming down the pike, but up until now it has not been aggressive. I'm afraid the trail has gotten cold on many. If you don't act promptly on some of these things, it is a lost cause. I'm afraid that has happened. 
Having said all of that, they can't blind us to the fact that separate and apart from the clear violations of the law which do not need amendment--they are clear laws, they are clear violations--we have now created another area that does not require our attention, except our oversight, to see the law is enforced. What doesn't require our attention because of what the courts have done, because of what the FEC has done, because of what we have done and because of what the Attorney General has done, we have a hodgepodge that results in the allowance of unlimited amounts of money coming into any campaign almost under any circumstances. You have to run it through a committee, perhaps. You have to be careful how you word the TV ads, but as a practical matter we have no limitations. That is what deserves our attention.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Dr. David Satcher of Tennessee. I have listened to the debate. I have talked to Dr. Satcher about the issues involved. I am convinced that this is an outstanding appointment that the President has made. Whether you look at Dr. Satcher's history in terms of his commitment to his family, whether you look in terms of his commitment to his community, or whether you look in terms of his commitment to his profession, I believe he is an outstanding individual. From everyone that I have talked to, I have come away with that conclusion. Clearly there are some policy issues on which we disagree. I think we have one in terms of the debate on partial-birth abortion. Frankly, in looking at the issues and listening to the debate, I think that that is at the crux of the concern as far as Dr. Satcher's confirmation. I think a lot of these other issues are collateral issues. 
I have talked to him about this. I am a strong supporter of the ban on partial-birth abortions. I think there is no justification whatsoever for that onerous procedure. And, in response to questions on this issue, Dr. Satcher has said: 
While I support the concept of a ban on late-term abortions, like the President I feel that if there are risks of severe health consequences for the mother then that decision should not be made by the Government, but by the woman in conjunction with her family and her physician. 
Again, he supports the concept of a ban on late-term abortions but he believes there should be more thought given to the situation of severe health consequences for the mother. I understand what he is talking about. Personally, I have concerns about that exception and its potential for abuse. Without getting into that whole debate again, I can simply say I disagree with the President's position on that issue. However I have discussed this issue with Dr. Satcher and I have read what he has written in response to questions on this issue. I am satisfied he does not intend to use the position of Surgeon General to advocate or promote abortion in any way. In fact, he said: 
Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of using the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I share no one's political agenda, and I want to use the power of these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans and not divide them. 
He went on to say: 
If I am confirmed by the Senate I will strongly promote a message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth which I believe can help to reduce the number of abortions in our country. 
This is the commitment that he has made. Many of us have been concerned in times past that this particular position of Surgeon General would be used as a bully pulpit by individuals to promote policies that are contrary to the best interests of this country. I think it has been done in the past. I do not feel that Dr. Satcher will do this. I think he has a good concept of the good that can be done in this job. I think he understands the terrible problems that our young people have. I think he sees an opportunity to do some good for these young people. Everything in his history indicates that that would be his attitude in approaching this position, and I believe him when he says that and I respect his position on that. 
I believe that, generally speaking, a President has the right and should have the right to appoint the kind of nominees, the kind of people he wants to these positions. I believe that, whether the President is a Democrat or a Republican. There are some situations where the positions or the background is so out of the norm, out of the mainstream, that we as a confirming body have to take a contrary position to that of the President. I think those situations ought to be rare. I have considered Dr. Satcher's record. I do not see anything in his record where that particular result on our part should obtain. 
Unfortunately, I think sometimes in these confirmation debates we have a policy problem with the President, or we have a policy problem with the individual who the President nominates. But, instead of concentrating on that policy problem we begin to look for other things that we perhaps could use against this nominee. I think we get into, then, issues sometimes of credibility and veracity and character and things like that that, frankly, I think is unfortunate. I think it has happened on both sides of the aisle with regard to nominees from both sides of the aisle in times past. 
I think we would be well served to keep our eye on the ball. Let's look at the history of this particular individual. I don't think anybody can question his character or his veracity or his commitment to his profession. We have a policy issue here. We need to address whether or not the fact that he supports the President, as all the President's nominees for any position that comes up are going to do--whether or not his support for the President in this case is sufficient to disqualify him for this position. I think the answer to that is no. I think he will be a good Surgeon General. 
He does happen to be a Tennessean. That does not disqualify him either, in my estimation. And therefore I respectfully submit this gentleman should be confirmed. 
I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak this morning. I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Levin and eight of our colleagues in submitting a substitute for S. 981, the Regulatory Improvement Act. This substitute incorporates some clarifications and improvements to the bill as result of our Committee hearing, written statements and letters, and a series of discussions with the Administration, environmental and public interest groups, State and local government, scholars, and other interested parties. I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the substitute and a list of the major changes to the substitute be included in the Record following my remarks. The substitute is the text that we will use as the basis for our Committee markup. This bill is an effort by many of us who want to improve the quality of government to find a common solution. The supporters of this bill represent a real diversity of political viewpoints, but we share the same goals. We want an effective government that protects public health, well-being and the environment. We want our government to achieve those goals in the most sensible and efficient way possible. We want to do the best we can with what we've got, and to do more good at less cost if possible. The Regulatory Improvement Act will help us do just that. 
The Regulatory Improvement Act is based on a simple premise: that people have a right to know how and why government agencies make their most important and expensive regulatory decisions. The S. 981 not only gives people the right to know; it gives them the right to see--to see how the government works, or how it doesn't. And by providing people with information the government uses to make decisions, it gives people a real opportunity to influence those decisions. So much of what goes on right now is pretty much done in secret. We're going to change that. 
Second, the bill will make government more accountable to the people it serves. S. 981 is based on the idea that increased public scrutiny of government decision making--and people who make those decisions--will lead to better and more accountable government performance. It gives people the ability to look over the Federal government's shoulder. 
The Regulatory Improvement Act will deliver more decisionmaking power closer to home--and into the hands of State and local governments. The bill empowers people and their State and local officials to provide input into the Federal system. It will make the Federal government more mindful of how unfunded mandates can burden communities and interfere with local priorities. When I became Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee last year, I asked the General Accounting Office to investigate whether the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 was improving regulations, which was one of its goals. Unfortunately, the answer is `No.' GAO released the report today. It is entitled, Unfunded Mandates: Reform Act Has Had Little Effect on Agencies' Rulemaking Actions. I view S. 981 as really phase two of the unfunded mandates reform effort, because it will make Federal regulators--not just Congress--more sensitive to local needs. 
Finally, the Regulatory Improvement Act will improve the quality of government decision making--which will lead to a more effective and efficient Federal government. The Regulatory Improvement Act will require the Federal government to make better use of modern decisionmaking tools (such as risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis), which are currently under-used. Right now, these tools are simply options--options that aren't used as much or as well as they should be. The bill also will help the Federal government to set smarter priorities--to better focus money and other resources on the most serious problems. 
The Regulatory Improvement Act bill builds on the Clinton Administration's government-wide reinvention efforts. It codifies many of the requirements of Executive Order 12866 and the principles of other Reinventing Regulation initiatives. It will give some needed horsepower to these efforts. This will help us reach our common goal: improving the quality of government. That's why the bill has broad bipartisan support, including myself and Senator Levin, as well as Senators Glenn, Abraham, Robb, Roth, Rockefeller, Stevens, Grams, and Cochran. This is a common sense effort we all can be proud of.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to make a few brief comments with my colleague, Senator Lott, in support of H. J. Res. 95, a resolution passed by the House of Representatives which gives the consent of Congress to the Chickasaw Trail Economic Development Compact. As the U.S. Constitution requires all State compacts to be approved by Congress, Representatives Ed Bryant of Tennessee and Roger Wicker of Mississippi recently introduced this legislation in the House. 
This Compact will allow the States of Tennessee and Mississippi to determine the feasibility of establishing an industrial park which would straddle the border between the two States. This proposed Industrial Park would lie in both Fayette County, TN. and Marshall County, MS. Governors Sundquist and Fordice have each expressed their support for this initiative, as they believe this type of industrial park will be strengthened by taking a regional approach to industrial recruitment and development. 
I believe that Tennessee will benefit from this initiative by combining the competitive assets of southwest Tennessee and Northern Mississippi to create an attractive and viable business park. 
I ask my friend from Mississippi, Senator Lott, if he agrees that this initiative will be of significant benefit to our two States and, indeed, to much of the Southeast region?

Mr. THOMPSON. There is a provision in the amended version of S. 1228 that I feel needs clarification. In setting the design parameters for the new dollar coin, the legislation makes clear that the coin should be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, and include other features to ensure that the coin is not confused with any existing coins. The last design parameter within the legislation states that the coin should have anticounterfeiting properties of coinage in circulation at the time of the bill's enactment. I ask the Senator, is this provision intended to require the Mint to use clad coin technology in the new dollar coin?

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up the nomination of Ronald L. Gilman of Memphis to be United States circuit judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. I want to thank Chairman Hatch of the Judiciary Committee for taking up and reporting this nomination so promptly and the majority leader for scheduling a vote on it so soon after the nomination was reported to the Senate. The Sixth Circuit currently has two vacancies, so it is important to my State and the others in the circuit that this vacancy get filled quickly. 
Ron Gilman is a native of Memphis, where he was raised. After attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Law School, he returned to Memphis in 1967 and since then has spent his entire legal career at the leading Tennessee law firm of Ferris, Mathews, Gilman, Branan and Hellen. I might point out that the Mathews in that firm name is former Senator Harlan Mathews. 
Mr. Gilman rapidly became established as a leader of the Memphis bar, serving as president of the Young Lawyers Division of the Memphis Bar Association and president of the Young Lawyers Conference of the Tennessee Bar Association. He subsequently served a term as president of both the Memphis and Tennessee Bar Associations. 
Mr. Gilman is eminently qualified to serve as a judge. His legal career has been as distinguished as it has been multifaceted. He has practiced criminal law, civil litigation, particularly commercial litigation, general business law, and estate planning. Most recently, he has spent a good deal of his practice involved in alternative means of dispute resolution, often serving as an arbitrator and mediator. From a background such as his, I think we can safely expect that Mr. Gilman will bring to the bench the legal practitioner's bent for common sense and careful application of the law rather than an ideological approach to the law. 
Mr. Gilman is not only one of Tennessee's most distinguished lawyers, but a leader in the Memphis community as well, having served leadership roles with the Boy Scouts, the Memphis Jewish Home, and Memphis Senior Citizens Services, among other groups. He is a recipient of the Sam A. Myar, Jr. Memorial Award for outstanding service to the legal profession and the Memphis community. 
This nomination enjoys widespread and bipartisan support. Both Republican Representative Ed Bryant and Democratic Representative Harold Ford, Jr., support the nomination. The entire Tennessee legal community supports the nomination. I have heard not a single negative word about Mr. Gilman's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this nomination.  
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I understand that the so-called Lott amendment will be considered this afternoon after lunch--an amendment to the campaign finance reform bill known as the McCain-Feingold bill. I want to address that briefly. I have given it serious consideration because I think it is a serious matter. 
I must say that I agree with the underlying intent of this legislation. I support the concept of this amendment. I would like to see it enacted into law. I believe that American workers need all the protections they can get with regard to the matters that are addressed in this amendment. In fact, I intend to cosponsor freestanding legislation that would give us an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on this idea. 
But, Mr. President, as I look at this, I became concerned whether or not there is any chance of this amendment ever becoming law because, as I understand it, it is an amendment to the campaign finance bill. When I ask around whether or not those who are supporting the amendment will support the bill in case the amendment passes, I don't get any affirmative responses. In other words, as I see the state of play now, if we pass this amendment, then those who are primarily in support of the amendment will still oppose the underlying legislation. So there is no chance, as I see it, that the amendment or the ideas expressed in the amendment have any chance at all for becoming law in this process. 
I am an original cosponsor of this particular legislation, the McCain-Feingold bill. I cannot align myself, even though I agree with the underlying intent, with an effort that has no chance of success in terms of passing any legislation or passing an amendment but that would, in effect, make sure that the underlying bill, McCain-Feingold, and the so-called Lott amendment, would both never become the law of this land. That is what we are faced with. 
I must say it makes it a little bit more difficult for me when it is openly expressed as an effort to kill the underlying legislation. 
So, Mr. President, I will do what I can for the rest of this Congress to see that the working men and women are protected in this regard. 
I think it is a noble settlement. I think it is a good idea. There is freestanding legislation on this which I will support. But since I see no hope and no opportunity for this amendment to ever have the force and effect of law, then I cannot support it and will not.

Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I intend to support final passage of H.R. 2203, the fiscal year 1998 energy and water development appropriations conference report, because it includes funding for a number of projects important to Tennessee, including the National Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge. 
However, I want to express my deep concern about the section of the conference report dealing with the Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA]. The conference report includes $70 million for TVA's nonpower programs in fiscal year 1998, which is $36 million less than TVA received to perform these functions last year. However, the House version of the bill had zeroed out funding for TVA, so I am grateful that the conferees provided most of the Senate-passed level of $86 million for next year. 
Unfortunately, the conferees also stipulated that this will be the last year that they will provide funding for TVA to carry out its nonpower activities. They warned that, beginning next year, these nonpower responsibilities will either have to be transferred to some other Federal agency or paid for with revenues from TVA's self-financing power program. 
Mr. President, I want to be sure everyone understands what we are talking about when we discuss TVA's nonpower programs. We are talking about flood control and navigation on the Tennessee River, our Nation's fifth-largest river system. We are talking about the operation and maintenance of 14 navigational locks and 54 dams--to which the TVA power system contributes its proportionate share of funding. And we are talking about the management of 480,000 acres of recreational lakes, nearly 11,000 miles of shoreline, and 435,000 acres of public land--including such unique national resources as the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in Tennessee and Kentucky. 
During the debate on this legislation, some have claimed that the residents of the seven-State TVA region are receiving an unfair Federal subsidy that no one else in the country receives. Madam President, that is simply not true. In every other region of the country, these types of natural resource and infrastructure management activities are performed by some Federal agency, whether it is the Army Corps of Engineers, the National Park Service, the National Forest Service, or the Bureau of Reclamation. In the southeast region, they have traditionally been carried out by the TVA. But if the TVA does not perform them next year, someone else will have to. There is no question that these are Federal responsibilities. 
Perhaps the most disturbing suggestion that has been made in recent weeks is that the TVA power program should pick up the cost of these Federal land and water stewardship responsibilities. That is nothing less than an unfair tax on TVA ratepayers. As I said before, these are Federal responsibilities that are paid for by the Federal Government in every other region of the country. Nowhere else are utility ratepayers expected to assume the costs of these types of Federal responsibilities by paying more for their electricity. 
So while I appreciate the fact that the conferees agreed to provide funding for TVA to meet its Federal obligations this year, I am very concerned about what they have proposed for the future. And I want to be clear about one thing: it is not acceptable for Congress to walk away from its Federal responsibilities in one region of the country while continuing to provide for them everywhere else. Over the course of the coming year, I plan to work very hard with my colleagues to come up with a solution that is fair and equitable for the people of the Tennessee Valley.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, proponents of campaign finance reform say it is an assault on the Constitution. I say that McCain-Feingold is an assault on an incumbent's protected system that is rapidly losing faith with the American people. These claims about government takeover, and government regulation, and big government, of course, resonate with me as well as they do many other people, because I'm against that. I'm against the more intrusive government and I'm against more and more regulation, and I'm against government doing things that it should not be doing, especially the Federal Government. 
However, I think we have too quickly divided up into liberal and conservative counts and Democrat and Republican counts on this issue. As I read my history, Senator Barry Goldwater, the father of modern conservatism, in many people's view, was one of the most avid proponents of campaign finance reform a few years ago. 
So let's go back to the basics. People who are basically conservative think that the Government ought to do the things the Government ought to do and not things that it shouldn't. What should the Government be doing? Mr. President, if the way we elect our Federal officials and the motivations that they come to Washington with is not relevant and is not something that we ought to be concerned with, then what is? That is the basis of Government. Government does a lot of things it should not be doing, but how we elect our Federal officials, who are the arbiters of everything else in society anymore, seemingly, is certainly the subject of our attention. 
As I listen to this debate today, it is almost like under the current system we don't have regulation and that we are trying to 
impose regulation on an otherwise pristine system. We have the most heavily regulated system in the area of campaign finance reform than almost any other area in the country. Under the current system, you have a Federal Election Commission with detailed rules, timeframes, limit frames and so forth. You have $1,000 limitation; you have $5,000 limitation for PACs; you have $20,000 limitation as far as committees are concerned; an overall $25,000 limitation as to how much you can contribute in 1 year. You have soft money rules, you have hard money rules, you have percentages of soft money you can do certain ads with--there has to be a certain percentage of soft and hard money. You have transfers of money going back and forth between State and national parties, all under a detailed set of rules that nobody understands. To run in a political campaign any more nowadays you have to have a team of lawyers and a team of accountants and a team of people keeping up with all the regulation. 
That is our current system. My friend from Utah talks about our friend Jack Kemp and Mr. Forbes and how it would be much better if we had a different kind of system in our Presidential primaries. That is our current system he is complaining about. I think he makes some good points there. I think we ought to look at limitation amounts there. I think they are somewhat ridiculous and too low. All of that is our current system. 
So, what we are doing here, it looks to me like in McCain-Feingold is basically two things: One is a ban on soft money; secondly, it is saying about independent expenditures, that if you have candidate expenditures, you call them that and treat them that way. 
Under the current law, express advocacy is regulated now. It is regulated now. This idea that we are going to cut off somebody from saying something or that we are going to shut people up and close people off is simply not true. That makes interesting rhetoric but it is not in this bill, it is not in this legislation. 
What it basically says is two things. In 1974 we passed a law and we went along for almost two decades, electing Presidents under that law. Not a breath of scandal as far as campaign finance reform under that law and under the rules that we set forth then, for soft money problems in that entire period of time.

Mr. THOMPSON. For about two decades we did not have a soft money problem because people abided under the rules laid down in 1974. 
What has happened since that time is that soft money has come into the system and now we have about $262 million in soft money in the system that we didn't have back in 1974 when we laid down the rules at that time.

<DOCNO>105-thompson-tn-6-19970926</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, yes, that is absolutely true. 
That, therein, lies the problem. We had a system for about two decades whereby people made a deal with the Government to run for President, and that is we will take millions of dollars in public money and we don't raise any private money. 
The Supreme Court held that up, it worked fine, no scandal, no constitutional problem, until we decided that there was not enough money in the system and that there were ways that we could get more money for our Presidential campaigns. We have just seen the results of that. The soft money situation started. We figured out a way that money could be given to the parties for the benefit of the Presidential candidates, and you could just add that, to the public financing that we already had. And so in this last campaign we had about $262 million in soft money, in addition, which was about 10 times what it had been a decade before. And that is the situation that we have now. 
So some people are saying, look, let's basically go back to what we thought we were doing in 1974. A lot of people disagree with that, certainly. A lot of people don't think we ought to do that. A lot of people don't like things that smack of public financing at all. A lot of people don't realize that we have public financing for Presidential campaigns in this country, as anathema as that phrase is. But now, after a situation that worked pretty good for a while, nobody was saying there wasn't enough money in our Presidential campaigns. I don't think anybody was saying we didn't have enough commercials during the Presidential years. It worked pretty good. But now we have this additional influx. We had a system that some people opposed and that some people thought was good. It was our system. To say that it was totally laissez faire, free market, unregulated is simply unfair. We had a system. Now we have seen a gaming of the system, whereby millions of dollars in addition though that is put on the plate. 
Now, at a minimum, if that is what we ought to want to do, we ought to revisit this as Congress. This is not something Congress came up with. Congress didn't say soft money was a good idea. Congress didn't say the current system we have is what we want. It was done little by little, by the FEC, by a court decision here, and by the FEC; advisory opinions. And then one party would see an opportunity for soft money and the other party, instead of blowing the whistle, would jump on the bandwagon, too. So we now have tremendous sums of money poured into our Presidential campaigns that we did not envision in 1974. 
Now, again, if we think that is a great idea, let's come back as a Congress and put our stamp of approval on that. But just under the idea of congressional prerogatives alone, under the idea that we should not let some commission downtown set such important rules for us, where we have legislated something quite different, under those ideas, we ought to revisit it. That is another good reason why we are having this debate. 
On the other hand, some of us don't think that is such a good idea, that we should not only revisit it, but we should do something about it. I think that, basically, what we are doing in the soft money debate here is going back originally to where we were when we last legislated in this area. When we passed the current law in 1974, we did not say it was OK for major corporations and major labor unions to give hundreds of thousands of dollars for the benefit of Presidential candidates in addition to what was publicly financed. We have gotten totally away from what we said we wanted.

Mr. THOMPSON. As the Senator knows, much of the soft money went for those kinds of ads. I would not be supporting a provision that I did not think would pass constitutional muster. What this bill does is basically what the Senator says. It says that you look to the circumstances. If something is called an issue ad, but it is really an ad for a particular candidate, it is called such. If it walks, quacks, and acts like a duck, we are going to call it a duck. You can still say whatever you want to say. Nobody is shutting anybody off. There are no free speech implications here. But if you are really going to do a candidate ad--and in some cases, we have candidates going around coordinating with independent groups, and the groups run an attack ad on their opponent, the candidate dictates where and when that ad is going to be, and all the details and the composition of it, and it is called an independent expenditure. 
What this would do would be to say we have a regulatory system. Whether anybody likes it or not, we already have a regulatory system. If it is an express ad for a particular candidate, it is already regulated. What this legislation would do is say you would look at the factors, look at the given situation. If it is an express ad, if it is really for a candidate, we are just going to call it that, and it is going to be regulated under the same system express ads are regulated under now.

Mr. THOMPSON. Well, I think that is a direction that we are trying to head in. I am not for trying to sit down and detail what somebody can say or not say. That is clearly unconstitutional. You can't do that. The Buckley case made a distinction between contributions and expenditures. Basically, it said you can't regulate expenditures. Independent groups ought to be able to do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it. But we decided a long time ago that, as far as campaign finance was concerned, we were electing the judges of our society in a way--you know, when we go to elect judges in our system, they are supposed to be independent. The litigants on either side can do things and get paid large sums of money, and so forth, but what you can do with regard to a judge is highly, highly narrow, in our system, and is regulated. 
In a sense, we are the same way. I mean, we get elected by people--one vote, one person; it is an equal deal. No matter how poor or rich you are, or your status in society, your vote counts as much as anybody else's. We are elected. I represent all of the people of the State of Tennessee, no matter how many votes I get. The President represents all of the people of the country. We come up here and we are supposed to represent everybody. We are supposed to pass legislation evenhanded. We have different views on different things. We have support here and opposition there. But we are supposed to try to give it our best objective shot as to representing all of the people. 
Given that situation in a democracy, we decided a long time ago that we were going to place some rules on it, because it didn't look good and it didn't make us feel good and didn't give us confidence in our system if we saw hundreds of thousands of dollars going into the pockets of people from interests who we were regulating or who we were passing laws on, when the people maybe on the other side of the issue didn't have the money to do that. Are you going to be able to take money out of campaigns? Of course not. But we decided once upon a time that a person ought to have a limit of $1,000--I personally think that is too low--and $5,000 for a PAC, and $25,000 overall. 
We have a regulated system now because we know in our democratic society there needs to be some kind of control on the amount of money that goes into the pockets of politicians. It is pretty simple and basic. The Supreme Court or nobody else has ever said otherwise. The Supreme Court, in Buckley, has recognized that we do and we can regulate on the contribution side of things--on the contribution side--how much money we can get. There is no question in my mind that we can regulate the soft money that is now coming into our system. This is not a constitutional argument. What we have now is a system that protects incumbents. It is a system that is becoming more and more isolated, more and more specialized, making it so that only a professional politician who has been out there raising money all his life, or some wealthy individual, is going to be able to be a part of the system anymore. 
My friend from Utah, a few minutes ago, made a very effective case that not only do incumbents have tremendous fundraising advantages, but they have other advantages. I agree with that. But that just makes the fundraising advantages that much more. The money goes to the incumbents. Maybe I just haven't been at it long enough. I have never run for office before this one. I had never run before about 3 years ago. I have run as a challenger against a person who was a congressional incumbent, and then I have run as an incumbent. I don't think we ought to get too bogged down with our own personal war stories, but I have seen it from both sides. I have had the disadvantages and the advantages of both sides of it. But all I know is that all the PAC money goes to incumbents. It doesn't matter what anybody believes anymore; it is their likelihood of getting reelected. Incumbents get reelected 90 to 95 percent of the time. The more upset the American people get with us, the more heavily incumbents become entrenched. I wonder why that is. 
Well, I think that part of it is what we are dealing with here today. For those who want to make this out as some kind of new regulatory, big Government scheme that we are imposing on an otherwise pristine system that we have here now, we heard some testimony the other day in the Governmental Affairs Committee, and I had heard things like it before. This was from a businessman, a gentleman representing a bunch of businesses in this country. He said, `We are tired of this system, tired of this soft money, tired of being hit up. We are tired of the extortion overtones of what is happening.' What we have now is a system, and what we had in this country in this last Presidential race was people sitting in the White House--and it could have come from a Senate office or congressional office, or anyplace of power--making calls to individuals saying, `I think it would be a good idea if you would send us $50,000 or $100,000.' And they feel that it probably would 
be a pretty good idea, from their standpoint, to maybe go ahead and send it on. 
Now, for those who are concerned about the coercive nature of big Government, chew that one over for a little while. That is what we have now. We have gotten to the point now that, since the soft money situation is totally unlimited, any politician can call up, and as long as they go through the guise of running it through one of the parties, which, in turn, will inure to their benefit, they can ask anybody for any amount of money. 
So I think the American people look at that, and they don't think the system is on the level. 
It all gets back to pretty basic stuff for me. I think the American people look at a system where we spend so much time with our hand out for so much money from so many people who do so much business with the Federal Government who we are basically regulating and legislating on, and they look at that system and the amounts of money that are involved nowadays, and they don't have much confidence in it. 
We will continue to see those lists in the newspapers of the hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars of contributions and the pieces of legislation put up against those contributions, the implication being that there indeed is a quid pro quo. People look at that, and there is a very little wonder that we are now having less than half our people voting. My understanding is we only have 6 percent of the American people making political contributions. 
So during the last few months we have had hearings that I think have been very enlightening. I want to talk about that a little bit later in a little bit more detail in terms of some of the things that have come out that in large part have to do with the actions of individuals and the ability that we gave them to pursue unlimited amounts of soft money. 
I think that the first thing we have to do, of course, is have accountability for those who have violated the law, for those who engage in improper activity, as part of what we have to be about. 
I think the public record is developed now so that without question there needs to be an independent counsel to look at this entire mess--not who made a phone call from what room and 
just focus on that--this entire mess that we have seen over the last several months. We need someone independently to take a look at that. 
But, my friends, if we think that accountability is going to solve our problem as far as the system we have in this country, we are making a terrible mistake because whoever is in power, if they have the right to pressure people for unlimited amounts of money, our system is constantly going to be and will remain a scandal waiting to happen. I hope that we will have learned that from this last one. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor an event that has long been a source of great civic pride for many of us in Tennessee: the Smithville Fiddlers' Jamboree and Crafts Festival. 
A spectacular 2-day event held annually over the Fourth of July holiday, the Smithville Fiddlers' Jamboree is dedicated to the furtherance and preservation of old-time Appalachian country music, dance, and authentic Appalachian art and culture. The jamboree and I go a long way back, and yet I never cease to be amazed by the hospitality, the fellowship, the crafts, and, of course, the outstanding music. 
This past Fourth of July weekend marked the 26th anniversary of the jamboree. It all began back on July 1, 1972, when musicians from 16 states delighted an audience of 8,000 people. While that in itself was quite an accomplishment, the event's founders were not content to stop there. By comparison, this year's event drew a record crowd of 125,000 and featured more than 600 contestants from 42 States and 4 foreign countries. More than 300 artisans and craftsmen were on hand to sell and display authentic pioneer and contemporary Appalachian crafts. 
These days, the Smithville Fiddlers' Jamboree is broadcast on television worldwide and has been featured in National Geographic Traveler, Southern Living, and several other national publications. The Jamboree has been named one of the top 100 tourist events in North America, according to a list compiled by the American Bus Association. The event was selected as a `Top 20 Tourist Favorite' by the Southeast Tourism Society, which includes the States of Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and Virginia. Earlier this year, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a resolution designating the Smithville Fiddlers' Jamboree and Crafts Festival as the official jamboree and crafts festival of the State of Tennessee. 
Without a doubt, knowledge of the Smithville Jamboree's accomplished musicians, inspiring music, skilled artisans, and authentic crafts has now reached the four corners of the globe, and I applaud the organizers, committees, volunteers, and the people of Smithville and DeKalb County, TN, for their unique and substantial contribution to the rich tradition of Appalachian art and culture.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to comment on Title XI of this legislation, the District of Columbia Revitalization Act. This is a major piece of legislation, and in many ways a major accomplishment, given that it was hammered out by a broad group of interested parties, including members and staff from the Governmental Affairs Committee, over a relatively short period of time. Agreement on this package was preceded earlier this year by considerable work in the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee chaired by Senator Brownback. Similar efforts were undertaken by the House Subcommittee on the District of Columbia. This Revitalization package was put together quickly, in a combined effort by all concerned parties, because of a mutual recognition that the District of Columbia's problems had become untenable. The broad recognition of the magnitude of the problem plus the possibly unique opportunity to come to agreement and enact reforms was what led so many people to agree on a package that virtually everyone regards as less than their ideal. 
One significant concern I have about this package is the major financial responsibility the Federal taxpayer is undertaking in the years to come. Technically, the D.C. Revitalization package meets the scoring requirements of this Balanced Budget Act, but the out-year costs are enormous and have not been dealt with. We are still evaluating the full impact of this package, but Members should be aware that the $4.8 billion in pension liability the Federal Government will be assuming is actually closer to $48 billion over time. I do believe it may be possible for these potential out-year costs to be reduced. The Revitalization package includes a provision which I requested requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a study of the D.C. pension assets and report back within a year on how the Federal Government might put them to best use. The Governmental Affairs Committee will then have the opportunity to consider whether additional legislation in this area could improve the financial outlook. The Administration has indicated a willingness to work further on this issue with the Committee, and I certainly look forward to that. We should be working together to institute reforms that make the District work independently, not simply encouraging a Federal Government takeover of all of its problems. There are assets currently in the D.C. pension fund, and rather than simply spending down those assets, we should build upon the assets so the funds are available to make payments in the future. 
Another area in which I question estimates of future costs is with the transfer of D.C. Corrections to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. I know the pressure was intense to close the Lorton Correctional Complex in Virginia, but here again this bill makes the federal bureaucracy responsible for absorbing the District's prison population. While the bill incorporates provisions for privatization, I believe the record will show that the Bureau of Prisons has consistently stood in the way of increased privatization in the Federal prison system. I have no reason to believe they will have a different response with regard to the Lorton prisoners. 
Many may not know that the District of Columbia was already engaged in a program to privatize the corrections function and has already entered into private contracts for housing 2,400 prisoners. I know well from my experience in Tennessee that private corrections facilities are a cost-effective, efficient and safe alternative to publicly-operated facilities. I am disturbed that Congress has substituted its judgment for the District's in this instance without evaluating whether the District's privatization initiative for corrections would work. 
Privatization can save valuable taxpayer dollars. In this instance, it is conceivable that the Federal Government could save the entire $885 million estimated for construction of new facilities if the District were allowed to continue on its current course. Because I believe these cost savings are important--and because this agreement was reached without sufficient debate--I want my colleagues to be aware that I, and other of my colleagues, want to work on follow-up legislation in this area as well. I think we can do better and I want to work toward that end. 
In conclusion, while this D.C. Revitalization Act is the result of a major, almost unprecedented effort by many with the best interest of the citizens of the District in mind, the reforms will require some additional thought and work to make the package live up to its full potential.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has oversight responsibility for the U.S. Postal Service, I want to comment on H.R. 1585. This measure directs the Postal Service to issue a semipostal stamp, at a price of up to 8 additional cents per first-class stamp, to raise funds for breast cancer research. Clearly this measure has the votes to pass; a similar measure passed the Senate last week by a vote of 83 to 17. But I want the record to reflect my strong disagreement with it. I think it is a bad idea for several reasons. It will create a precedent for congressional authorization for the issuance of many other fundraising postal stamps for many other worthy causes. As all Members are aware, the Postal Service has plenty of challenges on which it should concentrate. Not all costs of undertaking this new program are quantifiable, and we will be distracting the Postal Service from its responsibility of providing the best delivery service at the lowest price. Note that it is likely that we will soon see an increase in the cost of mailing a first-class letter. If Congress believes additional funds should be spent for this or another purposes, Congress should appropriate the funds directly. That is our responsibility.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to express my support for the regulatory accounting provision in Section 625 of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, S. 1023. This continues last year's effort by Senator Stevens, and as the new Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I strongly support it. I believe the public has the right to know the benefits and burdens of Federal regulatory programs. And Congress needs this information to better manage the regulatory process. Currently, Federal regulatory programs cost hundreds of billions of dollars per year--$700 billion by some estimates. That comes to several thousand dollars for the average American household--perhaps $7,000 per year. Our regulatory goals are too important, and our resources are too precious, to spend this money unwisely. 
This provision is identical to last year's Stevens Amendment. It requires the Office of Management and Budget to provide Congress with a report on: (1) the total annual costs and benefits of Federal regulatory programs; (2) the costs and benefits of rules costing $100 million or more; (3) the direct and indirect impacts of Federal rules on the private sector, State and local government, and the Federal government; and (4) recommendations to streamline and improve regulatory programs. Before issuing the report in final form, OMB must provide the public with notice and an opportunity to comment on the draft report--its substance, methodologies, and recommendations. In the final report, OMB must summarize the public comments. 
Now we know that regulatory accounting is doable, and it does not impose an unjustifiable burden on the agencies. First, OMB has done its first draft report under last year's regulatory accounting provision, and we expect the draft to be published in the Federal Register early next week. While this report is not perfect, it shows that regulatory accounting can be done and can help us better understand the benefits and burdens of regulation. In the past week, the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution released a primer on how to do regulatory accounting, entitled `Improving Regulatory Accountability.' This should be helpful to all of us as OMB revises its draft report. 
Estimating the total annual costs and benefits of Federal regulatory programs is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, and some of the major sections have been assembled. OMB's first draft report will provide a foundation for further improvements that can be proposed during the public comment period. Private studies have estimated the annual costs of regulation, and many of its benefits. These include Bob Hahn's `Regulatory Reform: What Do the Numbers Tell Us?,' Tom Hopkins' `Cost of Regulation,' and Hahn and Hird's `The Costs and Benefits of Regulation.' Moreover, Executive Order 12866, like the preceding Orders for the last 15 years, requires a cost-benefit assessment for significant regulations, which constitute most of the puzzle. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act also requires detailed cost-benefit analyses of $100 million rules. In addition, the paperwork burden--and I do think it should be addressed--constitutes about 1/3 of the cost puzzle, and paperwork burden hours already are estimated under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Those burdens can easily be monetized by estimating the value of the time needed to comply with paperwork requirements. In addition, the cost of environmental 
regulation--about 1/4 of the cost puzzle--is estimated in EPA's study, The Cost of a Clean Environment (1990), in annual estimates by the Department of Commerce, and by other sources. Finally, regulatory accounting should not create a resource drain for OMB. OMB should issue guidelines requiring the agencies to compile needed information, just as OMB does in the fiscal budget process. 
This regulatory accounting provision requires OMB to do a credible and reliable report on the costs and benefits of Federal regulation. First, subsection 625(a)(1) requires OMB to provide estimates of the `total annual' costs and benefits of Federal regulatory programs. This includes those regulatory costs and benefits that will impact the nation during the upcoming fiscal year. These costs and benefits would include impacts from rules issued before this upcoming fiscal year, not just new rules. OMB should do its best to estimate and quantify that figure on the cost side, and to explain what benefits we are getting for the costs of these programs. 
When estimating the costs and benefits of `Federal regulatory programs,' OMB should use the valuable information already available, and supplement it where needed. Where agencies have or can produce detailed information on the costs and benefits of individual programs, they should make full use of this information. For example, EPA produces reports on the costs of their major environmental programs. Since EPA has program-by-program information, EPA should include such detail in its estimates. Other agencies may not have program-by-program estimates of costs and benefits, nor be capable of producing it, so they may need to rely on less detailed information. I expect a rule of reason will prevail: Where the agencies can produce detail that will be informative for the Congress and the public, they should do so. Where it is extremely burdensome to provide such detail, broader estimates should suffice. Information generated during the public comment period should assist OMB. 
Subsection 625(a)(3) requires OMB to assess the direct and indirect impacts of Federal rules on the private sector, State and local government, and the Federal Government. As many studies show, regulatory impacts go beyond compliance costs. Regulation also creates a drag on real wages, economic growth, and productivity. Complex economic models can quantify these adverse impacts. However, OMB is not mandated to devote vast resources to create such models. Instead, OMB may use available reports, studies, and other relevant information to assess the direct and indirect impacts of Federal rules. In addition, OMB should discuss the serious problems posed by unfunded federal mandates for State, local and tribal governments. OMB should inform Congress of its efforts to address these problems. Ultimately, OMB must provide Congress with a credible accounting statement on the regulatory process. This report should show clearly the benefits and burdens of the regulatory process, and it should help Congress to see which programs are cost-effective and which are wasteful. 
We have received a copy of OMB's first draft report prepared under last year's Stevens Amendment. The draft is an important first step, and I agree with many recommendations it provides. For example, I strongly agree that OIRA should lead an effort to raise the use and quality of agency analyses for developing regulations. I also agree that OIRA should develop a database on the costs and benefits of major rules and a system to track the net benefits of all new federal regulations and reforms of existing regulations. This information could be used to determine what improvements to recommend. However, I also think that there are several more areas that would be fruitful for OMB to consider. First, OMB should estimate the total costs of all federal mandates, not just environmental, health, safety and economic regulation. In particular, OMB should estimate the entire costs of paperwork, including from tax collection. Second, OMB should estimate, where feasible, the quantifiable indirect costs and the indirect benefits of regulation. This includes, for example, the costs associated with product bans and marketing limitations, as well as the indirect benefits associated with the preservation of endangered species. Third, OMB should examine the impact of regulation on wages, innovation, employment, and income distribution, including employment impacts on particular sectors of the economy. OMB should leverage the expertise and resources of other agencies, especially the President's Council of Economic Advisors, to do these analyses. Finally, OMB should do more to recommend improvements to the regulatory process, as well as particular programs and regulations. OMB does not have to be omniscient to propose such improvements, and its recommendations do not have to be based on perfect empirical data. Let's also use common sense and work together for the public good. 
In closing, I should note that this regulatory accounting provision is founded on broad support. Last year's Stevens amendment was adopted by voice vote. It was modeled on more detailed provisions strongly supported in the 104th Congress--in the Roth bill, S. 291, the Dole-Johnston bill, S. 343, and the Glenn-Chafee bill. Regulatory accounting is widely endorsed--by those who labor under the growing regulatory burden, as well as by those who want to assure the benefits of regulation and to enhance the public's right to know about important governmental decisions.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I seek to withdraw an amendment I have filed to the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill because I see that pressing ahead with this amendment at this time would only delay passage of this important legislation. Before I formally withdraw my amendment, however, I wish to inform my colleagues about the circumstances which prompted me to introduce this measure--circumstances which continue today. 
A basic unfairness exists within the current regulations for membership in the National Guard. This inconsistency arbitrarily penalizes some patriotic Americans who serve their country well. It also hinders the ability of some National Guard units to attract and retain the most qualified individuals, thereby undermining the effectiveness of those units. 
This situation was brought to my attention because of a constituent of mine, Robert Echols, of Nashville. Mr. Echols, a Federal district court judge in the Sixth Judicial Circuit in Tennessee, is also a colonel in the Tennessee National Guard where he has served with distinction for 27 years. In September 1995, Colonel Echols was recommended for promotion to the rank of brigadier general. 
Although Colonel Echols' promotion was supported by the chief judge of the sixth judicial district, the Tennessee National Guard, and the National Guard Bureau here in Washington, to date his promotion has been delayed. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs has cited a regulation limiting Guard service by certain Federal officials to explain this delay. Further exacerbating the unfairness to Colonel Echols is the fact that this regulation is inconsistently applied. Other Federal officials who should fall within the scope of the regulation serve in the Guard unhindered. 
I have been working with the Pentagon since early this year to rectify this unfair situation. Thus far, no solution has been found. Indeed, the Pentagon has been unwilling to reconsider Colonel Echols' circumstance. They have also opposed my amendment to this legislation. 
I offered my amendment in an attempt to address the specific situation of district court judges serving in the National Guard. Considering that the chief of the sixth circuit has written that Mr. Echols' Guard service does not hinder his ability to serve as a judge, it is clear to me that civil servants in this category should be considered for National Guard service on a case-by-case basis. That is what my amendment would have done. 
Nevertheless, it has become clear to me that pressing forward in this fashion at this time will only delay passage of the critical Defense authorization bill, probably without rectifying the underlying problem. I will, therefore, withdraw the amendment at this time. I do intend, however, to continue working to find a solution to this unfair situation which penalizes Americans seeking to serve their country and undermines the effectiveness of National Guard units.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Strom Thurmond, and the other members of the committee for supporting my amendment, which will designate the Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge, TN as a `National Prototype Center.' 
Mr. President, for the first time in nearly half a century, the United States is neither designing nor producing any new nuclear weapons. The size of the U.S. nuclear stockpile is shrinking, and the size of the nuclear weapons complex is shrinking along with it. That is appropriate. 
However, as we reduce the physical size of our nuclear weapons complex, we must not allow the unique experience and expertise that have developed at the nuclear weapons production plants to simply disappear. Instead, we should use these unique resources to further enhance our national security and economic competitiveness. 
The Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge has played a critical role in our nuclear weapons complex since 1943. Every weapon in the current U.S. nuclear stockpile contains some part that was manufactured at Y-12. In the course of fulfilling this critical mission, Y-12 and its workforce have developed applied manufacturing expertise that is unsurpassed anywhere in this country. This makes Y-12 perfectly suited to become a National Prototype Center. 
Prototypes provide the first concrete test of a product after the initial research and development have been performed. Businesses and the military use prototyping to test their designs and to anticipate and prevent problems later in the production cycle. 
However, circumstances in the 1990's have made prototyping more difficult for both the military and industry. The threats facing our military today are fundamentally different from those we faced during the Cold War, and the defense budget has shrunk as well. This means that the military must now produce defense systems in relatively small volumes--sometimes as small as one. Commercial industries are facing some of the same challenges, as they strive to produce smaller numbers of more customized products. These trends have made prototyping even more important, but they have also made it prohibitively expensive in many cases. 
I believe that we will benefit as a nation if we find a way to preserve these important prototyping capabilities, and I believe the solution lies with Y-12. Y-12 has already helped to develop numerous prototypes for the Department of Defense, NASA, and others, from components for the Seawolf submarine's propulsion system to a new and more advanced type of pencil lead. Designating Y-12 as a National Prototype Center will highlight Y-12's ability to rapidly transform complex hardware designs into precision prototypes through the use of advanced manufacturing techniques. It will also allow customers to take advantage of the resources of a world-class national laboratory--the Oak Ridge National Laboratory--which is located in close proximity to the Y-12 plant. 
Mr. President, this National Prototype Center will not only enhance our national security by preserving vital weapons manufacturing expertise, it will also enhance our economic security by helping to solve tough problems for U.S. industries so that they can get their products to the global marketplace more quickly. And it will be cost-effective. 
The American taxpayers have already invested billions of dollars in the equipment and expertise that reside at Y-12. It makes little sense for that investment to be duplicated by other Federal agencies or U.S. industries. At a time when cost control is a major consideration in developing new weapons systems and commercial products, it makes sense instead for others to take advantage of existing state-of-the-art facilities at Y-12. My amendment would allow them to do just that, and I thank my colleagues for supporting it.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and Senator Glenn, the committee's ranking minority member. We thank the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for their cooperation and assistance in preparing this amendment which will benefit not only the procurement process within the Department of Defense, but other agencies across the Federal Government as well. 
The amendment which we offer today began as a request from the administration to include additional procurement-related reforms to those enacted over the last 4 years and those already included in S. 936. Our amendment includes the following provisions: 
First, it would amend current Governmentwide procurement law which requires the development and implementation of a Governmentwide Federal Acquisition Computer Network architecture--called FACNET and enacted as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 [FASA]. At the time, Congress intended to require the Government to evolve its acquisition process from a paper-based process to an electronic process. The specific intent of FACNET was to provide a common architecture to implement electronic commerce within the Governmentwide procurement system. 
However, GAO recently reviewed the Government's progress in developing and implementing FACNET, and concluded that, in the short time since passage of FASA, alternative electronic purchasing methods have become readily available to the Government and its vendors. Given these advances in technology, the overly proscriptive requirements of FASA and problems with implementation by the agencies, GAO questioned whether and to what extent FACNET makes good business sense. GAO recommended that if the FACNET requirements were an impediment to the implementation of a Governmentwide electronic commerce strategy, then legislative changes should be enacted. This amendment would provide those changes to give flexibility to implement electronic commerce at DOD and other Federal agencies in an efficient and cost-effective manner consistent with commercial practice. 
Further, the amendment would make technical changes to current procurement law to: First, conform civilian agency statutes to DOD statues regarding performance-based contracting; and second, revise a pilot program for the purchase of information technology to make it more competitive by allowing more than one vendor in the pilot.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to join with Senator Levin and several of our colleagues in introducing legislation to improve how the federal government regulates. This legislation is an effort by some of us to devise a common solution to the problems of our regulatory system. We have some real political differences among us, but we all share the same goals: clean air and water, injury free workplaces, safe transportation systems, to name a few of the good things that can come from regulation. We also all share the goal of avoiding regulation which unnecessarily interferes in people's lives and businesses, which costs more than it benefits, or which--inadvertently--causes actual harm. 
I am pleased we are introducing this bill with Senators Glenn, Abraham, Robb, Roth, Rockefeller and Stevens. They have all toiled in the fields to improve regulation. 
It was in this spirit that the legislation we are introducing today was drafted. The Regulatory Improvement Act will promote the public's right to know how and why agencies regulate, improve the quality of government decisionmaking, and increase Government accountability and responsiveness to the people it serves. 
The problem is that agencies sometimes lose sight of common sense as they create regulations. Then even well-intentioned rules can produce disappointing results. 
Consider the airbag issue that has been in the news lately. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration required high-force airbags to maximize the odds of survival for adult males in highway crashes. But the deployment force from these airbags can be so severe that they can injure children, women, and the elderly. Senator Kempthorne has spoken about the tragic death of a young girl from Idaho who was decapitated when an airbag deployed during a low-impact collision. The agency is now considering the use of an airbag cut-off switch to avoid these tragedies. But Mr. President, tragedies like this never should have occurred. We could have avoided needless deaths and injuries if the agency had carefully considered the risks that high-impact airbags pose to certain populations. I hope today's proposal will correct mistakes like this before they occur. 
A second example is the removal of asbestos from our schools and other public buildings. Early in the 1980s, government scientists argued that asbestos exposure could cause thousands of deaths. Congress responded by passing a sweeping law that led cities and states to spend nearly $20 billion to remove asbestos from public buildings. After further research, EPA officials eventually concluded that ripping out the asbestos had been an expensive mistake. Ironically, removing the asbestos actually raised the risk to the public--because asbestos fibers become airborne during removal. This mistake never would have occurred if these increased risks had been considered in the first place. I hope that would change under the Regulatory Improvement Act. 
Finally, let me mention our Superfund requirements. Superfund was passed with the good intention of cleaning up America's toxic waste-sites. Unfortunately, things are not working as well as intended. Superfund has become a legal and regulatory maze where a good 90 percent of insurers' costs and 20 percent of liable parties' costs are spent on lawyers and consultants--not on cleaning up the environment. We also have to ask if we are focusing on the most important priorities. For example, Superfund imposes extremely stringent standards for cleaning up lead in groundwater. Now, this is a good rule in many cases, because lead can be very toxic to children. The problem is that we may be overlooking more direct threats to children from lead. For example, lead paint in old houses can be a greater threat to children's health than lead that may be under some industrial site where there are no children. Last congress, our committee heard testimony about how the Superfund law requires groundwater in a Newark railyard to be cleaner than drinking water--at enormous cost. Now, if land is going to be used for industrial purposes, and no children will be there, does this make sense? The answer may be no--those requirements may not improve the environment much, but they may drive businesses out of Newark. Nobody wants to open a business near a Superfund site and risk being sued. No wonder our inner cities are starved for jobs. In the end, we may be hurting the very people we should be concerned about--the inner-city poor, those who already have to live with many risks in their daily lives, those who do not have clout here in Washington. 
Virtually every serious student of the regulatory process agrees we can do better. One study by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found that if agencies simply set their priorities in a smarter way, we could save an additional 60,000 lives per year at no additional cost. Mr. President, we don't have a moment to lose when we could save more lives. We can set aside partisan politics, and we all can agree this is the right thing to do. 
Since I became chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have been working closely with Senator Levin to forge bipartisan legislation with three major purposes: 
First, to promote the public's right to know how and why agencies make regulatory decisions. This legislation helps the public to understand agency decisions by directing agencies to-- 
Allow the public to comment and participate as rules are developed; disclose the benefits and burdens of major rules; disclose any environmental, health and safety risks a rule is designed to reduce, and make those risks understandable by comparing them with other risks familiar to the public; and identify major assumptions and uncertainties considered in creating rules. 
Second, to improve the quality of government decisionmaking. Careful thought, grounded in science, will help us to target problems and to find better solutions. We must carefully craft new rules to be effective and efficient. Agencies will carefully consider the 
benefits and burdens of rules and use good scientific and technical information. Agencies will seek out smarter ways to regulate, including flexible approaches such as outcome-oriented performance standards and market mechanisms. We must modernize and improve rules already on the books. Independent committees will advise agencies how to revise rules to substantially increase the benefits to the public. 
And finally, to increase Government accountability to the people it serves. The Act will require agencies to-- 
Clearly present regulatory proposals so the public, the Congress, and the President can understand the problem at hand and help find a solution; explain any legal impediment or other factor hindering the agency from issuing cost-effective and sensible regulations, and describe any superior alternatives; disclose realistic estimates of any risks addressed; document changes made to proposed rules when the rules are reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]; disclose contacts from persons outside the executive branch with OMB when it is reviewing proposed rules, since such contacts may represent outside influence. 
Mr. President, while it is important to review what this legislation will accomplish, it also is important to note that this proposal avoids the contentious issues that thwarted agreement on legislation last Congress. 
First, this legislation does not contain a supermandate. That is, while we believe that cost-benefit analysis is an important tool to inform agency decisionmaking, the results of the cost-benefit analysis do not trump existing law. The bill explicitly recognizes that sometimes an agency will issue a rule that would not pass a cost-benefit test. We only ask the agency to explain why it selected such a rule, including any legal impediment that hindered the agency from issuing a cost-justified rule. 
Second, this bill does not contain a petition process that would allow outside parties to sue agencies in court to change particular rules that the litigant does not like. While we believe there are fruitful opportunities to update and improve old rules, we do not want to set up a review process that could create a litigation morass. Instead of a petition process, agencies will use independent advisory committees that would recommend a list of rules that could be improved to substantially increase net benefits to the public. The agency would defer to the recommendations of the advisory committee, but they could not be dragged into court if someone wanted a different rule to be reviewed. 
Finally, this bill strikes a balanced approach to judicial review. We allow limited judicial review under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard to ensure that agencies issue reasonable regulations using the tools of cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. But this legislation does not provide a series of trip wires that could hinder agencies from performing their missions. In other words, we realize the agencies may not be perfect in complying with this law. They may make mistakes from time to time. We won't imperil important regulations because the agency made honest mistakes. We just ask the agency to make reasonable and honest decisions, and the public deserves no less. 
Mr. President, we are devoting vast resources to achieve our regulatory goals. By some estimates, the annual regulatory burden is nearly $700 billion per year--almost $7,000 for the average American household. Our regulatory goals are too important, and our resources are too precious, to spend this money unwisely. 
The Regulatory Improvement Act will ensure that agencies conduct better economic and scientific analysis before they issue regulations. Government will be more open to the public, will better explain the problem, and will consider the best available information to solve the problem. Agencies will consider the benefits and burdens of different regulatory alternatives so we can reach the most sensible solutions. And agencies will modernize old rules on the books to increase the benefits to the public. In the process, we won't sacrifice our important national goals and values. We can make our Government more effective, more open, and more accountable than ever.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to submit this declaration by the Trust for the Future to the U.S. Senate to honor the work of the trust and its founder and president, Charles A. Howell III: 
Be it known by all present, that, from this day forward, the last Sunday of June is to be known as Descendants Day. Henceforth, this shall be the day in each year when all the world's citizens assess the impact of their activities during the preceding year on their neighbors and their descendants across time. 
Be it further proclaimed, that the ultimate goal of this endeavor is to reach the day when we can celebrate a year in which the consequences of our activities had no measurable negative impact on our neighbors or our descendants and instead see clearly that the impact of our actions on posterity is decidedly beneficial and sustainable. 
Each generation of Americans has an unspoken bond and commitment with the previous and next generations to leave the world better than we found it. In many ways, today we are not keeping that commitment. We aspire to encourage others around the world to join in this yearly celebration of courageous accountability in the sure knowledge that we will be followed by billions of persons who will either condemn us or praise us for efforts we may or may not expend on their behalf. 
On this the Seventeenth Day of the Sixth Month in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Ninety-Seven, we affirm our desire to pursue this course with all diligence.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I recognize today a fellow Tennessean, Dr. David Abshire, who last month received the Distinguished Graduate Award before the Corps of 4,000 Cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. 
Dr. Abshire has a long and distinguished record of service to America. Not only has he served as an Army officer, an Assistant Secretary of State, our Ambassador to NATO, and as a special counselor to the President, but he also played an integral role in founding and building the Center for Strategic and International Studies [CSIS]. 
Mr. President, in addition to recognizing Dr. Abshire's impressive list of past accomplishments, I am particularly appreciative of the work he and the staff at CSIS are doing. Recently, Dr. Abshire and the CSIS staff have developed an innovative approach to working with individual States, counties, and cities in order to maximize the benefits of job creation, investment, exports, and economic growth stemming from a more global economy. I am gratified that Dr. Abshire has chosen Tennessee as the State in which to begin this effort. His work with Governor Sundquist and my office is greatly appreciated.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to lend my voice today to the thousands of women and men who are supporting the search for a cure to breast cancer. 
Breast cancer is still the leading cause of mortality among American women between the ages of 35 and 54. In fact, odds are that one in every eight women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. 
The encouraging news is that early detection is very effective in curbing this disease. At the same time we continue efforts to find a cure, we must be equally diligent in our efforts to educate women about the importance of regular clinical and self examinations for breast cancer. 
On June 7, Americans all over the country will again have the opportunity to show their concern by participating in the 1997 National Race for the Cure. The race is a series of 5k runs and a 1-mile walk sponsored by the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation in Dallas. 
I urge all of my colleagues, their spouses and staff to support the Capitol Hill Race for the Cure on June 7, where more than 50,000 are expected to participate. This event will help raise money for breast cancer research and education and bring us all closer to the day when a cure is found.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a few words of congratulations and tribute to a great man. 
When the history of American politics is written, somebody needs to put in a pretty good chapter just about Senator Strom Thurmond. This gentleman has seen and lived history as very few people have. He fought on the beaches of Normandy at the age of 41. His grandfather fought in the Civil War. And his long and dedicated service in the U.S. Senate deserves our honor today. He is both the oldest living and the longest serving Senator in U.S. history. 
Like many of my colleagues, he has made a run for the Presidency. That is not so uncommon. But Senator Strom Thurmond ran against President Harry S Truman. That is a little bit different. 
Senator Thurmond's life has been spent in public service. He has known every President since Franklin Roosevelt. He has been a county superintendent of education, State senator, Governor, circuit judge. He has been a schoolteacher, a coach. He has worked on a farm, and has even been a motorcycle rider, like my friend Senator Campbell. 
Senator Thurmond is one of South Carolina's most successful exports, and clearly their favorite son. 
I think it is worth noting that as times have changed, so has Senator Thurmond. When you look back on his life, you see a pretty good reflection of the way he lives. The views of many Americans have changed in this century. I think it is a good thing to know Senator Thurmond, because his example shows us how someone who serves the public can adapt to the times while still living by his core principles. 
Strom is a fair man, a kind man, who steadfastly believes in what he says. He believes in the rights of the people he represents to conduct their lives as they see fit. He has fought for that for years, and I think that is extremely noteworthy. It is among the highest obligations that elected officials can uphold. 
But aside from all the history, I think what Senator Thurmond most wants to be noted for today is what he sought to do throughout his life; and that is, there is no denying that this man is unendingly thoughtful and is faithful to his friends and family and the people around him. 
There aren't too many folks in South Carolina who do not have a firsthand story of Senator Thurmond picking up the phone to offer congratulations or to offer condolences, and getting a note in the mail where he expresses his concern or his interest in something that has happened in the life of a family. 
I think that is the mark of the best kind of public service. You don't forget that at the end of the day what matters is the people you can count as friends. And people remember their friends. They respect a true leader who sticks by his guns. Regardless of your politics, that is the kind of respect any public servant strives for, and it is the mark of a true statesman and a true gentleman, and, in this case, a true Southern gentleman. 
I have read that my colleague wants to be remembered as a man who is honest, patriotic, and helpful. I am here to tell you that he is all three. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, I commend and agree with my colleague on the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Glenn, with regard to the purpose of the census and how important it is. I commend Senator Hollings and Senator Stevens for working out some language that will get us over this temporary hurdle and will not cause us to have to stop in midstream and make a decision today as to exactly what we ought to do, because I do not think anybody knows exactly what we ought to do right now. I do not think attention has been focused on this issue. 
We in the Governmental Affairs Committee, however, have been focused on it for a while. When I became chairman, we had a meeting on the staff level and started to engage the people at the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce and explained to them what our intentions were in terms of having hearings and gathering information as to the right way to proceed. 
We have had two hearings, as Senator Hollings has pointed out, considering specifically these sampling issues that we are talking about, keeping in mind how important it is. 
It is important that people have confidence in this census. Clearly, we base a lot of things on it in terms of distribution of Federal moneys, academic research, and things of that nature that are dependent on it, and last, but not least, the apportionment for the House of Representatives. So we need to do it cautiously and carefully and not based on who is going to benefit politically in the outcome, not based on some supposition of what the outcome is going to be. 
I made a commitment early on that we would hear this fairly, we would bring in the experts and proceed carefully, but that the administration was going to have to convince us and the American people that the way they were going to proceed would be a fair, objective way. Of course, that brings us to the heart of the sampling issue, and it is not an easy issue to resolve. In fact, I think we are right in the middle of resolving it. We have asked for a lot of additional information in order that the Census Bureau can convince us that this will be done in the right way. 
Everybody is for doing something about the undercount, which I think most people agree that we have. We need to do something about this. We need to proceed in the fairest, most objective way in order to address that particular problem. 
But the question still is out there whether or not sampling is the right way to proceed. In the first place, I think we need to realize that the proposal that is on the table now really involves two levels of sampling: 90 percent is contact directly, 10 percent is sampling, and then there is another level of sampling which is supposed to take care of the undercount. So we have a couple of different levels of sampling. It has not been perfected yet. 
Back in 1990 when they did the census, they considered adjusting the census numbers based on sampling. Based upon the information that they initially had there, they made an error of one seat. One State would have improperly gotten a seat and another State would have improperly lost a seat. They caught it in time and decided not to use sampling back then. 
There are constitutional issues; there are legislative issues. It is not just a constitutional question. We are familiar with the fact that the Constitution requires, in some people's minds, an actual head count. It is somewhat debatable, but to some legal experts, it is even a greater question as to whether or not Congress has constructed a legislative pattern that would forbid sampling. 
There has been a lot of sampling legislation passed and some of it is inconsistent. It would be a tragedy, indeed, if we went through all this process and we used sampling and spent $4 billion 
in order to carry this out and then find out we did not have the constitutional authority or that we have the constitutional authority but did not have the legislative authority. So if we go through with sampling, I think we are going to need additional legislation to clear that up. 
There is another question involved as far as the expense. Some of the witnesses originally told us that if we did not sample, it would cost us an extra billion dollars. We are getting information now which says the cost would be much less than that. We need to clear that up. 
I think this is an appropriate way to proceed, but I want to emphasize to the administration, and I want to emphasize to the Census Bureau, that those of us who will be dealing with this thing directly are going to be looking to them to convince us and convince the Senate and convince the American people that they will conduct this thing in a fair and objective way. A lot of people are concerned that this administration, which has shown in times past the willingness and the ability to use the authority of the administration for political purposes--witness the Immigration and Naturalization Service before the election last time--that an administration that is willing to do that would be willing to tamper with this process. 
It is a matter that is somewhat new to us in this body for this particular purpose--that is, one of apportionment--and it is not going to be something we will readily latch on to. I am not saying it is the wrong thing to do, but I am saying the burden is on the administration, the burden is on the Census Bureau, not only that this is scientifically acceptable, which I think a lot of people think it is, but, second, that we are not going to have to be worrying about some people in a bureaucracy somewhere who are going to be having their fingers on the scales of justice, as has happened in other instances. 
So, with that, I leave it for another day. I look forward to working with the members on the committee and others on the Appropriations Committee in trying to come up with the best system that is fair to everybody, not based on who benefits or who suffers from a political standpoint, but based on what is fair and accurate, not only in terms of the result, but in terms of the process in getting to that result. 
With that, I thank the Chair.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to provide much-needed tax relief to the residents of my State who are employed as civilians on Fort Campbell, KY. These Clarksville area Tennesseans are hard working citizens who, I believe, are being taxed unfairly by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Fort Campbell is the home of the Army's famous 101st Airborne Division. This installation straddles the border between Tennessee and Kentucky. In fact, 80 percent of it lies within the State of Tennessee. But because the post office is located on the Kentucky side of the base, it is best known to most people as Fort Campbell, KY. 
Civilian residents of both Tennessee and Kentucky are employed by the Federal Government to perform important nonmilitary functions at Fort Campbell. Approximately 2,000 of the Tennesseans who work on post are employed on the Kentucky side in the schools, at the post office, at the post exchange, and on the primary airfield. Unfortunately, these Tennesseans are forced to pay income tax to the Commonwealth of Kentucky of up to 6 percent of their wages, in addition to the sales and excise taxes they pay to their home State of Tennessee. 
Because the State of Tennessee does not have an income tax, Kentuckians employed on the Tennessee side of Fort Campbell do not pay income tax to the State of Tennessee. Nor are Kentuckians required to pay Tennessee sales tax on Fort Campbell. All of the facilities on the Tennessee side of Fort Campbell to which Kentuckians have access, the KFC and the Taco Bell, for example, are exempt from State sales tax. It is only when a Kentucky resident leaves post that he or she becomes subject to Tennessee sales tax on purchases made in the State. 
Mr. President, I believe it is unfair of Kentucky to impose income tax on Tennesseans, because Tennesseans who work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell do not consume any services provided by the Commonwealth. Fort Campbell is a Federal installation. All emergency fire, police, and medical services on post are provided by the Federal Government, not the Commonwealth of Kentucky. All roads on Fort Campbell, both on the Kentucky and the Tennessee side, are maintained by the Federal Government. Water and sewer services are paid for by the Federal Government. If a Tennessean who worked on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell were laid off, he or she would not be eligible to obtain 
unemployment benefits from Kentucky, despite the fact that he or she had been paying income tax to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Finally, Tennesseans have no voice in the Kentucky legislature to affect change to this law. Tennesseans are being unfairly taxed without the benefit of representation--a principle anathema to this country. As I see it, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is receiving free money from residents of Tennessee who work on a Federal installation that happens to border their State. 
And although Kentucky likes to argue that the residents of Clarksville are not forced to work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell, employees are often moved on the base where a change of buildings means a change of State. A Tennessean forced to move into a Fort Campbell job across the border takes an automatic pay cut of up to 6 percent--just for moving across the street. This situation has been the cause of significant morale problems at Fort Campbell. According to Kentucky, however, those employees can escape paying the income tax by quitting their jobs. I find this alternative an unacceptable one. It is for this reason that I am introducing legislation to prohibit Kentucky from imposing its income tax on these Tennesseans employed either by the Federal Government or by a contractor with the Federal Government at Fort Campbell. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator Frist. Congressman Ed Bryant has introduced the similar legislation in the other body. 
Let me provide some history on this issue. According to legislation enacted by Congress in 1940, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is permitted to impose its income tax on Federal employees working in the State. This legislation, the Buck Act, repealed a prior law prohibiting States from imposing income tax on individuals who live or work on Federal property. However, Congress has also granted exemptions from State income tax to classes of Federal employees based on their obvious special circumstances: military personnel and Members of Congress and their employees. In addition, Congress enacted legislation in 1990 to exempt Amtrak employees from State taxation in the States in which they do not reside but through which they travel while working. Congress intended these exemptions to provide relief from inequitable situations. The Tennesseans employed at Fort Campbell also merit an exemption. 
Mr. President, I firmly believe that a State has the right to raise revenue in whatever manner its residents believe is most appropriate. In the case of Tennessee, residents have chosen sales and excise taxes to fund their cost of government--only one of six States in the United States without an income tax. But it should be noted that Kentucky has entered into reciprocal tax agreements with surrounding income tax States to ensure that Kentuckians are treated fairly. Unfortunately, Kentucky has refused to negotiate any type of reciprocal tax agreement with Tennessee, because it knows it has Tennesseans over a barrel. Prohibiting the Commonwealth of Kentucky from taxing Tennesseans working on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell is the best way to resolve this inequitable situation. 
During this week in April Americans are reminded of their obligations to government. I believe that Americans are willing to pay their fair share of taxes, but citizens should not be expected to pay tax to a government from which they receive nothing and in which they have no voice.

Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, it seems at this time of year every year we tend to go out of our way to criticize the Internal Revenue Service, but I think part of the reason for that is that sometimes it seems to take so much to get their attention. As the Presiding Officer knows, the General Accounting Office has a list of high-risk agencies which they set forth as agencies that are more prone to fraud, waste and abuse, and mismanagement. 
The IRS has been on that list now for 6 years in a row, and we had hearings last week in order to find out what they intended to do about it because not only do they have the normal problems that we all hear about and complain about every year, it seems now that in their attempt to modernize their computer system, which is totally outdated; they are working on 1960's technology, but in an attempt to do something about that they have spent billions of dollars and canceled one program after another and are not making substantial progress into getting into the 20th century much less the 21st century. 
We also found out that the Internal Revenue Service cannot 
stand an audit. They do not really know how much they have spent on this computer modernization system and they really do not know how much money they collect in terms of various categories of collection. 
In addition to that, we have learned more about the security problems. We know that we are all concerned about the browsing problem we have had some discussions about recently, but now we learn of the tremendous physical security problems, so much so that they had to classify the report when they sent it over here to us because they did not want to provide a blueprint, understandably, for people who might wish them ill. It is that bad. 
Congress has responded with the power of the purse. And last year we cut them back some, but that is not the total answer because they are going to need revenues in order to take care of some of these problems. So we had the hearings. We brought the IRS in. We brought the Treasury in, which the IRS, of course, is a part of. Perhaps if there is any good news in this it looks as if for the first time we do have a blueprint to work our way out of this. 
Congress in the past few years has passed some legislation which requires these agencies to come in and report on what kind of progress they are making in solving some of these problems. We have not always had this, but now we have some accountability--what are they trying to achieve, and every year come back and tell us and show us in some detail what they are doing to work out of these things. 
Treasury now says they are going to take a greater oversight responsibility, which they clearly should have done long before. There are timetables which they are going to be held accountable to. We are going to make sure they report back in solving these problems when they are supposed to be reporting back. So perhaps we are going to be making some progress for the first time. But this is the reason why we talk about the IRS. It is not just the fact that people do not like to pay taxes. It is just they have the right to have the IRS and all these other agencies at least reach the minimal compliance levels they expect out of the American taxpayer because, ultimately, our national security and our prosperity depend upon our faith in these institutions and certainly the IRS. 
So with that, I thank the Chair and will relinquish the remainder of any time I might have.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, on the final day for taxpayers to file their tax returns, I think it is appropriate for Congress and the American people to assess how well the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] is doing managing the collection of 1.4 trillion taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, the answer is not very well. The Committee on Governmental Affairs held a hearing last week on the IRS programs on the General Accounting Office's [GAO] high risk list which identifies those Federal programs most vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. To the taxpayer's dismay, the IRS made the list six times. IRS programs have been consistently on GAO's high risk list since its inception in 1990 and GAO has issued over 200 reports in the past 5 years critical of the problems at IRS. 
The problems at IRS are considerable. For example: 
IRS still can't pass an audit--something that the private sector has been doing since the 1930's and State governments since the 1980's. Because IRS' financial statements are so poor, it is likely the entire Government will not be able to pass its first congressionally required audit of its financial statements this fall. Shouldn't IRS live up to the same accounting standards it imposes on the taxpayer? 
For three decades IRS has been attempting to overhaul its outdated 1960's era computer systems. In its third unsuccessful attempt at modernization, IRS has spent over $3 billion, with very little to show for it. This has become a case study in how not to buy computers. 
In the area of tax collections, GAO finds that IRS has no real basis for determining how much it is owed or, in any comprehensive sense, by whom. This is important because every dollar owed which is not collected due to inaccurate filing or ineffective collection comes out of the pocket of every honest taxpayer. 
Despite an IRS pledge to have zero-tolerance for snooping by IRS personnel through taxpayer's files, GAO finds that the practice continues. Only one IRS computer system has a very limited ability to detect snooping. As for the rest of IRS systems and paper files there are few controls to protect sensitive taxpayer records from this invasion of privacy. 
All of IRS' computers are at risk of not operating properly on January 1, 2000, because of the antiquated computers' inability to deal with the year 2000 date change. In less than 1,000 days, the collection of revenue and the entire tax processing system will be in jeopardy. 
It is estimated that $200 billion is lost each year to fraud and nonpayment of taxes. While IRS caught $131 million in fraudulent returns in 1995, GAO lists filing 
fraud as a high risk area and it is uncertain how many fraudulent returns slip through the system. 
But these concerns are even surpassed by new ones raised by GAO in January in a confidential report on IRS security weaknesses which is now being released in very restricted form. IRS has very serious physical and information security problems which jeopardize its ability to function and puts taxpayer data at risk of being improperly used, changed, or destroyed. It should concern us all that GAO's findings of IRS' vulnerability to security threats are of such great concern that most of the original report can not be made public. 
What is at stake here? The confidence of the taxpayer is at stake. Tax laws must be fairly enforced at the least possible cost and personal intrusion and IRS must meet the standards it expects the taxpayer to meet. 
Our credibility as the steward of the money we ask the taxpayer to contribute is at stake. Each dollar the Government collects is a dollar someone else has earned. It is our obligation to make the best use of that dollar, and not waste a cent of it. 
Finally, at stake is the very ability of government to perform its necessary responsibilities and functions. Without taxpayer confidence that we are collecting money fairly and wisely, our system of government is crippled. 
Taxation in this country has a long and tumultuous history. We are a nation founded on a tax revolt and are continuously renewed by a healthy skepticism toward all forms of taxation. It is important to remember that it is only with the American people's consent that the IRS exists in the first place. 
As a nation we collect taxes to pay for the responsibilities we have assigned to our Government. Right over the entrance to the IRS are the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes: `Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.' But, recognizing the need to fund government responsibilities does not imply that we should continue with business as usual at the IRS. If an agency fails in its fundamental mission, or fails to keep its promises to Congress and the American people, we need to be prepared to make fundamental changes. I, for one, favor greatly simplifying the Tax Code. A simpler code, fairly administered, will help to restore the taxpayers' faith in the system. It will also make the system more manageable. 
In the meantime, it is imperative for IRS to improve its operations. It is outrageous that IRS programs put on GAO's high-risk list remain there year-after-year. GAO testified before the Governmental Affairs Committee in June of 1991 and described key areas in which IRS needed to improve its operations. Six years later, we heard virtually the same message in the same areas from GAO. What has IRS been doing in the last 6 years? What has been done to correct systemic management problems at IRS? 
Fortunately, the forces for change may now be coming into place. Congress has 
used its power of the purse to express its dissatisfaction with IRS' computer modernization. A new Commission to Restructure the IRS has been formed to address how the Nation collects taxes and the administration has announced a new plan for reform at IRS. The Deputy Secretary of Treasury Lawrence Summers, testified before the Governmental Affairs Committee last Thursday on this plan. The administration's recognition of many of the problems it faces is a good first step. However, it is unclear how establishing new layers of bureaucracy will improve the situation at IRS. We also need to understand how giving IRS greater personnel and budgetary flexibilities would enable it to better manage its programs and finances. 
It is necessary for Congress and the administration to work together to reform the IRS. As for the next step, the Congress needs more details on the administration's IRS reform proposals. I plan to work with my colleagues to ensure that a detailed plan is sent to Congress as soon as possible to address the IRS' high risk problems. This reform plan should be linked to IRS' GPRA strategic plan and should include specific performance measures that will successfully address IRS' high-risk areas. 
Congress is also taking up today legislation on criminalizing the snooping by IRS employees of confidential taxpayer data. This is an issue with a longstanding history at the Governmental Affairs Committee. The issue was first brought to light during financial audits under the Chief Financial Officers Act. In 1994, it was thought that IRS would address this issue in a comprehensive manner. At last week's hearing, GAO found that snooping was still a significant problem. All of us are greatly disturbed about reports of lax security and the unauthorized browsing by IRS employees of taxpayer information. This invasion of privacy is a breech of public trust and only further lowers the faith of the taxpayer in the fairness of the system. 
I want to work with the administration and other congressional committees to implement lasting solutions to identified management problems at IRS and reduce the risks to the taxpayers. Most of these problems have existed for years. I recognize that this administration, and previous ones, have tried to solve them. But, time is growing short. The confidence of our citizens is low and the risks are high.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a man of character, his tradition of accomplishment, his outstanding record of public service, and his contribution to his community and the State of Tennessee. Today, April 14, Gene Roberts steps down as the mayor of Chattanooga. He will be missed, but I know that wherever he chooses to put his skills to use in the future, he will be a great asset. 
Gene Roberts is a low-key kind of man, the kind who leads with confidence. When Gene gets behind some cause or effort, people just fundamentally know that he's in it for the right reasons and that they ought to seriously consider following his lead. The people of Chattanooga have had the benefit of Gene's talents in his capacity as mayor since 1983. They know firsthand what I'm talking about. 
Gene's history of public service goes back over 25 years, back to 1971, when he was the commissioner of fire and police for Chattanooga. For a brief time, he served in the cabinet of my friend, Gov. Lamar Alexander. And his long tenure as mayor has been marked by unprecedented growth, progress, and a rise in the fortunes and profile of the city of Chattanooga. 
He has presided over real progress. During his years in office, Chattanooga has seen a revival of its downtown, revitalized neighborhoods, a cleanup of pollution to preserve the beautiful land in the area, and a marked increase in the quality of life for the folks who call Chattanooga home. 
Thanks to Gene's efforts, and his coordination of efforts with other civic-minded groups and individuals, Chattanooga has become a model for other cities striving to improve. Today, leaders from around the world and across the country visit Chattanooga to see what's been done, and to find out how they can duplicate the success of this model city. 
It's this kind of effort that creates a vigorous economy for the area, and that's good for everyone. In no small measure, we have Gene Roberts to thank for that. 
These kinds of positive changes only happen when an individual steps forward to take the initiative. You've got to care enough to invest time and skill and experience to make a good city into a great city. Things like this don't just happen by themselves. 
Congratulations and all the best to Gene Roberts as he retires from the office of mayor of Chattanooga, TN.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator Frist and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment today because I am concerned about that section of the bill dealing with what happens if Yucca Mountain is not deemed to be a suitable permanent repository to store spent nuclear fuel. In that event, under this bill, all work on an interim storage site in Nevada would cease and the President would have 18 months to name an alternate site for an interim storage facility. 
What I am concerned about is that the bill goes on to say:  
The President shall not designate the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the State of Washington as a site for the construction of an interim storage facility. 
So the President will have one less option when he is looking for alternate sites under that scenario. My colleagues from South Carolina have offered an amendment which has subsequently been adopted that would exempt two sites in their State from consideration as well. 
Our concern is that Tennessee has been selected before as a site for an interim storage facility. However, it was later soundly rejected as a storage site both by the Congress and the courts. We may be facing the possibility that Tennessee again will be selected as an interim storage site under the scenario I just outlined. 
In 1986, the Department of Energy recommended three sites for the location of interim storage facility for spent fuel. All three of those sites were in Tennessee. Given that history, we may be at the top or near the top of the list again, especially if Hanford and Savannah River are taken off the table. Removing Hanford and Savannah River from consideration makes it more likely that Oak Ridge would be selected as an interim storage site. 
We should make it clear again today that Tennessee is not an appropriate site to store this waste, just as Congress did in 1987. I assume we will do the same thing today. Oak Ridge itself is a population center. The city of Oak Ridge has 28,000 residents. Oak Ridge sits directly between two major population centers in our State--Knoxville, with a population of 175,000, and Chattanooga, with a metropolitan area population of approximately 424,000--and it is just 175 miles from the capital of Tennessee, Nashville. 
Oak Ridge also sits at the center of three major interstate highways--I-40, I-70, and I-81. Thus, it is an extremely heavily trafficked area. 
In addition, Oak Ridge is just 5 miles from the Melton Hill Dam and just 15 miles from Norris Dam. In other words, it sits in close proximity to major waterways and dam facilities. 
I would like to think that my concern is not well placed, and it may not be well placed, but as this deliberation has proceeded, it has become more and more a matter of relevant concern. So out of abundance of caution, I think this Congress should make clear what a past Congress made clear--that Oak Ridge is not a suitable place as a storage facility. For this reason, I urge the adoption of the amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate my able colleague's comments. He is eloquent in defense of his position. I respectfully disagree with him with regard to the history of this matter in some respects. It seems often when we agree with a decision, it is based on scientific evidence and when we disagree, it is based on politics. 
In this particular matter, the decision not to have the Tennessee site designated as a storage facility actually was also addressed by the courts at that time, and they determined that the DOE at that time in making that decision, violated the Nuclear Waste Act in failing to consult with the State before selecting the sites in Tennessee. So before Congress even got involved in the matter, the courts had addressed the matter and enjoined the DOE from putting the facility in Tennessee. 
In listening to my colleague, I am more and more concerned because he makes a case, for his belief anyway that Tennessee apparently would in fact be the logical place once you eliminate all of the other sites that have already been eliminated. 
Talking about objective criteria, I think population is one. As I mentioned, the city of Oak Ridge is a city of 28,000 people, in sharp contrast to a place like the Nevada test site, which has a population density of one-half person per square mile. That is subjective criteria. This is not raw politics by any stretch of the imagination. 
I am not saying that this site-by-site consideration is the best way to proceed. We simply find ourselves in a situation where we do not want the dagger pointed at the heart of the State of Tennessee, when all the dust settles and find, instead of a place where the facility ought to be, which is embodied in the body of this bill, that we find someplace that the Congress has already rejected in times past as not being meritorious.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I want to recognize the achievement and success of the University of Tennessee's Women's Basketball Team in winning the 1997 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship. 
Under the outstanding leadership of coach Pat Summitt, the Lady Volunteers have taken home the championship trophy 2 years in a row. These are the first back-to-back championships in 13 years, and we couldn't be any prouder back home in Tennessee. 
Throughout the season, the Lady Volunteers had their share both of tough games and exciting wins. But they proved their talent and skill in the end with their victory in the NCAA tournament. 
Women's basketball has become a tradition in Tennessee, and those of us who are fans have grown accustomed to great performances on the court. Over the years, the University of Tennessee's Women's Basketball program has attracted some of the most outstanding scholar-athletes in the nation, and in doing so it provides one of the most notable examples of sports excellence and academic superiority to be found anywhere. 
Coach Pat Summitt and her tremendous staff deserve special credit. With this victory, Pat takes the fifth NCAA title of her career, placing her behind only the great coach John Wooden in the championship tally. Pat has achieved a real milestone in winning 5 trophies in just 11 seasons. She's been in charge of the team for 22 years now, starting when she was a graduate student, and only 1 year older than some of her players. Today, the program she worked to build and maintain has helped set the standard for many other successful athletic efforts in other universities, and women's college basketball is a national phenomenon. 
In a word, Pat is a trailblazer. She has helped raise the profile of the exciting sport of women's college basketball, and she's created a lot of new fans. 
This championship season at UT will be remembered for a lot of things, but most notably I believe we'll look back at the heart and the determination that led these women through to victory. The people of Tennessee, fans and UT alumni who live across the country and around the world are proud of this exceptional achievement. 
When the UT Women cut down the nets in Cincinnati, they took home the memory of a hard-fought victory across a dramatic 5-month season. In a team loaded up with talent, the members came together for the effort it took to bring home the trophy. With a record of 29 wins and 10 losses, the Tennessee Lady Vols came through in the clinch. They surprised those who counted them out. In the end, they won the final game 68-59, leading for the entire first half in the game against Old Dominion and keeping up the pressure in the second half. 
All the loyal fans of the University of Tennessee and all those who enjoy women's basketball have had the privilege of enjoying this fantastic season in a string of fantastic seasons. And with the young team and the new recruits, there's sure to be more excitement on the way in the coming years. What a great achievement this is by an outstanding group of athletes and coaches. Congratulations to the University of Tennessee Lady Vols--the 1997 NCAA champions. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think that we have made substantial progress. In fact, I think remarkable progress. I cannot express the extent of my delight in the cooperation we have seen here in the last few hours in the U.S. Senate. 
The minority leader is absolutely correct in that we have tended to get off track and we have done a little too much disagreeing and not enough coming together. What we have done now is, really, I think for the first time, focused on some of these issues. I think that many of our Members have not had the opportunity to really focus on the legal and procedural issues and what some of these things will mean to us as we go down the road in trying to conduct an investigation. I think Members on both sides, when you come right down to it, and they stop and think about it and focus on these issues, really have a whole lot more in agreement than in disagreement. 
I think we all want to see this investigation done in a fair manner, in a thorough manner, and as expeditiously as possible. That is what we tried to set out in January when I took the floor and tried to set out what I thought should be the scope of the investigation and where I thought we were going and how we were going to do it. We have not always, every day, been able to adhere to that. 
Today, I think that we really are back on track again. I want to compliment the majority leader. There have been strong feelings on all sides of these issues, a lot of misunderstandings, and a lack of focus in terms of really what was involved and at stake here. He has brought us all together, I think, and required us to do that, along with the minority leader. The two of them working together, with Senator Glenn and others, has resulted in something that I think is very, very good today. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee, on the scope issue, came with what we felt was a good, broad scope of things we should look at. The Rules Committee came back with what many felt was too narrow a scope. And now we are somewhere in the middle of that, with the ability to look at not only illegal activities, but improper activities. That is where we ought to be, there is no question about that. It's not that we gain so much by having it in our mandate, it is what we lose if we don't have it in our mandate. We could not be in a position of not looking at improper activities, and Members on both sides came to that conclusion once they focused in on it. 
We have had a good debate. I watched most of the debate yesterday that we had. Members were heard on both sides. Many of the Republican Members pointed out the serious accusations and reports that are out there--some of the most grievous things that this country has seen, if they prove to be true, having to do with foreign influence in our country and what they were trying to obtain with regard to foreign contributions and things of that nature. Of course, they were right in that. Other Members, from the Democratic side, pointed out the fact that we needed to make sure that our scope was not so narrow as to look like we were either trying to protect ourselves or trying to keep from looking at things that might prove embarrassing to one side or another. They were correct, also. What today represents is a coming together of both of those approaches that we saw in the debate yesterday. 
The scope we have now of looking at illegal and improper activities is in the tradition of the Governmental Affairs Committee. As Senator Glenn pointed out yesterday, this is the McClellan committee, the Kefauver committee, the Truman committee; this is the primary investigative committee of this body. So, therefore, it's certainly now more in the traditional range of what the jurisdiction and scope of Governmental Affairs' activity has been in times past. Does it mean that we have solved all of our problems? Certainly not. 
We are going to have to be judges. The committee is going to have to make determinations right along as to what is illegal or improper allegations that might lead to illegalities, or might lead to evidence of improprieties, or what is the threshold. Is there a credible report, or is there credible evidence that there might be illegalities? Or are they illegalities or improprieties? Those are things that people, in good faith, can have different views of. I am convinced that we, as a committee, as we consider these matters, will come to the right conclusion. Whether it is merely illegalities, as the jurisdiction was before this compromise, or whether its illegalities and improprieties, as it is now, we are in the same position that we were in and Senator Inouye was in during the Watergate investigation. Determinations had to be made at that time as to what was allegedly illegal or improper. So we are really in no different position, in terms of that, than we have been in in times past. It will not always be pleasant for the members of the committee to have to make these determinations. But that is a part of our job, and we can do that job. 
I think now, with this broader scope, it makes it more clear in some areas that things can be appropriately looked at and looked into, which perhaps were murky before we reached this agreement. I do not think that it is wise for me or anyone else to prejudge an individual, or an activity, or anything of that nature before you know what the facts are. But I think it's fair to say that some of these activities that we have heard about are more clear now in terms of whether or not we have the jurisdiction to look at them. Some of them are still not clear. 
We will just have to sit down again, in good faith, and work out with each other what activities merit our attention, what activities merit our investigation. I should say that not everyone who receives a subpoena, for example, or not everyone who is asked to appear as a witness is being accused of an illegality or an impropriety. Sometimes people have evidence of illegalities or improprieties, or information that could be helpful, and they themselves have no problems at all. So that issue has been raised in some form, and I think we need to put people's minds at ease about that. 
I think it is also clear that--as I have said many times 
before--we will have to set priorities. I do not think we ought to say that anything in terms of illegal or improper is off the table. It is all there for us to look at. You can have what some people might refer to as a minor illegality or technicality on a very serious impropriety, and you would have to take that into consideration. But I think it is fair to say that we should look at the more serious matters first. 
What are the more serious matters? We will have to make those determinations. In my own estimation, certainly matters that have to do with national security, matters that have to do with the security of this country, clearly illegal matters that we would not have any good-faith disagreement on, matters that are clearly illegal, matters of that category would certainly have to be at the top of the list, not only because of obvious reasons, but because of very practical reasons, and that is that people in a clearly criminal category tend to be the ones who leave the country, the ones who make determinations to take the fifth amendment, the ones to get together with other people in that category and reach agreements of silence, and things of that nature. They tend to be the ones to destroy documents that might incriminate them. We have had some evidence of that. It has been in the public domain. So by their very nature they have to be ranked pretty high. 
So we will have to constantly prioritize. That does not mean we have to wait months and months to get into some matters that do not fit into that category I have just mentioned. It just means we operate in good faith, with common sense, prioritize, keep our eyes on the ball, make sure that we as Republicans are mindful that procedural safeguards have to be instituted. It is important not only that we be fair, but that we perceive to be fair, as we proceed. 
It's important that the Democrats understand that we in the majority always have the responsibility of carrying the ball forward and pushing it forward and getting into these serious matters that affect all of us as citizens, whether we are Democrats or Republicans. There is no reason we can't do that, Mr. President. 
I think this is an opportunity here to start a new day. I know that in the little battles we have had back and forth here on these issues, some procedural issues and subpoenas, and so forth, that if I had decisions to make over again, I would make them in a different way than I have in times past. I have tried to adhere to what I said from the first day, and that is to walk that tightrope between toughness and thoroughness on the one hand, and fairness and bipartisanship on the other. That is not always an easy tightrope to walk. I haven't always walked it as well as I would liked to have walked it, but I am committed to starting forward from today and making sure that we get back on track. 
The Watergate committee was mentioned several times in the last couple days, and I was just thinking about the fact that the Watergate committee, I believe, was created by a vote of this body 99 to nothing, the creation of the committee. I do not believe, in its entire existence, and it was about a year and a half--I am not sure what the official time was, but it took about a year and a half for the report to be filed--that there was ever any battle over jurisdiction; there was never any partisan fight over money; there was never any fight over scope; and there was never any fight over duration because they worked together through those tough problems. 
There is no reason why we cannot do that either. There is no reason why we cannot do the same thing either, because at the end of the day, if we have conducted ourselves well, gone through these tough times, had our disagreements--and we will have our disagreements, but if we have done it in a fair way and everybody has tried to do their best and is willing to go forward with an investigation that a lot of people are not going to like, at the end of the day these procedural matters and these fights that we have, skirmishes that we have had are not going to mean very much. Where we come out on these things that we are resolving today is not going to mean very much if we do the right thing and have a good investigation, a good set of hearings promptly and make a report back to the American people as to what we found. 
So, again, I want to commend the majority leader especially and also the minority leader, Senator Glenn, and others who have worked this scope problem out. I think we can go forward now. That has been my primary concern here for the last several days. There were some times there when I wondered if it was going to go forward. But I believe that our better selves were shown today, and we refocused on this matter. And hopefully now we are back on the right road. 
I understand that my colleagues will have some questions concerning my own views on some of what we have done, and I stand ready to respond to any questions my colleagues might have. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. THOMPSON. There has been no agreement with regard to that, but I think that is a sound procedure. I have not revisited that in several years, as you might imagine. I do recall now that the Senator mentions it that that was the procedure during the Watergate committee hearings, and that gives the minority an opportunity to make their views known to the majority that they might not otherwise have. I tend to view that favorably. I would bring that to the attention of the committee, I say to the Senator. For myself, I would tend to view that favorably.

Mr. THOMPSON. It does. It has already proven to be a delicate situation. We got off on a bit of a wrong foot with regard to subpoenas. I take my share of blame for that. I do not think Senator Glenn was fully aware of all of the work that went into preparing our first subpoena list. But on the other hand, I did nothing personally to make him aware of that. I was depending on a lot of staff work. But what happened was that we came forth with several subpoenas that some people categorized as Republican subpoenas on Democrats and only a couple of Democrat subpoenas on Republicans. 
I did not look at it that way. They were subpoenas which basically ultimately Senator Glenn, I do not think, really had any problem with. I thought they were more or less basic documents that we could get into business with. 
But it is a delicate matter. It is a very powerful tool and can be a powerful weapon in the wrong hands. I appreciate that. We need to make sure that we work a little closer together as we prepare these subpoena lists because there is nothing--if you want to divide up into sides--there is nothing that one side cannot do to the other side. You might not have the ultimate authority to get the subpoenas out, but you can obstruct and do other things that Senator Glenn knows better than anybody, the tools that a minority has to protect them. I know them, too. But we do not want to get bogged down into that. We want to try to get on past that, and I think we can. I think the Senator's suggestion has a lot of merit to it.

Mr. THOMPSON. As I look over the original scope that the Senator referred to that came out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, a few things jump out at me that I think clearly come within our jurisdiction, or in the scope as we now have it. Foreign contributions are clearly illegal, not only improper; conflicts of interest resulting in misuse of Government offices, failure by Federal Government employees to maintain or observe legal barriers between fundraising and official business, certainly are within the scope of illegal or improper. 
I think there are others here that fit that category. Frankly, I think there are some other categories where it is not so clear. We are dealing with categories of activities here. It is very difficult for me to, with great precision, say what category in any given set of circumstances might or might not fall within our scope. Many times the answer depends upon the facts of the case. You might have a certain activity that may or may not be improper, depending on facts that we do not know yet. 
So, while, in summary, and in answer to the Senator's question, I think that certainly there is a good deal here of the delineation of the scope that came out of Governmental Affairs that certainly is picked up by this expanded scope that we have here today, but I would not want to pass judgment on, as one individual member of the committee when the committee itself will have to make the determinations on individual situations--I would not, as one member, want to pass judgment on any particular activity or group of people or anything like that, without knowing more about the facts.

Mr. THOMPSON. You are asking me to be pretty specific. Again, we are talking about categories of activities and situations that depend on the facts. I will say that the prelude to the specific areas that we are talking about now, foreign contributions, misuse of Government offices, et cetera, says that we should look into illegal or improper activities or practices in the 1996 campaigns, `including but not limited to * * *.' So I think the original scope kind of speaks for itself there. There is a further delineation, but it still has to be improper or illegal. 
You have to understand, now, I am just one member talking, as far as my own views are concerned on this. But I would assume that there would still be, for example, some soft money activity that would not either be illegal or improper. If the rules and regulations permit it, it was done in a correct way, there was no collusion involved, it was not done from a Federal building--which of course in and of itself is problematic, depending upon your legal interpretation. If someone gave a $20,000 soft money contribution, I am not prepared, today, to say that that is improper. 
These are the kinds of things that the committee will have to decide. I can assure you that we will have an opportunity for full discussion on any area the Senator brings up.

<DOCNO>105-thompson-tn-8-19970311</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. THOMPSON. Yes. I think that without any question it is important that we attempt to have joint participation in the depositions. I think that whichever side notices the deposition, there should be a certain period of time when the other side is notified and given the opportunity to attend the deposition. There might be instances where that's impossible, in terms of someone participating, but the notice should always go. The notice should always be there. 
And we need to have a firm procedure as to who has notices given, so there is no question about the fact that notice has been given. And we need to exercise a little good faith and leeway. If the time that is agreed upon is not fully needed, for example, the side not taking the deposition should not insist on it. If a little more time is needed for scheduling purposes, the side scheduling the deposition should be reasonable there. But I think it is very important, to maintain the credibility of what we are doing, that if at all possible we have both sides at the depositions unless there is an agreement that it is not significant enough a deposition for both sides to be there. So, those are the goals that I would work toward.

<DOCNO>105-thompson-tn-9-19970311</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. THOMPSON. Yes. I think we need to use our best efforts to ensure that by providing reasonable notice under those circumstances, at least of all significant interviews. As you say, as these things go, there are going to be people scattered out in various places, and I think on many occasions they can go in teams. I think that will be good. But many times they are not going to be able to do that. 
As the Senator knows, we have been talking about procedures a lot here for the last couple of months. Now we have to get down to the heavy lifting. We have people to interview all across this country and people in other parts of the world. We are not going to always be able to do it side by side. But best efforts should be made to provide reasonable notice for all significant interviews, whether taken by the majority or the minority, so that the other side will have the opportunity to be there. 
I think the other important part of that is that regardless of whether or not there is participation or presence, that there is access to the information that comes from that interview. Although the opportunity to question might be lost if the person is not present, they still should have access to that information. That should be a part of the agreement also.

Mr. THOMPSON. I think the Senator is probably right. But let's talk about what we are really concerned about here. I think the Senator is wanting to be included in the front end of the consideration, basically. I think that is reasonable. It is not required by the rules. None of this is required by the rules of the Governmental Affairs Committee. This is my attempt to go beyond the rules in order to do something that I think is right and the fair thing to do. 
Let me not mislead you here. I think these are things that I always felt were best worked out at the staff level, but I think we are going to have to address them now. I do not think it is ever practical to have Senators sit down around the table for the very first conversation about who we are going to subpoena. I think we have to let the staff do their work. They have to come to us individually and as a group. They have to come to me as chairman and Senator Glenn with their ideas. There has to be opportunity to have free discussion back and forth, and if somebody writes a list of names or companies down that they feel should have top priority, they should not have to be apologetic about that. It has to start somewhere. 
So we need to let the staff do their work, then we need to have the staff submit that to the members, and then the members need to talk to each other. That is my idea of proceeding. 
Now, if you want to do it otherwise, if you really think that it is good for us to involve ourselves that much on the front end, I will consider something else. But I think you want to consider that very, very carefully, because I don't think that is the highest and best use of our time. 
Prior to now, in the 54 subpoenas that were issued, I believe, if Senators will check, they will find that the staff did work together. There was considerable time; there was a requirement to give 72-hour notice. We gave more than that, all 
on the staff level. But there was lots of discussion. Whether or not somebody came up with a list before they started talking or they made the list in the presence of each other, I don't really care, and I don't think we should care. 
But what happened was, I think where we broke down was, I didn't call Senator Glenn and tell him, basically, what was going on at the staff level, and I think that was a mistake on my part. 
So I hear what you are saying. You want to be included on the front end of the discussion. But we are going to get into some busy activity around here. We all are going to be challenged tremendously, not only with regard to this investigation, but with regard to our regular business. It is going to be fast and furious for a long time, and I don't want to be accused anymore of being unfair to anybody. 
So I want to lay it on the table on the front end. If you want more than I think right now is reasonable, I will be willing to discuss that. What I think is reasonable is to let the staff do their job, then report to the members, then the members sit down. The crucial part is not what is written down on a piece of paper; the crucial part is what comes out the other end. 
The rules require 72-hour notice. We will try our best to have consultation over and above what the rules require. I don't see any reason why we can't learn from past experience and be able to have a procedure where both sides are satisfied on the subpoena issue.

Mr. THOMPSON. I will strive toward that end. I think that is what I should have done last time and didn't. Although it is not required, it is something I should have done in retrospect, because I think it sent a signal that I didn't mean to send. There are going to be times when I may not be able to do that, but I will make my best efforts along those lines.

Mr. THOMPSON. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his usual eloquent remarks. I think I agree with everything that he said. I am one of those who have thought for a long time that we needed to make some significant changes in our campaign finance reform system. And I still believe that way stronger today than ever before. 
But I want to leave one thought, not in response to what the Senator said, but from watching the talk shows and some of the comments that some of the people at the White House have made, and so forth, about this. When talking about the issue of the need for campaign finance reform, my remarks on the floor on January 28 were referred to earlier. Something rang home with me, so I got them. And here is one of the things I said then. I said:  
But those of us with responsibility in this area, whether it be the President or Members of Congress, cannot let the call for campaign finance reform serve to gloss over serious violations of existing law. If we do that, the reform debate will be cast in a totally partisan context and ensure that once again campaign finance reform will be killed. 
So it occurred to me that once again we must be reminded of the fact that those of us who want campaign finance reform must remember that the best thing we can do for campaign finance reform is to continue to talk about it if we want to, but also make sure we do a good set of tough bipartisan hearings that the American people have some confidence in. 
For those who want campaign finance reform, let us get about the money laundering, the foreign contributions, the allegations of selling public policy, allegations of violations of the Hatch Act, the Ethics Act, and the serious matters, 
that will do more for campaign finance reform than anything else. 
I thank the President and yield back the balance of the 2 minutes I was referring to. 
How much time is remaining?

Mr. THOMPSON. In response, I think that would be one of the circumstances that might lead us to ask for an extension of time. 
It would depend, I think, on the totality of the circumstances. We would need to feel that we really needed the additional information that was important to our investigation. With that being the case, that would be one of those circumstances. 
I might add, the Senator makes a very good and valid point, and one that I raised in January on this floor. It is one that I raised in the Governmental Affairs Committee when we were discussing scope and duration. I also raised it in the Rules Committee the other day. The Senator points out the fact that a good defense can sometimes take you past any cutoff date that you might establish out there as a target. 
I do not know if the Senator will ask about other circumstances, but I can certainly think of a couple of other circumstances that would cause the same problem. The White House, for example, in times past, has taken positions with regard to questions of executive privilege that were not valid. If you want the documents or the testimony, usually documents, then you have to go through a process, 
and you have to wind up in court, if you think the documents are important. So that is another situation where it would certainly be appropriate, if you needed that information, to come back before the Senate and ask for an extension of time. 
Third, and most obvious circumstance, would be simply where you run into additional leads that are material and substantial and that you need to follow up on to make a credible and complete report back to the U.S. Senate. All along the way, I have pointed out this problem, as has the Senator from Pennsylvania. What we have reached here today on that issue is a bit troubling to me, quite frankly. I have tried to point out that, although we have a so-called cutoff date of December 31, we have said that when those circumstances arise--the three we have discussed here--or any other circumstances arise where we have just cause to come back, that we will be back. I have been assured by Members of both parties, and the Governmental Affairs Committee and the Rules Committee, that they would be right there with us in attempting to get an extension under those circumstances.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, our generation inherited the freest, strongest, most prosperous country in the history of civilization. Within one generation, we are changing that. When historians look back and ask the question, `When did the decline of the United States begin,' they will point to our generation, because we are the first generation to spend the fortune of our grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
But we are told that we don't need to worry about it because we are in the process of balancing the budget, as evidenced by the President's latest so-called `balanced budget.' But when the analysis comes out, we see that we are looking at another $69 billion in deficit, and this so-called `balanced budget' is supposed to make all the cuts. But 98 percent of the cuts are in the last 2 years--after the President leaves office. We know that this is a sham. We know that even if, for a nanosecond, we did balance the budget in the year 2002, it would not account for the baby boomers who are going to be retiring in 2010. Can't we look forward for our Nation's future? 
I support the balanced budget amendment and urge immediate passage.

Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Utah for his strong leadership on this issue. It is not easy carrying the ball for so long and so well. He has done such an admirable job of that. I am sure our colleagues on both sides of the aisle admire him for what he has done. 
I want to talk for a few minutes on the broader question of the need for the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. It seems to me that among all of the things we address in this body, there are some basic considerations that should underlie it all, and we should focus from time to time on what we really should be about, what we should do as those who govern. 
I think it comes down to two basic categories, that is, trying to institute policies that make for the long-term strength of this country, and to try to do things that will encourage people to have more confidence and faith in their system of government. 
I believe those are the two basic things we ought always keep in mind as we go about our structured existence around here, the hurly-burly that we all have to contend with in passing thousands of pieces of legislation. Does it contribute to the long-term strength and viability of this country and does it contribute to people's confidence in their form of Government. I feel that is what we are dealing with here. I feel that every once in a while something comes up that really 
is important with regard to one or the other of those considerations, and I think the constitutional amendment to balance the budget has to do with both of those considerations, because I fear for the economic future of this country if we do not pass such an amendment. 
I feel that when the results of our economic policies today are felt a little bit further down the road and we see that once again the so-called balanced budget agreements that we may reach around here do not, in fact, balance the budget, we are going to increase the cynicism that the American people already have toward this Government. That is why I think a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is so important. 
There has been a lot of discussion as to whether or not there really is a need. I think most all of us take seriously the proposition of amending the Constitution, even though our forefathers certainly contemplated it. Thomas Jefferson is often quoted. Certainly they felt that from time to time we need to reexamine our basic institutions and not be afraid after due deliberation to make changes that in the course of history are proven necessary to improve our system of government. But it is not something to be taken lightly, and I do not think any of us do take it lightly. 
It is clear that from time to time we must sit down and see whether or not we are functioning as we should, whether we are getting the job done for this country and, if not, what should we do about it. We can go down the same old road or we can try to do something about it. 
This constitutional amendment constitutes doing something about it because it is clear that we will go down in history under present circumstances as the first generation to leave their children in worse shape than they found their country when they took positions of leadership. It is true, without question, that we are leaving the next generation with astronomical tax rates to face, astronomical interest rates to face, a slower economy. We certainly are on the road, the path that most and great civilizations have followed through history. Some historians say you can calculate it almost to the year. Some say they survive for 250 years. A case can be made that we are on the downside of that mountain, that we are certainly going in the same direction of other great powers--the Turks or Ottoman Empire or Spanish Empire, ones that ruled the world once upon a time but proved they could slide off into second-rate powers and nations that were much less than what they aspired to be or were in prior times. 
A good case can be made that we are on track for that. We know, our own entitlement commission tells us that by the year 2012 we will be paying out all of the tax collections we receive in entitlement and interest rates and have nothing for national defense, have nothing for infrastructure, have nothing for education. That is the road we are going down. 
Some say, no, we are making progress; all we need to do is get about the business of balancing the budget, that we are really making progress. If history is to be any indication of that, though, I hope that plea falls on deaf ears, as it should. 
The President's budget is used as an example of the fact that we are making progress, we might even have a so-called balanced budget amendment agreement. However, upon examination, we see readily that the President's budget or anything that might come from the President's budget that we might agree to is not going to solve the problem. It will not balance the budget. It adds over $1 trillion to the debt. It is based on assumptions that in all likelihood will not play out. It is based on assumptions having to do with current economic expansion which is now in the sixth year, making it the third longest on record. The likelihood is that will not continue indefinitely. It is based upon high projections of corporate profits that the CBO says are unrealistic. It is based upon the proposition that we will continue to have medical savings, and many, many experts, including the Budget Committee, think we have got most of those savings on the front end, that they will not be occurring year after year after year, and that will impact our tax revenues. 
The President's budget is based upon extremely optimistic projections for long-term interest rates. And last but not least, of course, three-quarters of the cuts in the President's budget come after the President is no longer in office, the last 2 years. 
In other words, it is based on the proposition that a future Congress will have more courage than this one does and we will be making cuts in discretionary programs, things that most all of us agree we need to be more attentive to, things like infrastructure and research and development and things of that nature that provide for the long-term viability of this Nation. But the proposition is that we will continue to squeeze that 17 percent of nonentitlement, nondefense, noninterest portion of the budget, that narrow 17 percent, for those infrastructure items and parks and that sort of thing, and get astronomical savings from cutting those areas in the last 2 years. 
We know that will not happen. We know that will never take place. So that is why David Broder referred to the budget as one of `no hard choices.' But, as we know, the time is past for no hard choices. We cannot get by with that any longer. We cannot get by with that indefinitely. 
Last Saturday I was watching on television, on C-SPAN, a former colleague of ours, Senator Packwood. He was speaking to a group out in Oregon about things that he knows a lot about, about our tax structure, about budgetary matters. As chairman of the Finance Committee, of course, he was deeply involved in those matters. He had some charts. 
I called and asked for those tables with regard to percentages of taxing and spending as a percentage of gross domestic product with regard to this country and other countries. There are some very interesting things in there in terms of where we are today and where we are likely to be tomorrow.

Mr. THOMPSON. What road are we on? If we do not need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and if we do not have that, what is likely to happen based on history and based on reasonable projections? 
First of all, he gave me a chart that had to do with United States, State/local, and total government taxes and spending as a percentage of GNP. It showed a couple of different things. 
In 1950, the tax take was 21.4 percent. In 1950, 21.4 percent of GDP. In 1995 it was 30.4 percent. But, spending went from 23.1 percent to 32.4 percent. 
So the point that he made, which I think is a valid one, is you cannot tax your way out of this problem. We are increasing taxes both in real terms and in terms of percentage of GDP, but of course, spending continues to increase right along with it. So, today, we are taxing a little over 30 percent and spending a little over 32 percent. 
Then he made some comparisons with some other countries. I think it is some indication of our future, and some indication of maybe our past in a way. As far as our future is concerned, the direction it looks like we are likely to go is the same direction that many of our friends in Europe and Scandinavian countries went. Figures with regard to Germany, France, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden--there, interestingly enough, they, too, are spending a greater percentage of their GDP than their taxing reflects. 
In Germany they are taxing 46 percent, spending 50; France, 49 percent, spending 54; Norway and Denmark and Sweden--Denmark, of course, taxing 60 percent of GDP and spending 62 percent. 
What is in common among all of these countries is they all have economic problems. They are all having problems with unemployment. They are all having the problems with the demographics that we will soon be facing, problems of a growing elderly population. They are all economies that, I think it would be fair to be say, generally are stagnating and having great problems. They are all economies that historically, just like us, always spend a little more than they tax. They continue to raise taxes, but always spend a little more than they tax. That seems to be our future on the present course. 
On the other hand, if you look at some countries around the Pacific rim--Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, countries of that nature, you see they are taxing in the neighborhood of between 14 and 17 percent of GDP and spending in the neighborhood of 16 and 17 percent of GDP. So, not only do they have very low rates of taxation and low rates of spending, but their spending is not outstripping their taxes. 
What do we have there that is common among those countries? High rates of growth, high employment rates, economic prosperity. They are behind us right now in many respects. They are on the move. They are catching up with these policies, and we are looking to a future with these other policies. 
There is no reason to believe we will not go down that same road that our European neighbors and our Scandinavian neighbors have gone. That, of course, will put us in an extremely vulnerable position when the baby boomers start retiring and all of our social services are flooded with those numbers. We are not going to be able to make it. It is going to take all of our revenues. We all know that. We all dance around and make sounds about a balanced budget because we are putting the numbers down on the back of an envelope. You could put numbers 
on the back of an envelope, saying that future Congresses will cut when the time comes so, therefore, we have a balanced budget. It is the easiest thing in the world to do on paper but everybody knows it is not going to happen. And when it does not happen, once again we will wonder why only 48 percent of the people in this Nation are even bothering to vote. It is because they feel there is a kind of joint, tacit understanding we will say whatever is necessary and do whatever is necessary for temporary political advantage, telling people we are going to have something that we are not really going to have, while continuing to spend because spending garners political support, political votes, and political contributions, and hoping that the hatchet will fall on somebody else's watch, years down the road. 
That is what this is all about. We can make arguments about various amendments to this constitutional amendment. Some of them are well thought out, well reasoned and so forth. But they avoid the hard question. Are we going to limit ourselves? 
Again, people say we do not need to mess with the Constitution in order to do that because we have it within our means to do the right thing. By that logic, we should not have to have the first amendment. We have it in our means not to pass a law abridging freedom of speech. All we have to do is not do it. Yet, we decided that we ought to have a constitutional amendment because we know historically, and our Founding Fathers certainly knew, that there seemed to be a tendency--I ask unanimous consent for another 3 minutes.

Mr. THOMPSON. Our Founding Fathers knew historically governments like to pass laws abridging freedom of speech. They knew historically that governments like to pass laws or carry out activities that constitute illegal searches and seizures, and that is why we came up with the fourth amendment. Governments historically like to do things that we decided a long time ago that we don't want them to do. 
What has history shown with regard to our ability to pass a balanced budget, or our ability to restrain spending? If we have any track record at all, it is one that is clear as can possibly be and that is we do not have that ability, we do not have that will in order to do that. 
Interestingly and parenthetically, after it was over with, in Q and A, Senator Packwood was asked, `Senator Packwood, where do we get that will?" 
He thought for a minute and said, `I am reluctantly coming to the conclusion that the only thing that will cause it will be term limits.' 
But that is a debate for another day. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today the U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO] issues its high risk series which identifies those federal programs that are especially vulnerable to waste and mismanagement. The programs identified in these reports have cost taxpayers billions of dollars in unnecessary expenditures. Without adequate oversight from the Congress many more billions will be wasted before we are through. While the magnitude of the problems GAO has identified is shocking, I am optimistic that we have in place the tools to change Government for the better--but we must be willing to use them. 
There is a tendency when we are debating how to balance the budget or when the crisis de jour erupts, for Government to ignore management issues--those which to some are tedious, time-consuming and best left to the bean-counters. While management issues sometimes tend to get swept under the carpet during high-minded policy debates, we ignore them at our peril. We cannot implement any of our policy solutions without effective public administration. In an era of static resources, if we are to balance the budget, replace aging weapon systems at the Department of Defense [DOD], or attack drug abuse, we must achieve significant savings. To find the money, we have to make Government better while cheaper and, to do that, we have to do things smarter. 
GAO identifies 25 areas that we must focus on to avoid squandering billions of taxpayer dollars. For example, GAO reports that DOD wastes billions of dollars each year on unneeded and inefficient activities, is vulnerable to additional billions of dollars in waste by buying unnecessary supplies and risks overpaying contractors millions of dollars for services not rendered. It reports that the Internal Revenue Service's accounting is so poor that it cannot effectively manage the collection of the over $113 billion owed the U.S. Government in delinquent taxes. In addition, GAO again criticizes the management of the IRS' computer modernization effort. Just last week, certain IRS officials conceded that this `modernization' has already cost the taxpayers $4 billion and `does not work in the real world'. 
IRS is not the only Federal agency having a problem coming to grips with the electronic age. Over the last 6 years, the Federal Government has spent $145 billion on computers but continues to have, according to GAO, `chronic problems harnessing the full potential of information technology to improve performance, cut costs, and/or enhance responsiveness to the public.' The security of sensitive data on Government computers and how well the Government converts its old computers to run in the 2000 were also identified by GAO as areas that posed a risk to the Treasury. 
Billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse occur in Federal benefit programs. GAO reports, in the supplemental security income program alone, taxpayers are losing over $1 billion a year in overpayments. The $197 billion Medicare Program, according to GAO `loses significant amounts due to persistent fraudulent and wasteful claims and abusive billings.' 
The risk of losses from the $941 billion Federal loan portfolio is another source of taxpayer vulnerability. Currently, the Government has $44 billion of defaulted guaranteed loans on its books and has written off many billions more over the last few years. According to GAO, three loan programs (student, farm, and housing) are especially vulnerable due to poor agency management. GAO also calls for improving Federal contract management at several agencies that spend tens of billions of dollars each year on contractor support. Finally, the 2000 census was placed on the high risk list. The census has tremendous implications in the allocation of billions of dollars in Federal funding and for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives. 
However, GAO was not all doom and gloom acknowledging that, `after decades of seeing high risk problems and management weaknesses recur in agency after agency,' Congress has moved to enact several Government-wide reforms to address the situation. GAO mentions five such laws as key to improving operations in the Federal Government: The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act information management and procurement reforms of 1996. These laws are designed to get the Federal Government to operate in a sound, businesslike manner. It is up to Congress and the administration to ensure that these management reforms are implemented to improve Government performance and results. 
I want to work with the administration and my colleagues in Congress to improve the Government's operations. As part of this process, I plan to invite before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee the Director of OMB to address the problems identified by GAO. We have the legislative framework in place to eradicate these programs from GAO's high risk list. What we need is the vision and fortitude to implement these bipartisan management reforms and achieve a lasting solution to the management problems that torment the pocketbook of our citizens.

<TEXT>
Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a constitutional amendment to limit congressional service to 6 years in the House and 12 years in the Senate. This proposal is identical to the one introduced in the 104th Congress. On May 22, 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the term limits that 23 different States had imposed on congressional service. The Court further declared that Congress lacks the constitutional authority to enact term limits by statute. Therefore, enacting this reform, which polls consistently show that more than 70 percent of the American people support, will require passing a constitutional amendment. 
Although this proposal is not about denigrating the institution of Congress or those who have ably served lengthy tenures, public confidence in elected officials does remain abysmally low. Given the many scandals involving public officials, the myriad of negative campaign commercials, and the inability of Congress to solve major national problems like the budget deficit, I can hardly blame the American people for being cynical. Nothing could be farther from the basic tenets of democracy than a professional ruling class, yet despite the supposedly high turnover in the last three congressional elections, that is essentially what Congress has become. 
Each of the last three Congresses has had unusually large freshman classes, but the percentage of those returned to Congress still exceeds the typical return rate prior to 1941. I acknowledge that altering the way we elect Members of Congress is a task not to be undertaken lightly, and people are justified in asking, what has changed since the ratification of the Constitution that necessitates this proposal? To them, I answer simply: The trend toward careerism in Congress. Although the system has worked relatively well for 200 years, the Founding Fathers viewed service in Congress not as a permanent career but as an interruption to a career. For the first 150 years of the Republic, in keeping with this notion, those who served in public office typically stepped down after only a few years. While incumbents were still almost always re-elected when they chose to run, a turnover rate of 50 percent every 2 years in the House was common throughout the 19th century. In fact, only 24 percent of the Members of the House in 1841 were sworn in again 2 years later. George Washington voluntarily stepped down after two terms as President because he understood the value of returning to private life and giving someone else the chance to serve. Over the last few decades, however, Members of Congress have become much less likely to step down voluntarily, so the average length of service in Congress has steadily increased. Because of this trend toward careerism, Congress now more closely resembles a professional ruling class than the citizen legislature our Founding Fathers envisioned. 
This is significant because a Congress full of career legislators behaves differently than a citizen legislature. Over time, after years of inside-the-beltway thinking, elected officials tend to lose touch with the long-term best interests of the Nation. Instead, they become slaves to short-term public opinion in their never-ending quest for re-election. Last year's Medicare debate is a good example of how constant elections, and the lure of short-term political advantage, make it harder to make the tough decisions. The constant flow of pork-barrel projects back home, the practice of effectively buying our constituents' votes with funds from the U.S. Treasury, is another example of how what may be beneficial to politicians at the next election is not necessarily in the best interests of the Nation. When Congress is not a career for its Members, their career will not be on the line every time they cast a vote, so I believe that term limits would more likely produce individuals who would take on the tough challenges that lie ahead. 
To act in the long-term national interest, elected officials also need to live under the laws they pass, which is why we enacted the Congressional Accountability Act in the last Congress. Similarly, it is important that elected officials return home after their term expires and live with the consequences of the decisions they made while in Congress. Just as the Congressional Accountability Act makes elected officials more cognizant of how laws affect average Americans in the long run, term limits, by requiring Members of Congress to return to private life, would encourage Members to consider the long-term effects of their decisions instead of just the short-term political consequences. 
Moreover, little doubt exists that power exercises a gradual, corruptive influence over those who have it. The Founding Fathers recognized this and used a system of checks and balances to limit the power of any one individual. When elected officials are up here for decades at a time, their accumulating power and growing disregard for the national interest often cause them to become arrogant in office. Term limits, by further dispersing power among more individuals, I believe, would lead to a more honest breed of politicians. 
Term limits will also make elections more competitive which will, in turn, lead to better representation. One only needs to look at the 1996 elections to see that most competitive elections are for open seats. Twelve-year limits on Senate service would guarantee every State an open-seat election at least once every 12 years unless a challenger dislodges an incumbent. Furthermore, term-limited officeholders will be more likely to seek a higher office. A Member of the House who is term limited will be more likely to run for the Senate than a Congressman who is not term limited and can easily win re-election to the House for many years to come. A term-limited Senator will be more likely to run for Governor or another office instead of seeking easy re-election to the Senate. 
Opponents of term limits make many arguments against the proposal, confident that they know better than more than 70 percent of the American people. Perhaps the most prevalent argument against term limits is that Congress will lose many good people. While this is true, as I have already pointed out, we will be gaining many good people as well. More to the point though, we should not be so arrogant as to think that we are the only ones who can do this job. I do not believe that the 535 people who currently serve in Congress are the only 535 people out there who can do the job. Two hundred years ago, people wondered how the Nation could ever survive without the leadership of George Washington, but President Washington knew that the system was stronger than any one man, and that many people were fit to be President. Not only do I think that many people besides us can do the job, but the argument that only the 535 currently serving in Congress possess the ability to solve the Nation's problems assumes that we are doing a good job now. A $5 trillion debt, Medicare and Social Security on unsustainable courses, an out-of-control campaign finance system, and unacceptably high levels of crime make this assumption dubious. A corollary of this argument is that term limits will result in Congress having little institutional memory. However, if the legislative process and the bills that come out of this place are so complicated as to require more than 12 years of experience to understand, then Congress is doing too much. The average citizen, with the additional focus of full-time attention to the issues with which Congress concerns itself, should be more than capable of doing the job. 
The other main argument against term limits is that we already have term limits in the form of elections. However, this reasoning has two problems. First, incumbents enjoy a tremendous advantage in elections. The ability to raise money, greater name recognition, a staff already in place, constituent service, and simple voter inertia help incumbents win their races more than 90 percent of the time. Second, the American people, just as they have a right to elect their representatives in Congress, have every right to place qualifications on whom they may elect. Opponents of term limits say that the voters ought to be able to elect whomever they want, but when the American people ratified the Constitution, they agreed not to elect anyone to the Senate who is younger than 30 years of age or not a resident of the State he or she seeks to represent. If the voters choose, and more than 70 percent of them do, they can also declare that people who have already served 12 years in the Senate may not be elected to the Senate again. 
It is my hope that we will move quickly to debate this measure. Perhaps no other proposal as popular with the American people has received so little attention from Congress. In fact, Congress has been so reticent with respect to this issue that some term-limits advocates are now asking the States to call a constitutional convention. The debate in the last Congress was the first serious discussion of this issue in Congress in the history of the Nation. Speaker Gingrich has already said that term limits will be the first item of business this year in the other body. Finally, other tough decisions are imminent including balancing the budget, saving Medicare, and putting Social Security on a permanently sustainable course. The single most important thing we can do to cultivate an environment where Congress can effectively address these long-term problems is to enact term limits immediately. Therefore, I urge my colleagues' support.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to address some vital management issues at the Department of Commerce and urge Secretary-designate Daley to make use of the management tools Congress has provided to obtain better results for the taxpayers' investment. The Department of Commerce must tackle some endemic management problems before it can successfully carry out its mission of promoting the Nation's international trade, economic growth, and technological advancement. 
The main problem with the Department of Commerce may be in the breadth of its mission. Commerce's writ runs from promoting American competitiveness in the global marketplace to providing the weather data we see on the news each night. The Department, which employs 35,000 people and spends $3.5 billion of taxpayer dollars is, in reality, a loose collection of more than 100 programs. In the last Congress, many questioned the value added of this departmental bureaucracy. This culminated in action by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee to report out a bill that would have abolished the Department, as such, and reassigned many of its functions. 
Clearly, the Department's new leadership will have a task ahead of it to ensure that its many bureaus and offices are efficiently run and are effectively serving the taxpayers' interest. For example, the General Accounting Office [GAO] has identified the National Weather Service's modernization efforts as being a high risk area which is especially vulnerable to the problems of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. This year, planning for the decennial census is expected to be added to that list. In addition, auditors have found significant accounting problems at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
I hope that the Department of Commerce will be able to improve its operations through effective implementation of recently enacted legislation. Congress has given the agencies like the Department of Commerce the tools to improve their management operations, most notably by passing the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act [GPRA] of 1993, and the information management and procurement reforms of the 104th Congress. These laws are designed to get the Federal Government to operate in a sound, businesslike manner and implementing these management reforms is a major responsibility for each department head. 
The Government Performance and Results Act, for example, can be an effective tool to make Government work better by measuring the success or failure of Government programs and using this information to support budget decisions. For example, GAO found that the Commerce Department shares its mission with at least 71 Federal departments, agencies, and offices. With this type of overlap and duplication, the Department needs to have a clear idea of its primary missions, otherwise it risks doing a lot of things poorly and nothing well at all. GPRA, by focusing on agency missions and results, will give Commerce, the Office of Management and Budget, and Congress the information necessary to consolidate and eliminate wasteful and redundant programs at the Department. 
I submitted to Secretary-designate Daley several questions regarding his views on implementing GPRA and improving Commerce's financial accountability and information resources management as part of his confirmation process. I look forward to receiving from him a firm commitment to use GPRA's strategic planning process, performance goals, and performance measures to radically transform his agency to better serve the taxpayers. 
There are many challenges ahead for Congress and Secretary-designate Daley as we address the problems at the Department of Commerce identified by GAO, the Department's inspector general and others. Certainly, the bipartisan management reforms we have enacted should be implemented to assist in that process. I am sure that together we can work to effectively implement sound management policies and practices and I look forward to achieving those objectives in the coming Congress.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici as a cosponsor of this important legislation. I supported a similar measure in the 104th Congress and held a hearing last year in the Committee on Governmental Affairs. The issue has been debated over a number of years without success. However, the 105th Congress presents a new opportunity. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I pledge my support in moving this measure to the full Senate. 
The bill being introduced today has the fundamental goal of moving both the budget and appropriations process to a 2-year cycle--just once at the beginning of each Congress. In addition, it will link program results obtained under the Government Performance and Results Act [GPRA] to the budget process. Congressional committees will be required to review the GPRA reports and provide views and comments in conjunction with their comments on the budget. 
Biennial budgeting would provide more time for Congress to conduct greater oversight and indepth evaluations of existing programs. We need to take more time to find out what is working and what is not. Congress should not just rely on good intentions when it passes new measures. We must ensure that the laws we write do provide the benefits and services as envisioned. The current budget process leaves us with far too little time to devote to thoughtful and systematic oversight of Federal programs, and far too little time to develop and consider long-term policy initiatives. 
Another important reason I support 2-year budgeting, in addition to enhanced oversight, I believe the bill would provide Members of Congress with more time to spend with the people they represent, receiving their views and insights on Government programs, services, and pending legislation. Freedom from dealing with the budget on an annual basis has the ability to move us closer to a citizen legislature as envisioned by the Founding Fathers. We have no greater responsibility than representing the people of our State. To do so, we need to spend time at home. 
On the issue biennial budgeting, once again the States are leading the way, with more than 20 States currently using some form of it. I firmly believe it is time for Washington to recognize the value in this and enact this bill promptly. I support the Biennial Appropriations and Budget Act of 1997, and encourage all my colleagues to do the same. It is an idea whose time has come.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to use the opportunity, following Senate confirmation of Andrew Cuomo as the next Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to address some vital management issues at the Department. The Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], like many other federal agencies, is confronted by serious management problems that impede its ability to carry out its mission. 
HUD, which Secretary-designate Cuomo will head, has a diverse group of activities under its purview. HUD manages an $885 billion loan portfolio and provides $25 billion in rental subsidies and over $5 billion annually in community development grants. As the principal agency concerned with the Nation's housing needs and redeveloping our decaying cities, HUD has a monumental task on its hands and should be run as efficiently and effectively as a Fortune 500 company. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in the past. 
Historically, HUD has had a rocky track record. Departmentwide management deficiencies were a major factor leading to the 1989 HUD scandals. In 1994, the General Accounting Office placed the entire department on its high risk list, designating HUD as `especially vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.' I understand that this year GAO will continue to keep HUD on its high risk list, believing that the deficiencies hampering HUD's leadership in effectively managing the agency have yet to be resolved. 
Congress has given agencies like HUD the tools to improve their management operations, most notably by passing legislation developed by the Governmental Affairs Committee such as the Chief Financial Officers [CFO] Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act [GPRA] of 1993, and the procurement and information technology reforms of last Congress. These laws are designed to get the Federal Government to operate in a sound, businesslike manner and implementing these management reforms is a major responsibility for each department head. I urge Mr. Cuomo to devote as much of his time as necessary to use these laws to focus on getting results for the taxpayers who fund HUD and the many who depend on its programs. 
The Government Performance and Results Act, for example, can be an effective tool to make government work better by measuring the success or failure of government programs and using this information to support budget decisions. I am encouraged by Secretary-designate Cuomo's enthusiastic support of GPRA in his responses to my questions submitted during his confirmation process. This is because effective GPRA implementation is especially needed at HUD. HUD's programs and missions often overlap or are linked only tangentially to HUD's primary missions. The National Academy of Public Administration and HUD's inspector general [IG] have recommended eliminating, consolidating, or restructuring many of HUD's 240 programs and activities, 91 of which, the IG said, were questionably related to the department's primary mission. GPRA, by focusing on agency missions and results, will give 
HUD, the Office of Management and Budget and the Congress the information necessary to consolidate and eliminate these wasteful and redundant programs. 
Unfortunately, HUD has a long way to go toward effectively implementing GPRA. The HUD IG recently found that the department is just beginning to develop an agencywide strategic plan, the key underpinning and starting point for the process of goal-setting and performance measurements under GPRA. The IG report also indicated that HUD staff felt that the initial plans were developed only by a few of the Department's staff and did not involve input from a broad range of HUD offices. Given the need for broad acceptance of performance measures and established deadlines for implementing GPRA, I hope the new Secretary will take steps to ensure the integrity and successful implementation of GPRA at HUD. 
GPRA is dependent on sound financial management--something that HUD is lacking. One of the reasons for GAO's designation of HUD as a high-risk area is its poorly integrated, ineffective, and generally unreliable information and financial management systems. These systems do not meet program managers' needs and provide inadequate control over HUD's housing and community development programs. HUD must get better control over its finances and prepare timely financial statements as required by the CFO Act. 
Good financial data relies upon the development of effective computer systems and these systems are crucial to HUD's ability to meet its housing mission and business needs. In recent years, the Department has obligated over $170 million annually to activities related to information management. Yet HUD has had a poor history of managing its information resources, and as a result, is struggling with aging systems that do not adequately meet the agency's needs and are contributing causes of managerial inadequacies. 
In response to its problems, HUD has undergone dramatic structural changes. In September 1995, HUD completed a major field reorganization which was intended to eliminate previously confused lines of authority, enhance communications, reduce levels of review and approval, and improve customer service. In January 1996, HUD announced additional plans to reduce headquarters staff and further streamline its field organization by, among other things, closing up to 10 of HUD's 81 field offices by the end of fiscal year 1997. However, it is questionable whether these changes have turned the tide as GAO has found that the Department still has an ineffective organizational structure. 
The situation is not hopeless. HUD has made some progress in recent years addressing these Departmentwide management deficiencies, but success will require top-down management support. I hope Secretary-designate Cuomo will articulate a management vision that can improve operations at HUD and take measures required to take the agency off GAO's and Congress' high-risk list. I look forward to working with him to achieve those objectives in this Congress and to effectively implement the bipartisan management reforms passed by Congress in recent years.

 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we introduced legislation earlier this week to establish a Corporate Subsidy Review, Reform, and Termination Commission. We know that many Americans believe that Government operates for the benefit of the few and the privileged. They believe the system does not operate fairly, and their lack of confidence in us affects our ability to enact the reforms and make the hard decisions which must be made if we are to get our country back on the right track again. 
Last Congress, we actively sought to reform many areas of Government spending--we reduced Government spending by $53 billion, reformed the welfare system, restructured farm supports, rewrote telecommunications law, reformed the Federal procurement system, and adopted major immigration reforms. We identified and reformed areas of Government spending which needed fundamental reform because they did not work as well as they should. 
As part of this process, a bipartisan group of Senators examined some programs whose primary beneficiaries are profit-making enterprises and proposed reforming 12 specific programs which are characterized by some element of corporate subsidization. We chose these examples to demonstrate that such programs exist in virtually every industry, from military construction, to energy production, to consumer product advertising. While all the sponsors were not uniformly enthusiastic about each of the 12 examples, we believed the package as a whole underscored an important point and demonstrated our willingness to examine Government spending in every area. This proposal was offered as an amendment to the reconciliation bill, and received the support of only one-fourth of the Senate. Clearly, this problem needed to be attacked in a different way. 
As a result, we introduced another bill last Congress which was reported favorably by the Committee on Governmental Affairs. It is that bill we introduced this week to create a Commission to fairly and independently review corporate subsidies and make recommendations to the President and the Congress for the retention, reform, or termination of such subsidies. 
Why establish a Commission and a new process to do what we could and should do directly? 
First, this Commission will do what we cannot do well: Make an overall informed assessment of all programs, on both the spending and revenue sides, at one time. Over the years, we have created an intricate, interwoven system of subsidies, taxes, and exemptions. For example, a Tennessee utility which would have 
been affected by the spending cuts we proposed last Congress pointed out to me that they in turn are competing against other energy providers who receive subsidies in the form of Federal tax exemptions. 
Second, our experience last Congress demonstrated that voting hit or miss on individual items is not going to be successful. One person's pork is another's prize. And no one wants to give up their prize program if there isn't shared sacrifice. With the commission approach, we will know that all programs have been examined and those which provide unjustified subsidies have been exposed. 
Third, the members of the Commission will be appointed specifically for this purpose by the President and the Congress. They will possess the expertise, authority and stature necessary to do the job. 
Fourth, the Commission's recommendations will not be buried in the corner of a Federal agency or a congressional committee. While the President and Congress will be able to propose amendments to or outright reject the Commission's recommendations, they must address them.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, as everyone knows, the Governmental Affairs Committee has begun an investigation into foreign campaign contributions and fundraising activities of the 1996 Presidential campaign. I believe that it is appropriate at the outset to set forth exactly what we were about, to discuss the committee's jurisdiction, the scope of its investigation, its purpose, and what principles we will apply in resolving the issues that will face us. The reasons to discuss this now at this time are several. 
First, we who are on the committee and in the Congress need to remind ourselves of these basics so we may keep our focus in the days ahead. 
Second, the American people need to understand the nature and purpose of our work in order that they will respect the process and the results of our efforts. 
Third, it is necessary to respond to some of the questions in the media and elsewhere as to the committee's role and purpose. 
Mr. President, my own analysis of these issues is just that; it's my own analysis. It is certainly subject to other views by other people. However, I do believe that there are certain principles that apply to our endeavor that can be gleaned from the Constitution, from the rules of the U.S. Senate, from court interpretations and, hopefully, from common sense in applying the lessons learned from the successes and failures of other committee investigations. 
Mr. President, the granting of the legislative power to Congress in article I of the Constitution includes the power to investigate. As the Supreme Court held 70 years ago, `A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not possess the requisite information--which not infrequently is true--recourse must be had to others who do possess it.' So long as an investigation addresses issues that can be the subject of legislation, the investigation is constitutionally permissible. Some of the most important inquiries the Congress has conducted in the past two centuries have involved the role of money in politics and its effect on policy: the Credit Mobilier scandal of the 1870's; an investigation of corporate campaign contributions in the 1912 campaign, at which Theodore Roosevelt testified concerning his own campaign; and, of course, the investigation of the 1972 Presidential campaign. 
Congress' powers to investigate broadly encompasses all areas of the operation of the Federal Government, as well as flaws in the electoral system that makes the Government accountable to the American people. As Chief Justice Warren stated, the investigatory power `encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes. It includes surveys of defects in our social, economic, or political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them. It comprehends probes into departments of the Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency, or waste.' 
Indeed, President Woodrow Wilson wrote that, `Unless Congress have and use every means of acquainting itself with the facts and the disposition of the administrative agents of the government, the country must be helpless to learn how it is being served. * * *' Then he went on to say, `The informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function. * * * The only really self-governing people is that people which discusses and interrogates its administration.' 
Although every committee in this body exercises oversight jurisdiction, the full range of the Senate's informing functions is granted to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. Its jurisdiction includes the effectiveness of the operations of all branches of Government, including misfeasance, corruption, and conflicts of interest. It is broad enough to include Presidential campaigns and even congressional campaigns if they are relevant to and reflect upon the way our Government currently operates. No other committee has within its investigatory authority the entire range of the Governmental Affairs Committee's jurisdiction, which is as broad as the Constitution permits. 
The investigation we are now undertaking is neither a criminal investigation nor a seminar on campaign finance reform, although, it involves elements of both. Based on the information before us at this time, it is an inquiry into illegal or improper campaign finance activities in the 1996 Presidential campaign and related activities. This means, however, that any facts that may have occurred before the 1996 campaign that are relevant to or shed light upon that campaign or the operation of our Government may also be subject to our inquiry. Such a scope will necessarily involve examining our current campaign spending laws and how they operate. 
Now, certainly, our work will include any improper activities by Republicans, Democrats, or other political partisans. It is of extreme importance that our investigation and our hearings be perceived by the American people as being fair and evenhanded. This does not mean that we must strain to create some false balance or that we have some sort of party quota system. It simply means letting the chips fall where they may. We are investigating activities here, not political parties. 
While no one should be shut off for partisan advantage, we must have a sense of priorities based upon the seriousness of the activities or allegations that come to our attention. Otherwise, we will be at this much longer than anyone will want us to be. Neither I nor anyone else can determine at the outset all of the activities or areas that we will investigate. As matters arise, the committee will simply have to make those determinations. 
It should be pointed out that these questions are not under the exclusive province of the majority. I have the greatest 
respect for Senator John Glenn, the ranking Democrat on the Governmental Affairs Committee. His many years of service in this body have demonstrated beyond question his integrity and his love of his country. We are working together with our staffs to ensure that all information is equally available to appropriate staff members and committee members. We hope that in all cases the work of the committee can be done by the staff in a cooperative fashion. Consensus should emerge on which issues are the most serious and those matters which will receive the greatest consideration. But if legitimate disagreement arises as to priorities, the majority will in no way limit the minority's rights to investigate any and all parties within the jurisdiction of the committee. Moreover, the minority will be given the opportunity to call witnesses in for public hearings if we cannot agree upon a joint witness list. 
Although I believe these comments are sufficient to describe what the committee plans to examine, I expect to receive further inquiries. So I will outline the following as some specific areas we will consider, although this is obviously not an exclusive list: 
A. Whether the Presidential campaigns, national political parties, or others engaged in any illegal or improper campaign activities, or whether illegal campaign contributions were made to such entities, in connection with or relevant to the 1996 Presidential campaign. 
B. Whether, during the course of the 1996 Presidential campaign, executive branch employees maintained and observed legal barriers between fundraising and the official business of governing. 
C. Whether Presidential campaigns remained appropriately independent from the political activities pursued for their benefit by outside individuals or groups. 
D. Whether any U.S. policies or national security decisions were affected by, No. 1, contributions made to or for the benefit of the President or, No. 2, improper actions of any executive branch employee or former employee. 
E. Whether our existing campaign finance laws, including laws governing the disclosure of contributions to entities established for the benefit of public officials, should be substantially revised and, if so, in what manner. 
F. Whether, based on the results of this investigation, laws other than campaign finance laws, such as the laws regulating the conduct of Federal officials and employees, should be revised, and, if so, in what manner. 
The committee does not intend to examine specific allegations of wrongdoing that Congress has already previously considered. 
Now, a significant portion of our inquiry will necessarily focus on the executive branch. This is consistent with Congress' historical function and obligation to conduct oversight of the executive branch. It is a part of our system of checks and balances. It is, by its very nature, somewhat of an adversarial process. As Justice Jackson wrote, the Constitution `enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence; autonomy but reciprocity. Presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate, depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.' 
Each branch of government has its rightful prerogatives, Mr. President. And just as Congress must understand its prerogatives and responsibilities in this process, so must the executive branch. And clearly, part of the executive branch's proper role is to protect the rightful prerogatives of the President and the Presidency, but also to provide prompt, truthful information when Congress requires it when it is needed to fulfill Congress' responsibilities. It is important that the executive branch refrain from claiming privileges that are inappropriate or simply do not exist. 
For example, executive privilege, though not specifically granted to the President in the Constitution, is an implied power that has been recognized by the courts over the years. Presidents are entitled to candid advice from their aides concerning important policy matters that would not be forthcoming if it were subject to exposure by Congress or anyone else. One the other hand, the privilege does not extend to wrongdoing and it does not extend to any and all information that may prove embarrassing to the President or others. Although it has not been court tested, Senator Sam Ervin, chairman of the Watergate Committee, always took the position that matters that were purely political were not covered by executive privilege when confronted with a legitimate congressional need. What the courts have held is that when it is based only on the broad claim of the public interest in confidentiality, executive privilege may be outweighed by other considerations. In other instances, claims of executive privilege are strongest when invoked in the areas of military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets. 
Presidents have handled the executive privilege issue with regard to congressional investigations in different ways. President Nixon fought his executive privilege claim all the way to the Supreme Court and lost. President Reagan during the Iran contra investigation waived all executive privilege and attorney client privilege claims that he may have had. Also, President Carter waived all privileges when the activities of his brother were investigated. As instructive examples of the cooperation of these two Presidents, they both allowed congressional examination of all documents, and President Reagan even provided his personal notes and diary entries. 
The President and others have correctly pointed out that the American people are tired of petty partisan bickering and the meanness that sometimes seem to pollute the atmosphere in Washington, DC. While this is undoubtedly accurate, I believe the American people also want us to stand for something, including the truth. That makes it our obligation to find it and lay it out. So the question becomes: Can we carry out our responsibilities and assist the American people in learning the truth about the strengths and weaknesses of the operation of their Government without engaging in mean spiritedness or partisan warfare? From time to time in our history, when the occasion required it, Members of this body have put partisanship aside, vocally criticized and even filed suit against an administration of their own party. Former Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee and former Senator Warren 
Rudman of New Hampshire come to mind. I have no doubt that my Democratic colleagues on the committee and in this body will do the same if the evidence calls for it. And I pledge my every effort to insure that their actions are not met with attempts to obtain partisan advantage. 
But let us be frank at the outset. The extent to which we can have a thorough, bipartisan investigation without many of the recriminations we have seen in the past is going to depend in large part upon the attitude of those in the White House and the executive branch. The same can be said of the length of our inquiry. If one looks solely to the past, there is little reason to be optimistic. We have seen what appears to be a grudging release of information in drips and drabs and, seemingly, only when forced to. We have seen the broadest claims of executive and attorney client privilege in our history. We have seen all manner of delaying tactics which congressional oversight committees claimed were intended to avoid scrutiny by Congress, where noncooperation has been stretched past the cutoff dates of committee investigations or even sessions of Congress. Accusations have abounded that disclosure has been withheld until after the Presidential election to avoid scrutiny by the people. We understand the nature of that game and we will not play it. We will do whatever is necessary and proper to make sure that such actions are not rewarded, including the continuation of investigations and the institution of court proceedings when appropriate. 
It doesn't have to be that way. I am still optimistic that it won't be that way. I think it possible that the President may have been overlawyered in the past; that while strategies may have been employed that were clever legal defense strategies, they were perhaps detrimental to the good of the country and even to the President himself. I am hoping for a new day. I am hoping the committee can establish its willingness to proceed in good faith. There is a new team in the White House, individuals with excellent reputations who commend respect. I am hoping that the new White House counsel will understand that his position is one of counsel to the office of the President. He is not the President's personal attorney. 
And I cannot believe that the President does not want to get to the bottom of the serious allegations that have been made. In the first place, he took an oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, including his article II responsibility to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. The President has publicly acknowledged that some of the DNC's contributions were illegal. Since under the best of interpretations, these are matters that reflect upon him and his Presidency, he above all should want to seen them cleared up, and I believe that he does. I would like to think that the President would be outraged at this turn of events and feel an 
obligation and responsibility to get to the bottom of the matter, including clearing the names of anyone who may have been unjustly accused. 
Nor is it enough to simply call for campaign finance reform. I trust that my position on this issue is well known. I cosponsored along with Senator McCain and Feingold, campaign finance reform legislation in 1995, my first year in the Senate. I was for campaign finance reform when campaign finance reform wasn't cool. I have long thought we simply spend too much time soliciting too much money from too many people who are interested in legislation that we consider. I'm not sure that the solution is and I am hopeful that part of what this investigation will do is examine our campaign finance system and seek out ways in which we can improve it. But those of us with responsibilities in this area, whether it be the President or Members of Congress, cannot let the call for reform serve to gloss over serious violations of existing laws. If we do that the reform debate will be cast in a totally partisan context and insure that, once again, campaign finance reform will be killed. 
The question constantly arises as to when public hearings will begin. Interestingly, Democrats, Republicans, the White House, and the news media all are seemingly interested in having hearings as soon as possible--I would guess all for different reasons. I share that desire. However, the committee's obligation is not to do it early but to do it right. Certain things should be kept in mind by those who, on a daily basis, ask when hearings will begin. In the first place, establishing a hearing date, or even a target date when dealing with such a broad array of matters as listed above, would be nothing more than guesswork. The hearings should begin as soon as the matters have been properly investigated and not before. Time spent in proper investigation and preparation prevents disjointed hearings and saves time in the long run. This is not a matter of hauling a bunch of people whose names have been in the paper before the camera and hurling charge at them. 
This committee as presently constituted and my chairmanship came about less than 3 weeks ago. We must rely extensively upon new staff that is just being hired and we do not have a full complement yet. Clearances must be obtained. Facilities must be set up. Documents must be gathered and carefully reviewed. A check of the history of other major committee investigations reveals that 3 or 4 months of investigation and preparation before the beginning of the hearing phase is the norm. That is not to say that it will take our committee that long. I am hopeful that it will not. But it will take whatever it takes. And as I have stated, the level of cooperation we receive from the White House and the rest of the executive branch is directly relevant. Most importantly, of course, one cannot tell in the beginning of an investigation what leads may be developed. 
One final thought: Most of us did not come to Washington to tear down, but to build up. But, the Founding Fathers did not believe that the errors of government were self-correcting. They knew that only constant examination of our shortcomings, and learning from them, would enable representative government to survive for hundreds of years past their own time. They believed correctly that this process makes America stronger, not weaker. We are heirs to that legacy, and we will strive to be deserving of it, by taking this step toward restoring the public's confidence in the Government for which our forebears were willing to sacrifice everything. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, while many of my colleagues have already addressed vital foreign policy issues during the consideration of Madeleine Albright to be the next Secretary of State, I would like to use this opportunity to address some equally vital management issues. I hope to use the confirmation process to elevate management issues that tend to get swept under the carpet during high-minded policy debates. When discussing policy goals, we must be careful to determine whether these goals are affordable and that the resources spent provide the best value for the taxpayers' investment. 
Congress has laid the groundwork for significant Government management reforms with the passage of laws such as the Government Performance and Results Act, which requires agencies to measure the results of their efforts, the Chief Financial Officers Act, which requires agencies to shore up their financial recordkeeping, and recently enacted information management and procurement reforms. These laws apply commonsense approaches to the business of government to reduce inefficiencies and get real cost savings for taxpayers. It is questionable whether these new laws will be taken seriously and fully implemented without extensive congressional oversight--there are reports that agencies do not believe Congress is serious about the effective implementation of these laws. I am hereby serving notice that they would be seriously mistaken in that belief. 
The State Department, which Ambassador Albright will head, has served this country admirably since its founding in 1789. But I wonder if Thomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State, could have imagined that the Department would grow to a staff of approximately 24,500 with a departmental budget of about $3.9 billion, part of an even larger $19.2 billion international affairs budget. Maintaining the infrastructure necessary to support 160 embassies and 100 consulates worldwide, costs this nation over $2 billion a year. The Department buys over $500 million in goods and services each year and is responsible for $12 billion in property. Effectively managing these resources would be a daunting challenge for any Fortune 500 company, but the State Department must do it at the same time that it is carrying out its primary functions--performing its diplomatic and foreign policy missions, protecting and assisting American citizens traveling abroad, and providing the interagency coordination necessary for conducting foreign policy in an increasingly complex and dangerous world. 
With a multitude of difficult missions to perform, management problems risk being ignored due to the exigencies of the day. The new Secretary will no doubt be consumed by critical foreign policy issues and crises from Bosnia to Korea that will demand a great deal of her personal attention. However, determining whether taxpayers are getting the best value for their multibillion dollar international affairs investment also must be one of the Secretary's highest priorities. 
In times of fiscal austerity, we all have to do more with less. I do not advocate performing critical missions `on the cheap,' but we must strive for the most efficient and effective use of our limited resources. The Government Performance and Results Act, for example, can be an effective tool to make Government work better by measuring the success or failure of Government programs and using this information to support budget decisions. 
The effects of belt tightening are painful as is illustrated by the $300 million backlog in deferred maintenance, obsolete technology and shrinking base of skilled personnel at the Department of State. The Congress will no doubt be asked to provide more resources to State and in the international affairs budget to counteract some of these negative effects. On first glance, this seemingly makes sense. However, the spending for State Department operating expenses has increased in both actual and constant dollars since 1985. Therefore, I question whether the Department has done all it can. Has it cut to the bone and ignored the fat in order to generate a compelling case before Congress for more money? I have to say that I don't know, and we will not know the true story from the Department anytime soon because the detailed supporting financial information does not exist. 
This is because the State Department does not have adequate financial and information systems to effectively manage and prioritize its programs. In the information age, the Government is increasingly dependent on good information--and yet this is what we are lacking. We need adequate information upon which to base sound decisions, otherwise we are making decisions in a vacuum. A good first step in developing this information would be for the Department to meet its responsibilities under the Chief Financial Officers Act and prepare an audited financial statement. 
Good financial data relies upon the development of effective computer systems. Government computers are crucial to the State Department's ability to meets its foreign policy missions and business needs. In recent years, the Department has obligated over $300 million annually on computer systems. Yet, the State Department has had a poor history of managing these systems and, as a result, is struggling with aging computers that do not adequately meet the Department's needs. This has resulted in critical information shortfalls, as well as interruption of operations. Obviously, the Department needs to do a better job. Legislation Congress passed last year to establish a Chief Information Officer at the Department of State should help in focusing attention on this longstanding problem. 
The Department has yet to change its business practices to reflect the new information age. In September 1994, the State Department launched a Strategic Management Initiative to identify its highest priority functions and products, as well as activities which were no longer necessary. However, GAO states that the State Department `has been reluctant or unable to significantly reduce its overseas presence and the scope of its activities or to substantially change its business practices.' I would hope in the future that the Department will not continue to conduct business as usual and then complain it does not have the resources to fulfill its mission. 
The State Department, like many other Federal agencies, is confronted by serious management problems that impede its ability to carry out its mission efficiently and effectively. GAO and inspector general reports have shown that in the past, top level attention has not been given to the stewardship of taxpayer resources. I am encouraged by Ambassador Albright's answers to my questions during her confirmation process. She assured us that she will be very much a hands-on manager and recognizes that the ability to conduct quality foreign policy depends upon attacking directly these management issues. Ambassador Albright stated at her confirmation hearing that she would work with Congress `to ensure that the American public gets full value for each tax dollar spent' and that she `is committed to making improvements in the Department's structure and operations that will produce a more efficient and effective use of our resources.' I am hopeful that Ambassador Albright will provide the leadership necessary for the State Department to meet its management challenges of the next century. I look forward to working with her to achieve those objectives in the coming Congress and to effectively implement the bipartisan management reforms passed by Congress.

Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President I join my colleagues in reintroducing our campaign finance reform legislation with mixed emotions. On the one hand, I am more optimistic about the chances of our being able to enact reforms than I was when we introduced our bill over a year ago. On the other hand, I regret that it has taken another round of public disappointment and anger over the role of money in federal elections to bring us to this point. 
The factors which led us to introduce this legislation in the last Congress have become even more prominent. Too much money is needed, too much time must be spent raising it, too much is asked of a limited number of special interests, and too much is going on outside of the regulatory system we established--some within the bounds of the law, some allegedly not. 
Most importantly, in my view, the public is increasingly concerned by what they see happening here. If they have no faith in the system which put us here, if they are turned off by what we do to get elected, how are they going to trust us to carry out our work in their best interests? 
Next, money raising consumes an inordinate amount of office-holders' and candidates' time and effort. Candidates should be reaching out to as broad a spectrum of people and interests as possible, and not feel they must concentrate on those who can afford to make a donation. 
Last, it is difficult for a challenger to raise sufficient funds to get his or her message out. Congress needs to move away from professionalism and more toward a citizen legislature. The process should be more open, instead of more closed. Because of the role money plays, unless a candidate has access to large sums of money, he or she is pretty much cut out of the process. 
I believe the revised legislation I am joining my colleagues Senators McCain and Feingold in introducing provides some solutions to these problems. It doesn't provide all the solutions, or perfect solutions, but it is a good faith effort and, in my view, a good place to start. 
This legislation reduces the appearance and reality of special interests buying and selling political favors by prohibiting federal PACs, restricting contribution `bundling', prohibiting so-called `soft money', and putting a cap on out-of-state fundraising. I do not believe PACs are inherently evil. There are other ways special interests can enhance their financial influence in a campaign. Contributions are bundled, or the word just goes out that a particular interest--be it business, or social, or labor--is concentrating donations on a particular race. PACs are a more formal association of people with common interests. Our test in legislating reforms should be whether the public feels they continue to serve an acceptable purpose. 
Furthermore, in this revised bill we have tightened up on the definitions of independent and coordinated expenditures, as well as those for express advocacy. Today we have a system under which, in many cases, the majority of the expenditures in an election are outside the system and the candidate's control. In 1992, `soft money' expenditures by the Republican and Democratic parties totaled $86 million. In 1996, they totaled $263 million. It is little wonder that we are looking at where some of it came from. 
I look forward to working with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in the House of Representatives, and with the President to fashion and pass meaningful reform. I believe a successful effort will renew the public's faith in our system and in us, and thus in our ability to do what they sent us here to do.
