Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act. The House recently passed an amended version of the Senate Coast Guard bill. While I support the overall reauthorization of the Coast Guard, I want to comment on several provisions contained in the House passed bill. 
There is currently an administrative process in place to convey excess Federal government property. I believe that legislation which mandates the transfer or disposal of Federal property under terms which circumvent the established administrative procedures is inappropriate. Consequently, the Senate bill used discretionary language to address certain conveyances requested by individual senators. However, the House bill includes mandatory legislative conveyances. In this case only, I am accepting the mandatory language because I am satisfied that the Coast Guard is willing and prepared to make each of these particular conveyances. 
Another important difference between the House and Senate passed bills relates to drug interdiction. I sponsored an amendment in the Senate bill which would have established criminal sanctions for the knowing failure to obey an order to land an airplane. As a former pilot, let me clearly state that this provision was not designed to put any pilot at risk of an arbitrary or random forced landing. Arbitrary or random forced landings are impermissible under the Senate provision. As with all aviation legislation in which I have been involved, safety is a top priority. Under current law, if a Federal law enforcement officer who is enforcing drug smuggling or money laundering laws witnesses a person loading tons of cocaine onto a plane in Mexico, sees the plane take off and enter the United States, he may issue an order to land, and if the pilot knowingly disobeys that order, there is currently no criminal penalty associated with such a failure to obey the order. 
The criminal sanctions contained in the Senate bill would only be applied to a person who knowingly disobeyed an order to land issued by a Federal law enforcement agent who is enforcing drug smuggling or money laundering laws. The bill would also require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to write regulations defining the means by and circumstances under which it would be appropriate to order an aircraft to land. One of the FAA's essential missions is aviation safety. Accordingly, the FAA would be required to ensure that any such order is clearly communicated in accordance with international standards. Moreover, the FAA would be further required to specify when an order to land may be issued based on observed conduct, prior information, or other circumstances. Therefore, orders to land would have to be justifiable, not arbitrary or random. Orders to land would only be issued in cases where the authorized federal law enforcement agent has observed conduct or possesses reliable information which provides sufficient evidence of a violation of Federal drug smuggling or money laundering laws. If enacted, I would take every step possible to ensure that this provision does not diminish safety in any way. 
Last year, 430 metric tons of cocaine entered the United States from Mexico. In 1995, drugs cost taxpayers an estimated $109 billion. The average convicted drug smuggler was sentenced to only 4.3 years in jail, and is expected to serve less than half of that sentence. It is incumbent on all of us to fight the war on drugs with every responsible and safe measure at our disposal. The provision in the Senate bill would help those men and women who fight the war on drugs at our borders by providing an additional penalty for those who knowingly disobey the law. 
A provision included in both the House and Senate bill relates to the International Safety Management Code (ISM Code). On July 1, 1998, the owners and operators of passenger vessels, tankers and bulk carriers were required to have in place safety management systems which meet the requirements of the ISM Code. On July 1, 2002, all other large cargo ships and self-propelled mobile offshore drilling units will have to comply. Companies and vessels not ISM Code-certified are not permitted to enter U.S. waters. 
Shipowners required to comply with the ISM Code have raised concerns that the ISM Code may be misused. The ISM Code requires a system of internal audits and reporting systems which are intended to encourage compliance with applicable environmental and vessel safety standards. However, the documents produced as a result of the ISM Code would also provide indications of past non-conformities. Obviously, for this information to be useful in rectifying environmental and safety concerns, it must be candid and complete. However, this information, prepared by shipowners or operators, may be used in enforcement actions against a shipowner or operator, crews and shoreside personnel by governmental agencies and may be subject to discovery in civil litigation. 
The provision in both the Senate and House bills would require the Secretary to conduct a study to examine the operation of the ISM Code, taking into account the effectiveness of internal audits and reports. After completion of the study, the Secretary is required to develop a policy to achieve full compliance with and effective implementation of the ISM Code. Under the provision, the public shall be given the opportunity to participate in and comment on the study. In addition, it may be appropriate for the Secretary to form a working group of affected private parties to assist in the development of the study and the issuance of the required policy and any resulting legislative recommendations. Any private citizen who is a member of any such working group cannot receive any form of government funds, reimbursement or travel expenses for participation in, or while a member of, the working group. 
The bill also includes a provision that would fix a curious conflict in maritime statutes that currently prohibits U.S. and foreign commercial vessel operators from agreeing among themselves to comply with the Maritime Administration's cargo preference policies concerning vessel sharing agreements, but allows the Maritime Administration to impose those policies on the agreements themselves. The vessel sharing agreement provision in the bill would allow the commercial vessel operators to voluntarily comply with that policy. This provision is consistent with a recent U.S. appeals court decision on this issue and simply preserves the status quo. The proper place to resolve concerns with cargo preference, many of which I share, is in the cargo preference statutes themselves.

Mr. McCAIN. I also recognize the Senator's concerns and I will work with the Senator from Michigan to find a solution that eliminates an unfair competitive disadvantage when the Commerce Committee considers the legislation as early as possible next year. This is a complex issue and I am sure that the Senator from Michigan would agree that fairness to all parties involved must be taken into account in addressing it. I would also like to address the broader issue of what type of dredging should be conducted on the Great Lakes so there is clarification on this issue in the future.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, unless less than 48 hours ago, only a few in this body had actually seen this nearly 4,000-page, 40-pound, non-amendable, budget-busting legislation that provides over half-a-trillion dollars to fund 10 Cabinet-level federal departments for the fiscal year that started 21 days ago. The bill exceeds the budget ceiling by $20 billion for what is euphemistically called emergency spending, much of which is really everyday, garden-variety, pork-barrel appropriations. The bill is loaded with locality-specific, special interest, pork-barrel spending projects, which are paid for by robbing billions from the budget surplus. 
I cannot in good conscience support a bill that makes a mockery of the Congress' role in fiscal matters. This bill is a betrayal of our responsibility to spend the taxpayers' dollars wisely and enact laws and policies that reflect the best interests of all Americans, rather than the special interests of a few. 
Most offensive and disturbing to me is the misallocation of more than $9 billion in so-called emergency defense funding in the bill. The decision to spend only slightly more than $1 billion on military readiness, when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and each of the Service Chiefs testified just last month about an impending readiness crisis, is a fundamental abandonment of the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. 
I recently released a comprehensive report on the state of military readiness that includes a lengthy compilation of material provided by the Chiefs detailing the myriad of problems the Armed Forces are facing as a result of inadequate resources to support the missions their civilian leaders have assigned them. In these documents and in their testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee just last month, the Chiefs were unambiguous in pressing for additional funding to address several serious concerns. 
Restoring military retirement benefits was the Chiefs' principal concern, and I and others introduced legislation to do so. The Chiefs cited the need to increase military pay for the 25,000 military families on food stamps. They asked for money to provide incentives to attract and retain qualified people in military service. They talked about the dire need for more training and maintenance funds. 
Mr. President, the Chiefs are the highest ranking military officers in our nation. Their sole mission is to ensure that our Armed Forces can fight and win any future conflict. They are the ones whom we should heed when we are told how to avert a crisis in military readiness. 
So what did the Congress decide to do to address the Chiefs' concerns? We put over $9 billion in so-called emergency defense funding in this bill. But we allocated only $1.1 billion to the Chiefs' priorities, and spent the other $8 billion on other programs that, while important, will not reverse the declining readiness trend in our military. 
We did nothing to address the Chiefs' number-one concern--restoring military retirement benefits for 20-year veterans to a full 50 percent of their highest three salary years. General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Congress very clearly that fixing the military retirement system is his top recommendation for restoring the readiness of our armed forces: 
The most critical element of both current and future readiness is the men and women we are privileged to have serving in uniform today. Our people are more important than hardware. 
I concur whole-heartedly with the Chairman's remarks. Army Chief of Staff General Reimer has written to me that: 
. . . the retirement package we have offered our soldiers entering the Army since 1986 is inadequate. Having lost 25 percent of its lifetime value as a result of the 1980's reforms, military retirement is no longer our number one retention tool. Our soldiers and families deserve better. We need to send them a strong signal that we haven't forgotten them. 
Mr. President, we did nothing to address this clearly stated, number-one concern. 
Instead, we bought three Gulfstream executive passenger jets, bought helicopters for the Colombian anti-drug effort, and padded the budget to pay for burying utilities at Keesler Air Force Base. We gave another $210 million of defense money to the Coast Guard to pay for its drug interdiction mission. 
We did give the Services $200 million for military health care, but that's less than a quarter of what's needed to ensure military personnel and their families receive the care they need. And we took care of other legitimate emergency costs, like ongoing operations in Bosnia and embassy security. But on the whole, the Congress ignored the clear warnings of our highest ranking military leaders and, once again, let their parochial priorities take precedence. 
Obviously, the waste in this bill does not stop with defense spending. 
Here is just a sampling of the egregious pork-barrel spending in this bill: 
$250,000 to an Illinois firm to research caffeinated chewing gum; 
$750,000 for grasshopper research in Alaska; 
$1 million for peanut quality research in Georgia; 
$1.1 million for manure handling and disposal in Starkville, Mississippi; 
$5 million for a new International Law Enforcement Academy in Roswell, New Mexico; 
$1 million for Kings College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, for commercialization of pulverization technologies; 
$250,000 for Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory; 
$1.2 million for a C&O Canal visitors center in Cumberland, Maryland; 
$250,000 for a lettuce geneticist in Salinas, California; 
$500,000 for the U.S. Plant Stress and Water Conservation Lab in Lubbock, Texas; 
$162,000 for research on peach tree short life in South Carolina; 
$200,000 for research on turkey carnovirus in Indiana; 
$64,000 for urban pest research in Georgia; 
$100,000 for vidalia onion research in Georgia; 
An additional $2.5 million for the Office of Cosmetics and Color; and 
$200,000 for a grant to the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Commission. 
And there is much more wasteful spending in this 4,000-page document. I have here 52 pages of items that I have found in this bill that meet one or more of the criteria that I and others, such as Citizens Against Government Waste, the National Taxpayers Union, and other well-known pork-watchers have used for many years. I have no idea yet of the total amount of pork on this list, but I am sure it is in the billions of dollars. 
Some of these earmarked projects may well prove meritorious and deserving of the priority given them in this bill. The problem is that none of these provisions went through the appropriate merit-based selection process, which is necessary to determine whether they are more or less a priority than thousands of other projects that are not funded in this bill. In addition, some of these provisions were never included in either the House or Senate version of any regular appropriations bill. They were simply added, behind closed doors, to this massive, nonamendable omnibus bill. 
Mr. President, we are wasting the people's money when we fund these dubious proposals. We undermine the faith of our constituents--the taxpayers--when we continue the practice of earmarking and inappropriately designating funding for projects based on political interests rather than national priority and necessity. Unfortunately, that has occurred here. This bill is a shameful example of why the American public has become cynical and skeptical of government. 
We seem to have forgotten that all these programs, whether meritorious or not, must be paid for. Designating spending as an `emergency' doesn't make it free; it still has to be paid for. And the Congress, blessed with the first budget surplus since 1969, has been unable to resist the temptation to dip into that $70 billion surplus and spend it on pork. 
The President declares we must save Social Security first. Members of Congress declare we must save Social Security first. Yet, we spend billions from the surplus on everything but Social Security. We don't save Social Security. We don't pay down the debt. We don't return to taxpayers a little of their hard-earned money. But we can spend a little more on pork. I guess we can never have too much of that, Mr. President, surplus or no surplus. 
Mr. President, we have lost track of our priorities. I am disheartened that Congress 
found the time and money to finance any number of pet projects, yet we failed to address the needs of over 7,000 children and families whose lives have been devastated by hemophilia-related AIDS, in part because of the government's failure to implement the appropriate safety precautions for the nation's blood supply in the 1980's. This is simply shameful. 
Mr. President, we are supposed to follow a process in Congress for considering important legislation--a process that relies on openness, fairness, and public input. If we had adhered to that process in crafting this bill, many of these egregious provisions might have been eliminated and our priorities might have been compatible with the public's priorities. 
The process by which this bill was created is deplorable. Negotiations were conducted behind closed doors, out of sight of the public as well as the vast majority of Members of Congress. Decisions were made, and then reversed without notice. 
A case in point, Mr. President, is a provision to clarify the status of auctioned spectrum licenses if the purchaser declares bankruptcy. At 5:00 p.m. on Monday, just a few hours before the Omnibus Appropriations bill was filed in the House, I was told that this provision was included in the legislation. Yesterday morning, it had been dropped from the bill. 
In addition, only after the bill was filed did I learn that several provisions which are clearly within the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, which I chair, were included in the bill. I know other authorizing chairmen share my frustration at never having been consulted or even advised about these matters. 
Let me point to one example of an appropriation exceeding the amount authorized for a program. The Senate authorized $192 million for the Advanced Technology Program of the Commerce Department; the House approved $180 million. Yet this bill appropriates $203.5 million for the program. What is the purpose of authorizing funding levels, when the appropriators simply ignore it and alone decide how much money to appropriate? 
Mr. President, I learned yesterday that the bill does not include a cost cap on the international space station, as I had earlier been assured--a cost cap that was included in the NASA reauthorization bill that was reported from the Commerce Committee and passed by the Senate. And I learned that the bill includes a provision for a $20 million, taxpayer-funded buyback of three boats to limit domestic competition in the fishing trade off Alaska--legislation that the Commerce Committee had not yet sent to the Senate. 
Mr. President, speaking about the authorizing legislation in this bill, one of the greatest failures of the omnibus bill is its rejection of comprehensive legislation to improve aviation competition, safety, and security. Critical aviation programs were due to be reauthorized this year, and the Commerce Committee duly reported the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill to the Senate. It passed the Senate last month, on an overwhelming vote of 92 to 1. 
In this bill, we had an opportunity to stimulate much-needed competition in the aviation industry and enact a host of other critical improvements in aviation policy. Frankly, because of the influence of the major airlines and other secondary interests, the legislation was blocked. But what we did see fit to do is place a hold on activities of the Department of Transportation to address anti-competitive behavior in the airline industry. Major airlines won; competition and consumers lost. 
Mr. President, I am very disappointed to report that the major airlines have succeeded in dealing yet another setback to the nation's consumers. As many of my colleagues are aware, the major airlines were able to scuttle the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill that passed the Senate last month by a vote of 92 to one. Some of the biggest players in the industry fought against it because the bill contained numerous provisions that would have enhanced airline competition, promoted new entry, and benefitted consumers. That is why the reauthorization bill was reduced to a mere six-month extension of the airport grant program. 
To add insult to injury, the major carriers have now succeeded in hampering efforts by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to curtail illegal competitive behavior industry. Regrettably, the omnibus appropriations bill includes provisions that would needlessly delay the issuance of pro-consumer airline competition guidelines that have been proposed by the DOT. Once again, the major airlines have gotten their way in Congress when it comes to protecting their turf. Not satisfied with maintaining the status quo, these carriers have forced us to take a step backwards. 
Last April, the DOT took the commendable step of proposing guidelines to curb unfair and anti-competitive pricing behavior in the airline industry. It didn't take long, however, for the major airlines to begin attacking the DOT for having the audacity to address this issue. 
The DOT has already been taking its time reviewing public comments on its proposed guidelines, which I admit may be in need of improvement. The added delay provided in the omnibus budget bill only serves to aggravate the existing situation. The airlines readily admit that this extended delay gives them more time to kill the competition guidelines outright. That has been the airlines' goal from the start. 
Shortly after the DOT proposed its guidelines, the Aviation Subcommittee held a hearing on airline competition, and the main focus was these guidelines. The DOT presented very compelling evidence that there have been instances of predatory behavior. But the major airlines merely shrug when confronted with very specific examples of a major carrier's driving a new entrant out of a market by irrationally cutting prices and increasing capacity. 
Even though such conduct makes sense only if predatory behavior is the standard, the major airlines insist that they only respond in normal ways to new entrants. 
Clearly, the DOT's effort to address this sort of behavior was too much for the major carriers to accept. They were able to exert enough influence on the budget negotiation process to put the competition guidelines on hold. The carriers were successful, despite that fact that no such provision passed either Chamber of Congress. 
With respect to airline competition policy, as well as many other matters in the omnibus bill, this situation represents the triumph of special interests over the public interest. The losers here are not just the new airlines, but the consumers. 
Despite this setback, I want to assure everyone that I will continue my fight for full and fair airline competition. Whether because of predatory behavior, or artificial barriers to entry such as slots and perimeter rules, the traveling public has yet to realize fully the benefits of deregulation. Fortunately, Congress will have an opportunity to take action again soon when the authorization for the Airport Improvement Program expires at the end of next March. 
Mr. President, we must not let the major airlines dictate the terms of competition in their own industry. I am determined to see Congress do better by consumers next time. 
Mr. President, I am also deeply disturbed that the House leadership has killed aviation competition legislation this session of Congress. Congress' record shows that it has done nothing to ensure a vibrant, competitive airline industry. Instead, the negotiators eliminated competition provisions such as new slot exemptions at capacity controlled airports, as well as efforts to loosen the perimeter rule at Reagan National Airport. Legislation to manage the environmental effects of flights over national parks also fell by the wayside because of this approach. Obviously the agenda of some is only to protect the big airlines against competition. Let's be clear, the big airlines have won. Consumers lost. That is a record about which nobody should be proud. 
Most of my Senate colleagues know that the Commerce Committee worked hard this year to develop a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration and the programs it oversees. Following a bipartisan, inclusive, and constructive process, we developed a package that among other things would authorize important airport construction grants. The legislation would institute a host of safety and security enhancements. It would provide the necessary spending to add more air traffic controllers in a congested system, and to make sure that the critical air traffic control systems are equipped to deal with the year 2000 problem. And, the bill would have established a widely-endorsed system for managing the environmental consequences of commercial air tour flights over national parks. 
One of the key elements of the Senate FAA bill was the aviation competition title. It would have modestly enhanced the capacity at the four slot-controlled airports in the country--LaGuardia and JFK in New York, Chicago O'Hare, and Reagan National. The new entrant, low fare carriers 
have been effectively shut out of these key markets, which are critical to sustaining a healthy network and giving consumers new low cost choices. 
Service to underserved markets in the country would have greatly benefited under the Senate bill. Rural America has suffered the most from the effects of hub dominance and the lack of airline competition. My colleagues from the Dakotas can tell you firsthand about the crippling effects of the recent Northwest Airline strike, for instance. Northwest dominates their region. When it shut down, they were literally cut off from the rest of the country. This is unconscionable. 
There are other, clear `pockets of pain,' according to the Department of Transportation and the General Accounting Office. These include communities in the Appalachian Region, such as Knoxville, Tennessee; communities in the southeast, such as Jackson, Mississippi; Des Moines, Iowa, in the midwest; Rochester, Syracuse and Albany in upstate New York. The citizens of these communities will continue to suffer from having to pay exorbitant air fares without any real kind of relief that could have been provided with the FAA bill's promotion of additional airline competition on existing routes, and additional access for these underserved communities in key business markets such as Washington and New York. 
There are two reasons why the FAA reauthorization bill failed in the 105th Congress, along with its provisions to enhance competition in the domestic airline industry. The first reason is the utter intransigence on the part of the major airlines, and the unmitigated gall that they exhibit in defending the anti-competitive status quo. Their motives are dictated solely by increasing their profits with no concern for the free market. It's about blatant anti-competitiveness. At the same time that they herald industry consolidation and hoard capacity at their hubs, they continue to thwart efforts to respond to these changing dynamics in the industry. 
Parochial interests on the part of members of Congress constitute the second reason that this bill failed. 
Specifically, House lawmakers from Illinois and Virginia have taken down the entire FAA bill because of a few noise complaints from their districts. We have done everything possible to accommodate their constituents' noise concerns. We have minimized the impact of new flights by spreading them out so that there are only one or two new flights per hour. We have increased their noise mitigation funding. Further, the FAA continues to enforce Congressional aircraft noise requirements that have brought noise levels down in their neighborhoods significantly over the last decade. 
Notwithstanding, these Members refused even to come to the table to acknowledge legitimate interests. Let us not forget, the FAA bill was approved freestanding by the Senate on a vote of 92 to one. However, the House refused to even conference with the Senate on the bill. 
This is not an insignificant issue. As I noted earlier, just ask the people of North and South Dakota who were effectively paralyzed because of one airline. Competition is the principle upon which our free market economy is based. It is a complete, utter and wholesale abrogation of our responsibilities, not only to kill pro-competition and pro-consumer provisions of the FAA bill, but to stop any addressing of the issue by the proper authorities. The omnibus appropriations bill blocks pro-consumer airline competition guidelines, which were recently proposed by the Department of Transportation. 
During these six months we will seize the momentum we developed this year to enact aviation competition legislation. We will also be examining additional pro-competition issues. It is too important to our country, to consumers and to the principles of our free market economy to look the other way. 
Mr. President, as we work over the next six months to finish the job of reauthorizing federal aviation programs, I intend to use all means at my disposal to rectify this situation. 
Mr. President, even today, there is confusion about what is in the bill and what is not, because the only copy that was available Tuesday to all Republican Senators was scattered in pieces around the Republican Cloakroom. There are no copies of this bill available to the public and only a few copies available in the Capitol. Most of what the public knows about this bill comes from media reports and the rumor mill. Members of Congress are only slightly better informed about the details of this bill, and we have had no opportunity to carefully review it. 
And even if a Senator discovers that there is something in this bill that is highly objectionable to him, he cannot amend the bill. He can only vote for or against the entire package. It is all or nothing--take it or leave it. We are all held hostage to a process that protects pork-barrel spending at the expense of good policy. 
Well, I, for one, will leave it. That is why I voted against the wanton fiscal irresponsibility this legislation represents. 
Mr. President, we cannot continue to do business this way. We have an established process and we should follow it. I intend to work with like-minded Senators to develop needed reforms in that process to ensure that the Congress cannot so easily sidestep the checks and balances that are so clearly necessary to control wasteful spending and ensure responsible legislating, and that were intended by the Constitution. 
Mr. President, I do want to take a moment to talk about some of the programs and provisions in this bill that are meritorious and which, in other circumstances, would have received my full support and my vote. 
For example, the bill blocks the use of taxpayer-funded needle exchange programs for drug addicts, institutes new reforms to ensure accountability and market-based response measures within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and extends important tax provisions, such as the work opportunity and research and development tax credit. Also, the bill contains $18 billion to replenish the International Monetary Funds depleted resources, which is critical to restoring confidence and economic stability in the global economy. 
This bill funds many important programs directly benefitting American families and providing critical assistance to our children, including Child Care Block grants and Head Start. It increases funding for the Department of Education to almost $33 billion, including $8 billion for disadvantaged children and over $5 billion for children with special needs, but not at the expense of local control. The bill sends $1.1 billion directly to local classrooms ensuring schools have the flexibility to determine how to meet the unique educational needs of their students instead of Washington bureaucrats, and it prohibits federally funded national tests, leaving that decision to state and local authorities. 
I am also pleased to see inclusion of the Internet Tax Freedom bill, introduced as S. 442, in the omnibus appropriations bill. This limited moratorium reflects the need for careful thought and analysis of the implications for taxing electronic commerce, and the proper roles for local, state and federal government in taxing the Internet. Present federal law neither authorizes, imposes, nor ratifies any excise, sales, or domain name registration tax on Internet use for electronic interstate commerce, and only one fee for the Intellectual Infrastructure Fund. I am confident that this moratorium will allow Congress to move forward in developing a national strategy for advancing electronic commerce and appropriate taxation of the Internet. 
I am pleased to see that the provisions concerning Amtrak generally maintain the integrity of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act and continue the mandate for Amtrak to operate free of taxpayer subsidies by 2002. The bill also provides funding, though limited, directly to the Amtrak Reform Council instead of channeling such funds through the Secretary of Transportation. These are good decisions, ones which I support. 
Also contained in this omnibus bill is legislation to increase the number of H-1B visas for skilled foreign professionals who wish to work temporarily in the United States in jobs unfilled by American workers. I cosponsored the original Senate legislation to raise the existing cap on H-1B visas. The provisions in this bill will allow dynamic American companies and research labs to hire more skilled foreign professionals. At the same time, we have incorporated safeguards to protect American workers and provide substantial funding to educate and train Americans to fill the lucrative high-tech jobs that are available across our country. American companies, American workers, and the American consumer will all benefit as a result. 
The provisions I have just mentioned, and many others, are good for the American people. In fact, if these and many of the other policies and programs contained in the Omnibus Appropriations bill had been proposed and considered in the established process, I would have voted for them. Unfortunately, because the Congress has abandoned the normal process of legislating, my vote against this Omnibus Appropriations bill may also be construed, albeit wrongly, as a vote against these meritorious provisions. My vote against this precedent-setting legislation should be recognized for what it was--a vote against wasting taxpayer dollars and failing to ensure the readiness of our Armed Forces. 
Responsible spending is the cornerstone of good governance. I look forward to the day when we can go before the American people with a budget that is both fiscally responsible and ends the practice of earmarking funds in the appropriations process. 
Mr. President, those of my colleagues who support this legislation will say of us who oppose it that we are not practical politicians, that we ask for the impossible--legislation that is free of compromise, that we would let the perfect be the enemy of the good. That is a false charge, and it fails utterly as a defense of a legislative process that everyone agrees is terribly, terribly flawed. 
We do not ask that a Republican majority produce legislation that reflects in every detail our priorities and dismisses completely the views of the President and the minority. We ask only that, on balance, any legislation--and surely legislation of this magnitude--reflect the principles upon which our majority was elected. We ask only that the Congress complete its work when it is supposed to complete it work, and in a manner that ensures fairness, openness, and inclusions. We ask only that we adhere to a little truth in advertising. 
When we say we are going to save Social Security first, we ask only that we make some attempt to do so. When we call something an emergency, we should be able to say it with a straight face. When we promise to restore the resources necessary to provide for the common defense, we must pay just a little attention to the concerns of the military. When we promise to return to the people some percentage of the money they have sent to Washington, we ask only that we rank that pledge somewhat higher on our list of priorities than the usual cornucopia of parochial spending. 
Those who voted against the omnibus appropriations bill would not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We simply oppose letting back-room negotiations, business as usual, and pork-barrel politics be the enemy of principle. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. The Senator is correct that this is an issue of personal importance to me, and I appreciate his support as we work to defeat this terrible disease. I would also like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the Parkinson's community--courageous individuals in my state and all across the country who have worked so hard to pass the Udall Act and continue to work to achieve its full funding. 
There are an estimated one million Americans living with Parkinson's disease, and the nature of its symptoms are such that they impact heavily on families and loved ones as well. Add to these staggering human costs the fiscal burden of health care expenses and lost productivity, and it's easy to see that Parkinson's deserves to be a higher national priority. Parkinson's disease also represents a real research opportunity, where an investment of funds is likely to yield improved therapies sure to reduce both the personal and financial costs to our families and our nation. 
To realize this opportunity, though, it is up to Congress and the NIH to ensure that these funds get allocated to research focused on Parkinson's. Chairman Specter and others in this body have worked hard to ensure that NIH has the overall funding it needs to aggressively pursue research opportunities like those relating to Parkinson's. I have received a letter dated May 21, 1998 from NIH Director, Dr. Harold Varmus, which includes a chart indicating that the NIH will spend over $106 million on Parkinson's research in fiscal year 1999. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the NIH to see that this funding goes for research principally focused on the cause, pathogenesis, and/or potential therapies or treatments for Parkinson's disease as mandated by the Udall Act.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with a sense of disappointment and frustration that Congress is adjourning without reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. Our senior citizens deserve better. 
In January, our Nation will enter the fourth year without an authorization for Older American programs which provide a multitude of support services for our Nation's elderly including: community-based long-term care, transportation, legal services, adult day care, `Meals on Wheels' and senior citizens centers. For our Nation's Indian tribes, it is the cornerstone of programs for their elderly and is the only federal legislation that allows them to directly plan for the needs of their elderly based on their culture and traditions. 
My personal concern about the lack of authorization for the OAA programs was heightened while traveling around my home state of Arizona. I continually hear from seniors concerned that the OAA programs are at serious risk because of Congress' failure to reauthorize them. They are particularly disturbed that funding for the programs has not been keeping up with inflation, thereby jeopardizing important programs for the most vulnerable elderly. 
I recognize the commitment of the Senate Subcommittee on Aging to produce a reauthorization bill, but I became concerned when the committee did not produce an OAA bill by July. It became clear to me that the limited time left in Congress' schedule would prevent the committee from completing their work and moving a bill through the full legislative process. 
This is why, on July 13, I introduced S. 2295, the Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. I simply could not allow another year to go by without reaffirming Congress' support and commitment to older Americans. 
This bill would reauthorize the OAA using the same language from the 1992 reauthorization which expired in 1995. The bill would extend the OAA until 2001, giving the Subcommittee on Aging and Congress sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate these programs and reconcile differences on the reforms needed if we are to ensure the relevance of the OAA, continue to meet our obligations to our current seniors, and be more adequately prepared to meet the needs of future seniors. 
Sixty-seven of my colleagues agree that Congress should reauthorize the OAA this year and alleviate the fears of our Nation's senior citizens who believe that these programs are in jeopardy. It is disheartening that a bill with such broad bipartisan support was prevented from being implemented due to the objections of a small minority. I am confident that their concerns could have been addressed even as we moved forward on a short-term extension. 
I remain committed to resolving this issue next year and will work with Senators Gregg and Mikulski to develop a bill that strengthens and more effectively defines the OAA programs for our Nation's elderly. It is imperative that we continue our efforts on behalf of older Americans and pass a bill which recognizes their unique needs and addressed those needs by reauthorizing the programs of the Older Americans Act.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer legislation to authorize the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation to establish a memorial on Federal land in the District of Columbia to honor all disabled American veterans. This legislation is not controversial, costs nothing, and deserves immediate consideration and passage as the 105th Congress prepares to adjourn for the year. 
As a nation, we owe a debt of gratitude to all Americans who have worn their country's uniform in the defense of her core ideals and interests. We honor their service with holidays, like Veterans Day and Memorial Day, and with memorials, including the Vietnam Wall and the Iwo Jima Memorial. But nowhere in Washington can be found a material tribute to those veterans whose physical or psychological health was forever lost to a sniper's bullet, a landmine, a mortar round, or the pure terror of modern warfare. 
To these individuals we owe a measure of devotion not accorded those who served honorably but without permanent damage to limb or spirit. For these individuals, a memorial in Washington, DC, would stand as testament to the sum of their sacrifices, and as proof that the country they served values their contribution to its cause. 
We cannot restore the health of those Americans who incurred a disability as a result of their military service. It is within our power, however, to authorize a memorial that would clearly signal the nation's gratitude to all whose disabilities serve as a living reminder of the toll war takes on its victims. 
Under the terms of this legislation, the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation would be solely responsible for raising the necessary funding. Our bill explicitly requires that no Federal funds be used to pay any expense for the memorial's establishment. 
I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Cleland, Coverdell, and Kerrey in support of this legislation. America's disabled veterans, of whom Senator Cleland himself is one of our most distinguished, deserve a lasting tribute to their sacrifice. They honored us with their service; let us honor them with our support today.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Oceans Act of 1998 and several other fisheries issues included in the legislation. In addition to the Oceans Act, this bill approves the Governing International Fishery Agreements between the government of the United States and the governments of the Republics of Lithuania and Estonia. These agreements will permit large processing vessels from these countries to enter the United States Exclusive Economic Zone and process fish caught by U.S. fishermen in fisheries where American processors have insufficient capacity. These privileges have been authorized this year for vessels of Poland and Latvia as well. I support these agreements because they provide needed markets for American fishermen to sell their catch. However, I believe we have inadvertently worked an injustice upon a large U.S. vessel, the Atlantic Star. 
The Atlantic Star is a U.S.-owned, U.S. flag fishing vessel that was refitted last year for the herring and mackerel fisheries off the East Coast. The vessel had received all necessary permits to enter these fisheries. Because the Regional Fishery Management Councils had not then developed plans or plan amendments addressing the entry of large vessels into these fisheries, Congress enacted an appropriations rider which voided the permits for this specific vessels and imposed a one-year moratorium on the entry of the Atlantic Star into any U.S. fishery in order to give the Councils time to examine the issue. Meanwhile, the vessel has had to leave the United States in order to operate at all. 
The Councils held hearings and carefully reviewed the issues. Recently, the Mid-Atlantic Council recommended size limitations on large harvesting vessels engaged in the mackerel fishery, but has not decided to extend similar limitations to processing vessels. This would allow U.S. flag vessels, such as the Atlantic Star to process fish caught by U.S. fishermen, just as the foreign flag vessels we are allowing in today will be able to do. By providing another market for U.S. fishermen it would also provide employment and economic benefits to the region. Moreover, unlike foreign vessels, U.S. flag processing vessels must pay U.S. income taxes, employ Americans and are subject to U.S. labor and environmental laws, requirements that benefit all Americans. 
Unfortunately, during deliberations on the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act of 1999, which will be included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill for 1999, the Senate accepted language creating a blanket exclusion of the Atlantic Star. We are now in the awkward position of authorizing the entry of foreign vessels to process U.S.-caught fish, while excluding our own U.S. processing vessels. Ironically, if the Atlantic Star were to give up her U.S. flag and operate under Lithuanian or Estonian flag, she could come into the United States and operate as a processing vessel in these U.S. fisheries, free from U.S. income tax, employing all foreign crew and exempt from other U.S. laws. 
I support the development of our American fishing industry, while ensuring the long-term health and management of the resource. The principles of the Magnuson-Stevens Act--the primary fisheries law of the land--long ago established the priority to be afforded American vessels to harvest and process fish inside the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Excluding U.S. processing vessels in the face of the Council's contrary judgment and while allowing foreign processing vessels into the same fishery does a disservice, not only to American catcher-vessel fishermen who seek markets for the fish and to the crew and owners of the Atlantic Star, but to all Americans. Frankly, it is a policy that simply makes no sense. I hope my colleagues will join me in revisiting this issue early in the new Congress.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act. The House recently passed an amended version of the Senate Coast Guard bill. While I support the overall reauthorization of the Coast Guard, I want to comment on several provisions contained in the House passed bill. 
There is currently an administrative process in place to convey excess Federal government property. I believe that legislation which mandates the transfer or disposal of Federal property under terms which circumvent the established administrative procedures is inappropriate. Consequently, the Senate bill used discretionary language to address certain conveyances requested by individual Senators. However, the House bill includes mandatory legislative conveyances. In this case only, I am accepting the mandatory language because I am satisfied that the Coast Guard is willing and prepared to make each of these particular conveyances. 
Another important difference between the House and Senate passed bills relates to drug interdiction. I sponsored an amendment in the Senate bill which would have established criminal sanctions for the knowing failure to obey an order to land an airplane. As a former pilot, let me clearly state that this provision was not designed to put any pilot at risk of an arbitrary or random forced landing. Arbitrary or random forced landings are impermissible under the Senate provision. As with all aviation legislation in which I have been involved, safety is a top priority. Under current law, if a Federal law enforcement officer who is enforcing drug smuggling or money laundering laws witnesses a person loading tons of cocaine onto a plane in Mexico, sees the plane take off and enter the United States, he may issue an order to land, and if the pilot knowingly disobeys that order, there is currently no criminal penalty associated with such a failure to obey the order. 
The criminal sanctions contained in the Senate bill would only be applied to a person who knowingly disobeyed an order to land issued by a Federal law enforcement agent who is enforcing drug smuggling or money laundering laws. The bill would also require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to write regulations defining the means by and circumstances under which it would be appropriate to order an aircraft to land. One of the FAA's essential missions is aviation safety. Accordingly, the FAA would be required to ensure that any such order is clearly communicated in accordance with international standards. Moreover, the FAA would be further required to specify when an order to land may be issued based on observed conduct, prior information, or other circumstances. Therefore, orders to land would have to be justifiable, not arbitrary or random. Orders to 
land would only be issued in cases where the authorized federal law enforcement agent has observed conduct or possesses reliable information which provides sufficient evidence of a violation of Federal drug smuggling or money laundering laws. If enacted, I would take every step possible to ensure that this provision does not diminish safety in any way. 
Last year, 430 metric tons of cocaine entered the United States from Mexico. In 1995, drugs cost taxpayers an estimated $109 billion. The average convicted drug smuggler was sentenced to only 4.3 years in jail, and is expected to serve less than half of that sentence. It is incumbent on all of us to fight the war on drugs with every responsible and safe measure at our disposal. The provision in the Senate bill would help those men and women who fight the war on drugs at our borders by providing an additional penalty for those who knowingly disobey the law. 
A provision included in both the House and Senate bill relates to the International Safety Management Code (ISM Code). On July 1, 1998, the owners and operators of passenger vessels, tankers and bulk carriers were required to have in place safety management systems which meet the requirements of the ISM Code. On July 1, 2002, all other large cargo ships and self-propelled mobile offshore drilling units will have to comply. Companies and vessels not ISM Code-certified are not permitted to enter U.S. waters. 
Shipowners required to comply with the ISM Code have raised concerns that the ISM Code may be misused. The IBM code requires a system of internal audits and reporting systems which are intended to encourage compliance with applicable environmental and vessel safety standards. However, the documents produced as a result of the ISM Code would also provide indications of past non-conformities. Obviously, for this information to be useful in rectifying environmental and safety concerns, it must be candid and complete. However, this information, prepared by shipowners or operators, may be used in enforcement actions against a shipowner or operator, crews and shoreside personnel by governmental agencies and may be subject to discovery in civil litigation. 
The provision in both the Senate and House bills would require the Secretary to conduct a study to examine the operation of the ISM Code, taking into account the effectiveness of internal audits and reports. After completion of the study, the Secretary is required to develop a policy to achieve full compliance with and effective implementation of the ISM Code. Under the provision, the public shall be given the opportunity to participate in and comment on the study. In addition, it may be appropriate for the Secretary to form a working group of affected private parties to assist in the development of the study and the issuance of the required policy and any resulting legislative recommendations. Any private citizen who is a member of any such working group cannot receive any form of government funds, reimbursement or travel expenses for participation in, or while a member of, the working group.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 1998, 1999, and 2000. The Coast Guard is a branch of the armed forces and a multi-mission agency. The Coast Guard is responsible for our national defense, search and rescue services on our nation's waterways, maritime law enforcement, including drug interdiction and environmental protection, marine inspection, licensing, port safety and security, aids to navigation, waterways management, and boating safety. This bill will provide the Coast Guard with funding and authority to continue to provide the United States with high quality performance of its diverse duties through fiscal year 2000. I commend the men and women of the Coast Guard who serve their country with honor and distinction. 
This bill authorizes $100 million over the Administration's budget request in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 for drug interdiction activities. This additional money will restore drug interdiction funding to approximately the same level which the Coast Guard spent on the war on drugs in 1997. As the primary maritime law enforcement agency, the Coast Guard has played an essential role in our nation's war on drugs. The Commandant of the Coast Guard serves as the Administration's drug interdiction coordinator. With the leadership provided by the Coast Guard, several successful drug interdiction operations performed with other federal agencies have proven to be quite effective. In Operation Frontier Shield, 36,262 pounds of cocaine were seized off the coast of Puerto Rico, and in three months during Operation Frontier Lance, 2,990 pounds of cocaine were seized off the coast of Haiti. Despite these successful operations, the Administration has not provided for an actual increase in drug interdiction funding levels in its fiscal year 1999 budget request. The funding included in this bill signifies the Commerce Committee's endorsement of the Coast Guard's continued role in the war on drugs. 
In addition to funding the important multi-missions of the Coast Guard, this bill makes a series of programmatic changes which will help the Coast Guard operate in a more efficient and effective manner. I will briefly highlight and explain several provisions contained in the bill. The bill gives the Coast Guard parity with the Department of Defense for severance pay. It gives the Coast Guard discretion in making decisions related to severance pay for officers being separated with a less than Honorable Discharge and removes the existing cap on warrant officer severance pay. In both instances, the Committee expects the Coast Guard to implement this provision in a fair and uniform manner. 
The bill also prohibits a foreign-flag vessel which has been detained for a violation of an international safety convention to 
which the United States is a party from carrying cargo sponsored by the United States Government for one year after the violation. The Committee intends this penalty to be triggered in the case of serious violations of such conventions. 
The bill authorizes the Coast Guard to establish seasonal helicopter search and rescue capability based in Westhampton, NY, from April 15 through October 15. Due to the discretionary nature of this provision, the Committee fully expects the Coast Guard to continue to maintain its complete search and rescue mission based on need. By including this provision, the Committee does not intend to extend any inference of priority for the establishment of such search and rescue capability in a manner that contravenes meeting higher priorities. 
The bill authorizes the Coast Guard to administratively convey excess lighthouses. In granting such authority, the Committee is focused on the historic preservation of the lighthouses. However, the Committee expects the Coast Guard to take factors, such as the protection of the taxpayer, into consideration when making such an administrative conveyance. For example, if a conveyance is the source of a local controversy or would result in a waste of taxpayer dollars, the Committee would anticipate that the Coast Guard would exercise its discretion and not make the conveyance. 
The bill also provides an administrative process for obtaining a waiver of the coastwise trade laws to allow vessels to commercially operate in the coastwise trade under certain conditions. The waiver authority allows the Administration to process noncontroversial waiver requests in a more expeditious manner than the Congress and improve the responsiveness of the federal government in meeting the needs of many vessel-operating small businesses. I introduced this provision separately as S. 661 and it was adopted by the Committee. 
The bill includes S. 1480, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998. This bill was adopted by the Committee and provides funding for Federal research, monitoring, and management activities to address harmful algal blooms and hypoxia on a national scale. 
The bill includes a provision which authorized the Commandant of the Coast Guard to recognize the community of Grand Haven, Michigan as `Coast Guard City USA'. The community has a long and lofty tradition of making the Coast Guard at home in Grand Haven. Senator Abraham, Senator Levin, and Representative Hoekstra worked tirelessly to secure this recognition for Grand Haven. The bill contains discretionary language because the Committee was concerned about possibly precluding any other community in the United States from attaining such recognition under any circumstances. 
This bill represents a comprehensive set of improvements which should enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the day-to-day operation of the Coast Guard. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude and that of the full Commerce Committee to staff who worked on this bill, including Clark LeBlanc, Sloan Rappoport, Jim Sartucci, Penny Dalton, Jean Toal, Carl Bentzel, as well as Tim Cook, a Coast Guard fellow, who provided valuable insight into life in the Coast Guard and how certain provisions in the Coast Guard bill would benefit the men and women in uniform, and Stephanie Bailenson, a Sea Grant fellow, who helped develop the harmful algal bloom legislation and provided an essential scientific perspective on the bill.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend, Senator Inhofe, for raising these issues. As he said, the goal of this amendment is to help U.S. law enforcement officers fight the war on drugs. The provision would make it unlawful for a pilot subject to U.S. jurisdiction to knowingly disobey an order to land issued by an authorized Federal law enforcement officer. The provision does try to address the issues you raise by requiring that the FAA write the regulations to define the means by and circumstances under which it would be appropriate to order an aircraft to land. The regulations would include guidelines for determining when an officer may issue an order to land based on observed conduct, prior information, or other circumstances. 
Clearly, safety must be a primary consideration in the formulation and administration of these guidelines. Let me also assure the Senator from Oklahoma that the intent of this provision is not to allow for seizure of aircraft owned by people whose planes have been stolen, borrowed or rented and used illegally without the owner's knowledge. If the general aviation community still has concerns, we will work with you to make sure the issues involving safety and fair treatment of innocent pilots are thoroughly considered. As we discuss the Coast Guard bill with the House, we will work with you and review the language in this provision. I want to assure my friend that I will discuss all of your concerns and recommendations, and recommendations from other Senators with our colleagues in the House.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Fair Competition in Foreign Commerce Act of 1998, to address the serious problem of waste, fraud and abuse, resulting from bribery and corruption in international development projects. This legislation will set conditions for U.S. funding through multilateral development banks. These conditions will require the country receiving aid to adopt substantive procurement reforms, and independent third-party procurement monitoring of their international development projects. 
During the cold war, banks and governments often looked the other way as pro-western leaders in developing countries treated national treasuries as their personal treasure troves. Information technologies and the resulting global economy have transformed the world in which we live into a smaller and smaller community. For example, economic turmoil in Indonesia hits home on Wall Street. Allegations of misconduct in the White House negatively impact Wall Street, which causes capital flight to other nation's stock exchanges. In today's increasingly interdependent global economy, nations are ill-advised to ignore corruption and wrongdoing in neighboring countries.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill for their hard work in putting forth this legislation which provides federal funding for numerous vital programs. However, I am sad to say, once again, I find myself in the unpleasant position of speaking before my colleagues about unacceptable levels of parochial projects in another appropriations Conference Report. 
Earlier this year, I came to the Senate floor and highlighted the numerous earmarks and set asides contained in the Senate version of this bill. That bill contained $826 million in specifically earmarked pork-barrel spending. That was a $791 million increase over last year's pork-barrel spending total for this bill, which only contained $34.25 million in wasted funds. 
While the Senate bill contained an unacceptable amount of pork, this conference report is even worse. It contains $1.5 billion in specially earmarked pork barrel spending. This is almost double the amount of pork which was in the bill. This is a tremendous burden which is patently unfair to the millions hard-working American taxpayers, who does not possess the resources to get a `pet project' placed in their back yard. 
The list of projects which received priority billing is quite long and the dollar amounts are staggering. Nevertheless, I will highlight a few of the more egregious violations. 
First the conference report instructs the Administrator of General Services to purchase a property adjacent to the new courthouse currently under construction in Scranton, PA, at whatever price she/he determines is appropriate. The language then provides $668 million for repairs, alterations, and construction services. That adds $668 million to the price of acquiring the building. I am not an expert on court house construction, but $668 million in addition to the purchase price seems like a lot of money for a courthouse. 
But, the unbridled spending does not stop with the Scranton, PA court house, it continues. The conference report also contains numerous provisions for millions of dollars to construct new court houses in specific locations throughout the U.S. Again, why are these particular sites so deserving of funding, that they receive specific earmarks to fund their construction? Unfortunately, this spending frenzy is not limited to court houses. Somebody in either the House of Representatives, or the Senate has concluded that the World Trade Office in Vermont ($500,000), and the IRS Service Center in Brookhaven, NY ($20 million) are so unique that they should receive specific earmarks. 
These are just a few examples of the spending excesses in this report. The list goes on, and on. Mr. President, why are we spending so much on locality specific pork barrel projects? Why are we spending so much on new court house construction? Maybe if we used some of the new court house construction money to combat teen drug use, we would not need to construct so many new court houses. Maybe, we should redirect some of this court house construction money to combating overall drug use, putting more police on our streets, or funding crime prevention programs to prevent people from ever becoming involved in the criminal justice system. 
Mr. President, I will not deliberate much longer on the objectionable provisions in the conference report. I simply ask my colleagues to apply fair and reasonable spending principles when appropriating funds to the multitude of priority and necessary programs in our appropriations bills. 
As I have said many times in the past, we must remain committed to open and fair consideration of public expenditures. Our objective must always be to further the greatest public good. This must remain the cornerstone of the appropriations process. And, most important, we must remember, responsible spending is the cornerstone of good governance.

Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I am here today with my colleagues, Senator Coats and Senator Coverdell, to submit a resolution providing much needed direction to our nation's battle against heroin addiction. 
Drug abuse continues to plague our society, destroying families, futures and opportunities for millions of Americans each year. Addiction to drugs, particularly devastating drugs like heroin, endangers the well-being of all citizens, particularly our children, and thus the future of this nation. 
Recent statistics show dramatic increases in drug use among children and pain a chilling image of the obstacles facing our nation before we can claim victory in the battle against drugs. In a 1997 study, almost 12 percent of children between the ages of 12 and 17 report using an illicit drug in the preceding 30 days. The number of children using heroin for the first time is at its highest level in 30 years, and today there are over 810,000 heroin addicts in our country. 
Clearly, we are still quite far from winning the war drugs. 
This is why I am concerned and, honestly, frustrated by the policies which are being promoted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to combat heroin addiction. Under the direction of General McCaffrey, the ONDCP and the Administration have announced their decision to spend $3.7 billion to double the number of heroin addicts in methadone maintenance programs, which ONDCP has unilaterally chosen as the preferred treatment for heroin addicts. 
Mr. President, I have serious concerns about this recently announced policy. 
First, methadone treatment programs simply transfer addiction from one drug, heroin, to another drug, methadone. Methadone treatment merely transfers dependency. It does nothing to provide addicts with the training and support necessary to function as self-sufficient, productive members of society. Methadone maintenance programs alone force individuals into a life of government-sponsored drug dependency. 
Second, ONDCP did not consult with Congress about this significant and expensive policy decision. The simple fact is that ONDCP has neither the statutory nor budget authority to implement this policy without Congressional approval. And it is not clear that spending nearly $4 billion on expanded methadone maintenance programs is a wise or effective use of the resources available to combat drug abuse and addiction in this country. 
Mr. President, eradicating heroin use is a difficult issue which must be addressed with careful deliberation, extensive dialogue and a thorough examination. Our policies and programs must be designed to free heroin addicts from their addition, not hook them on another government-condoned drug. 
The resolution we are submitting today calls on Congress to focus on developing effective policies and program for ending heroin addiction. We should be looking at all alternatives to methadone treatment, especially those that do not involve transferring addiction or dependence on substances. We should also include programs to provide training and support to former addicts to help them become productive members of our society. And we should be working to develop drug strategies that will further our goal of a drug-free America. 
Let me take a moment to thank my dear friend, Dan Coats, for his work in putting together this resolution. His thoughtful and caring devotion to improving the lives of children and the less fortunate in our society will be sorely missed. 
Mr. President, I realize that time is short in this Congress, but I strongly believe that eliminating drug abuse and addiction in America should be a high priority for the Administration and Congress. I urge my colleagues to give careful consideration to this issue and join in working toward that goal in the 106th Congress.

Mr. McCAIN. In full accordance with the rules and procedures of the Senate and pursuant to the notice filed yesterday, I move to suspend rule XXII as it applies to the consideration of amendment No. 3711. 
And, Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, I want to explain what will occur here and the significance of this vote. 
By the way, as far as the modification is concerned to amendment No. 3711, since it is agreed on both sides, once we dispense with this parliamentary tactic, then obviously we will be able, by unanimous consent, to modify to satisfy a concern that was not included in the amendment. 
At some point this morning we will vote to suspend the rules regarding germaneness with respect to the pending amendment. Senator Wyden and I would have offered this amendment earlier, long before cloture was invoked, but we didn't because we were still negotiating language with other Senators--specifically, the Senator from North Dakota and other Senators--who were involved in this very important piece of legislation. We could have offered it and I am sure we could have passed the amendment, but in the environment of trying to reach overall agreement on language of this legislation we did not do it at that time. We did not propose this amendment in order to accommodate other Senators. As we all know, sometimes there are package agreements involving different parts of the legislation. 
The Democratic manager of the bill, Senator Dorgan, Senator Wyden and myself came to agreement on the language of the amendment. It was at that time, and only at that time, we were notified that a point of order would be raised against the language, even though we have been negotiating with the Senator from Florida and his staff since last August on this package. Doing so obviously is the Senator's right. I don't begrudge any Senator their right to use the rules to his or her advantage. But I do want to make it clear we tried to be fair and accommodate everyone who has left us in this position. 
Simply, if we don't succeed in suspending the rules and adopting this amendment, Senator Wyden and myself will no longer pursue this legislation. It won't pass. Internet tax freedom, at least for this year, will be dead. Because, Mr. President, failure to adopt this amendment will render this bill impotent. 
I suspect that may have been the desire of some Members all along, to kill this bill. Let there be no mistake, failure of this bill will hurt the future of electronic commerce and will subject our constituents to new taxes. Yes, a vote against suspending the rules is a vote to kill the bill. Without the language of this amendment being added, the bill is meaningless; it will accomplish nothing. Therefore, we will not pursue the legislation. 
But this vote means more than killing the Internet Tax Freedom Act. Adopted to this bill was Senator Bryan's Children's Online Privacy Act. That is a very important bill that will protect children who use the Internet. It is bipartisan legislation that was passed out of the Commerce Committee by a unanimous vote. If this bill dies today, Senator Bryan's Children Online Privacy Bill dies today. 
Adopted to this bill was Senator Coats' Decency Act. That measure was adopted by a vote of 98-1 yesterday. The Coats amendment is exceedingly important to protect our children from pornography that is proliferating on the world wide web. If this bill dies today, Senator Coats' Decency Act dies today. 
Adopted to this bill was Senator Dodd's amendment regarding filtering. The Dodd amendment would require Internet service providers making filtering software available to families so that they can screen unwanted and harmful material from appearing on their computer. The Dodd amendment has twice been adopted by the Senate. It is important. 
Adopted to this bill was Senator Abraham's Digital Signature bill. This bill was reported by the Commerce Committee with no opposition. 
Mr. President, if we cannot suspend the rules and adopt this amendment that is supported by both managers, the Internet tax bill is dead and so is the vital legislation sponsored by our colleagues. 
Let me briefly explain why this amendment is needed. The amendment does two things. First, it clarifies what is a discriminatory tax. This is necessary because without this definition the moratorium is rendered meaningless. States and localities do not pass new laws every time a new product appears. They simply interpret existing laws to apply to the products. What we are seeking to do here is clarify that the Internet cannot be singled out for the application of a tax in a discriminatory manner. For example, if an entity has a wicket tax, or a cellular phone tax, or a microwave oven tax, it would not be able to apply such tax in a discriminatory manner solely to the Internet and thereby claim the moratorium does not apply. 
Mr. President, if this definition is not included in the bill, then the moratorium is gutted. 
The second part of the amendment clarifies that the location of a server or of web pages does not constitute nexus. This is exceedingly important. If an individual in Iowa, sitting at his or her desk is surfing the web and buys a product for his mother in Tennessee from a company in Maine, using a server located in Florida, the fact that the server is located in Florida should not constitute nexus for the purposes of taxation. Neither the purchaser nor the company from which merchandise was purchased, nor the recipient, under this example, lived in Florida. 
So, again, this language simply clarifies this matter. We do not state that the appearance of a catalog in someone's mailbox constitutes nexus. This provision simply updates that fact in the age of the Internet. 
As technology bypasses us all and the use of the web becomes more and more ubiquitous and seamless, we will need to protect the technology that is fueling our economy. The issues of Quill and of who should and should not have to pay taxes will and should be settled by the Congress and the States. But regardless of that outcome, this technology should not be harmed by onerous, discriminatory, unfair--and in many cases--outdated laws. 
To close, adoption of this amendment is vital to the passage of this legislation. This vote is key to its passage. If we fail to muster the 66 votes necessary, this bill will be dead. And as I have noted, some have wanted to kill it all along. We were forced to file cloture on the motion to proceed. We were forced to file cloture on the bill. We did all we could to accommodate all Senators with interests in this bill. We protected the rights of Senators to offer and debate amendments. 
We did not have to allow the senior Senator from Arkansas an opportunity to offer non-germane amendments prior to cloture we did. We could have filled the tree or sat in quorum calls awaiting the cloture vote or final vote. But the Senate functions in a spirit of comity. So the Senator from Arkansas had his opportunity and his votes. 
The bill has been changed and amended. We have accepted language offered by Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas. We accepted language offered by my good friend Senator Enzi. I did not care for those amendments, but I accepted the will of this body and I recognized that we must move forward on this important legislation. 
Especially on legislation like this, accommodations and concessions have to be made. 
This bill does contain amendments which I wish were not in there, but there are 100 Members here. I also agreed to go along with the will of the majority, as did the Senator from North Dakota, as did the Senator from Oregon, and many other Senators who had deep and abiding interests in this legislation. 
Again, this vote is exceedingly important if we are going to pass this bill. If we waive the rules for the purpose of this amendment, we can pass the bill and send it to the House. If we waive the rules, we can protect the Internet from unfair and discriminatory taxation, and more importantly, pass legislation that is vitally important to the country. 
It is my understanding, and I ask parliamentary clarification, this motion is debatable; is that true?

I also would like to add to the comments of the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, who said this is how the process should work. It has been very tough, very difficult, very time-consuming, but I think the magnitude of the legislation we are considering probably warranted all of that--and perhaps more. So I thank him very much. And as far as the freshman from Oregon is concerned, he has certainly earned his spurs as a member of the Commerce Committee. 
By the way, I also thank the Chair for his involvement in this issue. He is probably the most computer literate Member of the U.S. Senate. We obviously value his talent and expertise and look forward to the day when he has his laptop on the floor for its use that so far we have failed to achieve but someday I hope we do. 
I also mention one other person, Congressman Cox over in the other body, who has also played a key role in the development of their legislation on the other side. He has done a tremendous job, Congressman Cox of California.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again, I find myself in the unpleasant position of speaking before my colleagues about unacceptable levels of parochial projects in the VA/HUD appropriations bill. Although the level of add-ons in some portions of this conference are down, this bill still contains approximately $865 million in wasteful pork barrel spending. This is an unacceptable amount of low priority, unrequested, wasteful spending. 
The level of add-ons in the Veterans Affairs section of this conference report is down. The total value of specific earmarks in the Veterans Affairs section of this conference report is about $116 million. 
Let me just review some examples of items included in the bill. The bill directs $1 million for the VA's first-year costs to the Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership's proposal to develop an Alaska-wide telemedicine network to provide access to health services and health education information at VA, IHS, DOD and Coast Guard clinic facilities and linking remote installations and villages with tertiary health facilities in Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
An especially troublesome expense, neither budgeted for nor requested by the Administration for the past seven years, is a provision that directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue the seven-year-old demonstration project involving the Clarksburg, West Virginia VAMC and the Ruby Memorial Hospital at West Virginia University. Last year, the appropriations bill contained a plus-up of $2 million to the Clarksburg VAMC that ended up on the Administration's line-item veto list and that the Administration had concluded was truly wasteful. 
The VA provides first-rate research in many areas such as prosthetics. However, some of my colleagues still prefer to direct the VA to ignore their priority research programs and instead provide critical veterans health care dollars for parochial or special interest projects. For example, this bill earmarks $3 million for the Center of Excellence at the Truman Memorial VA Medical Center in Missouri for studies on hypertension, surfactants, and lupus erythematosus, and provides $6 million in the medical and prosthetic research appropriation for Musculoskeletal Disease research in Long Beach, California. It is difficult to argue against worthy research projects such as these, but they are not a priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Like transportation and military construction bills, the VA appropriations funding bill is no exception for construction project additions to the President's budget request. For example, the bill adds $7.5 million in funding for the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in Missouri for gravesite development which will provide 13,200 grave sites for full casket interments. Although this is a worthy cause, I wonder how many other national cemetery projects in other States were leapfrogged to ensure that Missouri's cemetery received in the VA's highest priority. 
In the area of critical VA, medical facility funding, again, certain projects in key members' states received priority billing, including $20.8 million add for the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center ambulatory care renovation project in Ohio, a $9.5 million add for the Lebanon, Pennsylvania VAMC for nursing unit renovations, including providing patients with increased privacy, a $25.2 million add for construction of an ambulatory care addition at the Tucson VA Medical Center in Arizona, and provides $125,000 for renovation of the Pershing Hall building in Paris, France for memorial and private purposes. 
Mr. President, we are charged with the important responsibility of dedicating funding toward the highest priorities to safeguard our environment. Yet, I am troubled that this conference report is loaded with directed earmarks toward specific projects without adequate explanation of why these projects are higher in priority than national environmental problems and needs. 
I continue to hear about the number of Superfund sites that are in critical need of remediation actions or leaking background storage tanks that continue to endanger lives. Yet, the picture that I am putting together from this report is a prioritization of member interest projects. EPA's overall budget contains approximately $484,325,000 in earmarks that are directed to specific states and to national organizations. 
Rather than dedicating funding toward our most pressing environmental concerns, the priorities of the conferees are earmarking spending of $125,000 for the establishment of a regional environmental finance center in Kentucky and $225,000 for a demonstration project in Maryland to determine the feasibility of using poultry litter as a fuel to general electric power. 
I commend the efforts of my colleagues who worked tirelessly to rectify differences between the two chambers and present us with this conference report. Each of them have worked diligently to ensure that important housing programs and initiatives are adequately funded in a fair and objective manner. 
Contained in this bill is funding for many programs vital in meeting the housing needs of our nation and for the revitalization and development of our communities. Many of the programs administered by HUD help our nation's families purchase their homes, assists low-income families obtain affordable housing, combats discrimination in the housing market, assists in rehabilitating neighborhoods and helps our nation's most vulernable--the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged have access to safe and affordable housing. 
In July, I came to the Senate floor and highlighted the numerous earmarks and set asides contained in the Senate version of this bill. At that time, the egregious violations of the appropriate budgetary process in the HUD section amounted to $270.25 million dollars. 
Unfortunately, I find myself coming to the floor today to again highlight the numerous earmarks and budgetary violations which remain in the conference report of this bill. In the HUD section alone there is $265.1 million in set asides or earmarks. While this amount is slightly lower than when the Senate first considered this bill it is still too great a burden for the American taxpayers. 
The list of projects which received priority billing is quite long but I will highlight a few of the more egregious violations. There is $1.25 million set aside for the City of Charlotte, NC to conduct economic development in the Wilkinson Boulevard corridor, $1 million for the Audubon Institute Living Sciences Museum in New Orleans and $2 million for the Hawaii Housing Authority to construct a community resource center at Kuhio Homes/Kuhio Park Terrace in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
It is difficult to believe many credible and viable community development proposals may be excluded from access to federal housing funds because such a large amount of funds have been unfairly set aside for specific projects fortunate enough to have advocates on the appropriating committee. 
Finally, I would like to comment on the public housing reform bill which is now included in this funding bill. In the limited period of time I was afforded to examine this provision, I have learned that it includes several initiatives intended to enhance the quality of life for many individuals while promoting self sufficiency and personal responsibility in our communities. 
While I applaud these goals and will not object to this bill based on the inclusion of this section I am gravely concerned about the process used to pass this reform bill. It concerns me that this complex measure was inserted at the last moment during conference which precluded the Senate from having sufficient time to thoroughly examine its contents and fully evaluate its objectives. This is a very serious matter which directly impacts the lives of thousands of American families and our local communities. 
Certainly, this issue deserves thoughtful deliberation and careful review through the established legislative process and should not be attached at the last moment to a funding conference report. This is not the manner in which we should be implementing meaningful reform intended to benefit the citizens of our nation. 
Mr. President, I have touched on only the tip if the iceberg. There is more I could point to, were time available. I continue to look forward to the day when my trips to the floor to highlight member interest spending are no longer necessary.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to make a clarification to my list of objectionable provisions to the Senate passed version of the FY'99 Interior Appropriations bill. 
I was pleased to learn that the Indian health facility that is designated to be constructed on the Hopi reservation in Arizona was requested for funding in this year's budget. I had previously objected to this item in my pork list, not based on the merits of the project, but what appeared to be an unrequested, directed earmark. 
The Hopi Health Center in Polacca, Arizona is requested for funding at the level of $14,400,000 for construction of Indian health facilities, which is consistent with the budget request. I will remove this item as an objectionable provision. 
I assure Chairman Wayne Taylor and the Hopi Tribe that I continue to be supportive of establishing an Indian health center for the Hopi community.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my purpose today is to introduce legislation that would increase the authorization level of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The recently passed TEA-21 legislation authorized NHTSA at its requested level, approximately $87.4 million. The Office of Management and Budget recently asked that NHTSA receive $99.9 million in the budget request. 
Although the Department of Transportation had requested $87.4 million, we are now informed by Secretary Slater that this authorization level will not permit the funding of `key safety initiatives.' 
I know that no one in this body wants a situation where highway safety is degraded in any way. I also know that there is no opportunity that this legislation can be passed yet this Congress. This is an issue that we will address in the next Congress. I look forward to working with my colleagues to address this important issue of highway safety in a manner that provides an appropriate funding level to meet safety needs while also meeting our budget obligations and the consensus of the Appropriations Committee.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is simple. It is offered by myself for Senators Gregg and Lieberman. The amendment instructs the commission created in this bill to examine model state legislation and provide definitions of what should be subject to or exempt from taxation. Additionally, the Commission would be instructed to look specifically at Internet transactions. 
Some would like to see the scope of the commission expanded. This is not necessary. The Commission may look at any form of remote sales, but it is not forced to. 
This bill is about the Internet, and its potential as a new technology--but more importantly, as a medium for electronic commerce. The Internet is not like the mail. It is not a monopoly. It is unlike anything that we have seen to date. For that reason we believe that it should be protected from discriminatory taxation. 
Mr. President, there will be some who seek to defeat this amendment or will offer second degree amendments to it regarding remote sales, specifically mail order sales. We dealt with that subject specifically the other day. My good friend from Arkansas offered an amendment to overturn the Quill decision regarding mail order sales. Senator Graham of Florida spoke in favor of the amendment. And then the Senate voted on the matter. The amendment was defeated handily: 65-30. We don't need to revisit this issue again. If we do, I would hope the vote to table would be the same. 
We should let this commission do its work. We should not prejudge what they will decide or attempt to force them to examine certain subjects or come to certain conclusions. That would be wrong and would undermine the mission of the Commission. The bi-partisan amendment before the Senate gives the commission free reign to decide what it believes is best and report such findings to the Congress. I urge my colleagues to support the McCain/Gregg/Lieberman amendment and defeat any second degree amendments that may be offered. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, let me comment on what is going on here for the benefit of my colleagues. We have agreed on the language concerning the grandfathering of this legislation, which was important. 
Now we have resolved all matters with the exception of whether the moratorium should last for 3 or 4 years. My amendment, after we accept the grandfather language from the Senator from North Dakota, will be to have the moratorium expire at the end of 4 years, for which there will probably be a recorded vote, after which it is most likely--although we have to check with both sides about further debate--we will have completed the amending process of the germane amendments that were on the bill and we will be very close to final passage of the legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge the advocates of the 3-year moratorium to come to the floor and help us explore this very complex issue as to whether we are going to have a 3-year or a 4-year moratorium. I know it is a subject that is complex in detail. However, we would like to complete the debate on this very complicated issue that we were unable to resolve with our friends on the other side of this issue. 
Again, I find it remarkable that we were able to work out grandfather language, and about 15 other amendments. But somehow this one is worthy of a vote as to whether a moratorium is 3 or 4 years. 
I can't add a lot to what the distinguished Senator from Oregon just said, except to say that I hope we can minimize the debate. But I say to those who are the 3-year advocates to come over and make their case, because as soon as Senator Dorgan comes back we would like to move on that amendment, because I believe that, following Senator Murkowski's motion on the underlying amendment, we can move to final passage on this bill. 
I know the Senator from Oregon would like to dispense of this legislation but not nearly so much as I would.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Oregon. 
The reality is that the original legislation as proposed by the Senator from Oregon had no grandfathering. It had no time limit. This legislation received overwhelming support both in the committee and, very frankly, throughout the country, and gradually, interestingly enough, many Governors who would experience, in the view of some, a loss of revenue came on board this legislation--the Governor of California, the Governor of Texas, the Governor of New York, and many other Governors, but practically every Governor of every major State.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. Gilmore says: 
I am very pleased the Senate will soon vote on the Internet Tax Reform Act, S. 442. 
Not as pleased as I am. He says in his concluding paragraph: 
For these reasons, I urge the enactment of the Internet Tax Freedom Act this year and look forward to working with you and the Congress to ensure our Nation remains the undisputed leader in cutting edge technology industries. 
So another Governor and a very important one, the Governor of Virginia, has weighed in in favor of this legislation. 
I believe the fact that we were willing to agree to certain grandfathering provisions was very helpful in moving this process forward, but I also think that it made an argument for a 4-year moratorium. Again, when it came out of the committee, it was 6 years originally and now the Finance Committee reduced it to 2. We think that 4 years is obviously a reasonable compromise. 
So again I urge the 3-year moratorium advocates to come to the floor so we could have vigorous debate on that issue and a vote sometime around 4:45, with the agreement of the majority leader.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while he is on the floor, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his involvement in this issue. He won a significant victory. I believe that his knowledge of this issue and this technology is very helpful not only on this issue, but we will be addressing numerous other issues regarding these emerging technologies in the future and I appreciate his participation. We look forward to working with him. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me say for my colleagues where we are on this bill. 
We believe that we had an agreement that there would be this vote on the Murkowski amendment to table, and then we would proceed to adopt a previously agreed to amendment that had been agreed to by the Senator from North Dakota who has been managing the bill and others that have been involved in the legislation. Apparently, that was not agreed to by the Senator from Florida who intends to at least at this time challenge on the issue of germaneness the amendment that the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from Oregon, I, the Senator from Wyoming, and others had agreed to, which has to do with the definition of what are discriminatory taxes. 
This, obviously, germane point of order would carry, or there is a likelihood that it would. That would reduce the effectiveness or the impact of this bill to the point where it would be nearly meaningless. 
The Senator from Florida has told me that he will work overnight with us and with others to try to craft some agreement or relook at the entire issue. I hope that he will do so. 
After the vote at 11 tomorrow on VA-HUD, I will then propose amendment No. 3711. At that time, if the Senator from Florida still wishes to, obviously he can challenge the amendment on point of order concerning whether the amendment is germane or not. 
Mr. President, I think everybody realizes how important this legislation is. I would very much hate to see it derailed at this point in time. 
But the amendment, 3711, is vital to this legislation. Some may ask why we didn't propose it earlier. That is because it was part of a package of negotiation that we were in with the Senator from North Dakota, and others. 
I respect the right of the Senator from Florida to object on germaneness grounds. That is his right as a Senator. I do not challenge that.

But I want to be clear that my interpretation and that of the Senator from Oregon and the proponents of this legislation are that if we do not allow the amendment 3711, then the legislation itself would be rendered largely meaningless.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to support and cosponsor the legislation that Senator Roberts introduced earlier today that reinstates the 50 percent retirement `earned benefit' plan for men and women in the military who retire with 20 years of military service. I also implore the Senate leadership to act quickly on this legislation and move for its swift passage before the 105th Congress adjourns for the year. 
Times have changed since 1986. Our economy has prospered, producing historically high levels of employment and resulting in the emergence of a very difficult recruiting and retention environment for the armed services. Maintaining a top-quality force requires a military personnel system that has the flexibility to react quickly to the dynamics of the civilian market, and the leadership and confidence to follow through with critical personnel decisions rather than neglecting them out of fiscal opportunism. Regrettably, this year, first, second, and third-term enlisted retention, pilot and mid-grade officer retention, and recruiting are all short of the goal for each of the services. 
Recruiting and retaining quality individuals requires pay scales that adjust to meet prevailing rates rather than fall 14 percent behind comparable civilian pay. It requires adequate funding for recruiting. It requires proper promotion rates--not promotion boards that take five months to process reports of promotion boards, as is the case with the Navy. It requires proper living conditions and morale, welfare and recreation services. It also requires reasonable tours of duty, a higher quality of civilian leadership, and `role models' within the leadership who are seen to take service members' quality-of-life concerns to heart. 
Reinstatement of the 50 percent retirement plan for career military men and women would serve as an important signal of resolve to our service members that the United States Congress is aware of the shortfall in benefits for those who wear the uniform of their country and is acting to improve those benefits. Last week, the Senate Armed Services Committee heard directly from the Joint Chiefs that restoring retirement benefits is a requirement for recruiting and retaining the qualified individuals we rely on to defend this nation. 
General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated clearly that fixing the military retirement system is a top recommendation for restoring the readiness of our armed forces. Army Chief of Staff General Reimer has written to me that 
. . .the retirement package we have offered our soldiers entering the Army since 1986 is inadequate. Having lost 25 percent of its lifetime value as a result of the 1980's reforms, military retirement is no longer our number one retention tool. Our soldiers and families deserve better. We need to send them a strong signal that we haven't forgotten them. 
The military medical health care system, particularly the TRICARE program, has been described by Service Chiefs as falling far short of what is warranted and needed. We cannot ignore the erosion of retirement and health care benefits, and the resultant impact on retention and readiness. General Reimer writes,  
`The loss in medical benefits when a retiree turns 65 is particularly bothersome to our soldiers who are making career decisions.' 
From the Service Chiefs' answers, it is highly questionable whether we are meeting any of these requirements. On the contrary, it is clear that there is much work to be done. 
Finally, it is demoralizing to the men and women we send into harm's way, and is incomprehensible to the American people, who expect a well-trained and well-equipped force, to witness as many as 25,000 military personnel and their families on food stamps. One tax provision that I have tried to reverse this year excludes uniformed men and women in the military from beneficial tax treatment on the profits resulting from the sale of their homes. We order servicemembers to move from place to place, but we do not afford them the same tax treatment as other U.S. citizens. Should this issue have been permitted to exist for so many years? 
Mr. President, we cannot afford to neglect this array of personnel concerns. Let us begin by acting immediately to restore the higher earned benefit plan for retired service members. Senator Roberts has offered critical legislation to help reverse the diminishing retention rates that cripple our Armed Services and ultimately diminish their ability to execute our National Military Strategy. On behalf of all men and women who have honorably dedicated their careers to serving this country in uniform, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is a letter I sent to the President this morning concerning Kosovo. It reads as follows: 
Dear Mr. President: I am writing because of my serious concern about developments in Kosovo. With a brutality that would be almost unimaginable were anyone else responsible for it, Slobodan Milosevic has subjected yet another innocent population to the bloody carnage of ethnic cleansing. The stark depravity of his actions gravely offends the basic moral values of Western civilization. Moreover, the conflict in Kosovo threatens the stability of Europe, as the prospects are quite real that it may eventually embroil other countries in the region in a larger war. More than once, the United States has warned Serbia that NATO will not tolerate its continued aggression against Kosovo. Serbia has ignored our warnings, thereby challenging the credibility of the United States, obliging us and our NATO allies to consider using military force to prevent further aggression against our values and interests in Kosovo. 
Congress has reservations about such a course of action, however. While I am inclined to support military action, I understand the basis for my colleagues' reservations, and I believe it is imperative that prior to ordering any military strike on Serbia you take all necessary steps to ensure both Congress and the American people that the action is necessary, affordable, and designed to achieve clearly defined goals. 
First, you must state clearly the American interest in resolving this terrible conflict; describe in detail the facts on the ground; identify all parties responsible for perpetrating the terrible atrocities committed in Kosovo while making clear that Serbia is indisputably the primary culprit; explain how our own security is threatened by Serbian aggression and justifies risking the lives of American pilots, and how the use of air power can prevent further aggression. You must also define for the public what will constitute the operation's success so that Americans know that air strikes were launched with a realistic end game in mind. 
Second, you must convincingly explain to the American people why it is that we should be involved in a conflict that to many people seems to affect our interests indirectly, and that should be resolved exclusively by those countries most directly threatened by it--our European allies. As I am sure you appreciate, Congress and the public's frustration over Europe's lack of willingness to bear a greater share of the burden for maintaining peace in their own backyard is at an all time high, threatening the nation's consensus that our leadership in NATO should remain a priority interest for the United States. You could go a long way toward alleviating that frustration by ensuring that any ground forces that might ultimately be needed to keep the peace in Kosovo will be provided by European countries alone. 
Third, should you order air strikes you must ensure the nation that they will be of sufficient magnitude to achieve their objectives. I hope you will view the following criticism in the constructive spirit in which it is offered. In the past, your administration has too often threatened and then backed down from the use of force, or authorized cruise missile strikes that amounted to little more than ineffective gestures intended, I suspect, to send a message to our adversaries, but because of their small scale interpreted by our adversaries as a lack of resolve on the part of the United States to defend our interests vigorously. Your administration's failure to support UNSCOM inspectors in Iraq has also greatly exacerbated our adversaries' lack of respect for America's resolve. 
Finally, you should explain how you intend to find additional resources to fund the operation in order to alleviate well-founded Congressional anxiety regarding the over-extension of U.S. military commitments at a time when spending on national defense is woefully inadequate. 
Mr. President, should you convincingly address the issues I have raised, which I believe you can do, I am confident you will have the support of Congress and our constituents for operations against Serbia. You will certainly have mine. I believe there exists a clear and compelling case for such an action that Americans will accept if you avoid the mistakes made in the past when your administration has attempted to build public support for the use of force. I urge to give these concerns your most serious consideration.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, before my friend from Montana leaves the floor, I want to tell him how much I appreciate his work as chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee on the Commerce Committee. My friend from Montana and I have had spirited discussions and debates on this overall issue. I understand his deeply held views, and I appreciate them. There is great attraction to his argument. There is a fine line in America between the prevention of material which is offensive being forced on our young people and censorship. So I understand the arguments that the Senator from Montana has made. But let me say that it is a huge problem, and the Senator from Montana knows it as well as I do. It is a huge problem. 
Anyone who operates the Internet today sees this proliferation of incredible trash that occurs, which is terribly, terribly disturbing to all of us--all of us on both sides of the aisle--because of the influence that it has on young Americans, not to mention older Americans. 
We had a hearing in the Commerce Committee. There was testimony that there is a direct relation between pedophilia and the Internet. There are documented cases where pedophiles have corresponded with young people on the Internet and enticed them into meeting. These stories are so terrible and graphic that I am reluctant to discuss them on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
It is a problem in American society when you look at the growth of the Internet in America. All of us, especially those of us who serve on the Commerce Committee, are aware of the incredible potential of the Internet, the unbelievable effects it is going to have on the Nation and the world. With the wiring of schools and libraries in America, for the first time, every child in America, no matter whether they come from the Navajo Reservation and Chinlee High School or whether they attend Beverly Hills High School, are going to have access to knowledge and information like never before. 
When you dial in the word `teen' on the Internet, or when you dial in the word `nurse' and the search engine comes up with a proliferation of pornography and advertisements for it, we have to try to address this problem. 
The Senator from North Dakota has discussed this issue in committee hearings, the Senator from Oregon--all of us who are familiar with it. I will tell you right now, Mr. President, one of the problems is that a lot of us don't use the Internet like the now tens of millions of Americans do, so we are not aware of this problem. And, no, none of us would support censorship. No one is in favor of censorship. 
I will tell you that when we have actual testimony before our committee by detectives who say that they go out and they find people who entice young children through the Internet to meet with them and then terrible things ensue, then obviously we have a problem. Recently in Phoenix, AZ, a young boy who was on the Internet viewing pornography walked out and molested a 4-year-old child. It is a fact. It is a documented fact. Or parents in the library see pornography as they walk by and their children are in the library and see this. 
I am not sure I know the answers. I don't know the answers, but I firmly believe that we at least ought to make an effort to provide parents with the tools and institutions with the tools at least to filter out some of this garbage, which brings me to the Senator from Indiana. 
I know of no one who is more involved in the issues of families and morals and decency in America than is Senator Coats. I miss many of my colleagues when they leave; some of them I don't miss. But the fact is, the majority of them I do. I will miss Senator Coats because I view him as a moral compass around here. 
When Senator Coats speaks on these issues, we all listen because he is a living example of what we want families in America to be about. Senator Coats has been involved in this particular effort on this piece of legislation for a long, long time. 
I believe there may be some question about the bill's constitutionality. Fine, we will let the courts decide that. I have some questions myself. But it is a sad, but inescapable fact that material harmful to children is pervasive on the Internet in America today. It is an indisputable fact. There is no Member of the Senate who is more qualified and has more credibility to address this issue than the Senator from Indiana. 
It is my understanding that the Senator from Montana is not going to seek a recorded vote on the second-degree amendment of the Senator from Connecticut. Fairly shortly, if there is no other debate on this amendment, we will move to a vote around noon. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after adoption of the Dodd second-degree amendment that the Senate vote at 12 noon on the Coats amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Agriculture Appropriations bill continues funding for the various agricultural and land-based programs within USDA and directs $4 billion in additional spending to support emergency farm relief and crop assistance to help farmers in need during a critical year of disaster-related conditions. 
Back in July, I reported more than $241 million in earmarks contained in the Senate bill for unrequested, unauthorized or purely parochial projects. A review of the conference report leads me to determine that the conferees jointly decided to overload this report with even more flagrant examples of wasteful and unnecessary spending. This year's conference agreement is more than $381 million above the budget request and higher than either the Senate or House had proposed. 
Included in this spending bill is an added farm relief package that totals $4 billion for crop loss assistance and market loss payments to help farmers cope with emergency situations and falling prices. We did not vote on this measure as part of the original Senate or House bill, it was added in conference. This is a very serious issue which involves a substantial amount of federal spending. Certainly, this deserves thoughtful deliberation and careful review through our established process, and should not be attached at the midnight hour to a conference report. This is not the way we ought to conduct the business of prioritizing taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. President, each year, appropriations bills are a target for members to advance political platforms. I find that the accounts for the Agricultural Research Service and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service are a virtual goldmine for member-interest earmarks. 
For example, specific earmarks are directed at the cost of: 
$250,000 for `alternative fish feed' in Idaho; $750,000 for grasshopper research in Alaska; $250,000 for lettuce geneticist/breeding in Salinas, California; $1,000,000 for peanut quality research in Dawson, Georgia and Raleigh, North Carolina; $162,000 for peach tree shortlife in South Carolina; $200,000 for tomato wilt virus in Georgia, and $750,000 to the Fish Farming Experiment Laboratory in Stuttgart, Arkansas. 
While I am not an expert in the agricultural field, I find it incredulous that we can expend one million dollars on peanut quality research while we are experiencing a crisis in the farm economy! Additionally, a quarter of a million is earmarked for `alternative fish feed'? While I am certain that the members from these respective states can make their case for directed funding for these projects, I question their desire to side-step a competitive and merit-based review process. 
I was pleased to note in the conference report a recognition of the importance of merit review procedures for grant funding. However, despite this recognition, the report continues to include directive language which explicitly leads the agency to grant specific projects with special consideration. 
For example, the report reads: 
The House and Senate reports recommend projects for consideration under various rural development programs and the conferees expect the department to apply established review procedures when considering applications. 
The report then directs: 
The conferees further expect the Department to give consideration to business enterprise and housing preservation projects in the city of Bayview, VA; aplications for rural business enterprise grants from TELACU, for a project in Selma, CA; for assistance for a community improvement program in Arkansas; water and sewer improvements for the City of Vaughn, NM; the Shulerville/Honey Hill Water project, South Carolina; and a rural enterprise grant for Indian Hills Community College in Iowa. 
This is a true disservice to the many potential competitors who are vying for funding, yet decide to work through the designated competitive grant process. 
Last year I noticed a practice by the appropriators of using the appropriations process to prevent Federal agencies from following government-wide efforts to down-size and cut back on unnecessary bureaucracy. This year's conference report formalizes this practice as a tradition by including language such as: 
Language whereby the conferees `expect the Secretary, to the extent practicable, to avoid the use of reductions-in-force or furloughs for both Federal and non-federal employees or any county office closings'; or, 
Prohibitive language which prevents the expenditure of funds made available by the Food and Drug Administration to close or relocate, or to plan to close or relocate, the Food and Drug Division of Drug Analysis in St. Louis, Missouri. 
Mr. President, I am not trying to undermine the hard work of the conferees for they do have a difficult responsibility. I commend the managers on both sides of the aisle in working out a careful compromise. Unfortunately, the Agriculture Appropriations conference report is representative of legislative circumvention and the troubling practice of pork-barrel spending. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

It circumvents the legislative process by requiring a supermajority to extend the tax moratorium in the Internet Tax Freedom Act, it would bind the hands of future Congresses, and it would start setting a rather dangerous precedent. 
Mr. President, the Senate has a supermajority mandate that applies to all legislation; it is called a filibuster. Requiring three-fifths of Congress to agree to adopt any future actions in this matter is unnecessary, when all legislation considered and passed by the Senate must essentially meet the test created by the filibuster. 
This legislation before us, the Internet Tax Freedom Act, is an excellent example of the proper manner in which legislation makes its way to the Senate for full consideration and a final vote. This legislation has been fully considered by the Commerce Committee, referred to the Finance Committee, and Senator Wyden and I have worked hard to address the concerns some Members have expressed.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today beginning debate on S. 442, the Internet Tax Freedom Act. Shortly, Senator Bumpers will come to the floor to propose his amendment, and we expect further amendments following that. 
Before I summarize the bill, I want to note for the record the importance of this measure. The reality is that this bill could determine the fate of electronic commerce. Without it, the economic revolution we are hoping for may never take place. Without it, electronic commerce may--and we are in fact seeing this occur--be hampered by politicians who see it as not as revolutionary, but as a source of new tax revenue. 
First, I want to commend Senator Wyden for his extraordinary leadership in moving this legislation forward. He kept all of the interested parties at the negotiating table when on many occasions it appeared as though we were at an impasse. After months of hard work and determination, we have come much closer to appeasing the National Governors' Association and other state and local organizations. Without Senator Wyden's assistance, the bill may never have made it this far. 
This bill will do the following: It would prohibit state and local governments from imposing any Internet access tax, bit tax or any multiple or discriminatory tax on electronic commerce for a two-year period. 
The bill would establish a 16 member Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce comprised of 4 Federal representatives (the Secretaries of Commerce, State, Treasury and USTR); 6 representatives of State and local government, as well as 6 representatives of electronic industry and consumer groups, all to be appointed by the Speaker of the House, the House Minority Leader, and the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders. 
The Commission would exist for 18 months to study and develop policy recommendations on the appropriate domestic and international taxation and tariff treatment of transactions using the Internet, Internet access, and other comparable or international sales. The Commission's findings and any legislative recommendations are required to be transmitted to the Congress within 18 months after the bill's enactment. 
The bill also includes a sense of the Congress that there should be no new federal taxes on the Internet; a requirement that electronic commerce be examined as part of USTR's annual trade estimates report; a declaration that the Internet should be free of foreign tariffs and other barriers; and a provision stating that nothing in this bill is intended to affect implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. 
Mr. President, we find ourselves at a critical juncture in the evolution of our economy and our society. The information technology industry, driven by the growth of the Internet, is connecting people and businesses around the world in ways we never dreamed possible. 
At this critical juncture, we are faced with a choice. We can choose to hamper the growth of this vital medium by imposing old ways of thinking that just do not apply. Or we can seek new principles to govern in this new era of ubiquitous access to information, people, products, and services. 
Mr. President, I hope that Congress will take this opportunity to establish new principles and ways of thinking and governing that will allow this vibrant medium to grow and flourish. 
I believe we must embrace three fundamental principles: There must be no piecemeal regulation of the Internet, a medium with interstate and global reach. There must be no discrimination between goods sold over the Internet and goods sold by other means. There must be no tax on the right to access information. 
The vast potential of the Internet can no longer be denied. According to one recently released research report, it took radio almost 40 years to reach 50 million listeners in the United States, while broadcast and cable television took about 13 and 10 years, respectively, to reach that many viewers. The number of Internet users in the U.S. reached 50 million users in just five years. 
By the end of 1998, an estimated 100 million users will be connected worldwide. Some estimate that the Internet will soon reach 500 million users--nearing universal connectivity and access. 
According to a recent Business Week article, online sales are expected to reach nearly $5 billion this year--double that of 1997. From computer software and airplane tickets to cars and investing, people are taking advantage of the Internet in new ways each day. 
Now is not the time to allow complicated and unadministrable taxes to kill the tremendous potential of electronic commerce. 
The Internet is creating tremendous value for business as well as consumers. The innovative use of the internet enables thousands of businesses--big and small--to establish internal networks, or intranets, that link geographically dispersed workers and information within an enterprise. Lockheed Martin and Boeing Aircraft collaborating over an Intranet developed the Darkstar aircraft in 11 months with 50 people, a process that would normally require hundreds of designers and years of work. 
But a business need not be the sizer of a Lockheed Martin or a Boeing to utilize the advantages of the Internet. With the Internet, even small local companies can obtain a global reach that would otherwise have been unthinkable. A small supply company in Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Valley Safety Supply Company, realized a 150 percent increase in revenue when they placed 50 of their items for sale on the Internet. 
Given the tremendous potential of the Internet, I see no reason for partisanship on an issue which is so vitally important to the future of America. I know we are in agreement that we want to see the Internet grow and expand. Everyone, including the experts, is astonished at how quickly the Internet has grown. Literally, every expert who has studied this industry has underestimated the growth that has taken place in the past few years. So it is very likely that they are underestimating the dramatic changes and growth that we will see in the future. 
That is why we need a moratorium on Internet taxation as proposed in the Internet Tax Freedom Act. This bill will allow the various experts from industry and government to sit down and do the difficult work of determining how the Internet is different from other media and under what circumstances it should be taxed. 
The time to act is now. Over the last several months, individuals representing government, consumers, and industry have been working tirelessly to make this a bill that achieves the goal of a temporary moratorium on confusing Internet taxing schemes while preserving the states' rights to continue collecting taxes. Those states that have been collecting Internet access taxes have been specifically grandfathered in the amendment that Senator Wyden and I offer today so they can continue to collect those taxes during the moratorium. 
The Commission created by this bill will address the issues of how the Internet and all remote commerce should be taxed. This Commission will make recommendations to Congress on how best to proceed. By working to create a clear taxing scheme for the Internet, we will continue to set an example for the world on how to nurture this vibrant medium. 
Mr. President, the Internet Tax Freedom Act will allow the Internet to continue to develop and ultimately reach its full potential. Given the importance of this goal to consumers, businesses, and our global economy, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. President, on September 4, we received `An Open Letter To Congress' in support of the Internet tax moratorium legislation. It is paid for by the National Taxpayers Union, American Conservative Union, American Council of the Blind, American Legislative Exchange Council--some 60 organizations.

I thank Senator Dorgan for his continued efforts to reach a compromise on some of the differences we have had, as well as Senator Graham of Florida and Senator Gregg of New Hampshire. We are close to agreement on several issues. I hope we can dispatch this legislation in an orderly fashion without having to go to cloture. It is just not something that we enjoy doing, because it prevents people, over time, from getting the attention to their amendments that they deserve. So I hope we will have an agreement and not have to have a cloture vote, and conclude this legislation as soon as possible. 
Again, I thank Senator Dorgan. I yield the floor knowing that the Senator from Oregon has some important comments. I hope all of us understand as soon as Senator Bumpers gets here we will move to his amendment as quickly as possible. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. 
The proponents of this amendment say it is not a new tax but proper enforcement of an existing sales tax. This is not the case. With a few exceptions, States do not receive sales taxes from out-of-State mail-order businesses, nor can they expect one under current law since this is a tax that has never been collected in the past. 
There is only one way to vote in favor of this amendment. Let's be clear. This amendment represents a very large tax increase on the public. 
Mr. President, this amendment permits states to require out-of-state mail order businesses to collect their sales taxes on purchases made by their residents. The Senate Finance Committee, while reviewing the Internet Tax Freedom Act, determined by a bipartisan vote of 13-6 that the Internet Tax Freedom Act is not an appropriate vehicle for the Senate to act on this measure. I agree with the Finance Committee's assessment, and I know that were my colleague and chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, present, he would object to the consideration of this measure by the Senate without a full review of this issue in committee hearings. 
Make no mistake, this is not simply the collection of a standardized interstate sales tax, as troubling as that would be. There exist thousands of taxing jurisdictions at the state, county, and local level in the U.S. Combined with the different nuances of each of these jurisdictions, mail order businesses will face an administrative nightmare fulfilling their obligations under this amendment. In fact, it is the large number and complexity of different tax codes which now require the Senate to consider a moratorium on taxation of electronic commerce. Certainly we cannot now say that mail-order businesses can or should have to attempt to deal with the same difficulties electronic commerce faces when it comes to sales taxes. 
Mr. President, in addition to representing an administrative burden to industry, this amendment would also place unacceptable burdens on consumers. Mail-order businesses contribute greatly to the quality of life for many Americans. The disabled, the elderly and others rely on mail-order businesses for a variety of products. Should out-of-state mail-order firms be required to collect sales taxes, it is entirely possible that consumers will find themselves having to calculate the proper sales tax to be remitted to the mail-order company. Given the complexity of taxes, it is more than likely that no small number of consumers will find the delivery of their purchases delayed due to insufficient sales tax payments. Not only will this amendment decrease mail order business' ability to cater to these Americans, but it will reduce the convenience of the mail order industry which is at the heart of its success. 
Proponents of this amendment have cited fairness for small businesses as support for passing this amendment. The underlying philosophy is that small businesses cannot compete with tax-free products offered by out-of-state mail-order businesses. Mr. President, small businesses have more to fear from retailers in their own communities, such as K-Mart, Target, and Wal-Mart, than from mail-order businesses, yet small business continues to thrive. Most Americans are not spending their time shopping around for good deals on sales taxes, but they will go to a store two blocks away as opposed to a store a block away if they can get a better price on a product. 
Mr. President, this amendment is not necessary for states to collect sales taxes on out-of-state mail order purchases as some suggest. Many states have adopted use taxes to make up for supposed losses in sales tax revenue on goods purchased out-of-state, which require residents to send in sales taxes on these purchases on their own. Proponents of this amendment say that the public is not aware of these use taxes, and therefore does not pay them. In reality, use taxes have not been effective because many of those states with use taxes are not actively enforcing them. Is this reason enough to place the burden of tax collection for Arkansas on Arizona businesses? Will Arizona businesses be able to take advantage of the sidewalks, roads, or public safety services in Arkansas? If taxing authorities are dissatisfied with their receipts from use taxes, they should work to devise alternative methods for informing the public about their existence. 
Mr. President, the Congress has worked hard to balance the federal budget, and we now have a budget surplus. As a result, Congress is working on a tax cut package the American people have every right to expect. This is not the time to consider new taxes on an American public already being nickel and dimed. Proponents of this amendment say it is not a new tax, but merely the proper enforcement of existing sales taxes. This is not the case. With a few exceptions, states do not receive sales taxes from out-of-state mail-order businesses, nor can they expect to under current law. Since this is a tax that has never been collected in the past, there is only one way to view a vote in favor of this amendment. Let us be clear, this amendment represents a huge tax increase on the public. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this new tax.

Mr. President, tomorrow morning we will start out with a Bumpers amendment which he will be prepared to propound shortly after we convene in the morning. And we expect a couple of other amendments besides that. Also, it is the intention of the leader to file cloture tomorrow morning, as well, on this legislation since we only have a few days remaining in the session. 
We have been working with Senator Dorgan and with Senator Graham of Florida to try to resolve the remaining issues, and with Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution that is of tremendous importance to me and many of my constituents back in Arizona. This resolution expresses the Sense of the Congress that firearm and archery sports are a recognized recreational opportunity for the general public and a legitimate use of public land. The availability of public land for such activities is especially important in western states, such as Arizona, where a very large percentage of the land is public land. 
Mr. President, given that there is little private land in Arizona that is available for such activities, I believe it is crucial that the Forest Service support the continuation of firearm and archery sports on national forest lands. 
Mr. President, the Tucson Rod and Gun Club operated a shooting and archery range in the Coronado National Forest for almost 45 years and had an exemplary safety record during that time. When opened, it was miles from the nearest developed area, but the City of Tucson has spread to the very edge of the forest, and houses and schools are now within a short distance from the existing shooting range. The Club's special use permit was temporarily suspended on March 10, 1997 after a Forest Service report concluded that the range may pose a hazard to the homeowners in the vicinity and to visitors to the Sabino Canyon area. The Club as well as the Congressional delegation has asked the Forest Service to assist in searching for an alternate site for their facility. 
Mr. President, despite assurances by the Secretary of Agriculture and by the Forest Service that the Club's request would be dealt with in an expeditious manner, it is now more than eighteen months since the range was closed, and shooters in Tucson still do not have a reasonably close, organized, and safe place for recreational firearm sports. At the delegation's urging, the Secretary of Agriculture directed the Forest Service to look at the proposed alternative sites and issue a decision on a selected site for these activities by November 1998. The local Forest Supervisor has pledged to issue a final decision in this matter by November 20, 1998, and has further agreed that once this decision is rendered, no further public comments will be solicited, nor will additional environmental analysis be required by the Department of Agriculture or the Forest Service. I expect the Forest Supervisor to abide by this understanding. 
Mr. President, let me make clear that it is not my intent in offering this resolution, to override the Forest Service's normal planning process or existing laws. I know there are others in this body with similar concerns about retaining multiple use policies of the Forest Service. The intent in the resolution is that the Forest Service should support shooting and archery ranges on public land as one of the many public uses of public lands and should strive to find a suitable alternative location for the Tucson Rod and Gun Club.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to praise the Senate for the final passage of S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, and to clarify the legislative history of the bill with the Senator from Texas, who authorized the bill. 
On April 21, 1998, the Senate first adopted S. 414. In her statement providing legislative history for the bill, the Senator from Texas identified a need to resolve the requirement for Federal agencies, including those in the Department of Defense, to ensure U.S.-flag ocean common carrier compliance with cargo preference law requirements concerning shipping rates with the new confidential service contracting regime authorized by S. 414., At that time, my colleague encouraged the Federal Maritime Commission to work with other Federal agencies to address this concern. 
I'd like to ask the Senator from Texas to clarify the ability of the FMC to share confidential service contract rate and service information with other Federal agencies to ensure that U.S.-flag shipping rates for preference cargo shipments meet statutory requirements.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I'd like to thank my colleague from Texas for clarifying this issue. Also, I'd like to complement her on her efforts to protect the interests of the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, and American taxpayers while reforming the ocean liner transportation system in a manner that encourages greater competition. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 is a thoroughly crafted piece of legislation that required hard work by her and many others for more than 3 years. It is a worthy accomplishment for the 106th Congress.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, permit me to quote from the Armed Services Committee's report accompanying the Senate-passed version of the fiscal year 1999 defense authorization bill: 
The Committee views with concern the slow progress of the C-130J program, the increased expense of developing the aircraft . . . and notes the Department's failure to provide a report on the remanufacture of existing C-130 airframes . . . Development costs were initially estimated at $350 million and introduction of the new model forecast to begin in mid-1997 . . . However, it has been estimated that the program has cost more than $900 million and is over two years behind schedule. 
To the objective observer, this language would indicate a certain frustration or disenchantment with the developmental history of the C-130J airlifter. Indeed, cognizant as we are of the Air Force's enormous surplus of C-130s and the fact that, of the 256 such planes funded by Congress since 1978, only five were actually requested by the Air Force, one could reasonably conclude that Congress would not be in a hurry to expend scarce financial resources for additional planes. Yet, that is precisely what we continue to do, every year, to the tune of literally billions of dollars. 
Let me see if I can summarize the situation. We are concerned about enormous cost overruns associated with the C-130J's development and with the degree to which that development has fallen behind schedule. The Air Force has far more C-130s than it needs. So our response is to spend hundreds of millions of dollars per year to purchase more. 
Over the last two weeks, the Senate Armed Services Committee, on which I serve, has devoted considerable time and energy to the issue of military readiness. My office has only recently received the responses of the Armed Forces Chiefs of Staff to a number of questions I had submitted in an effort to ascertain to the extent possible the true state of military preparedness. Indeed, I have for the past six years spent a great deal of time tracking preparedness trends in the military in order that we might prevent the resurgence of the kind of preparedness problems that plagued our armed forces during the 1970s. I warned in the early 1990s that if we continued on our then-current path, the ability of our military to respond to crises and to prevail in the major regional contingencies for which they exist would eventually reach crisis proportions. As the train advanced down the track, those of us who did advance such warnings were categorized as Cold War anachronisms. As the train neared over the past two years, our numbers increased somewhat, but the President and many in Congress continued to ignore the growing problem. And now the train has arrived. 
The United States Armed Forces are the finest in the world. No one would deny that basic fact. The quality of intellectual discourse on the subjects of force posture and military preparedness, however, has been disappointingly shallow. How often, Mr. President, have we heard critics of defense spending argue that the United States spends more on defense than the sum of its potential adversaries combined? Do such individuals honestly believe that the subject lends itself to such simplistic equations? Has history taught them nothing? 
The United States military, alone in the world, is tasked by this country's civilian leadership to be prepared to respond to crises anywhere in the world, on short notice, and with sufficient strength to defeat aggression with a minimal loss of life. No other country bears that burden. 
We have serious problems afflicting our armed forces that six years of presidential rhetoric to the contrary could not deny, although the Administration did its best to ignore it. So how do the committees with oversight of U.S. defense policy react to the current confluence of budgetary restrictions and historically high operational tempos? With the aforementioned C-130s, with a $1.5 billion ship not requested by the Department of Defense, with the continued acquisition of unrequested C-35 passenger jets, with the exasperatingly constant tendency to send hundreds of millions of dollars a year to National Guard units whether it is needed or not, and with the repeated acquisition of rockets and grenade launchers solely because contractors have convinced, with little effort, their congressional representatives to continue the flow of money for unneeded weapon systems. I fully support and encourage the allocation of additional funding to address legitimate readiness concerns, which we have in abundance. The programmatic and highly questionable operations and maintenance expenditures that are included in the lists I am submitting, however, do not qualify. 
It has been said that a million dollars here, and a million dollars there, and pretty soon we're talking real money. The list I am submitting pretty much fits that category. It is composed of hundreds of Member-adds. They range from half-a-million dollars to $94 million, not including the ship and airlifters, which are in a category all their own. The total dollar amount of the list from the defense authorization bill is $4.5 billion. 
The continued practice in the defense appropriations bill of restricting procurement of major weapon system components to United States manufacturers at the expense of more cost-effective options--and, I should point out, at the expense of other U.S. companies that benefit from the cooperative arrangements we maintain with allied countries and are consequently threatened by these `Buy America' provisions--represent a throwback to an earlier time when defense budgets allowed for such congressionally-mandated inefficiencies. Similarly, prohibitions and restrictions on the Department of Defense's ability to manage itself in order to protect hometown contractors and civil servants, such as are included in the appropriations bill are reaching ever-more multifarious levels that would make Rube Goldberg proud. I invite my colleagues to read Section 8071 of the bill for one such example. 
I am also concerned about the precedent set by Section 8125 of the appropriations bill, which intervenes in the relationships between Federal agencies, prime and subcontractors. The ramifications of that effort to benefit specific subcontractors will redound to the Federal government's misfortune in complicated contractual matters involving primes that go out of business, leaving their subcontractors in the lurch. Obviously, we are all sympathetic to those subcontractors' plight, but intervening in bankruptcy proceedings like this provision does is not good government. 
At a time when our declining force structure is stretched virtually to the breaking point; when our most skilled personnel are leaving the service in droves for better paying, less stressful jobs in the private sector; when front-line aircraft are routinely cannibalized so that squadrons may deploy and equipment and personnel are cross-decked to the long-term detriment of both, it is disheartening in the extreme to still witness the scale of unnecessary and wasteful spending represented in these bills. 
The airplane mechanic having to remove parts from one fighter in order to repair another can be excused for not understanding why $5 million is diverted from the defense budget to the public school system in the state of a senior member of the Armed Services Committee. He or she can be excused for not comprehending the mind set that allocates $75,000 for establishment of a State Maritime Academy with no realistic military application. Five million dollars for Agricultural Based Bioremediation and $20 million for the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence--the word `defense' being inserted in the title strictly for propagandistic purposes--and $3 million for research into stainless steel double hull technology, on which private industry is supposed to be spending its own money per the requirements of the Oil Pollution Prevention Act, are just the tip of a very large iceberg. 
Try as I might, I cannot rationalize, with the scale of readiness problems highlighted in yesterday's Armed Services Committee hearing, the expenditure of $64 million for the National Guard Youth Challenge program. In fact, the budget authority earmarked for the Guard and Reserve, once again solely for parochial reasons, continues to represent one of the greatest hemorrhages of defense dollars for low-priority programs in the defense budget. Ten million dollars, Mr. President, to convert a National Guard Armory into a Chicago Military Academy in order to provide a Junior ROTC program is not consistent with national security imperatives that should be driving the process. I have no idea--no idea--why we are earmarking a million dollars for Lewis and Clark. 
Earmarks for specific facilities are out of control. Whether it's the Francis S. Grabeski Airport in New York, the earmark of $2,250,000 from the Operations and Maintenance budget--yes, the very portion of the budget most closely tied to readiness--for the White Sands Missile Range and Fort Bliss, Texas, or the earmarking of $4.6 million for the Montana National Guard Distance Learning Network, such practices illustrate all too well the unwillingness of Congress to translate its rhetoric on readiness problems into constructive action and to cast aside once and for all the business-as-usual approach that is so damaging to our national defense. 
The appropriations bill adds $50 million for the B-2 bomber for continued upgrades. The continued expenditure of millions for upgrades for that formidable fleet of 21 aircraft is particularly disturbing, as the B-2's practical utility scarcely warrants the funding Congress lavishes upon it every year. If it could fly combat air patrols, I would be inclined to be a little more sympathetic. Its' theoretical application to real world contingencies, however, leaves me aghast at the cost of that program. 
Mr. President, my views on parochial-oriented spending remain very much in the minority. That is why we continue to see billions of dollars wasted by Congress to satisfy parochial interests. I will not, however, shy away from continuing to shine a spotlight on these wasteful practices. During a week in which the Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified on the myriad of readiness problems afflicting our armed forces, to ignore the scale of the problem represented in the lists I am submitting for the record would be to fail the men and women who wear the uniform of our Nation. They deserve better. It is a shame they will not receive better.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 7 months ago, three out of the four service chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the President's fiscal year 1999 defense budget was well balanced and that the operating and maintenance accounts and manpower accounts were about correct. 
Yesterday, in a hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee, there was a dramatic reversal of those statements that were made by three of the four Service Chiefs. Yesterday, the Service Chiefs acknowledged that there is a long-term degradation in our ability to fight and win a war and that immediate action, indeed, emergency supplemental funds are called for. 
I am sure that there were a number of factors that contributed to this incredibly candid display yesterday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. I have the utmost respect and regard for every one of the military leaders of our services. But the reality is that this problem has been building for years, not just 7 months. I believe that some of the problems that we are going to have to address in emergency fashion now could have been addressed in a much more measured way if the Joint Chiefs had been more candid in their testimony before the Armed Services Committee and the Congress in the past years, not to mention 7 months ago. 
The preparedness problem within the military is compounded by both the `can do' attitude of the military, which I admire, and the pressure that senior leadership puts on its ranks to not report bad news. Our men and women in uniform have a history of making do, of adjusting to civilian decisions, and working out potential solutions even at the cost of assuming higher risks. But we commit a grave disservice to those very men and women when we fail to provide the resources they need to do their job, and when political considerations prohibit our military leaders from telling Congress and the American people the truth about their ability to execute our National Military Strategy. At yesterday's Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff told us the truth about our declining military readiness--something that has long been apparent to those of us who hear regularly from lower-level officers and enlisted personnel in the field, who risk their careers by making Congress aware of the readiness gaps not acknowledged by their superiors. 
In mid-July, I sent letters to each of the Service Chiefs expressing my concern about the military's overall state of readiness. In order that I might gain a better understanding of current readiness and readiness trends in the military, I asked each Chief to address key readiness issues in his Service, and to provide me with written answers to a series of questions that addressed these problems. I requested that the responses to the questions also include an assessment of National Guard and Reserve readiness. I have now received answers from each of the Chiefs. Their responses are thoughtful and thorough, and I was grateful that they and their staffs took the time to describe in detail our current state of military readiness. 
I have now received answers from each of the Chiefs. Their responses are thoughtful and thorough, and I was grateful they and their staffs took the time to describe in detail our current state of military readiness. 
These responses do not reveal a single reason for the continued degradation of the Services, or a single set of answers as to how these problems can be solved. Each service has a unique mix of readiness problems and has made different trade-offs in efforts to compensate. The data provided by the Service Chiefs clearly demonstrate that both the Executive Branch and the Congress are to blame. They show that the Administration is to blame for underfunding some aspects of readiness at the expense of others, and that Congress is to blame for using readiness for parochial and other special interest projects. Moreover, for two years now, we have turned down pleas by the Secretary of Defense and the President for additional base closure rounds, causing money earmarked for readiness and modernization accounts to be used instead to maintain bases built to sustain a Cold War force structure. The central issue is not, however, who is to blame, but how to reverse these alarming trends. 
The world is a very tough neighborhood and requires a tough cop. As the world's sole superpower, we have no choice but to patrol this beat in order to defend our interests. Safeguarding our security and advancing the cause of freedom may well require us to send young Americans into battle against the enemies of peace. The very least we can do is to make sure that the men and women we send into harm's way are equipped and trained to fight and win. What I greatly fear, though, is that they will be sent less than optimally combat-ready, which leads to the inevitable consequence of casualties that are unnecessary and tragic.  
TODAY'S READINESS CHALLENGES 
In their replies to my letters, the Service Chiefs identified a series of general risks that affect each service, and which both the Administration and the Congress must consider in funding an adequate defense program. 
The Illusion of OPTEMPO. One example is the current effort to maintain high levels of operational activity or OPTEMPO. Our military forces cannot be ready if they do not constantly maintain high levels of training, and there is merit in ensuring that we do not reduce their operational tempo as we cut total force strength and defense spending. However, if such levels are funded at the expense of major overhauls and depot maintenance, of keeping personnel deployed for excessive periods such as our military deployments to Bosnia, Somalia, SOUTHERN WATCH and PROVIDE COMFORT in Southwest Asia, and at the general cost of straining our military forces and our major combat equipment, they trade this year's readiness for going hollow in the future. 
On a given day, one-third of our Navy ships, submarines and squadrons are deployed overseas. In his testimony yesterday morning, Admiral Johnson stated that well over 50 percent of the Navy's surface fleet is deployed around the globe. In 1992, that figure was 37 percent. Of particular concern is the Chief of Naval Operations' comments on the continuing erosion of non-deployed readiness in the sea service. Admiral Johnson writes, 
A decade ago, non-deployed naval units were at the highest states of readiness (C1/C2) nearly 70 percent of the time. Today, that figure is barely 50 percent. Non-deployed readiness has fallen to the point that an intense effort is required by our Sailors to regain a deployable level of readiness, and that peak is being reached closer and closer to deployment. This compression of training and maintenance puts tremendous strain on our people as they struggle to meet commitments, pressure that negatively impacts the personal and professional quality of life of our Sailors. 
The high levels of OPTEMPO reported by each service are no longer a guarantee against going hollow. In fact, to a large degree, the nature of contingencies driving OPTEMPO is the surest guarantee that readiness will degrade. 
Furthermore, time and again, we have learned that our system for measuring readiness is unrealistic and fails to anticipate real-world demands on operating funds. In the past, data that indicated a decline in readiness was considered `merely' anecdotal. 
Increasing Depot Level Backlogs. A tangible indicator of decreasing readiness is the fact that the price of correcting our depot level maintenance backlogs has been rising for the last six years, despite sizable reductions in force structure. That backlog now totals $1.6 billion compared to $420 million in 1991. Similarly, the cost of our backlogs in real property maintenance (RPM) have risen from $3 billion in the mid-1980s to over $10 billion today. 
Underfunding Quality-of-Life. More than anything else, our victory in Desert Storm was a tribute to the men and women in our military--a clear victory for the all-volunteer force. Displaying the `can do' attitude not found anywhere else in the world, our military personnel exhibited an overall level of individual combat performance that had previously been limited to a small portion of our total force. 
At the same time, our economy has prospered, producing historically high levels of employment, resulting in the emergence of a very difficult recruiting and retention environment. Maintaining this top-quality force requires a military personnel system that has the flexibility to react quickly to the dynamics of the civilian market and the leadership and confidence to follow through with critical personnel decisions rather than neglecting them out of fiscal opportunism. However, first, second, and third term enlisted retention, pilot and mid-grade officer retention, and recruiting are all short of goal for each of the Services. 
Recruiting and retaining quality individuals requires pay scales that adjust to meet prevailing rates rather than fall 14 percent behind comparable civilian pay. It requires adequate funding for recruiting. It requires proper promotion rates--not promotion boards that take five months to process reports of promotion boards, as is the case with the Navy. It requires proper living conditions and morale, welfare and recreation services. It requires reasonable tours of duty and a higher quality of civilian leadership and `role models' to deal with matters fairly. It requires a reinstatement of the 50 percent retirement plan and a close examination as to whether the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) or a 401K-type plan has utility in the military pay system. General Reimer writes that 
. . . the retirement package we have offered our soldiers entering the Army since 1986 is inadequate. Having lost 25 percent of its lifetime value as a result of the 1980's reforms, military retirement is no longer our number one retention tool. Our soldiers and families deserve better. We need to send them a strong signal that we haven't forgotten them. 
The military medical health care system, particularly the TRICARE program, has been described by Service Chiefs as falling far short of what is warranted and needed. We cannot ignore the erosion of retirement and health care benefits, and the resultant impact on retention and readiness. General Reimer writes, `The loss in medical benefits when a retiree turns 65 is particularly bothersome to our soldiers who are making career decisions.' From the Service Chiefs' answers, it is highly questionable whether we are meeting any of these requirements. On the contrary, it is clear that there is much work to be done. 
Finally, it is demoralizing to the men and women we send into harm's way, and is incomprehensible to the American people, who expect a well trained and well equipped force, to witness military personnel, up to 25,000, on food stamps. One tax provision that I have tried to reverse this year excludes uniformed men and women in the military from beneficial tax treatment on the profits resulting from the sale of their homes. We order servicemembers to move from place to place, but we do not afford them the same tax treatment as other U.S. citizens. Should this issue have been permitted to exist for so many years? 
Underfunding Manpower Strength. President Clinton's defense budget and National Military Strategy calls for force levels of 1.37 million servicemembers. This is nearly 250,000 less than the Base Force advocated by President Bush. What must be determined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, however, is whether we really have the resources to maintain a force of much over 1 million servicemembers by the year 2000. The end result may be manning levels that are too low to meet our readiness needs and too low to provide effective combat capability. This fact is compounded by the ever increasing number of contingency operations that increase OPTEMPO and PERSTEMPO and put additional stress on our men and women in uniform and the equipment they use. We have to be certain that our force levels are adequate to meet deployments, and that rotations conform properly to overseas commitments. Admiral Johnson stated in his responses to me that `. . . deployed readiness is trending downward, owing mostly to personnel shortages.' The Chief of Staff of the Army had similar concerns. General Reimer has written that: 
The readiness of our Armed Forces is more difficult to understand and more complex to manage today than at any other time in our Nation's history. We have reduced the Total Army by 34 percent--nearly 650,000 Active, Army National Guard, and U.S. Army Reserve soldiers and Department of Army civilians--and have closed over 700 bases worldwide. Meanwhile, the requirements for land forces are greater than ever. In the 40 years prior to 1989, the Army participated in 10 major deployments. Since then, the Army has participated in 29 major deployments--a dramatic increase in operational tempo. 
Manpower Turbulence and Insecurity. According to the Joint Chiefs' responses, each service is experiencing near-record levels of turbulence and insecurity. This is reflected in extended tours of duty, sudden changes of assignment, high rates of relocation, and a series of changes in personnel policies that essentially eliminate the ability of personnel, thereby complicating decisions on whether to stay in the service. 
These problems are compounded in the case of military families. Across each service, extended family separations are the number one reason why enlisted personnel and junior officers are leaving the military. Spouses often lose their jobs with relocations, moves mean significant unexpected expenses, and dependents often have adjustment problems. At the same time, unit and crew continuity is lost, as moves break up well trained, cohesive units, depriving them of much of their readiness. 
Underfunding Base Maintenance and Repair. Ships, aircraft, and weapons systems are kept ready through planned maintenance and modernization programs. Buildings, runways, truck bays, piers, barracks and utilities are equally important assets that must be kept ready through a similar level of commitment and fiscal support. Historically, each of the Services have used infrastructure to pay the bill for other accounts. General Krulak has said, `Our Backlog of Maintenance and Repair will reach $1 billion by FY03 and our plant replacement cycle will grow to nearly two hundred years.' Admiral Johnson writes, `We have mined as much as we can from the infrastructure accounts; we are not at an unacceptable level and QOL in the workplace environment is negatively affecting morale and readiness.' General Reimer's response: `We have been forced to underfund our Base Operations (BASOPS) and Real Property Maintenance (RPM) accounts--84 percent and 58 percent of requirements respectively in Fiscal Year 1999. This level of resourcing has proven insufficient to run our bases in a way that provides our soldiers and families with an adequate quality of life. As a result, our commanders have been forced to divert funds from training accounts in order to maintain their installations.' 
Underfunding Equipment Modernization. Prior to the 1990s, our National Military Strategy and corresponding force structure were oriented overwhelmingly toward the Soviet threat. That emphasis, obviously, is less relevant today. The December 1997 National Defense Panel Report put it this way:  
We must look beyond the challenges for defense and assess the relevance of the National Security Act of 1947 for the next millennium. This framework served us well during the Cold War, but we must objectively reexamine our national security structure if we intend to remain a world leader. It will take wisdom to walk the delicate line that avoids premature decisions and unintended `lock-in' with equipment purchases, operational concepts, and related systems whose effectiveness may quickly erode in a rapidly changing environment. 
Furthermore, comprehensive developmental test and evaluation is expensive and it is tempting to cut corners by reducing resources. Any reduction, however, means a loss of readiness. 
Current critical needs for modernization include funding improved medium troop lift, amphibious lift, amphibious vehicles and fire support for the Marine Corps. They include increasing shipbuilding rates, funding mine warfare, naval fire support, improved interoperability and battle management, and improved fighter/strike aircraft for the Navy. 
They include funding for digitizing the force (Force XXI), information dominance and interoperability, maintaining combat overmatch through increased lethality of ground weapon systems, improved attack and other combat helicopters for the Army. 
Finally, they include funding improved strategic lift, precision guided munitions, bomber force upgrades, air dominance fighter aircraft and space initiatives for the Air Force. 
Underfunding Training and Excessive Reliance on Simulation. We must continue to fund training in order to maintain mission and unit readiness. Critical training includes unit-level operations, the flying hour program, the number of steaming days, combined arms exercises, temporary duty in conjunction with operations, student skills training, and professional development. Better business practices, through the military's Revolution in Business Affairs, and increased usage of simulators are being incorporated as quickly as possible to ensure efficient use of existing training resources. Any reductions to the Services' training accounts cannot be tolerated because they will directly reduce readiness. 
Simulation can be an extremely useful supplement to training, but it cannot replace it. It is tempting, however, to save money on exercises and other high cost training scenarios and increase reliance on simulations even when this produces a significant cut in real world readiness. For example, the Air Force over the past three years has cut pilot flying hours and increased pilot simulation hours by equal amounts. I do not believe the two are interchangeable. Excessive reliance on simulation may produce lower training costs, but it is no substitute for the real thing. 
Underfunding Major Equipment Life Cycles. History has proven that periods of diminishing defense resources inevitably mean that equipment and munitions must be kept in service much longer than the military services originally planned. In General Krulak's letter, he wrote: 
We have reached a critical point in the life cycle of our ground and aviation equipment. We are facing virtual block obsolescence of crucial items. Time needed by our units for training in the field is being spent in the motor pools, hangars, and armories. Our commanders are finding it more and more difficult to train their units because their equipment is `deadlined' or evacuated for repair. Our amphibious assault vehicles (AAVs) are, on average, seven years older than their already extended programmed service life. 
The general goes on to say that two aviation workhorses, the CH-46E and the CH-53D helicopters, are 27 and 30 years old on average, exceeding their projected service lives by many years. Another example of this is the continued practice of the Marine Corps' retreading tires on the humvees (HMMVV's) and five-ton trucks of the First and Second Marine Expeditionary Forces. 
The age of our military equipment, along with high operational tempo, has dramatically increased the cost of equipment maintenance in man-hours and money while dramatically reducing the availability of that equipment for training. Our equipment readiness rates remain high only because of the dedication of our men and women in uniform, who routinely work twelve to sixteen hours per day, six to seven days a week, on overlapping and rotating shifts to maintain this equipment. Unless a concerted effort is made to adjust maintenance and overhaul cycles to provide for service lives, existing readiness standards will continue to drift further towards a hollow force. 
Underfunding Munition Stocks. Each of the Services now tends to meet its munitions goals by redefining the stocks on hand as adequate to meet a shrinking force posture. As Air Force Chief of Staff General Ryan wrote me, `While we lived off the surplus from the 40 percent drawdown of our forces in the early 90s, funding has not matched our need for the last several years.' The net result is smaller stocks of munitions per weapon system, and a failure to purchase the most advanced forms of smart weapons, fuzes, and conventional weapons in the amount required by our National Military Strategy. Admiral Johnson writes, 
I am concerned about the inventory levels of modern weaponry, particularly the Tomahawk Block III missile, and the resultant increased risk in fighting two nearly simultaneous Major Theater Wars (MTW). We have maintained the current level by limiting the fleet's training allowances, with some units only receiving one training missile per year of our costly leading edge weapons, and by significantly reducing funding for development of future weapons. 
In the process, we are risking our industrial base for smart and conventional munitions by reducing orders below a critical threshold or to achieve the production economies which would result from a higher procurement rate. 
Balancing Act of Emerging Technologies. There is a growing tendency to reduce force posture and readiness in anticipation of the introduction of technological innovations like network-centric warfare and interoperability and weapon systems that are not yet in the force structure. This `betting on things to come' trades readiness we have on hand for technology that is still in the bush. Historically, we have never deployed such systems on time, at the estimated cost, or, often, with the anticipated effectiveness. 
However, the risks of such efforts to trade readiness in the near-term for future technologies must be balanced with the statement of General Krulak: 
For the military, this is a time when emerging technologies, if exploited, will fundamentally alter and substantially increase our warfighting capability. To the maximum extent possible, consistent with the imperative for maintaining current readiness, we should leverage these `leap ahead technologies' which promise a warfighting edge well into the next century. We should minimize expenditures on procuring evolutionary technologies and maintaining old systems that do not promise a significant edge on tomorrow's battlefield. 
Funding Operations at the Expense of Readiness. We are already deep in the process of using readiness funds to pay for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. In theory, much of this expenditure will be repaid through supplemental appropriations or out of Department of Defense contingency funds. In practice, it is very unlikely that the services will ever be fully repaid for the cost of their operations, and they will be forced to pay for peacekeeping and humanitarian actions in a way that will affect their readiness. In Bosnia, the Army's actual reimbursement is about 90 cents on the dollar. 
Spending Savings Before We Achieve Them. It is very easy to achieve management efficiencies on paper, and to cut infrastructure or reduce support funding to achieve budget savings. In practice, however, there is an increasing tendency to cut first and determine the practicality of such savings later. On February 10, 1998, General Reimer testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee that  
We have programmed $10.5 billion worth of efficiencies across the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). These efficiencies are based upon better business practices and reform initiatives . . . these are risks associated with this budget.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, may proceed to S. 442, the Internet tax bill, and the motion to proceed then be considered agreed to; and further, at that time the Commerce Committee amendment be adopted, to be followed by the immediate adoption of the Finance Committee amendment. I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment. I finally ask consent that during the pendency of the bill only relevant amendments be in order in addition to a Bumpers amendment in order relating to catalog sales. 
Mr. President, let me clarify, there will be relevant amendments, but there will be a Bumpers amendment that will be in addition which is not a relevant amendment but the Senator from Arkansas wants very much it to be considered at this time.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me also point out that the other side, the Democratic side, has agreed to this after some very difficult negotiations. I appreciate the work especially of the staff on the other side of the aisle for helping us make this be a reality. 
Mr. President, so it is my understanding that after the defense authorization bill is considered tomorrow, we, in the early afternoon, will move to the Internet Tax Freedom Act. There will be a number of relevant amendments. I believe they can be worked out, including the Bumpers amendment. And I believe that we can move forward and resolve this very important bill very rapidly. 
I thank my friends on both sides of the aisle. I understand there are strongly held views. I believe those views will be given the consideration they deserve during the debate on this very important piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in forging a conference agreement which will provide funding for important energy and defense related programs in this year's Energy and Water Appropriations bill. As we will not likely complete all of the individual 13 appropriations bills, I compliment the managers for completing their respective conference bills and reports. 
I did not object to the conference report's passage yesterday by unanimous consent. However, I do take exception to the continuing practice of overloading an important spending bill such as this one with wasteful and unnecessary spending for unrequested, unauthorized or member-interest projects. I examined the Senate bill and report during our consideration earlier this year and counted more than $920 million in earmarks. I am disappointed that the conferees chose not to cut back on this wasteful spending, but rather took the opportunity to indulge and attach even more erroneous earmarks for projects which were not considered by either legislative body. 
Mr. President, I will not dwell on the details, for I have compiled an extensive list of objectionable provisions which clearly reflects an outrageous spending binge by our federal government. This conference report is shamefully overridden with $1.6 billion of pork-barrel spending. Many members will come out of this process as winners with spending for their own special interest projects. Unfortunately, the losers are the American taxpayers who will have to shoulder this fiscal burden. 
The complete list of objectionable provisions is available through my office.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, the Senator from Florida has chosen to object. We just had a vote, 89-6, which probably would have been 94-6. This is not the way the Senate should function, Mr. President--1, or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6 Senators should block this important legislation. We are going to have a motion or a vote on the motion to proceed, and we are going to file cloture and we will begin the 30 hours that will bring us to final conclusion on this vote. 
If the Senator from Florida wants an amendment, we will debate it. If the Senator from Florida wants to change the bill, we will discuss it. But for the Senator from Florida, with one more week to go before we leave, to continue to block consideration of this legislation, I think is clearly thwarting not only the majority of the Senate, but the majority of the American people. His own President was out in the Silicon Valley at a soft money fundraiser bragging about the fact that the Congress will pass the Internet Tax Freedom Act, as he raised $25,000 a plate in a soft money fundraiser. And he took credit for H-1B, which Senator Abraham was primarily responsible for. 
We are growing weary of this. It is time we move forward with this legislation. It is time we save this critical technology, which is absolutely vital to the future of this Nation. 
Mr. President, I want to state my intentions again, after consultation with the majority leader. That is, on Thursday morning, there will be a vote on the motion to proceed. It will be another 89-6 or 94-6 vote. We intend to file cloture at that time, and then we will have cloture on the bill, which will then allow us 30 hours of debate. I might point out that, in this present scenario, 1 hour of debate post-cloture on the motion to proceed is allowed per Senator. We will finish this legislation and go to conference in the House and make sure that we don't choke this baby in the cradle--which is called the Internet--which is vital to the future of the economy of this Nation and the world. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. I heard the objection from the Senator from Florida. I deeply regret that. 
The Senator from Florida, as I understand it, is insisting on a specific result in this legislation. We never do that. The Senator from Florida knows that. We don't insist on a specific result. 
We would be more than happy to listen to the amendment of the Senator from Florida. We would be glad to debate it. Perhaps I could even support it. But, frankly, what the Senator from Florida is doing right here--the other 99 Senators are in agreement--by objecting to us moving forward to the bill that is vital to the future of the economy of this Nation, I think the Senator from Florida takes on a very large responsibility. 
I want to tell the Senator from Florida I am going to file cloture right now and we are going to have a vote. And I also want to tell the Senator from Florida that because of that, we will delay, again, consideration of this very important bill. We will move forward. I do not understand why the Senator from Florida, after having a commitment of mine, that of the Senator from Oregon and everybody else, to give the kind of consideration that he deserves, and ample debate, unlimited debate on his amendment and a willingness to work with him--because the Senator from Florida knows that there is a Senator on this side who cannot agree to the language of the amendment that he is insisting on. That is what debate is all about. 
We just finished a bill, an omnibus aviation bill, where everybody sat down together. The Senator from Oregon was very unhappy with one of the results, as were a number of other Senators, including this one. But we worked the process. 
So I again urge the Senator from Florida to withdraw his objection, especially when faced with the inevitability that this cloture motion is going to be agreed to, probably 99 to 1. 
Mr. President, I ask, again, unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the bill at this time.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Ford in thanking the staff for their contributions: John Raidt, Ann Choiniere, Michael Reynolds, Lloyd Ator, Scott Verstandig, Brad Sabala, and Bill Winter on the Commerce Committee staff; Ivan Schlager, Sam Whitehorn, Jim Drewry, and Becky Kojm with Senator Hollings' staff; Brett Hale and Jeanne Bumpus with Senator Gorton; and David Regan with Senator Ford. Charles Chambers and Tom Zoeller, who are no longer Senate staffers, made efforts in making this legislation happen. Also, Mr. President, because of the scope associated with this bill, we have negotiated with literally every Senator and their staff members on various provisions of this bill, and I thank all of them, also. 
But obviously, Mr. President, I wish to express again my deep and profound appreciation to the Senator from Kentucky for his efforts on this legislation and many, many other aviation bills that have moved through the Senate during my time here. I think it is a very small token that the bill before us is named for him. He deserves that recognition and much, much more. 
Mr. President, Senator Ford has been a Member of the U.S. Senate for 24 years. That is a long time, even in the history of the U.S. Senate. I have had the privilege of working with him for 12. When I first came to the Commerce Committee 12 years ago, I spent a lot of time with Senator Ford then and in the intervening years, especially on aviation issues, because he is regarded, perhaps, as the most knowledgeable Member of the U.S. Senate on those issues. 
Senator Ford is also known--as I think, perhaps, I may be to some extent--as a person who fights fiercely for the principles that he believes in, for what he believes is right as God gave him the right to see it. And he also is a strong advocate for his party. I noted, while looking at his biography this morning--I was scanning it--not only is he a former Governor, but for 6 years he was the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. I know that there are many times when he and his colleagues yearn for those golden days of yesteryear.

Mr. McCAIN. Did you? But Senator Ford has obviously served his party with distinction as well. Around this place you have the opportunity of working with your colleagues on a variety of issues, but I do not believe that I have observed anyone as effective, as single-minded, and as dedicated as the Senator from Kentucky. Yes, we have had fierce differences of opinion which have always been resolved at the end of the day with a smile and a handshake. I have learned from those encounters. I believe one of the great learning experiences of my life was in 1990 when Senator Ford was responsible for a massive restructuring of the aviation system in America. The impact of that will be felt well into the next century. I watched him guide that legislation through all the rocks and shoals of the process around here, and it emerged as a landmark piece of legislation. 
I am proud to have learned from him. I am proud to have worked with him and to be associated with him on a broad variety of various areas. Most of all, I will be pleased many years from now to be able to call him my friend. So I thank him. I look forward to observing that same fierce determination as we do battle with the folks on the other side, to try to maintain this legislation intact as it has been reported out through the Senate. 
As has often been observed, the Senator from Kentucky is not dying, he is just leaving the Senate.

Mr. McCAIN. Until such time as the time has expired or the Senator from New Jersey yields back, at that time, I intend to seek a tabling motion, and that tabling motion would be at the agreement of the two leaders, since it is not clear as to exactly when that vote would be held. So that is my intention. 
Mr. President, I would like to speak on the amendment. 
This amendment to reestablish the Office of Noise Abatement and Control in the EPA is something that I believe is very unnecessary. The language of the proposal is being represented as dealing with noise from all sources. It is clearly targeted at aviation noise. 
I also say to the Senator from New Jersey, I understand the aviation noise problems in his State, as well as neighboring States. 
Mr. President, aviation noise issues involve a careful balancing of many concerns, including technology, safety, airspace management, research and education, and land use. The expertise and necessary center of authority for dealing with these highly interrelated matters has always resided in the FAA. 
Replication of the necessary expertise within the EPA, along with the creation of jurisdictional ambiguities, would not only be wasteful of our limited Federal resources, but would also serve to complicate and confound existing efforts to deal with and better understand community noise concerns. The fact of the matter is that the EPA does not have any expertise in aerodynamics, which is fundamental to addressing aircraft noise issues. 
Mr. President, I think it is important to point out that noisy Stage 2 aircraft are currently being phased out. The FAA estimates that by the year 2000, the population exposed to significant aircraft noise will be approximately 600,000. That is a dramatic decrease from the more than 4.5 million just 8 years ago. It is clear that current noise mitigation efforts have significantly reduced the exposure of a great many people to aircraft noise. We should allow this substantive work to continue without any interference. 
Reestablishing the Office of Noise Abatement and Control strikes me as a needless return to big government. The last thing I think we need to be doing now is funding, even with a budget surplus, another bureaucratic office, especially when the underlying concerns are already being addressed. 
Mr. President, the FAA News, i.e., the press release that was issued on September 9, says:  
Aircraft Noise Levels Continue to Decline, Secretary Slater Announces. 
It goes on to say: 
With the continued removal of noisier aircraft and the introduction of quieter airplanes to the U.S. fleet, approximately 80 percent of airplanes operating in the United States today are the quieter Stage 3 aircraft, Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater reported today. * * * * * * 
This is the sixth consecutive year that the aircraft fleet has been ahead of the requirement to transition to a quieter aircraft. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 requires that all airplanes meet quieter Stage 3 noise levels by the year 2000. 
I might add that that legislation was a direct result of the efforts of the Senator from Kentucky. 
Secretary Slater's report to Congress shows that operators surpassed the Dec. 31 interim compliance requirement. Operators either had to reduce noisier Stage 2 airplanes by 50 percent or have 65 percent of the quieter Stage 3 airplanes in their fleets. Just this past year, 225 noisier Stage 2 aircraft have been removed from service while 554 quieter Stage 3 aircraft have entered service in the United States.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are making progress, a lot of it due to the exhaustive efforts of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee under the leadership of Senator Ford. We are making progress. It is exceeding the goals that everyone agreed were reasonable at the time we passed the act in 1990. I strongly recommend that we do not set up or reestablish another bureaucracy to address a problem which, although is still in existence, clearly is being addressed in a manner which exceeds our expectations. 
Again, I have great sympathy for the Senator from New Jersey and the people who live in these air corridors where there is exceedingly high noise levels. My message to them is: Help is not only on the way but it has been on the way for some years now. In fact, for the sixth consecutive year noise levels have been reduced. I know that is of small consolation to some, but over time we will have much quieter communities in New Jersey, as well as Arizona, Kentucky, and every other State in America. 
As I said before, Mr. President, I intend to move to table the amendment, either at the expiration of all time or the yielding back of time before the vote. I tell my colleagues, I will let them know as soon as possible, because the two leaders would have to consult on the time of that vote. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very appreciative of and I believe sympathetic to the concerns of the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli. There are very large noise issues in his State and in States surrounding his. I just think it is important for us to recognize that noise levels have decreased by some 80 percent around America. We are moving to Stage 3 aircraft. We do not need to reestablish another bureaucracy. I am confident in the FAA in that the provisions of the 1990 act, which Senator Ford was responsible for, are being carried out in an accelerated fashion. I pledge to the Senator from New Jersey that if there is not continued progress, I would be more than happy to revisit this issue with him.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me say that what the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, has described today is a signal event. I recently visited Silicon Valley, which politicians seem to be doing more and more of nowadays. I was told that there were two major priorities that they felt were critical to the future of their industry. One was this, what we know now as the H-1B visa bill, and the other is the Internet tax freedom bill. 
Senator Abraham took an issue, which very few believed we could, and turned it into reality. He worked with both sides of the aisle, with the White House, and with the Silicon Valley folks, as well as labor. I believe that he has come up with a remarkable package, a remarkable product, which will allow us to maintain the incredible high-tech lead we have in the world. Without the ability to have trained, qualified and educated people in this industry, obviously we cannot have as predictable a future as we would like. 
A part of this bill, Mr. President, will be the National Science Foundation Scholarship Program for Science and Math. At the appropriate time, I will offer language to name these scholarships the `Spencer Abraham Scholarship Program.' 
Again, I congratulate Senator Abraham, because what he has achieved in this time of labeling the Congress as a `do-nothing Congress,' very frankly, is the best example of working on both sides of the aisle and with the administration for the good of the Nation. I hope that many of the rest of us, including this Senator, will follow his example. 
I also hope we will be able to take up the Internet Tax Freedom Act so that we can also get that legislation passed before we leave. 
I note the presence of Senator Dorgan on the floor. I thank him for his patience. I yield the floor. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I, of course, respect very much the views expressed by Senators Frist and Inhofe, both of whom are pilots. The FAA has objected to this amendment. I believe it goes too far. I understand Senator Inhofe's concerns. They were voiced a couple of years ago on a similar measure when we were doing another bill, the aviation bill. The fact is, we need to address this issue. 
I believe this goes too far. I look forward to working with Senator Inhofe and Senator Frist on it, but I am very hesitant to take a measure which could, at the end of the day, possibly endanger safety. That is why I have to oppose this amendment at this time.

But I think we have always to keep safety as the paramount concern, and I believe this amendment possibly--I am not saying absolutely--but possibly could endanger the FAA's ability to carry out their primary responsibilities. 
I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his deep involvement in this and other aviation issues. I look forward to working with him in addressing what is clearly a problem.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also want to add my words of appreciation to the Senator from North Dakota. It seems that he and I are destined to spend a lot of time together, especially since we are going to take up the Internet Tax Freedom Act here soon. He and I will be having a vigorous discussion on that. 
I want to point out something again that I pointed out three times. Deregulation of the airlines is a wonderful and marvelous thing and has done great things for America. But when we have a situation where the State of the Senator from North Dakota is shut down because of one airline going on strike, obviously, we have to look at this whole environment of competition. Mr. President, it is not right; it is not right when an entire region of the country is dependent upon one airline. That is true, perhaps to a lesser degree, for other regions in the country. The concerns of the Senator from North Dakota, not only affecting his own State but the entire Nation, include the dramatic disparity, according to GAO, of airfares and where there is hub concentration and competition, which is clearly something that is indisputable. 
So it seems to me that the Senator from Washington, chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, and I, and others should devote a lot of attention to this issue, as to whether there is true competition and whether people in rural areas and in smaller markets in America are being deprived as a penalty because of where they live. So I want to tell the Senator from North Dakota again, I want to work with him and with the distinguished Senator from Washington, and other members of the committee, next year as we address this issue. 
I am afraid, Mr. President, that concentration is increasing rather than decreasing. That trend can only be reversed when we get new entrants into the airline business. I am very disappointed at some of the information--much of it anecdotal--that I hear of the major airlines basically preventing that competition from beginning, or even existing, for a long period of time. 
I thank the Senator from North Dakota and I look forward to more work with him on this issue and other issues, such as Internet tax freedom. 
I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.

Now, these distortions have to be fixed because we are penalizing Americans who don't have access to major hubs. That is not fair to the American citizens. I know that the Senator from North Dakota will not give up on this particular issue.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate both Senators from Maryland who have been steadfast and tenacious in their efforts to further not only improve BWI but also Washington National and Dulles Airports. 
Senator Sarbanes I think has a very important amendment. Noise abatement is a very serious issue. I am glad to say that at least partially due to his efforts, BWI has made significant improvements. Unfortunately, that has not been the case with Reagan National Airport, which is interesting. That is one of the things that Senator Sarbanes is trying to do with this amendment, and is doing at all airports in the Washington metropolitan area under the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority's work on noise compatibility, planning, and programs. 
I think this is an excellent amendment. I thank the Senator for the amendment. We obviously support it. But I know the Senator has other amendments. 
I want to additionally state that I understand how difficult some of these issues are for the Senators from Maryland, especially Senator Sarbanes who has been involved with these airports for many, many years. I think Senator Sarbanes was involved with these airports when Dulles was viewed as a white elephant, and now certainly it is a very busy airport. 
I was pleased--and I know Senator Sarbanes was--the other day to see an article in the Washington Post that says business at BWI is at an all-time high. It has turned into an outstanding facility. 
I thank Senator Sarbanes not only for his amendment but the following amendments in his efforts to help the Metropolitan Airports Authority, the districts, and his willingness to work with us on what is a very contentious issue amongst his constituents. I thank him for it. 
Mr. President, I believe there is no more debate on this amendment.

I understand that concern and that commitment, and I think it is not only appropriate but laudable. I assure both Senators, my commitment to them and their citizens is we will do everything we can to see that there is not an increase in noise in the neighborhoods surrounding these airports. If we renege on that commitment, I will be glad to come back and revisit this issue. If there is an increase of noise pollution of any kind, I want to tell my two dear friends that I will come back, revisit this issue, so that we can repair any damage that is inflicted on the people of the State of Virginia--and Maryland as well, I might add. Maryland as well. 
Both Senators from Virginia have been staunch opponents. They have done remarkable things in preventing even this very modest--let's be realistic here--this is very modest. When we are talking about a total of six round-trip flights a day, it is not a huge increase. But they have done a great job, and I commit to them, finally, we will be glad to revisit this issue if problems arise as a result of this legislation. 
Also, we can put all the blame on Senator Ford because he will no longer be with us at that time.

There were two very different positions here and strongly held views. I believe this is what our work here in the Senate is all about. The Senator from Washington, in his responsibilities as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, has preserved some fundamental principles here, and I also think the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has taken a major step forward concerning children. For the first time, now children will be ranked along with everybody else in compensation and in the case of tragedy. I believe that the people who have fallen victim to these terrible aircraft tragedies owe a great debt of gratitude to Senator Specter for what he did tonight. There is now some hope for them for some reasonable compensation. We all know that there is no compensation for the loss of a life. But there are certainly ways that we can make their lives better and give them a chance to have a decent future. 
I thank Senator Specter for what he did here tonight. I also want to thank Senator Gorton, who fundamentally protected principles that he has adhered to for a long period of time. 
I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.

He understands as well as I do, with just a few days remaining, that if we didn't have some kind of agreement, which I do believe we will agree to, on circumscribing the number of amendments to the bill, then it would be very difficult to get it done in a short period of time. I am not going to pursue this issue. Again, I spent too many hundreds of hours working with the Senator from Kentucky for us to end up in some disagreement over an issue such as this before completion of the bill that is called the Wendell H. Ford legislation, which is very fittingly named after him as the reality is that there is no Member of the Senate who has done more to further the cause of aviation in America than the Senator from Kentucky. 
So, Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there will be a vote tomorrow morning at approximately 9:50 a.m. on passage of the FAA reauthorization bill.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1998 to help build a national wireless communications system and save lives. I would like to thank Senator Burns for co-sponsoring this important legislation with me, and I look forward to working with him to move this legislation forward during the remainder of the Congress and the next Congress. 
Mr. President, when a person is seriously injured, in a car crash or a violent crime or in some other way, every minute counts. Medical trauma and public safety professionals speak of the `golden hour'--the first hour after serious injury when the greatest percentage of patient lives can be saved. The quicker that person gets medical help, the greater the chances of survival. 
We would like people to be able to get medical help as fast as possible after serious injury. As a practical matter, it takes time--often a half-hour in an urban area or an hour in a rural area--before an ambulance completes the job of getting to the scene of an accident and transporting the injured to a medical facility, where doctors can go to work saving the injured person. This bill is designed to help cut down that medical response time for millions of Americans, by helping to make sure that people can use their wireless telephones to call 9-1-1 immediately to get the ambulances rolling. 
More than 60 million Americans carry wireless telephones. Many people carry them for safety reasons. People count on those phones to be their lifelines in emergencies. A parent driving down an interstate highway with children in the back seat draws comfort from knowing that if the car is involved in a crash, he or she can call 9-1-1 for help and an ambulance will be rolling in seconds. An older American driving alone on a long trip feels more comfortable knowing that if an accident occurs or sudden illness strikes, he or she can use the wireless phone to dial 9-1-1 for help and the state police will be on the way. 
But there's a big problem. In many parts of our country, when the frantic parent or the suddenly disabled older person punches 9-1-1 on the wireless phone, nothing happens. In many areas of the country, 9-1-1 is not the 
emergency number, or there simply is no wireless telephone service at all. If a wireless telephone isn't within range of a wireless tower, a wireless call can't go through. The ambulance and the police won't be coming. You may be facing a terrible emergency, but you're on your own. 
The same problem arises even if an emergency occurs within range of a wireless tower, if a person is too injured to make a 9-1-1 call, or can make the call but cannot give his or her location. 
Mr. President, this bill can be called the 9-1-1 bill--its main purposes are to expand the areas covered by wireless telephone service so that more people in more places can call 9-1-1 systems so that they can deliver more information, like location and automatic crash notification data. The bill is designed to tie our citizens through their wireless telephones to the medical centers, police, and firefighters who can help them in emergencies. 
The bill has four main elements. 
First, it makes 9-1-1 the universal emergency telephone number. I suspect that most Americans think that 9-1-1 already is the emergency number everywhere, but it isn't. There are many places in America where, even if you can get a telephone connection, 9-1-1 isn't the right number to call for help. This legislation will reduce the danger of not knowing what number to call. The rule in America ought to be uniform and simple--if you have an emergency, wherever you are, dial 9-1-1. The bill sets a national policy for us all to pursue together, but, instead of imposing a federal mandate for executing that policy, allows the states and localities to decide how best to further that policy in their areas. 
The second key element of the bill is a system of grants to assist the states and local governments in developing, coordinating, and carrying out their plans to make wireless service available to more citizens and to upgrade their 9-1-1 systems so they can provide the location of wireless callers. The bill gives the states maximum flexibility in designing their plans to qualify for the grants. It is written carefully so that it is not a federal mandate, and we will not have federal bureaucrats micro-managing wireless telephone companies, state and local public safety programs, or hospital emergency rooms. 
The people who run our nation's 9-1-1 systems, and increasingly the elected officials who employ them, know they have a growing challenge in this area. More and more Americans are using wireless telephones to communicate, and there are over 83,000 wireless emergency calls a day now. But the technology receiving those calls is often outdated, and new local technology needs to be implemented. By offering substantial federal grants funded from the fees the government receives from wireless carriers who place their towers on federal land, the bill encourages the states to bring the stakeholders together to make the decisions necessary to deploy these life-saving technologies. The implementation problems here are not technological; they are financial and legislative. This bill will provide federal support, but the key leadership and decisions will come from state and local officials. 
The the third key element of the bill is research and development of new lifesaving technology for motor vehicles. Proper medical care could be dispatched almost immediately if a car that was involved in a crash automatically signaled to public safety officials that the car had crashed, where it had crashed, and how bad the crash was. The trauma experts tell us they can predict the kinds of injuries a victim has this crash data--so they will know whether to send a helicopter, an advanced care ambulance, or just a wrecker and a ride home. We can use wireless technology to make these automatic reports. This bill will authorize the necessary investments to develop the know-how to tie together our cars, our public safety officials, and our hospitals for rapid response in vehicles emergencies 
The fourth key element of this legislation is using federal property to help expand the wireless network. Current law and Administration policy say that federal agencies should encourage wireless facilities on federal property so as to expand the availability of wireless service, but agencies have been slow to open up their land and buildings. This bill will establish a clear and enforceable policy of allowing wireless facilities on federal property when it doesn't interfere with the agency's mission or use of the property. The agency will be allowed to charge fees for the use of the property, and those fees will go into a fund that will pay for grants to states and crash-notification investments under the bill. 
It is also important to note what this bill does not do. It does not affect in any way the ability of state or local governments to impose taxes or fees on any business. It does not preempt in any way the current power of state and local government regarding antenna siting over property under their authority. And, indeed, it provides an explicit statutory requirement of notice and comment for state and local officials on siting applications for use of federal property. These three changes I made from earlier drafts resolve some of the concerns that were raised by some leaders of local and county governments. 
Some organizations sought additional changes to the legislation. 
The Department of the Interior, for example, wanted to change the provision on judicial review of federal agency denials of requests for access to federal property so that the burden of proof in court would be on the person challenging the agency's decision not to grant the requested access. This bill instead adopts the standard used in the Freedom of Information Act, which puts on the agency the burden of sustaining its action. Since the agency has superior access to all the relevant information, it is appropriate for the agency to bear the burden of going forward with evidence and persuading the court of the correctness of the agency's decision. 
Also, some have suggested that the bill should be changed so that the sate and local law would apply to the citing of wireless antennas on federal property. That would be inconsistent with current law and run counter to the basis purpose of this legislation. To allow state and local officials to extend state and local zoning laws to the placement of antennas on federal property would give states and localities an unprecedented ability to control decisions by federal officials with respect to federal property, and reduce the revenue generated by the federal leases or antenna siting. We simply cannot have a situation in which a locality could be allowed to hold the interests of the region or the country hostage to parochial interests. The requirement in my legislation that state and local officials have notice and an opportunity to comment with respect to requests for antenna siting on federal property gives state and local officials their appropriate role. They will have the opportunity to present their views, but will not have a veto over placement of antennas on federal property. It is important to remember what is at issue here--the ability of people to call for help in emergencies and get a prompt public safety response--in short, save lives. 
This legislation has been developed in consultation with a wide range of groups that have great expertise in the subjects covered by the legislation, including state and local officials who run our nation's 9-1-1 systems, trauma experts, the American Automobile Association, the wireless industry and others. The bill has the strong support of a diverse coalition that includes these and many other groups. To the extent that some groups have concerns about a few of he bill's provisions, I intend to continue to work with them to try to address these concerns. 
Mr. President, this bill is an important step forward to helping state and local emergency agencies do their jobs, offering them significant grants to improve their capabilities. This bill also will go a long way toward helping the nation expand its wireless network. It will help make sure that Americans everywhere can dial 9-1-1 to summon prompt assistance in an emergency. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee on this important life-saving legislation, an I urge all my colleague to support it.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are back on the FAA authorization bill. We have a number of amendments that will require debate and votes. We also are working to resolve a number of them. I want to say to my colleagues that I don't know what the leaders on both sides intend to do this evening, but the Senator from Kentucky and I intend to try to get rid of all amendments by this evening. If we are unable to have Members come over here to propose amendments, then, obviously, we have no choice but to move forward on the legislation. We have a number of amendments: A Dorgan amendment, a Mikulski-Sarbanes amendment, a Torricelli amendment, a Robb amendment, a Domenici amendment, and others that are on the unanimous-consent agreement. I hope that those Senators will come over and offer the amendments and stand ready to debate them and vote on them. 
I yield the floor.

A managers' amendment; McCain-Wyden amendment extending length of moratorium; Coats, Internet porn, 1 hour equally divided; Bennett amendment, relevant; Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison amendment, relevant; Bond amendment, relevant; Bumpers amendment, mail order; three Enzi relevant amendments; Domenici, an amendment on interest rates; Graham, relevant; Abraham, Government paperwork; and Bumpers, a commission amendment. 
I further ask unanimous consent that relevant second-degree amendments be in order to all amendments other than the Coats amendment. 
I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 hours of general debate equally divided on the bill. I finally ask that following the disposition of the above-listed amendments and the expiration of time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill with no other intervening action or debate.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just point out that I think the Democratic leader makes a very legitimate point. Obviously, he believes there are very important issues that need to be addressed. The Patients' Bill of Rights is a very important issue. But let me also point out, Mr. President, that we have been working on this legislation for 2 years. All of Silicon Valley, especially the State of Massachusetts as well as other places where high tech is a very important part of the economy of the various States and the Nation, want this bill done. 
Senator Wyden, who is the originator of this bill, and I, along with many others, have worked very hard for a long period of time. We have made concession after concession; we have made compromise after compromise on this bill, including having the Finance Committee play a major role in it. All I hope is that on the Democrat side we can get some agreement to address the Patients' Bill of Rights, and I also ask that we make every effort to get this bill up and passed. We have approximately 11, 12 remaining legislative days, as I understand it. 
I respect and understand the objection of the Democratic leader. I hope we can get this issue resolved, up and passed so that we can ensure the future of perhaps one of the most important and vital parts of America's economy.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oregon, he is too kind in his remarks. The fact is that this legislation was originated by the Senator from Oregon. I have been glad to assist and help in that effort. He has done the heavy lifting. I appreciate his kind remarks. 
I assure him that in discussions with the Democratic leader, with Senator Dorgan and others, I am confident that we will get this bill up and done in the next few days. I thank him for all of his efforts. 
The Senator from North Dakota mentioned the difficulties in North Dakota. North Dakota has gotten more than its share of natural disasters this year, including one man-made in the form of an airline strike that was very damaging to the economy of his State. I certainly believe that all of us are in sympathy with the agriculture crisis in America. 
Mr. President, I have been awaiting the presence of Senator Ford, who is going to manage on the other side. I am a bit reluctant to move forward, so I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business for 5 minutes.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in the already strife-torn region of the former Yugoslavia, the new year of 1998 was initiated with a new declaration of war. A then-small group of pro-independence rebels calling themselves the Kosovo Liberation Army announced its intention to fight for the independence of the Kosovo region of what remains of Yugoslavia. With the wounds from Bosnia still festering and U.S. and allied troops seemingly locked-into an intractable peacekeeping operation with no end in sight, Europe and the United States once again found themselves with a serious dilemma involving life and death decisions. The subsequent nine months of conflict in the Albanian majority province of Serbia have illuminated the degree to which the enlightened nations of the West continue to wrestle with the most fundamental tenets of conflict prevention and resolution. The results are not impressive. 
We have not lacked for rhetoric, but we have proven woefully inadequate at backing up our words with resolute action. Relatively early in the conflict, but long after the gravity of the situation was apparent, Secretary of State Albright warned that Serbia would `pay a price' for its characteristically scorched-earth military campaign against the KLA and its ethnic Albanian supporters. `We are not going to stand by and watch . . .,' she declared, while `. . . Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away with doing in Bosnia.' 
During the June meeting in Luxembourg of the European Union foreign ministers, Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was quoted as stating, `Modern Europe will not tolerate the full might of an army being used against civilian centers.' A few days later, as reported by the Washington Post, 
Yugoslavia's reply to threats of NATO airstrikes could be heard for miles around. The nightly bombardment of border villages occupied by rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army has unleashed a flood of tens of thousands of refugees. Caught in the cross-fire, they have seen their homes shelled, then torched by government forces in what other nations and international organizations have denounced as `ethnic cleansing'. 
The next day, NATO fighter jets streaked across Albanian skies in a show of force that was less than the sum of its parts. `I'm very glad,' one Albanian said, `because it shows that [NATO is] for the liberation of Kosovo.' In less time than it took our fighters to land at Aviano, though, U.S. and allied credibility had descended to new depths, and the victims of Serb aggression were once again lulled into a false sense of security. United States foreign policy in the Balkans has once again been shattered by the reality of a dictatorial regime adept at manipulating the anemic diplomatic process that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths in Bosnia and has now left Kosovo in ruins. 
By conducting that aerial show of force back in June without following-through, and by repeatedly allowing the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to employ his tactics from Bosnia of professing compliance with United Nations demands one day only to return to his policy of ethnic cleansing the next, the United Nations has failed to accomplish the overriding goal for which it was created: the resolution of conflict so that the crimes of the past would not be repeated in the future. Mr. President, the scale of human tragedy before us cries out for a European response that it has heretofore been unwilling to countenance. 
There is no question that Russian and Chinese opposition to Security Council resolutions authorizing the use of force to compel Serb compliance has been a serious, and tragic, obstacle to the kind of resolute response circumstances demand. It is also inarguably difficult to castigate the United Nations while simultaneously insisting that United States and NATO policy should not be subordinate to the dictates of the U.N. with regard to a conflict so central to European stability. As is often the case in international relations these days, we do not enjoy the luxury of the level of clarity prevalent during the Cold War when Europe was firmly and evenly divided between competing centers of power. 
Europe must take responsibility for the security of the Balkins. The United States cannot and should not be vested with responsibility for maintaining security in the Balkins in perpetuity. Putting aside for a moment the utter inability of the current Administration to articulate and implement a sound policy with regard to Kosovo, both the United States and Europe must come to terms once and for all with the central imperative of supporting diplomacy with force. 
Right now, the Serbs are conducting a major offensive against the remnants of the KLA. In fact, this latest offensive cannot truthfully be characterized as counterinsurgency in nature; the cold, hard fact is, as with Bosnia before it, the Serb nation is carrying out the very type of brutal, inhumane ethnic cleansing for which it was universally criticized prior to the Dayton Accords. As with Bosnia, a strong, meaningful--and I emphasize `meaningful'--employment of military power against Serb military forces and associated infrastructure at the outset could have prevented the scale of devastation that has subsequently transpired. Will Europe learn? If history is a guide, the lessons for other peoples subject to domination by stronger neighbors are not positive. 
Our former majority leader, Bob Dole, upon returning from 
Kosovo, stated that `American and European leaders have pledged not to allow the crimes against humanity which we witnessed in Bosnia to occur in Kosovo. But from what I have seen, such crimes are already happening.' 
Mr. President, prominently displayed in the United Nations building in New York is Picasso's famous and haunting `Guernica.' That painting symbolized for the artist the carnage, the human suffering on an enormous scale, that resulted from the Spanish Civil War--a prelude to the Second World War. Perhaps it is too abstract for those countries in the United Nations that oppose the use of force to stop the atrocities that have come to symbolize the former Yugoslavia, or that believe the war in Kosovo is the internal business of Serbia. A few minutes away from here is a reminder of what happens when Edmund Burke's adage that `all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing' is ignored. 
Ethnic cleansing is not an abstract concept in the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Technology has advanced to wondrous degrees during this century, but the basic nature of man remains the same. He is capable of great good; he is just as equally capable of the kind of actions that have made places like Auschwitz, Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, the Gulag Archipelego, and Nanking synonymous with sorrow. To this list, will we have to add Kosovo? The situation is clearly not at that stage, but the onset of winter could change that very quickly, with implications that I don't want my small children to have to read about in their history books with shame. 
The Europeans have never been very adept at maintaining peace within and between their boundaries. It is instructive that the longest single period of peace the continent has experienced was during the Cold War when the United States stationed over 300,000 troops there. That troop strength has since been reduced by two-thirds, and the stabilizing aspects of the bipolar structure are gone. The turbulence of the post-Cold War world demands a level of competence on the part of those entrusted with our national security and foreign policy that is sadly lacking. The history of the conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo are histories of threats not carried out and of the strong being outmaneuvered by the weaker. This Administration's conduct of diplomacy with regard to Serbia, North Korea and Iraq is somewhat akin to what would happen if Thucydides' Melian Dialogue were reversed, and the weak were dictating terms to the strong. 
But the stakes here are real. The situation in Kosovo is potentially more dangerous than was the case in Bosnia. The KLA's professed long-term goal of uniting the Albanian populations of Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania into a greater Albania cannot be ignored. The conduct of Serbia's campaign against the insurgents similarly holds the potential for spreading beyond the confines of that beleaguered province. We cannot afford the level of diplomatic ineptitude that has been prevalent with regard to the former Yugoslavia since 1992. 
The United Nations' stagnation as an instrument of conflict resolution during the Cold War was, to an extent, understandable. Its failure in the Balkans, however, is a very bad omen indeed for its ability to perform its most essential core task. The Clinton Administration's inability to comprehend the limitations of that body--the U.N. is, after all, comprised of nations and not of ideals--do not augur well for the protection of United States security interests abroad. NATO, meanwhile, continues its contingency planning with a range of military options, but anything less than truly decisive force that makes the regime in Belgrade fear for its survival will leave us with a battle yet to be fought, just as it has in Iraq. A token number of cruise missiles will cost a lot of money, but will not accomplish our goals. Missing is a strategy for ending the conflict, vice compelling President Milosevic to agree to talk about negotiations. The employment of military force must be sufficient to destroy the internal power structure that sustains those prosecuting crimes against humanity. In short, NATO must either be prepared to do what militaries are trained to do, prevail, or it will reap limited gains of short duration. 
Mr. President, people are dying. Prevarication, the modus operandi of this administration when decisive actions are required, carries a price in lives. The world will look to this body for a glimpse of the level of U.S. resolve, seeing little in the White House. That is a burden we must face with the grace and dignity and moral fortitude that comes from representing the citizens of the greatest country in history. It is a burden that carries with it implications that none should take lightly. Not just in Kosovo but elsewhere where our interests are threatened, the world must know that the United States will stand firm and will not follow the path that leads to the inclusion of more places in the list of sorrow. 
Mr. President, last night I was at a function here in Washington. All of us who are Members of the Senate attend many functions, many of them nightly. This was kind of a special evening, at least for many of us, and that is because we honored Senator Bob Dole, our former majority leader of the Senate and former nominee of our party for President of the United States. 
Bob Dole gave a moving, persuasive and compelling speech, probably the likes of which I have never heard him give in the many years I have been a friend and a compatriot of Senator Dole.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Dole spoke about the crisis in Kosovo. We all know that with the ongoing scandal in our Nation's Capital, many of our important national security issues are being ignored, whether it be Iraq or Korea or the Middle East peace process. But Bob Dole focused the attention and riveted the attention of the audience last night, as he did in a recent op-ed piece in the Washington Post, on this terrible situation that exists today and the impending terrible tragedies that will ensue in Kosovo with the onset of winter. 
Bob Dole pointed out that literally hundreds of thousands of people of Albanian nationality are in the mountains around Kosovo. These people will freeze to death, they will starve to death, and they will die by the thousands and thousands if something isn't done and done quickly. 
Bob Dole's speech and his commitment on this issue should serve as a compelling call to this administration to act--to act--on Kosovo in consultation with the Congress of the United States and the American people. 
Six months ago, the Secretary of State of the United States of America stated we will not allow the Serbs to do in Kosovo what we have prevented them from doing in Bosnia, and exactly what we prevented in Bosnia is taking place in Kosovo at the cost of possibly hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, since Senator Ford is not here yet, I will not ask for a unanimous consent agreement because I believe he would object at this time. But what I do want to do is go over the pending amendments, as I know what they are, and urge my colleagues to call in within the next half hour or come over with any amendments they may have to this bill so that we can get a unanimous consent agreement narrowed down on the amendments to the bill. 
The amendments that I now understand would be pending are: McCain-Ford amendment, which is a managers' amendment, which is 10 minutes equally divided; a McCain amendment, which is relevant, 5 minutes equally divided; a Hollings amendment, relevant, 5 minutes equally divided; a Gorton, relevant amendment, 5 minutes equally divided; a Ford amendment, relevant, 5 minutes equally divided; a Bingaman amendment, overflights, bolster Native Americans' role, 30 minutes equally divided; DeWine sense of Senate, 10 minutes equally divided; Dorgan, regional jet tax incentives, 2 hours equally divided; Dorgan, mandatory interline and joint fair agreements, 2 hours equally divided; Faircloth, sense of the Senate, 5 minutes equally divided; Inhofe, FAA emergency revocation power, 10 minutes equally divided; Mikulski-Sarbanes--two amendments--Reagan National Airport, slots and perimeter rule, 30 minutes equally divided; Roth, reintroduce title VIII to the bill, 5 minutes equally divided; Thompson, criminal penalties for airmen who fly without a certificate, 10 minutes equally divided; Torricelli, Quiet Communities Act, S. 951, 1 hour equally divided; D'Amato-Moynihan, DOT issue 70 slot exemptions at JFK Airport, 10 minutes equally divided; Lott-Frist-Moynihan, limit eligible airport size for regional jet section and Reagan National commuter slots, 10 minutes equally divided; Reed of Rhode Island, noise at Rhode Island airport, 15 minutes equally divided; Reed of Rhode Island, cost-sharing notice, 15 minutes equally divided; Robb, Reagan National Airport, slots and perimeter rule, 1 hour equally divided; Snowe, handicapped access violations, increase civil penalty, 10 minutes equally divided; Snowe, community air service grants, regional distribution, 10 minutes equally divided; Warner, prohibit new Reagan National slots and perimeter rule exemptions until Washington Metropolitan Airport Authority nominees confirmed by the Senate, 1 hour equally divided; Warner, notice, comment, and hearings before proceeding with Reagan National slots and perimeter rule exemptions. 
If there are additional amendments to the bill, I would urge my colleagues to send them over so that sometime within the next hour we could try to initially propose a unanimous consent agreement at least to narrow down the list of amendments. 
Madam President, I want to make clear to my colleagues the importance of this legislation and why we need to resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. Today is the 23rd of September, 1998. If we do not get a bill into conference and back and passed by the 1st of October, at least $2 billion worth of moneys out of the airport trust fund/aviation trust fund will not be allowed to move forward, and also there are many letters of intent that entail hundreds of millions more. 
Madam President, we all know how important aviation is to America. We all know how important it is for us to move forward with the ever growing air traffic in the United States of America. 
Madam President, I rise in support of S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act of 1998. Today, I will be offering a manager's amendment to the bill as reported by the Commerce Committee on July 14, 1998. This bill, as modified by the manager's amendment, has the support of Committee Ranking Member Senator Hollings, Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Gorton, Aviation Subcommittee Ranking Member Senator Ford, and myself. As I indicated on the floor last week, this is a `must-pass' piece of legislation which includes critical aviation projects such as safety, security, capacity and noise projects at airports across the Nation. 
Madam President, if the Congress does not pass legislation to reauthorize the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the FAA will be prohibited from issuing grants to airports in every state, regardless of whether the transportation appropriations bill is signed into law. Therefore, we must act to reauthorize the programs of the FAA before we leave this year. 
I would like to highlight three areas of importance which this bill addresses. First and foremost, it reauthorizes the FAA and Airport Improvement Program, AIP. Second, the bill contains essential provisions to promote a competitive aviation industry. Last but not least, it will protect the environment in our national parks from the harmful effects of excessive commercial air tour overflights. I have worked long and hard on all of these issues. And many of these long and hard times have been spent with Senator Ford, the Senator from Kentucky. 
This bill provides a two-year authorization for most programs of the FAA including FAA Operations, Facilities and Equipment, and AIP, the Airport Improvement Plan. Research, Engineering and Development (RE&D) programs have already been authorized for FY 1999 by separate legislation that was signed into law on February 11, 1998. S. 2279 authorizes the AIP at $2.4 billion for Fiscal Year 1999. 
The legislation also includes funding for aviation security. Two years ago, the Congress passed the 1996 FAA reauthorization bill which contained numerous provisions designed to improve security at our nation's airlines and 
airports. These provisions included accelerating deployment of the latest explosive detection systems; enhancing passenger screening processes; requiring criminal history record checks on screeners; and requiring regular joint threat assessments and testing baggage match procedures. While these provisions have helped secure our airlines and airports, the legislation before us builds upon the security foundation we established 2 years ago. 
Madam President, S. 2279 legislation also includes several provisions to enhance competition in the airline industry. On October 29, 1997, I introduced the Aviation Competition Enhancement Act of 1997, S. 1331. The purpose of this bill was to further deregulate our domestic aviation system for the the benefit of travelers and communities, by promoting more convenient options and competitive air fares for travelers. According to the General Accounting Office report of October 1996, several factors have limited entry at many airports. These factors include the dominance of routes to and from the four slot controlled airports by one or two established airlines. In April 1996, the Department of Transportation conducted a study that estimated that almost 40 percent of domestic passengers traveled in markets with low fare competition, saving consumers an estimated $6.3 billion annually in airline fares. 
Due to the interest of other Senators to increase competition in the airline industry, I worked with Senators Frist and Lott on a substitute to Senator Frist's competition legislation, S. 1353, which the Commerce Committee also reported out of Committee on July 14, 1998. These provisions are also included in the bill that is now before us. 
The competition provisions--and I would like to again give great credit to Senators Frist and Lott--have three main elements. First, they would provide slot exemptions for nonstop regional jets to fly to and from so-called underserved communities and the four slot-controlled airports--Reagan National, O'Hare, LaGuardia, and JFK--would create 12 new round-trip flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and provide limited exemptions to the perimeter rule at Reagan National and finally, would add additional slots at Chicago O'Hare. I will comment on each of these provisions. 
The slot exemptions for nonstop regional jets must be approved by the Secretary of Transportation for service between a nonhub airport and a small hub airport and the high density airports which are O'Hare, LaGuardia, and JFK. 
At Reagan National, the legislation would create 6 new daily round-trip flights beyond the 1,250-mile perimeter, a 
federally imposed restriction, and 6 new daily round-trip flights to under-served markets within the perimeter. Carriers can only use Stage 3 aircraft that meet strict noise requirements in the new slots. The new service will result in only one or two new flights per hour at the airport. 
At Chicago O'Hare, the legislation as reported by the Commerce Committee would provide discretionary authority to the Secretary of Transportation to convert up to 100 unused military slots to air-carrier slots over three years at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. Due to concerns raised by some Senators, however, I have worked on a compromise regarding additional flights at O'Hare. Under the agreement which is included in the managers amendment we are offering today, the Secretary of Transportation would be directed to allocate 30 new daily take-off and landing slots over the next three years. Specifically, eighteen slots would provide service to under-served communities, and twelve slots would be available for general distribution. 
I would now like to address those members of the Senate who have concerns about the possible increase in noise at O'Hare and Reagan National due to the increase in slots. The aircraft that operate in these new slots would be required to operated Stage 3 aircraft only. Stage 3 aircraft is the quietest technology available today. The entire domestic fleet is in the process of converting from Stage 2 aircraft to the significantly quieter Stage 3 aircraft. Currently, the fleet is 75 percent Stage 3. By 2000, thanks to legislation previously passed, it must become 100 percent Stage 3. Once the fleet becomes 100 percent Stage 3, the noise impact on areas surrounding airports will drop significantly. 
At Reagan National, the FAA has already stated that the phaseout of Stage 2 aircraft will have a significant impact on noise at the airport. Therefore, adding a few more flights of quieter Stage 3 aircraft certainly should not cause noise levels to approach what they are today. 
At O'Hare, before granting any of the exemptions, the Secretary is to study and report on the environmental considerations that are associated with the flights that would utilize the additional exemptions, including determining that there is no significant increase in noise. I want to repeat: including the Secretary must determine that there is no significant increase in noise. The Secretary must certify that sufficient capacity is available at O'Hare to accommodate the additional flights, and that the exemptions can be used safely. 
Prior to issuing any of the slot exemptions, the Secretary is to provide 30-days public notice in the Federal Register. 
Furthermore, the Secretary is to consult with local officials on the noise and environmental issues surrounding granting of the exemptions. At the end of three years, the Secretary will again study and report on how safety, the environment, noise, access to underserved markets throughout the country, and competition at Chicago O'Hare have been impacted by the new exemptions. 
Meanwhile, the revised bill will direct the Secretary to study and report on the community noise levels in the areas surrounding the four high density airports O'Hare, Reagan National, LaGuardia and JFK, once the national 100-percent State 3 requirement comes into effect in 2000. Among other things, the report is to compare community noise levels since enactment of the Stage 3 aircraft fleet requirements in the 1990 Airport Noise and Capacity Act. The report will also offer suggestions on improving the noise impact of these airports. 
In summary, Madam President, this legislation represents over a year's work by the Commerce Committee and the Aviation Subcommittee. I cannot overemphasize the need to move quickly on this bill. As the end of the second session of the 105th Congress comes to an end, we cannot run the risk of the bill getting caught up in unrelated, politically-charged issues. This bill will have to be conferenced with the House, and we need to take the time to move through the appropriate process. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to comment on an important issue that is not being addressed in this bill--although I considered offering an amendment on the subject. The issue concerns the abuse of familiarization training programs at the FAA. Such programs authorize FAA employees to have free access to cockpit or cabin seating on commercial flights. Cockpit access is designed to provide these employees an opportunity to gain firsthand experience in the operational characteristics of various types of aircraft, to directly interface with cockpit crews and air traffic controllers, and to gain insight into the FAA's systems' performance.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, again, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I argue that if I possess any legislative skills, a major part of the reason for that is that I learned from a master for several years. I was privileged to serve as the ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee of which the distinguished Senator from Kentucky was the chairman. I watched the Senator from Kentucky masterfully, with enormous skill and bipartisanship, pass several pieces of landmark legislation. He did it in a way that I will always remember, and he did it even though issues may have been rather controversial, and he did it without rancor. I believe that the contributions that he has made to aviation in America will be remembered long past his time here in the U.S. Senate. 
Madam President, we do have a managers' amendment, which I will bring forward in just a minute, as we attempt to get amendments. By the way, I also know that there are Members, especially from the States of Maryland, Virginia, Illinois and New York, who have very strongly held views on this issue, and I welcome their presence on the floor to help educate me and Senator Ford further on their views and the impact of this legislation on their airports and surrounding communities.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, now I ask that my colleagues, again, who are interested in this bill--we have a little less than 2 hours remaining--who wish to debate this bill, who wish to discuss it, who wish to amend it, please come to the floor and do so. The Senator from Kentucky and I intend, again, to achieve a final list of amendments for tomorrow. We have every intention of completing this bill by tomorrow evening. 
I want to put my colleagues on notice. We have been working on this bill for a long, long time. If there are not Members who come to the floor to propose their amendments, then I will move to go to third reading of the bill, because there is no point in us going all the way tomorrow and into Friday and not having completed this legislation. I repeat, it must pass. 
I have heard personally from a number of Members who have strongly held views on this legislation, particularly the Senators from Maryland and Virginia. I will point out, Mr. President, that one of the Senators from Virginia, Senator Warner, has had a tragedy in his family, which is why he is not here to debate the bill at this time. 
I, again, urge my colleagues to come to the floor in the next couple of hours to either propose amendments or debate the bill. 
Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada not only on this issue but for his continued activity as a valued member of the Commerce Committee on all aviation issues. He is knowledgeable. He is given to bipartisan cooperation. I appreciate very much the opportunity to work with him not only on aviation issues but a variety of other issues, including the sport of boxing.

Mr. McCAIN. I do not know exactly which airports they go to, although there are some letters of intent that I had printed in the Record. One is the Greater Cincinnati airport, $6 million; and Louisville, $18.243 million. These are letters of intent following fiscal year 1999 grant allocations that are already in preparation. 
Texas: I see the New Austin at Bergstrom, $11.43 million; Dallas/Ft. Worth International, $12.5 million. Washington: Seattle-Tacoma, known as SeaTac Airport, $4,400,000.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. As always, he has been extremely cooperative and helpful as we have this kind of legislation out of the Commerce Committee, which sometimes has tax implications. I am very grateful for the continued cooperation and effort to not encroach on the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee and also to make sure that their views and their authority are well recognized. 
The crucial programs in this legislation are directly dependent upon the ability of the FAA to spend moneys out of the aviation trust fund, and the trust fund itself is supported by revenues from the aviation excise taxes which are paid by all air travelers. 
I thank Senator Roth for his cooperation in our effort to keep necessary funds flowing to aviation programs. His amendment will help keep the FAA on sound financial footing. 
He and his staff have been very helpful in our efforts on this bill. I want to clarify with the chairman that this amendment merely authorizes expenditures from the trust fund for 2 years and prevents expenditures from the trust fund without an authorization in place?

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to go back to the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. I admire the tenacity and commitment to aviation of the Senator. Also, I have had the privilege of personally experiencing his piloting skills while being with him in the great State of Oklahoma. Although I must admit that my willingness to ride in an airplane with him while he was at the controls had more to do with my conviction that because of my colorful history associated with aviation having long ago convinced me I was not intended to die in an airplane, as I watched my dear friend from Oklahoma fly into what one would describe as `threatening weather' with intrepid courage and skill, I have grown to appreciate him even more. 
Associated with that kind of piloting skills is his dedication to aviation and his tenacity associated with this issue specifically. I don't agree with the amendment of the Senator, but I do believe and I am convinced we can work out something which will be agreeable, because the Senator from Oklahoma does identify a problem. I don't agree with the Senator from Oklahoma that it is as big a problem, but when someone like Mr. Hoover, who he just described, is subjected to what he was subjected to, then there is a problem. But I am just not convinced that the remedy that the Senator from Oklahoma is prescribing is the proper remedy. He certainly, in a very articulate fashion, describes the problem we need to work together and address. 
The FAA uses its emergency authority only as a remedial measure when a certificate holder lacks the necessary qualifications to hold the certificate, and the continued exercise of the privileges of the certificate would be contrary to public safety in air commerce or air transportation. All emergency suspensions are premised on a reasonable suspicion as to the certificate holder's qualifications. 
FAA policy since approximately 1990 has generally been that an emergency exists in which a certificate holder lacks the technical qualifications, or the care, judgment, or responsibility to hold an FAA certificate, and remains in a position to use the certificated skills. In such cases, the FAA has reasoned that it intolerably threatens air safety to permit pilots, aircraft mechanics, or air carriers, for example, to operate or repair aircraft when the FAA has reasonably concluded that they do not possess the qualifications necessary to perform those functions. If it is clear that a certificate holder will be unable to exercise the privileges of the certificate, the FAA will not invoke an emergency suspension. 
An emergency order is effective immediately upon issue, rather than being stayed pending conclusion of the adjudicative process. An expedited adjudication process is initiated since the certificate holder immediately loses his or her privileges. The FAA respects the privilege of holding a certificate, but must ensure as its primary mission the highest standards of aviation safety. Retaining authority to take immediate action in emergency situations is integral to the FAA's ability to carry out this mission. 
While S. 842 would not limit the FAA's ability to immediately revoke a certificate, it would complicate the process of appealing such an order by providing new avenues of appeal in addition to those already existing. Currently, a person subject to an emergency revocation order may appeal the emergency nature of that order to the U.S. Court of Appeals. There is no deadline for the Court of Appeals to act although the FAA claims that the court will usually rule within 5 to 7 days. According to the GAO, few choose to do this and even fewer prevail. 
This amendment changes this procedure for challenging the emergency nature of a suspension. Rather than appealing to the Court of Appeals, the emergency nature of the revocation could be appealed to the NTSB. Under the amendment, the NTSB would have 5 days to decide whether it was really an emergency. If the person does not prevail before the NTSB, he or she would then be able to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals under the same circumstances as currently exist. This risks placing substantial strain on limited agency resources by creating a right to appeal to the NTSB, when there is no demonstrable need for such change. 
Between 1993 and 1997 the FAA initiated an average of only 2.55% of its total enforcement caseload as emergency actions. This average demonstrates the FAA's commitment to using this authority only in those cases where the FAA finds that a serious question exists as to a certificate holder's qualifications, and no other action will suffice to ensure the highest standards of safety are maintained. Additionally, the FAA prevails on the vast majority of emergency actions before the NTSB, supporting its position that it has acted properly and not abused its authority. From 1990 through 1997, the FAA was reversed in only 2% of the cases in which emergency orders or revocation were issued, and in only 1% of the cases in which emergency orders of suspension were issued. 
The FAA opposes S. 842. The agency argues that the bill does not alter what may be appealed, merely who would have jurisdiction of an appeal. The FAA believes that S. 842 does not make the process more effective or efficient, but rather creates several new final agency decisions, all of which would be subject to appeal in the Courts of Appeals, which in turn would complicate and potentially prolong, not streamline, the process. 
The FAA has stated that, even if the bill is enacted, an equal number of emergency actions can be expected to be issued with the only result being the additional strain on FAA and NTSB resources in response to more appeals regarding the existence of an emergency. On the other hand, if the legislation results in a significant enough strain on FAA resources that the agency is discouraged from its current use of its emergency authority, the FAA argues that it would permit allegedly unqualified certificate holder to operate one to two years or longer, while the non-emergency litigation is ongoing. In sum, the FAA does not believe that its actions and record before the NTSB support the need for any change in the current system. 
Mr. President, I am always reluctant, whenever we are talking about safety--and maybe it is a bit of cowardice, but I think it is good sense when we are talking about safety to be very, very, very serious about the recommendations of those agencies that we entrust with those responsibilities. 
Obviously, the NTSB is one of those. As the Senator from Kentucky will attest, we have had the NTSB before our committees on many occasions--not just aviation, but many others. They are comprised of very outstanding, knowledgeable people. Mr. Hall, in particular, has impressed us a great deal. 
I understand the Senator from Oklahoma will want a recorded vote. I want to assure him that if he doesn't prevail on this vote, I want to work with him because he has cited serious examples of abuse of power--or certainly injustice, if not abuse of power. The Senator from Oklahoma deserves, as those people who have not been fairly treated or where there is the appearance of unfair treatment--I won't allege that it actually happened, but certainly if there is an appearance of it, I want to work with him in getting something added in the bill to provide additional protections. At the same time, I hope that whatever we do, we can achieve the support and cooperation of both the FAA and the NTSB, which is not the case with this amendment. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I, with Senators Thurmond, Burns, and Hutchison, introduce the United States Cruise Ship Tourism Act of 1998. The purpose of this bill is to stimulate increased domestic cruise vessel opportunities for the American cruising public by temporarily reducing barriers for entry into the domestic cruise ship trade. 
The oceangoing cruise ship industry offers the American cruising public with a multitude of itineraries in international trade. However, due to barriers to entry such as the Passenger Vessel Services Act, large cruise ship domestic trade options are limited to one oceangoing cruise ship in Hawaii. Also, the U.S. port calls of these international itineraries are heavily concentrated in Florida and Alaska due to the proximity of these states to neighboring countries. This means that America's cruising public is denied the opportunity to cruise to many attractive U.S. port destinations, and those ports are denied the economic benefits of those visits, due to these domestic cruise ship trade barriers to entry. 
Three separate bills addressing the domestic cruise ship trade have been referred to the Commerce Committee this Congress: S. 668, S. 803, and S. 2290. Each of these bills takes a different approach to removing barriers and stimulating growth in this area. Senator Hutchison, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine, held a hearing last year on this subject. I would prefer we take the approach proposed in S. 803, of which I am a cosponsor, but I understand that bill does not address the concerns of some other members. We have been working with representatives of all industries concerned with this legislation for several months in an attempt to reach a consensus on this issue. 
While a consensus has not yet been achieved, I believe it is time to take another step forward in the legislative process. My bill would allow the Secretary of Transportation to waive certain current coastwise trade restrictions on a limited basis to stimulate the domestic cruise ship trade. I expect some of my colleagues on the on the Commerce Committee may want to make additional changes to this bill in Committee. I look forward to working these issues out with them in the next week so that we may report this bill to the Senate later this month. 
I believe it is important for this Congress to take action on this issue this year. We should maximize the economic growth potential of the domestic cruise ship trade and the cruising opportunities for America's public.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to speak on behalf of millions of defenseless unborn children who cannot speak for themselves. If they could speak, I know that they would ask for a chance to live. Tragically, too many unborn children are not given a choice and they lose their chance at life to abortion. 
We are not here today to debate the legality of abortion. We are here to discuss ending partial-birth abortion--a particularly gruesome procedure that would be outlawed today but for the President's veto last year of a national ban. 
Banning partial-birth abortions goes far beyond traditional pro-life or pro-choice views. No matter what your personal opinion regarding the legalization of abortion, we should all be appalled and outraged by the practice of partial-birth abortions. This procedure is inhumane and extremely brutal, entailing the partial delivery of a healthy baby who is then killed by having its vibrant brain stabbed and suctioned out of the skull. 
This is simply barbaric. 
I have heard from thousands of people in my home State of Arizona who are outraged that this brutal procedure is permitted. Many of them have differing views regarding the legalization of abortion, but they all concur that partial-birth abortions are particularly cruel and must be stopped. 
Arizonans were recently reminded about the devastating effects for unborn children of partial-birth abortions. On June 30 of this year, a physician in Phoenix attempted to perform a partial-birth abortion. Dr. John Biskind of the A-Z Women's Center was aborting what he believed was a 23-week-old baby. 
After beginning the procedure, Dr. Biskind realized that the child was actually a 37-week, 6-pound baby girl. He immediately stopped the abortion procedure and delivered the baby girl. She suffered a fractured skull and facial lacerations, but thankfully is now recovering with a loving family who adopted her. 
This deplorable incident should never have occurred. It could have been prevented, sparing this little girl, now known as Baby Phoenix, the physical and emotional trauma of nearly being killed at birth. 
If a national ban on partial-birth abortion had been the law, this Arizona doctor would not have been performing such a horrific procedure on a viable 23-week-old baby--let alone 37-week-old Baby Phoenix. 
Clearly, this near-tragedy illustrates the urgent need for a ban on partial-birth abortions in our Nation. We simply cannot allow this heinous procedure to continue taking the lives of viable, healthy babies. 
Some would argue that abortion, including partial-birth abortion, is a matter of choice--a woman's choice. Respectfully, I must disagree. 
What about the choice of the unborn baby? Why does a defenseless, innocent child not have a choice in their own destiny? 
Some may answer that the unborn baby is merely a fetus and is not a baby until he or she leaves the mother's womb. Again, I disagree, particularly, in the case of infants who are killed by partial-birth abortions. 
Most partial-birth abortions occur on babies who are between 20 and 24 weeks old. Viability, `the capacity for meaningful life outside the womb, albeit with artificial aid' as defined by the United States Supreme Court, is considered by the medical community to begin at 20 weeks for an unborn baby. Most, if not all, of the babies who are aborted by the partial-birth procedure could be delivered and live. Instead, they are partially delivered and then murdered. These children are never given a choice or a chance to live. 
Today, we have to make a choice. We can choose to protect our Nation's most valuable resource--our children. We can choose to give a tomorrow full of endless possibilities to unborn children throughout our Nation. We can choose to save thousands from being murdered at the hands of abortionists. 
Or we can choose to allow this barbaric procedure to continue, permitting doctors to kill more innocent, unborn children. 
We each have a choice, a choice which unborn children are denied. We must make the right choice when we vote today, the choice to save thousands of unborn children by banning partial-birth abortions in this country. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 3 days ago the distinguished majority leader asked unanimous consent, and it was objected to. I come to the floor, again, to say I am happy to work with any Senators. The Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, is now in agreement. I believe that the Senators from Illinois are, although unhappy, willing to let this bill move forward. If the Senators from Maryland have a problem, I am happy to consider their amendments in the normal legislative process. 
Mr. President, let me point out something very important here. We are talking about aviation safety, security, capacity, and noise projects, and we are talking about billions of dollars' worth. I hope that we will be able to move forward on this bill very quickly. There are over $2 billion worth of projects that can be held in abeyance because of our failure to reauthorize the FAA. We are talking about safety, Mr. President, which is a very big burden for all of us to bear. So I want to tell my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--especially the Senators from Maryland--I am ready to sit down at any time and see if we can work out any differences that we have to their satisfaction so that we can get this very important reauthorization completed before the end of the fiscal year.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will address two problems confronting the millions of Americans who subscribe to satellite TV service. I am delighted to have Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine and Kohl as original co-sponsors. 
These two problems involve the legal and practical difficulties satellite TV providers currently face in providing network TV stations as part of their service package. 
The first problem is that the law effectively prevents satellite TV companies from providing local network stations to their subscribers. That hampers the ability of satellite TV to compete effectively with cable TV and, by doing so, to check cable rate increases. 
The second problem is that existing law also forbids satellite TV providers from offering distant network stations unless the subscriber happens to be located beyond the reach of local network stations. But the satellite companies and their subscribers claim that the law's definition of what constitutes decent off-air TV reception is too narrow. This has resulted in many situations in which consumers who cannot receive local network stations as a practical matter, are nevertheless regarded as being able to receive them, as a legal matter. In many cases, satellite TV providers are offering distant network signals even though it's actually illegal. This has led to litigation and a court order that could cause more than a million satellite TV subscribers throughout the country to lose their network TV within the next several weeks. 
Mr. President, we need to fix these problems, and we need to fix them quickly. No satellite TV company should be forced to suddenly discontinue any customer's network TV service, and satellite TV companies should be able to provide their subscribers with local network TV stations, just as cable TV companies can. 
The legislation being introduced today is intended to strike a reasonable balance between the competing interests of cable operators, broadcasters, and satellite TV providers, to enable satellite TV providers to offer network stations, to assure that no satellite TV subscriber is unfairly deprived of network TV service, to assure local broadcasters are not deprived of the support of their local audience, and to make satellite TV a more effective competitive alternative to cable TV. 
This legislation will also require changes to the Copyright Act, the Satellite Home Viewers Act, and the Communications Act. The distinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, has developed legislation to give satellite TV providers a compulsory copyright license enabling them to offer local TV stations. I am also cosponsoring this legislation. 
The bill I am introducing today will be merged with Senator Hatch's legislation to provide a comprehensive and workable solution to all these problems. Let me briefly describe what my bill provides. 
My bill directs the Federal Communications Commission to straighten out the rules governing satellite TV companies' carriage of distant network TV stations, and provides guidelines for the Commission's decision. It will also guarantee that no satellite TV subscriber loses network stations before the FCC issues revised rules next February. It will require that satellite TV companies carry all local TV stations, just as cable systems must, when it becomes feasible for them to do so. In the interim it will allow them to carry fewer than all local stations as long as they compensate any local stations that are not carried for any loss of revenue the stations will suffer as a result. 
During the last several weeks the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, and the Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Fritz Hollings, have worked tirelessly with the broadcast and satellite industries to develop a compromise that will avoid the disruption of satellite TV subscribers network TV service until this legislation can be enacted into law. I would like to recognize them for their efforts on behalf of every member of the public who subscribes to multichannel video service, whether by satellite or by cable. All of us should be grateful for their leadership on this issue. 
I intend to hold hearings on the status of the parties efforts to reach a compromise, and on the legislation sponsored by Senator Hatch and myself, next week. It is my hope that broadcasters and satellite TV providers can reach a mutually-acceptable temporary agreement that will enable Senator Hatch and myself to enact our comprehensive legislation as soon as possible, and in any event no later than early in the next Session of Congress.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for trying to move this legislation. I thank the Democratic leader for expressing his willingness to try to work something out. But I also have to express my disappointment that we can't reach agreement yet on a manner to proceed to the consideration of the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act. I pledge to do whatever I can within my power to work with my colleagues on a way to move forward with this critical legislation. 
This reauthorization bill is a must-pass piece of legislation. The bill must be reauthorized before the end of this fiscal year, or airport grants across the Nation will lapse. Grants to our airports will stop regardless of whether the transportation appropriations bill is signed into law or not. 
Madam President, the bill allows for approximately $2 billion to be spent annually on safety and security improvements, as well as capacity enhancements, at public use airports across the country. Ongoing construction projects at hundreds, if not thousands, of airports will be jeopardized if Congress doesn't act before the end of September. Funding for noise grants will halt, as well as funding for important FAA Letter of Intent projects. 
Madam President, coincidentally, the State of Texas happens to entail $26,942,447. 
This bill authorizes a number of safety initiatives, as well as provisions to promote competition in the domestic airline industry. We need only to look at the crippling effect of the Northwest Airlines strike to understand the need to advance legislation that enhances capacity at and access to our most congested airports. 
We must move quickly on this bill. Otherwise, we run the risk of the bill's getting caught up in unrelated politically charged issues at the end of the session. 
Also, we need to take the time to move through the appropriate process on this bill. There are too many significant improvements in the Senate reauthorization bill which would die on the vine if we don't proceed to consideration of the Senate version of the bill. Both the House and the Senate have completed action on their respective 1999 transportation appropriations bills and are currently moving towards conference. Without an authorization bill these funds would be unavailable obligations to our Nation's airport.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, finally, in summary, let me just say we worked hard on this bill. There are some things that are controversial. We sat down and worked--I see the Senator from Illinois on the floor--on the issue of Chicago O'Hare. We worked with Senator Warner on the issue of National Airport. We worked with a lot of other people. 
We need to move this legislation forward. I want to tell my colleagues that I have a commitment from the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that he will not put a temporary reauthorization on the appropriations bill if we don't reach a resolution of the authorization bill. I have been working on a couple of these issues for now 10 years. I do not intend to see it delayed further. I am committed to seeing this reauthorization take place. 
I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in trying to resolve any differences that we might have. 
I thank the majority leader for trying to move this legislation at this time. I appreciate the Democrat leader's commitment to working in trying to work this thing out. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his leadership on this very important issue. I am here to offer my wholehearted support for him in his efforts on this piece of legislation. 
Currently, 22 States require parental notification if a minor is going to receive an abortion. Each year, thousands of adults deliberately circumvent these laws by taking children across State lines to receive an abortion in another State which does not require parental consent. 
This legislation would make it a Federal criminal offense to take children across State lines to receive an abortion without the knowledge of their parents. By implementing this safeguard legislation, we will insulate our children from exploitation by adults who do not want the parents involved in the decisionmaking process for an abortion, and who may not have the child's best interests at heart. 
The decision to have an abortion is a critical one, which I hope women of all ages would not choose. However, despite an individual's personal opinion about abortion, the majority of Americans, myself included, believe it is imperative for the parents of minor children to be included in this life-altering decision. According to a 1996 Gallup poll, 74 percent of Americans support requiring minors to get parental consent for an abortion. According to the Supreme Court, `the medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting; this is particularly so when the patient is immature.' Clearly, our Nation's children should not be kept from their parents when making an important life decision, particularly one with such broad ramifications as an abortion. 
I find it unbelievable that schools throughout the country are unable to dispense even a simple aspirin to a child without written consent from their parents; yet, every day thousands of adults are permitted to escort children across State lines for an abortion which has serious physical and mental effects. 
This is simply preposterous. A child cannot receive over-the-counter medications like an aspirin to relieve a headache while at school, but we allow that same child to have an abortion without the consent or knowledge of their parents and guardians. 
It is my firm belief that we must pass this law and stop people from bypassing the laws of our individual States. I would like to stress that this bill does not impact the individual rights of States, nor does it alter, supersede, or override existing laws in the individual States. What the Child Custody Protection Act does is protect the current laws of States which have chosen to implement parental notification. Most important, this legislation protects our children from making a life-altering decision without the guidance of their most trusted and caring advisers, their parents. The mental and physical well-being of thousands of children depends on us passing the Child Custody Act.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do think it is of interest that newspapers from the Aiken Standard all the way to the York Sunday News, 196 newspapers--some of them more than once; some of them as many as five or six times--have editorialized in favor of campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, one of the people that I admired and revered in many ways, and in many ways was a mentor to me when I was in a different avocation, was Senator John Tower. On March 28, 1974, Senator Tower rose to speak in favor of campaign finance reform. At that time, it was S. 3261, a bill to reform the conduct and financing of Federal election campaigns, and for other purposes.

Mr. McCAIN. In the body of his remarks, Senator Tower said: 
The ascendancy of the power of faceless organizations in campaigns is unhealthy. It leads to unfair and unrepresentative influence on the part of the few who manipulate the many. Individuality is a hallmark of America that has made it great. It promotes that diversity of thought and influence so necessary to a thriving and robust democracy. 
The bill he is referring to is the campaign reform bill that was then being considered by the Senate. 
This bill dignifies and encourages each individual to participate actively in Federal elections. It assures each voter that he will not be harassed, intimidated, or misled by political action groups representing narrow and special interests. It assures each voter that his contribution will count as much as others. 
Mr. President, Senator Tower described the situation pretty much as it is today. Each voter does not believe that his or her contribution counts as much as others. We have seen manifestations of that in virtually every primary this season. Every voter does not believe that there is fair and representative influence on the part of the many. In fact, the voters, in recent polls that have been taken, believe that there is undue influence on the part of special interests. And I, having witnessed it myself, am convinced of it. 
In 1974, on August 8, Representative Anderson said: 
Under our representative system of government, the people elect fellow citizens to speak for, vote on behalf of, and represent their interests in the legislative bodies--the House and Senate--and they elect a President to administer the laws, conduct foreign affairs, and established priorities. And, I believe this to be the best system of government devised by man. 
If some people, however, are given preferential treatment because of their ability and willingness to contribute large sums toward the election of an individual, then the system breaks down. If some are `more equal' than others, then our representative system fails and the interests of all the people are aborted. 
And this is a very serious threat to our democracy. It is a very serious threat if the interests of the rich and powerful are placed above the interests of the weak and the poor. 
Our country was founded on the principle of equality--all are equal in the eyes of the law. But, if the rich and the powerful have a greater influence on writing and administering the laws, is not equality a sham, a farce? 
Mr. President, yesterday I noted a document that was put out by the Democratic National Committee in the 1996 election where a broad variety of privileges would be extended to those who contributed $100,000. One of the most egregious were seats on trade missions. These things have consequences, Mr. President. One of the ongoing controversies--in fact, we will have a hearing in the Commerce Committee next week on the transfer of technology to China being directly related to the issue of these `trade missions.' 
Mr. President, both parties do this. Both parties do this as far as many of these are concerned. This is a memo from the Democratic National Committee. If you want to give a contribution of $100,000 annually: 
Two annual Managing Trustee Events with the President . . . 
Two annual Managing Trustee Events with the Vice President. 
One annual Managing Trustee Dinner with senior Administration officials. * * * * * * 
Two Annual Retreats/Issue Conferences . . . 
Invitations to Home Town Briefings 
As senior Administration officials travel throughout the country, Managing Trustees are invited to join them in private, impromptu meetings. 
Monthly Policy Briefings 
Administration officials discuss topics ranging from telecommunications policy to welfare reform at regular Washington policy briefings to which Managing Trustees are invited. 
Personal DNC Staff Contact 
Each Managing Trustee is specifically assigned a DNC staff member to assist them in their personal requests. [et cetera.] 
But of course the one that strikes me is:  
Annual Economic Trade Missions 
Managing Trustees are invited to participate in foreign trade missions, which affords opportunities to join Party leaders in meeting with business leaders abroad. 
Is that equal opportunity? Could any American citizen go on these trade missions? I think it is pretty clear that if you are willing to give $100,000 annually, then indeed you can take those trade missions. 
A memorandum from whoever Ann Cahill is: 
To: Ann Cahill 
From: Martha Phipps 
RE: WHITE HOUSE ACTIVITIES 
Two reserved seats on Air Force I and II trips. 
Is that the way you ride on Air Force One and Two, Mr. President?--`In order to reach a very aggressive goal of $40 million this year . . . very helpful if we could coordinate the following activities between the White House and the Democratic National Committee.' 
Let me repeat that memorandum: `. . . coordinate the following activities between the White House and the Democratic National Committee.' 
Two reserved seats on Air Force I and II trips . . . 
Six seats at all White House private dinners . . . 
Six to eight spots at all White House events (i.e. Jazz Fest, Rose Garden ceremonies, official visits). 
And in this memorandum it says who the contact is. Ann Stock seems to be a person to contact; and Alexis Herman, now Secretary of Labor. 
Invitations to participate in official delegation trips abroad. 
Contact: Alexis Herman . . . 
Better coordination on appointments to Boards & Commissions . . . 
White House mess privileges. 
Patsy Thomason was the contact for that. 
White House residence visit and overnight stays. 
Ann Stock was the person on that. 
Guaranteed Kennedy Center Tickets (at least one month in advance) . . . 
Six radio address spots 
Contact: David Levy . . . 
Photo opportunities with the principles . . . 
Phone time from the Vice President. 
That was Jack Quinn's job, Mr. President, general counsel. He was responsible, he is the contact, for phone time from the Vice President. That would be the subject of some ongoing inquiry. 
Ten places per month at White House film showings . . . 
One lunch with Mack McLarty per month. 
Boy, it makes me better understand why Mr. Mack McLarty decided to go into private life. 
One lunch with Ira Magaziner . . . 
I think that might be a penalty rather than a benefit. 
One lunch with the First Lady per month. 
I will leave that unremarked. 
Use of the President's Box at the Warner Theater and at Wolf Trap . . . 
Ability to reserve time on the White House tennis courts . . . 
Meeting time with Vice President Gore. 
Again, Jack Quinn was the contact person. 
To be very clear, this is a memorandum of May 5, 1994, to Ann Cahill from Martha Phipps, and it is titled `White House Activities.' Again, it reads: 
In order to reach our very aggressive goal of $40 million this year, it would be very helpful if we could coordinate the following activities between the White House and the Democratic National Committee. 
I have stated several times that every institution of government was debased in the 1996 campaign. I think that this document certainly indicates that was the case. 
We will have a vote on a tabling motion by my dear friend from Wisconsin here in a few minutes and then we will have a cloture vote later this afternoon. I will have a lot more to say before we finish this debate. 
How do we go home and tell our constituents that we are all equal when this kind of thing has become commonplace? And the same kinds of things are done by the Republican Party. Obviously, they didn't have the White House boxes and those other conveniences or perks. How can we tell the American 
people that they are equal when these kinds of things go on? 
The reason I bring this up, this all has to do with the most egregious aspect of the present system, and that is soft money. When you look at the dramatic increase in soft money over the last couple, three cycles, it is dramatic. So there will be more memorandums like the one I just cited and there will be more soft money and there will be more requests for large contributors. 
I see a couple of my colleagues who are waiting to speak. I believe--and I will say this again before the final vote--this issue will be resolved over time and we will prevail because the American people won't stand for this. They won't stand for it, and I believe they will demand we clean up this system either sooner or later. 
I will talk again later on. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. This side has used all but 8 minutes of its time, and the other side has not used a significant amount of its time because there is an hour and 15 minutes approximately between now and when the vote is scheduled. 
What we are trying to achieve here is, one, allow the debate to continue, and, two, allow the proponents of the legislation the opportunity to continue the debate. 
I thought that this whole debate was being conducted in an atmosphere of comity. When I have been in other debates here on the floor of the Senate and there has been no one to speak in opposition or in favor of a particular amendment, then those who wanted to speak were allowed to speak. 
If we are going to depart from that, Mr. President, OK. But I am asking unanimous consent, one, that the last 20 minutes be equally divided, 10 minutes on each side, but also I am asking unanimous consent that if there are no speakers in opposition to the legislation, that speakers in favor of the amendment be allowed to speak rather than just throw the Senate into a quorum call.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, let me begin by thanking all those who have fought so very hard to pass campaign finance reform, both within this body and without. I specifically mention by name the measure's cosponsors: Senator Thompson, Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, Senator Levin, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Jeffords. All have expended great energy to keep this issue before the Senate. 
Also, I again thank my colleagues in the House, Congressman Shays and Congressman Meehan. We would not be doing what we are doing today if it had not been for their signal and unpredicted victory. 
Most importantly, I thank my partner on this 4-year journey, the Senator from Wisconsin, Russ Feingold. His work on this issue has been outdone by none. His efforts are tireless, and he deserves great praise for bringing us to this point today. Together we have worked to do the bidding of the majority of the American people. We worked to pass legislation that is supported by majorities in both Houses, although a minority has continued to thwart our efforts. But time is on our side. 
Yesterday and today, I have quoted previous debates on this subject. One fact that is clear in every one of these debates is that, with persistence, we will prevail. I hope we prevail today. If we do not, I will be back to offer campaign finance reform legislation again and again and again. Neither I nor the Senator from Wisconsin will relent. The will of the American people, their desire to see what they perceive as a corrupt election system cleaned up, cannot be perpetually ignored. The public wants us to act. 
Low voter turnout--and we will perhaps see the lowest voter turnout this century, this November--is ample proof of the growing cynicism of the electorate. That cynicism, if left unchecked, will grow to contempt and shake the foundations of this great Nation. Let us not procrastinate further. Let us confound public cynicism and accede to the country's wishes today. 
The Senate was conceived by our Founding Fathers as an institution that acts deliberatively. 
Certainly we have seen this occur on this matter. But it was not conceived to block indefinitely the will of the people. Many significant matters have been slowed or stalled in this body. Many have taken years to pass. Campaign finance is undoubtedly one of those subjects. But to repeat myself yet again, this body will act and pass campaign finance reform. If not today, then soon. It will happen. Delay is not resolution, merely postponement of the inevitable and thus pointless. 
Until we recognize the futility of procrastination, the money chase in this hallowed Capitol, the debasement of the White House, the selling of trade missions, the never-ending series of fundraising scandals that leads the public more and more to believe that elected officials only represent monied special interests will not end. 
Congress can and must and will change this system. If we do not act, there will be more scandals, both parties will be further tainted by this system, no one will be left unscathed, and that fact will force this body to do what is right. 
When do we as a body come to realize that something must be done? And to my Republican colleagues: When will we realize it was our ideas, not our fundraising prowess, that got us to power? The American public granted us the majorities in both Houses because, I would argue, our ideas were superior to those of the opposition. Our ideas represented what a majority of Americans felt and believed. We do not need to fear a new campaign finance regime so long as we continue to best represent the public interests. And because I so strongly believe that fact, I appeal to my Republican colleagues to support cloture and allow us to move forward on this matter. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me close by again putting my colleagues on notice. If we cannot move forward today, we will soon. To those who will proclaim the issue dead, nothing--I repeat, nothing--is further from the truth. As long as I am privileged to serve in this great institution, we will revisit campaign finance reform again and again. We will revisit the subject until it becomes the law of the land. We will revisit it because the will of the majority over time always prevails. And we will revisit it because it is the right thing to do. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

We will continue this fight. But I also think it is important to point out that we got 52 votes, which was the same as the last time. I intend to work with friends on both sides of the aisle to try to get additional votes so we can make progress on this issue. Since that is not the case, it is my understanding that the majority leader will move off of this bill probably at this time. 
I want to make sure that again we are not giving up this fight. We will continue. And sooner or later I am convinced that we will have the opportunity to prevail.

Mr. McCAIN. Let me just make a couple of comments before I withdraw my amendment. As I said, we will not give up the fight. We need to have progress. We need to pick up a couple of additional votes, and it is important we make every effort to do so. 
There would at least have been a vote at noon today on this issue, because a tabling motion was in order by the Senator from Wisconsin. The Senator from Wisconsin, for very legitimate reasons, chose not to have that vote. So we could have had everybody on record at least on the tabling motion. 
I insisted the night before last that we have 2 full days of debate. I had rather harsh words exchanged between myself and the majority leader--which is very uncustomary for me to have, except on approximately a daily basis. But the fact is the majority leader agreed that we would have 2 full days of debate. Then I came in today to find that, for the convenience of a Senator or Senators on that side of the aisle, we had to have a vote at 1:45. There were many on both sides who wanted to debate this particular amendment, but we had to curtail it. Last night there were Members on this side as well as the other side who wanted to speak on this issue. Instead, the Senator from Massachusetts had to speak for 2 or 3 hours on minimum wage. 
So, if we are really serious about this, I want to tell my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, then we ought to go ahead and debate it, and debate it fully. We reached the point before the vote at 1:45 that, even on this side, the seven Republicans who wanted to debate did not have sufficient time to do so, because rather than go late into this evening as I had envisioned, for the convenience of Senators on that side of the aisle we had to curtail the debate and have a vote at 1:45 today. 
So I think it is important to point out that I do not believe the issue was debated as fully as it should have been, even though it has been done several times in the past. I urge, again, my colleagues to recognize there is one way we are going to get true, meaningful campaign finance reform, and that is on a bipartisan basis. My opening statement yesterday articulated three principles as to what brings about meaningful campaign finance reform, and one is bipartisanship. So I am reluctant--I am reluctant, without progress on this issue, to engage in a debate which could divert the Senate from other important issues of the day. 
I want to point out one other reality, much to the sadness of almost everyone I know. Tomorrow's newspapers will probably not highlight the fact that we failed again on campaign finance reform. They will highlight the issue which has consumed all the oxygen throughout this town, and that is the firestorm concerning the scandal that is affecting the Presidency of the United States and the institution of the Presidency today. 
So I hope we can move forward. I will never give up on this fight as long as I am a Member of this body. And I hope that we can make progress together. But let's do it in a meaningful way and in a bipartisan way so we can make genuine progress. 
Finally, I thank all the people who worked so hard to get this back up before this body. I thank Senator Feingold. I thank all our friends on the outside. I thank everybody who has worked so hard in this effort. And we will prevail over time. But we will prevail, I believe, in a bipartisan fashion and not in one that exacerbates emotions on the floor of the Senate rather than working towards a common goal of bettering the electoral progress. 
Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, only 8 years ago we went to war in the Persian Gulf as the most combat-ready force in the world. The value of that preparedness was clear. We won a massive victory in a few weeks over one of the largest armies in the world and we did so with remarkably few American and allied casualties. We were able to end aggression with minimum losses of civilian life and were even able to greatly reduce the casualties of our enemy. Today, our enormous preparedness, impressive military force, is beginning to evaporate. 
In spite of the efforts of our services, armed services, we are having significant problems again that remind me of the very difficult period during the 1970s when the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army came before the Congress and said we had a `hollow army.' We are losing the combat readiness and edge that is an essential aspect of deterrence, defense, and the ability to repel aggression. 
It is true that we have heard many reassuring words to the contrary from the administration. The fact is, however, that we are `going hollow.' We are losing our ability to get there `fastest with the mostest,' and the indicators are all too clear the moment we look beyond superficial indicators and the normal rhetoric of budget testimony. 
Mr. President, I have heard firsthand accounts from commanders in the field and in the fleet on the deteriorating status of the operational readiness of the U.S. military forces, including the availability of resources and training opportunities necessary to meet our national security requirements. Although the upcoming year's budget makes some strides to reverse 5 straight years of underfunding for both short-term and long-term modernization, I have serious concerns about the future state of preparedness of our units and our men and women in the military. 
The tangible evidence of this trend is contained in the words of nearly all the military witnesses who have testified this past year before the Senate Committee on Armed Services as well as before our House counterparts. Their statements do not reveal a single reason why we are going hollow or a single set of answers as to how these problems can be solved. 
Each service has a unique mix of readiness problems and has made different tradeoffs. At its core, however, is an alarming lack of concern on the part of the administration that repeatedly acts without regard for the most basic requirements for maintaining Armed Forces essential for our national security and promoting our national interests. The repeated and deliberate failure to match requirements, as set forth by the National Command Authority, with resources adequate to the task, compounded by the White House's unwillingness to budget for ongoing contingency peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, has over time clearly degraded military preparedness. 
Not to be ignored is the role of Congress in exacerbating this situation through its exceedingly damaging practice of wasting scarce financial resources on programs for strictly parochial reasons. That practice was harmful when we were adding to the administration's budget request in the context of the 1997 balanced budget agreement. And that harm is magnified manyfold. 
Mr. President, I have spoken many times of the wasteful spending practices embodied in the defense appropriations bill, and I will not go through the details again now. But the fact is that a lack of a Base Closing Commission commitment, the lack of a commitment to a balanced force, the continued unnecessary and unneeded funding for especially our Guard resources, and our inability to somehow make the transition to the post-cold-war requirements of a military that is ready to move anyplace in the world on short notice, is absolutely deplorable. And as I indict the administration, Mr. President, the Congress also bears enormous responsibility for our failure as well. 
In spite of the highest readiness funding in our history, we are having preparedness and readiness difficulties. Some recent examples noted by experts are--and I quote a memorandum dated August 20, 1998, from General Bramlett, Commander-in-Chief of Forces Command, to Army Chief of Staff General Reimer. General Bramlett wrote:  
. . . we can no longer train and sustain the force, stop infrastructure degradation, and provide our soldiers the quality of life programs critical to long term readiness of the force . . . we cannot operate within current funding levels and have the viable fighting force we want to project into the next century. Operation and maintenance funding levels are no longer sufficient to `make it happen' and avoid serious long-term negative impacts to the force. Commanders of Fort Lewis, Stewart, and Bragg [all installations home to major contingency `first-to-deploy' units] report units will drop below authorized training levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999. This threatens our ability to mobilize, deploy, fight, and win. Current funding levels place FORSCOM's ability to accomplish its mission at an unacceptable risk. 
Mr. President, let me repeat: `Current funding levels place FORSCOM's ability to accomplish its mission at an unacceptable risk.' Mr. President, I want to remind you, these are not my words but the words of General Bramlett who is the Commander-in-Chief of Forces Command and contained in a memorandum to the Chief of Staff of the Army. 
Current funding levels place FORSCOM's ability to accomplish its mission at an unacceptable risk. 
We must have additional funding for FY 99 and beyond.

Mr. McCAIN. He ends up by saying: 
My assessment is not good news. Funding has fallen below the survival level in FY 99. The commanders are concerned that they cannot meet the daily challenges of the three imperatives of readiness: Training, QOL [meaning quality of life], and infrastructure. Our commitment to doing our part in reengineering, creative training strategies, and best business practices has never been stronger. Current funding levels place FORSCOM's ability to accomplish its mission at an unacceptable risk. 
It is a very, very strong statement, Mr. President. I have been associated with the military all my life, and I have not seen quite that strong a statement or a stronger statement than that from one of our commanders in the field. 
The Air Force's 1st Fighter Wing, with primary responsibility for the Middle East, has experienced a prolonged period of declining preparedness, as squadrons are forced to deploy at physically and mentally exhausting rates while spare parts shortages result in the cannibalization of fighters from one squadron to ensure another can deploy on schedule. 
Naval aviators have stated to Armed Services Committee members and staff that the frequency of deployments has placed excessive stress on their personal lives, with the result that many are leaving the service for higher paying, less stressful jobs with the commercial airlines. That operational tempo is a direct result of the convergence of shrinking force structure and increased deployments to overseas contingencies. 
The commander of the 3rd Fleet, Vice Adm. Herbert Browne, testified before the Readiness Subcommittee that the shortage of skilled personnel has resulted in crossdecking, which places enormous additional stress on those personnel remaining in the service. `Crossdecking,' Mr. President, means when a ship comes back from a deployment, the personnel of that ship, rather than being allowed to come home, then move to another ship that is headed out on another deployment--an absolutely unacceptable practice. 
During the same hearing, the commander of an Air Force fighter wing operations group testified that his unit's full mission capable rates have consistently dropped from 90 percent in 1993, to 80 percent in the 1995 time frame, down to 70 percent for the present. 
Radar and jet engine mechanics told ABC News reporters of their growing frustration with shortages of spare parts to repair aircraft and of the exodus from the service of skilled mid-level maintenance people, with the result that aircraft sit idle and less skilled personnel are assigned vital maintenance and repair work. On the same broadcast, the commander of Air Combat Command stated that his command has `suffered about a 10 percent to 12 percent decline in the average readiness of our fleet from day-to-day.' 
In a June 1998 letter from Admiral M.G. Mullen, Director of Surface Warfare Division on the Chief of Naval Operations staff wrote to every surface warfare commanding officer soliciting ideas to turn around retention amongst surface warfare junior officers. In his letter he wrote, `I can also tell you we are only retaining about 1 in 4 and we must keep 1 in 3 to develop the leaders our Navy needs.' 
In a San Diego Union-Tribune article on September 2, 1998 during an interview with Admiral Clemins, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, it was reported that the Navy is short 18,000 sailors, forcing the Navy to send many warships including carriers to the Persian Gulf at a reduced level of readiness, specifically a C-2 rating, only the second highest level of readiness. 
According to a 1998 article in the Army Times, the mission of the Army has increased by 300 percent since 1989, yet its active duty force has declined by 36 percent and its budget by 40 percent. These facts have resulted in a severe decrease in the level of operational readiness for the service and led former Assistant Vice-Army Chief of Staff of the Army Lieutenant General Jay Garner to describe divisions as `hollow.' 
Colonel Stephen E. Bozarth, Commander of the 388th Operations Group, testified before the Readiness Subcommittee that although the current experience level of the pilots of the Wing is 77 percent, it is expected to degrade over the next 18 months to approximately 50 percent. Such a loss in experience results in not only untrained personnel fulfilling necessary pilot positions but also an inadequate number of people to train these individuals. Moreover these losses necessitate that pilots who choose to remain in the service work longer and harder hours, thus creating a serious strain on morale. 
Vice Admiral Browne also testified this year that inadequate fuel supplies are depriving pilots of strike fighter jets the flight hour training necessary for familiarization of the aircraft. Lack of such training will result in the substandard performance of these men and women in the multi-threat environment in which they currently operate. 
The commander of the Air Warfare Center (AWFC), Major General Marvin Esmond, testified before the Readiness Subcommittee that those under his command have experienced a six month slip in skill improvement due to delays in specialized training. Such delays are a direct consequence of a lack of manpower. This loss in personnel has also required that the servicemen and women work 60-65 hours per week as well as 12 hour duty shifts. 
Major General Ronald Richard, Commanding General of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, voiced concerns over equipment readiness to the Readiness Subcommittee. According to the general, a majority of his equipment is `getting exceedingly old,' a fact which has led to increased maintenance as well as excessive expenditure. 
In order to understand the issues involved, it is necessary to understand just how difficult it is to achieve the level of military preparedness we enjoyed during Desert Storm. Military preparedness is the product of readiness and sustainability, the former referring to the ability of forces to go to war on short notice, the latter the ability to support them in the field. Preparedness is not just a matter of funding operations and maintenance at the proper level. It is not only a matter of funding adequate numbers of high quality personnel. It is not simply a matter of funding superior weapons and munitions, strategic mobility and prepositioning, high operating tempos, realistic levels of training at every level of combat, or logistics and support capabilities. 
Military preparedness is all these things and more. A force begins to go hollow the moment it loses its overall mix of combat capabilities in any one critical area. Our technological edge in Desert Storm would have been meaningless if we did not have properly trained men and women. Having the best weapons system platforms in the world would not have given us our victory if we had not had the right command and control facilities, maintenance capabilities, and munitions. 
The preparedness problem within the military is compounded by both the `can do' attitude of the military and the history of military readiness reporting. On the one hand, our men and women in uniform have a history of making do, of adjusting to civilian decisions, and working out potential solutions even at the cost of assuming higher risks. An example of this is the continued practice of the Marine Corps to retread the tires of the humvees (HMMVV's) and five-ton trucks of the First and Second Marine Expeditionary Forces. 
On the other, we have been very slow to modernize and integrate our various measures of effectiveness, to independently audit command reporting, and to adopt modern management information systems. Time and again, we have learned that our readiness measures are unrealistic or fail to anticipate real-world demands on readiness funds and budget cuts. Time and again, we have seen peacetime claims of `can do' turn into wartime realities of `can't fight.' 
Mr. President, in mid-July I sent letters to each of the Service Chiefs expressing my concern about the military's overall state of readiness. In order that I might gain a better understanding of current readiness and readiness trends in the military, I asked each Service Chief to provide detailed answers to questions by September 30, 1998, from all levels within the military and not just the typical Pentagon talk that we have become used to during the multitude of hearings that surround the defense budget cycle. In addition, I requested that the responses to the questions also include an assessment of National Guard and Reserve readiness. Mr. President, I intend to share these answers with my colleagues and make them widely available to the public. It is critical that not only Members of Congress, but all Americans should be fully informed on the state of our military so that they can participate in any discussions in the near future to add money to the defense budget and reprioritize critical resources within the military. 
Very often, those who question the Administration's commitment to maintaining proper levels of military preparedness are accused of exaggerating the scale of the problem through the random marshaling of anecdotal information. These criticms, to say the least, are without merit. If a pattern of evidence cannot be seen as leading to a logical conclusion, then the basis for rational, objective intellectual discourse is thoroughly discredited. This `anecdotal evidence' increases every year, is discovered through visits to the field to meet with military personnel of all ranks, through congressional hearings, media reports and scholarly studies, and is beyond dispute. 
My President, this will be as true in the future as it was during Desert Storm, and it has been true throughout the history of warfare. As Sun Tzu pointed out over 2,000 years ago, `It is a doctrine of war not to assume the enemy will not come, but rather to rely on one's readiness to meet him. It is a doctrine of war not to presume that he will not attack, but rather to make one's self invincible.' 
I make those statements concerning military readiness in the context of what is happening in the world today. When you glance around the globe you find that there is a potential trouble spot in literally every continent of the world with the exception of the two poles and perhaps Australia. We find this situation in Kosovo with ethnic cleansing where our Secretary of State, several months ago said, and I believe the quote is accurate, `We will not allow the Serbs to do in Kosovo what we prevented them from doing in Bosnia.' The last time I checked, Mr. President, they were doing quite a bit of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and the situation continues to worsen. 
In Iraq, we have gone from a position where our Secretary of State said we would respond with military force if Saddam Hussein refused to allow our U.N. inspectors access to any installation that they desired--would be met with military force. Now, according to Scott Ritter and other reports, the administration has been encouraging UNSCOM not to inspect. 
The situation in Asia is serious. Riots are taking place in Indonesia as we speak. The nation that the World Bank a year and a half ago did a study on as a model nation for economic development, now had the privilege of seeing its President go on nationwide television in Indonesia and recommended that the Indonesian people not eat 2 days a week because of food shortages. 
We have seen the administration surprised by the nuclear tests conducted by both India and Pakistan. 
We have now apparently circumstantial evidence that technology was transferred to China, which either marginally or substantially, depending on which expert you talk to, increased the precision targeting capability of Russian ICBMs until recently, 12 of which were targeted on the United States of America--now are not--but in a matter of seconds could be retargeted. 
Mr. President, I could go on. But the fact is that the world is a very tough neighborhood and requires a tough cop. The cop is now not on the beat and bad things are happening all over the world, which makes it even more likely that we may have to call upon the United States of America to again expend its blood and treasure somewhere in the world. The very least we can do is make sure that those men and women who we have to send somewhere are the best equipped and trained as we possibly can make them. What I greatly fear is that we may have to send them less than well prepared, less than ready, and less than well equipped, which then leads to the inevitable consequence of casualties that are unnecessary and tragic. 
Mr. President, I intend to talk more on this issue. I think it is an important one. I also remind my colleagues that we--the traditional protectors of the military--have an obligation to address this issue as well as the administration. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his patience and for presiding at this late hour. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first I mention a scheduling item. I am confident that the agreement we reached yesterday was that there would be a vote either late tomorrow afternoon or early evening. Now I am told that there may be some Members on the other side who want to have an earlier vote. Mr. President, I will not agree to such a thing. I believe that we need more than 2 days' debate on this issue even though we have been over this issue many times before. I just want to tell my colleagues on both sides, but particularly on the other side of the aisle, I understand there are personal commitments and we will try to accommodate those, but to have a vote earlier than very late tomorrow afternoon or tomorrow evening I think would not be in keeping with the agreement that we reached yesterday. 
This is not a happy time for America. It is not a happy time for the institutions of government, especially the Presidency, but also the Congress. We are going through a very wrenching and difficult episode which already, I think most of us would agree, ranks in the first order of crises that affect this country. And it affects us. As I have said on numerous occasions, all of us are tarred by a brush when the institutions of government are diminished and affected by scandal. 
But it also points out the criticality of us addressing this issue of campaign finance reform now rather than later. In today's newspaper, `Reno Sets 90-day Clinton Probe': 
Attorney General Janet Reno yesterday opened a preliminary investigation of President Clinton that could lead to an independent counsel probe of allegations that he orchestrated a plan to violate spending limits for his 1996 reelection campaign. . . .The new Clinton inquiry was triggered by a preliminary report last month from the Federal Election Commission auditors. The auditors concluded that the DNC ads about issues such as Medicare and the budget amounted to `electioneering' on the President's behalf, and the Clinton-Gore campaign should be required to reimburse the government for the entire $13.4 million it received in Federal matching funds. 
This morning, in most of the major newspapers in America, there is a poll that is conducted by the Terrence Group and Lake, Snell, Perry and Associates--one Democrat and one Republican polling group: `What do you think is the number one problem today? Moral-religious issues, 14 percent; crime and drugs, 14 percent; economy and jobs, 13 percent.' 
Mr. President, perhaps moral and religious issues have been a No. 1 priority in America before, but I don't think there is any doubt that that is the case today. `Which of the following issues do you want Congress to focus on? Restoring moral values, 22 percent; improving education, 19 percent; reducing taxes and Federal spending, 13 percent.' 
Mr. President, when 22 percent of the American people say they believe that restoring values is the No. 1 issue they want Congress to focus on, I don't believe they are just referring to the problems concerning the Presidency and that crisis. I think they are talking about the fact that they don't believe that they, as individual citizens, are represented here in the Congress in the legislative process. I think they believe that special interests rule. I believe they are concerned that no longer are their concerns paramount, but only those of major contributors. 
The effect of this was manifested just yesterday in my home State of Arizona in the primary that was held, as has been true throughout the country. It was the lowest voter turnout, as a percentage, of any time in the history of my State. I don't think that voters didn't turn out to vote in the primary in Arizona yesterday because of their anger--which may be justified--at the President of the United States; I think they didn't turn out because they believe that the present system of financing campaigns results in an exclusion of them in the legislative process; their homes and their dreams and aspirations for themselves and their families are no longer reflected here in the Congress of the United States. 
Mr. President, the amendment at the desk, which is commonly known as the McCain-Feingold campaign finance legislation, is amended by Senators Snowe and Jeffords. This amendment would begin to reform a severely broken campaign finance system. Early last month, the Members of the other body did what the Senate has failed to do, and that is to pass genuine campaign finance reform. By so doing, they have given Members of this body who support reform encouragement that Congress, at long last, may accede to the wishes of the majority in both Houses of Congress and to the wishes of the vast majority of the people we represent by repairing a campaign finance system that has become a national embarrassment and assails the integrity of the office that we are privileged to hold. 
I want to commend and thank Representatives Shays and Meehan, and many other Members of the other body, whose courage and determination have given us a chance to reclaim the respect of the American people. I appeal to all Members of the Senate to listen to the majority of our colleagues in the other body, and to the majority of Senators, and seize this historic opportunity to give the Nation a campaign finance system that is worthy of the world's greatest democracy. 
Mr. President, no Washington pundit thought that the House would actually pass campaign finance reform, but it did. It was not an easy fight. But those in favor of reform prevailed. I hope the majority in the Senate that favors reform will be able to prevail here. A majority in the House passed reform because the American people demand it. Members of the House recognized that the current system is awash in money, exploited loopholes, and publicly perceived corruption. It is a system that no Member of Congress should take pride in defending. 
Before I discuss the matter more fully, I want to remind my colleagues of three points. One, for reform to become law, it must be bipartisan. This is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that affects both parties in a fair and equal manner. 
Two, reform must seek to reduce the role of money in politics. Spending on campaigns in current inflation-adjusted dollars continues to rise. In constant dollars, the amount spent on House and Senate races in 1976 was $318 million. By 1986 that total had risen to $645 million, and in 1996 it was $765 million. Including the Presidential races, over a billion dollars was spent in the last campaign. As the need for money escalates, the influence of those who have it rises 
exponentially. 
Three, reform must seek a level playing field between challengers and incumbents. Our bill achieves this by recognizing the fact that incumbents must always raise more money than challengers. As a general rule, the candidate with the most money wins the race. If money is forced to play a lesser role, then challengers will have a better chance. 
The amendment before the Senate achieves these three points. Is the measure perfect? No. Is it a legitimate start for discussion? Yes. For that reason, I hope my colleagues will support cloture and allow the Senate to work its will, to improve the measure where necessary, and begin a real dialog with the House on what can and should be sent to the President for his signature. 
I want to repeat that this is the Senate's opportunity to not only do what is right but what is necessary. Washington has lately become synonymous with scandal, but for all the recent scintillating revelations, the real scandal--a scandal that will not go away--is the money that is and has been corrupting our elections. Unless this Senate finds the courage to act, that scandal will not subside. 
Some will come to the floor and state that we do not need to reform how campaigns are run. They will state instead that we should simply enforce the laws that already exist. Mr. President, with all due respect, this argument is specious. Republicans demanded that the welfare system be reformed not only because it was the right thing to do but because the system was riddled with loopholes and was being abused and exploited. We didn't sit back and simply challenge the executive branch to enforce the laws. We acted, we changed the law, and we changed it in our society for the better. Let's do the same now. 
I know that many colleagues think this refrain has become all too familiar, and they are correct. This is not the first time our campaign finance system has been in need of reform, and it will undoubtedly not be the last, because as time passes, the flaws and loopholes in the law become more evidence. It is at that time that the Congress has historically done what is needed; it has passed campaign finance reform.  
The underlying purpose of this movement for the publication of contributions made for campaign purposes is to limit expenditures in political contests to legitimate purposes and to lessen the use of money in political elections. 
So said Senator Culberson in 1908. 
Senator Culberson inserted into the Record many letters, many of which could have been written today: 
For some years there has been earnest agitation of the question of enforcing campaign contributions relating to national elections. A strong public sentiment has been created in favor of this important regulation. In obedience to this sentiment, a bill is now pending in Congress providing for the desired publicity. The question is whether the bill will be passed, defeated, or smothered. 
The letter continues: 
No party should be afraid to go before the country with a record of its campaign financiering. 
No candidate for office should hesitate to have the people know the sources of campaign money. In other words, such contributions should come only from legitimate sources, and only money from such sources would be accepted, if the facts had to be made public: Hence, the great importance of publicity. The people do not want successful candidates to owe their elections to special interests affected by the subsequent administrations of such candidates. Such favors and obligations they involve are absolutely against the principles of honest government, whether that government be national, State, or municipal. 
In the House that same year 1908, Congressman Sulzer stated: 
In my opinion, this publicity campaign contribution bill is one of the most important measures before this House. It is a bill for more honest elections, to more effectively safeguard the elected franchise, and it affects the entire people of this country. It concerns the honor of the country. The honest people of the land want it passed. All parties should favor it. Recent investigations conclusively demonstrate how important to all the people of the country is the speedy enactment of this bill. 
Remember, this statement was made in 1908. 
In every national contest of recent years the campaign has been a disgraceful scramble to see which party could raise the most money, not for legitimate expenses but to carry a system of political iniquity that will not and cannot bear the light of publicity. Political corruption dreads the sun of publicity and works in the secret of darkness . . . Napoleon said victory was on the side of the heaviest guns. There are many thoughtful people in this country who have been saying since 1896 that the political victory in our Presidential contest is on the side of the campaign committee which can raise the largest boodle fund. 
This important bill for publicity of campaign contributions is a nonpartisan measure. There should be no politics in it. We should all advocate from patriotic motives; but some of the gentlemen on the other side are injecting party politics into it, and are doing everything in their power to prevent the Members of this House who sincerely favor the bill from having the opportunity to vote for it. . . It is a shame the way this bill is being strangled to death. 
In 1908, Congress went on to do the people's bidding. It passed the campaign finance reform legislation. 
In 1947, Senator Ellender stood on this floor, and stated: 
It came to my attention as chairman of that committee--and this feeling is shared by committee members joining me in sponsoring this bill--that the present statutes dealing with elections, campaign expenditures, and contributions, and limitations thereon, are utterly inadequate and unrealistic and as now in force and do not begin to accomplish the purposes for which they were enacted. . . 
I may state, Mr. President, that our committee last year found that many corporations and some labor organizations had spent thousands of dollars in Federal elections, but we could not force them to report for the reason that the money expended was not considered as contributions. So this bill requires any money spent to be reported by whoever makes the expenditure. 
Experience has shown that some corporations and labor unions have spent money directly on behalf of a party or candidate and thus I invaded the application of the prohibition upon contributions. 
In 1947 the Congress, again, responded to the public's disdain for the way our campaigns are financed and passed campaign finance reform legislation. 
In 1974, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, the Congress again passed campaign finance reform legislation. 
Mr. President, after what we know about the last election, it is time again to pass campaign finance reform legislation. 
Mr. President, recently there was given to me a memo that is public knowledge: The Democratic National Committee, Democratic National Committee Managing Trustee Events and Membership Requirements Events; two annual Managing Trustee Events where the President in Washington, DC, attended; two annual meetings, trustee event for the Vice President, et cetera. It is kind of a standard thing that you see on these kind of things. But the thing that is interesting about this is the fifth one down, `Annual Economic Trade Missions.' `Managing trustees are invited to participate in foreign trade missions, which affords opportunities to join Party leaders in meeting with business leaders abroad.' 
Another memorandum that was given to me of May 5, 1994, to Anne Cahill from Martha Phipps: 
White House Activities: In order to reach our very aggressive goal of $40 million this year, it would be very helpful if we could coordinate the following activities between the White House and Democratic National Committee: 1. Two reserved seats on Air Force One; and, 2. Six seats at all White House private dinners. 
No. 4: `Invitations to participate in official delegation trips abroad. Contact: Alexis Herman.' 
Mr. President, that is wrong. We know that is wrong. And the people who did it knew that it was wrong at the time. That is not an appropriate use of official trade missions. 
This gives rise to all the speculation and allegations concerning the transfer of technology to China. It makes it much more logical or believable when you read about these kinds of things. 
Mr. President, I know this legislation is not perfect. I know that if given the opportunity to offer amendments, many Members would do exactly that, and the measure could be improved. 
For example, I think there would be a majority vote in this body that would raise the individual spending limits to the level of $1,000, which it was in 1974, that some here may not agree with. But I believe the majority would. 
I believe that the Snowe-Jeffords amendment went a long way towards leveling the playing field as far as unions, businesses, and corporations are concerned. I know that there are other ways we could improve this legislation. I know that we can do that if my colleagues would vote for cloture. 
I appeal to my colleagues to muster the courage that led to reform in 1908, 1947, and 1974. 
Mr. President, I ran for public office first in 1982. It was not the kind of money in that campaign that I see today. When I meet a young man or woman who is interested in public office nowadays--I used to ask them, `How do you feel about smaller government, taxes, less regulation?' We would have discussions of the issues. Now there is only one question you ask a young man or woman who is interested in seeking public office. And I might add it seems to be fewer and fewer. The only question is, `Where is the money? Where is the money?' Because, if they don't have the money, obviously no matter how they stand on the issues, no matter how principled they are, and how impressive their resume might be, their chances of achieving public office are dramatically diminished. 
I know that many on this side of the aisle don't agree with all of the provisions of the amendment. I know they recognize that there is a problem--a problem that we have to address. 
This is our opportunity, and if we opt to gridlock over results, we will only fuel the cynicism of the American electorate. 
I want to point out again, every political expert is predicting that we will have the lowest voter turnout in this upcoming election than at any time in history. I think that is a sad commentary. 
I hope we will do what is right to take such steps as necessary to pass meaningful campaign finance reform. Should we fail, we will have only ourselves to blame for the low esteem in which we are held by the American people. We will have done our part to degrade the high office to which we have been elected. We will by our inaction contribute to the alienation of the American people from the people who have sworn an oath to defend their interests. 
As I mentioned, Mr. President, yesterday was primary day in Arizona. Turn out was an all-time low, indicating another record-setting low turnout election day. I have no doubt whatsoever that the way in which we finance our campaigns has in no small measure contributed to the abysmal commentary of the health of our democracy. The people's contempt--there is no more charitable way to describe it--for us and for the way in which we attain our privileged place in government cannot be sustained perpetually. We will someday pay a high price for our inattention to this problem. We will forfeit our ability to lead the country as we meet the complicated challenges confronting us at the end of this century because we have so badly squandered the public respect necessary to persuade the Nation to take the often difficult actions that are required to defend the Nation's interests. 
Our ability to lead depends solely on the public's trust in us. Mr. President, people do not trust us today. And that breach, that calamity, is what the supporters of campaign finance reform intend to repair. I beg all of my colleagues to join in this effort and give our constituents a reason to again trust us, and to take pride in the institution we are so proud to serve. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

There are Senators who want to talk on it. I say in all respect to the Senator from West Virginia, we have just begun this debate. We just had the first opening statements.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will not object because of the Senator from West Virginia, but the fact is we are debating an amendment just as we normally do. And we are under a unanimous consent agreement, which we normally do. The Senator from West Virginia could object to us going into session--we all know that--because we function by unanimous consent. I think it is very unfortunate that when we have, really, now, a day and a half, and we just initiated debate on this very, very critical issue, the Senator has to do that at this time. I will not object.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday I submitted a list of objectionable provisions in the FY'99 Interior Appropriations bill for the Record. I wish to make two clarifications to that list which came to my attention. 
First, I learned that the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project was not requested for a funding level of more than $97 million. Instead, the allocated amount for the NIIP project was equal to the requested level of $25.5 million, but this information was not clear in the committee bill. I removed this item from my list of objectionable provisions. 
Second, two separate listings for the removal of the Elwha dam removal project were requested for funding, based on its authorization in P.L. 102-495. These items should not have been listed as objectionable according to my established `pork criteria.' These two items are removed from the list: (1) $29,500,000 for the purchase of the Elwha Project and Glines Canyon Project; and, (2) $2,000,000 for planning and design, removal of Elwha Dam in Olympic National Park, WA. 
I wish to thank the individuals who brought these matters to my attention and for providing the necessary information to clarify this mistake. 
Mr. President, I wish to state that the revised total amount of $222.4 million included in this bill still represents an inordinately high level of wasteful spending. I sincerely hope that we will do better by the American people with stricter fiscal spending that abides by the appropriate legislative process.

I look forward to vigorous debate in the next couple of days. I know that the majority leader is going to file a cloture motion. I believe it is important that we bring this issue again before the Senate since the House of Representatives obviously acted on this issue. 
I do want to point out that the majority leader has assured me we will have 2 full days of debate on this, which will mean a cloture vote sometime late Thursday afternoon. I appreciate that. I hope that we will on this occasion prevail. I again look forward to a vigorous debate on this issue. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for their hard work in putting forth annual legislation which provides federal funding for all of the agencies within the Department of the Interior, the Indian Health Service and several forestry programs. Many of the programs funded within this bill are vital to the preservation of our National Parks and to protect our precious natural resources.

Mr. McCAIN. Many of the programs within this proposal are meritorious and do deserve funding. However, should American taxpayers foot the bill for rural and economic development programs solely benefitting the State of Alaska? My colleagues have generously included unrequested funding for $1,000,000 to study mineral resources-at-risk in Alaska under the Bureau of Land Management's budget, as well as including $2,000,000 for the same minerals-at-risk program in Alaska under the U.S. Geological Survey budget. The earmarks do not stop there as $3,000,000 is directed to build visitor use facilities in the Katami National Park and Preserve. The panel has also afforded the borough of Ketchikan $2,000,000 to participate in a cooperative study to determine the feasibility of manufacturing veneer products from southeast Alaska. 
Certainly the home state of the Committee's esteemed Chairman is not the only beneficiary of pork-barrel spending. My colleagues have seen to it that the State of Utah will have the funds to build an access road to venues for the winter Olympic Games in 2002. Calling it a `necessity' in their report, the Committee funnels $15,000,000 toward the completion of Trapper's Loop Road. In addition, Utah is also slated to receive $1,300,000 to build recreation facilities for the 2002 Games. What is even more egregious is that these funds are directed to be transferred to Utah before the remaining funding can be dispersed to states for other projects. 
This bill is weighed down by dozens of other wasteful projects which clearly have skirted the public review process, and in many cases do not serve the greater national interest. For example, why must we expend $500,000 of taxpayer dollars on noxious weed issues for the Okanogan and Colville national forests? Or to replace toilet facilities at a price of $320,000 in the Ouachita National Forest? While the American people are proud of their national heritage and history, is it fair to ask them to pay $10,000,000 for a new National Constitution Center in Pennsylvania? 
Mr. President, I do not enjoy coming forth each year for every appropriation bill to decry wasteful spending, but I believe the American taxpayers deserve to know where their hard earned dollars will be spent. Sadly, this bill continues the practice of loading up important spending measures with unnecessary and wasteful pork-barrel projects. I hope that we can restore the faith of the American people in our federal government by honoring our responsibility to them by applying judicious deliberation to our budget process.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the modification, by the way, takes out the provision, at the request of the administration and others, that requires that the North Koreans be fully meeting their obligations under the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. I did that with some reluctance, but, at the same time, the important aspect of this amendment is that the President must certify that North Korea is not actively pursuing the acquisition or development of nuclear capability, other than light-water reactors provided for in the 1994 Agreed Framework between the United States and North Korea. 
I think it is the desire of the distinguished manager that we vote on this amendment. First of all, I ask, if it has not taken place, that the Hutchison second-degree amendment be voice voted at this time.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will make some additional remarks which are so compelling, and as soon as the Senator from Kentucky desires, I will yield so that we can proceed with this vote. I know the Senator from Kentucky is very interested in concluding this legislation, as are the rest of us. Given the conditions in the world today, I argue this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will consider in the Senate. 
Yesterday there was an article in the New York Times, parts of which I think are important to note. 
It is titled `Missile Test By North Korea: Dark Omen for Washington.' Part of the article says: 
The officials and arms experts said the test also suggested that North Korea had made real progress towards building Taepodong-2, which is reportedly capable of traveling 2,400 to 3,600 miles and could strike targets throughout Asia and as far away as Alaska. 
Henry D. Sokolski, the executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington, said the ability to build rockets in stages opened the door to intercontinental missiles, which in theory have virtually unlimited range. 
`We're entering a new era,' Mr. Sokolski said. 
Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, another research organization in Washington, said the missile test was `a clear sign' of North Korea's intent to develop nuclear weapons, despite its 1994 agreement with the United States to stop in exchange for energy assistance. 
Mr. Milhollin said a two-stage missile was too costly to build simply for delivering conventional weapons. `It means they plan to put a nuclear warhead on it or export it to somebody who will,' he said. `The missile makes no sense otherwise.' 
Mr. President, these are important statements. Some argue that perhaps the North Koreans are just simply building a missile and they are not pursuing the acquisition of nuclear weapons. 
As Mr. Milhollin said, it doesn't make sense. Why else would they be building a two-stage rocket without planning also to have that missile armed with a weapon of mass destruction?--from what we have seen in the past, most likely a nuclear weapon. 
I don't want to go through the litany of my complaints about this agreement that was made with North Korea in 1994. I spoke at length on the floor of the Senate and with the media. I did not see any indication that the North Koreans were serious. I did see indications they were in violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to which they were signatories and that we were basically providing them with a bribe. I also believed and still believe that unless the North Koreans understand they have to pay a significant price, then they will continue in this most destabilizing activity. 
The Florida Times Union on August 28 said: 
An argument could be made that Pyongyang feels it must renew its nuclear program to keep people warm, but it also claims it cannot feed its people and has been begging successfully for free rice. If it doesn't have enough money to feed its people, how can it have enough money to build expensive nuclear facilities and two-stage rockets? Pyongyang presumably is taking money that would have been spent on food and heat if not for western charity in building a nuclear arsenal. 
Unfortunately, the administration made it easy for Pyongyang to cheat. The agreement does not require inspections to verify North Korean compliance. Oddly enough, Pyongyang threatened earlier this month to pull out of the agreement over the U.S. failure to lift economic sanctions quickly enough. It has also complained about the lack of progress toward diplomatic ties. Those sound more like excuses to me for cheating on an agreement rather than reasons to break it. Not once since its inception in the aftermath of World War II has North Korea proven itself trustworthy. That makes it difficult for the United States to continue making agreements based purely on trust. 
Mr. Hoagland, probably one of the most respected, if not the most respected, individual commentators on the issues of national security, said:

Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I appreciate the efforts of the distinguished Chairman of the subcommittee who mentioned he has had five hearings on this issue. We obviously paid close attention to the Senator from Wyoming who now feels that the time has come to support this amendment. I believe that the commander of the forces in Korea, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, probably the national security adviser, and even the President, if he knows about the amendment, is probably in opposition. 
I want to tell the Senator from Vermont this agreement was flawed from the beginning. I stood on the floor of the Senate 
and said it would fail. It was a bribe. It was kicking the can down the road. There was no inspections required. The reality is that North Korea, which is the most Orwellian, bizarre government in history, they have a ruler who is--well, he likes to kidnap Japanese movie actresses. We are supposed to trust the word of these people? And they just launched a missile--a two-stage missile--which every arms control expert in America will tell you that you don't build these kind of missiles unless they are armed with weapons of mass destruction. 
This thing was wrong from the start, and everything that we have seen has proven that to be the case, including every major newspaper in America--the L.A. Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and, frankly, the former national security adviser, Mr. Brzezinski, and many others; Dr. Kissinger, and many others. 
For each expert that the Senator from Vermont could present, I could give you one who is as well regarded, or more highly regarded, who feels that it is time that we at least demand that they stop building nuclear weapons. 
I reply to the Senator from Vermont. The amendment simply says that we won't continue to pay them millions of dollars if they in return continue to try to build nuclear weapons, which is what the whole agreement was about, supposedly, to start with. 
I thank the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in going through the fiscal year 1999 foreign operations appropriations bill and accompanying report, I was pleased by the apparent reduction in earmarks and other wasteful and unnecessary spending compared with past years. The fact that part of the reason for this reduction is that programs traditionally funded in the foreign operations bill have been shifted to other appropriations bills only mildly diminishes my enthusiasm for the progress that has been made on this bill. 
Foreign aid programs, as all of us in Congress know, are enormously unpopular with the vast majority of the American populace. That only one percent of the federal budget is allocated for foreign assistance and generally supports U.S. foreign policy objectives does not detract from the extreme disfavor with which the public views the notion of their tax dollars going to foreign countries. It has always been to Congress' credit that it passes foreign aid legislation every year despite public opposition out of this recognition for the very important role aid programs play in facilitating economic growth and social stability in less developed nations. 
While the bill before us includes fewer earmarks for the benefit of parochial or other favored programs, there are still too many. Some of the examples of earmarks and other wasteful spending are annual occurrences. A particularly egregious case in point is the annual $3 million allocation for the International Fertilizer Development Center. An annual provision in the foreign aid bill, it is highly questionable whether the millions of dollars funneled to this program are warranted by its actual value to less developed countries or to the American public. Some justification for this funding, as well as a sense of whether it could and should be competitively awarded, would go a long way toward alleviating my concern about its continued inclusion in this bill. 
The International Law Enforcement Academy for the Western Hemisphere in Roswell, New Mexico is the recipient in this bill of $5 million. This is a classic earmark, matching an activity established and geographically located for parochial reasons. That the bill mandates it receive $5 million simply compounds the injury to the integrity of the federal budget process represented by this project. Clearly, the concept of fiscal responsibility remains alien to members of this body. 
One area in which there has been no discernable improvement is earmarking for specific academic institutions, a practice that wastes millions of dollars every year, either in clearly questionable programs or by failing to mandate competitive bidding processes. The accompanying list includes these 
projects, but a few in particular warrant special mention. The International Integrated Pest Management Training and Research Center at the University of Vermont probably does fine work in the field of pest management--a serious endeavor given the scale of damage to crops regularly inflicted through pest infestations--but directing the Agency for International Development to provide it $1 million without the benefit of a competitive process is typically irresponsible. 
The foreign operations appropriations bill also includes earmarks for the University of Hawaii, University of Northern Iowa, George Mason University, Utah State University, Montana State University, Mississippi State University, and the aforementioned project at the University of Vermont. Of these seven university earmarks, five are located in the states of members of the Appropriations Committee and a sixth is in the state of the Senate majority leader. You don't have to be Hercule Poirot to be suspicious of this pattern. Israel being a desert country and Hawaii being the quintessential tropical climate, it makes perfect sense that they are corroborating on a project involving tropical plants and animals. I strongly encourage AID to look closely at the merits of this project before allocating scarce resources toward it. 
Additional funds are expected to flow to universities through the Collaborative Research Support Projects (CRSPs) for such worthwhile causes as cowpea, peanut, pond dynamics, and sorghum/millet development programs. That the peanut industry enjoys considerable political influence is not news; that the Appropriations Committee wants to allocate funds for research on pond scum, however, is, as Monty Python used to say, `something really different.' 
Finally, S. 2334 continues the onerous practice of minimizing the value of foreign aid dollars through protectionist provisions. While the `Buy America' section of the bill is not mandatory, an appropriations bill automatically carries with it a certain implicit authority. Declaring that, `to the maximum extent possible, assistance provided under this Act should make full use of American resources . . .' is clearly intended to convey a certain message to pertinent federal agencies. The mandatory reporting requirement imposed on these agencies included in this section of the bill can be expected to have precisely that effect. 
Mr. President, the waste and noncompetitive allocations represented in the foreign operations appropriations bill is minuscule relative to the billions literally wasted in the defense and transportation bills on highly questionable programs. Given the disdain with which the American public views foreign aid, however, the types of earmarks specified in the accompanying list represent a serious diversion of scarce resources otherwise needed for truly worthy programs. I regret that Congress feels compelled to continue to act without a sense of restraint, but I have been around long enough to understand that my protestations won't change the system. That I can at least illuminate the problem will have to suffice.

Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate today to express my deep disappointment over the egregious number of low-priority, Congressionally earmarked military construction projects that are contained in the conference report on the Fiscal Year 1999 Military Construction Appropriations Bill. 
I am dismayed that, at a time when our nation's military is perilously close to becoming a `hollow force'--due in great part to a decade of declining defense budgets and increased commitments--members of both bodies have once again directed precious funds away from the services' readiness and modernization needs toward their own parochial interests. I am dismayed, but given the long tradition of egregious member adds, I am not surprised. 
This year's Military Construction Appropriations Bill was crafted under the additional stricture of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. The agreement established firm funding limits to the National Defense budget. With these constraints in place, one would think that it would be difficult for members to even consider adding projects of questionable merit. Sadly, the sheer volume of unrequested, low-priority projects present in this bill--142 domestic projects in all, at a cost of some $977 million--betrays an attitude of `business as usual' by the members of Congress. 
I was encouraged by the fact that there were no new projects added by the conferees as they crafted this compromise legislation. That display of discipline is laudable. However, it pales in comparison to the gross misuse of critical defense dollars to fund members' pet military construction projects. 
Recently the Navy announced that its pilot retention rate is at its lowest point since aviation continuation pay was instituted more than a decade ago. The Air Force is currently retaining only 28 percent of its pilots. The pay of service members lags an embarrassing 14 percent behind the civilian sector. We are deploying some of our forces to combat zones that are not meeting established readiness standards. Cannibalization rates are increasing. Mission capable rates are dropping. Nearly 12,000 personnel are eligible for food stamps. The number and scope of training exercises have been curtailed as a result of insufficient funding, resources and manpower. The list indicating the decaying readiness of our armed forces goes on and on. Unfortunately, the congressional response to these critical deficiencies has not been ideal. 
In this bill alone, there are 45 additional, unrequested Guard and Reserve projects; five control towers at Air Force bases that currently have operational control towers; twelve child development or physical fitness centers; an $8.3 million fence for Fort Bragg; and many more projects of questionable merit--nearly $700 million worth. 
The fact remains that funds for our national defense are limited. We have a duty to ensure our men and women in uniform are ready to fight and win wars decisively, expeditiously, and with minimum loss of life. Robbing from readiness to pay for unadulterated, member sponsored military construction projects does not contribute to that end. 
Mr. President, I look forward to the day when the Military Construction Bill will be devoid of low-priority, member-requested pork. I urge my colleagues to exercise the restraint required to make that day a reality. Now, more than ever, the security of our nation depends upon it.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Helms and Senator Murkowski pertaining to recent events in North Korea: 
The announcement that U.S. intelligence has discovered a very sizable underground construction project in the mountains northeast of the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, and Monday's firing of an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japanese territory. 
Later I intend to propose another amendment expressing the sense of Congress that North Korea should be forcefully condemned for such an openly belligerent act while the United Nations is once again debating cooperative arrangements with the Stalinist regime in Pyongyang. 
This amendment adds to the certification requirements a Presidential certification that North Korea is not pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. The distinction between what is currently in the bill and the provision in this amendment is crucial as it addresses new activities as opposed to those already identified and incorporated into the 1994 Agreed Framework. 
Mr. President, it is instructive to go back in time and review the history of North-South relations on the Korean peninsula. Last summer, I came to the floor and submitted for the Record a comprehensive list compiled by the Congressional Research Service of North Korean provocations since its inception following the Second World War. That list detailed numerous terrorist acts, intelligence-related submarine incursions into South Korean territory, kidnappings of Japanese nationals for intelligence purposes, and armed incursions across the demilitarized zone. 
At that point, I noted that the list illuminated an extraordinarily consistent North Korean pattern of alternating minor and manipulative gestures of goodwill with acts of terror and provocation toward its South Korean neighbor. To that list, we can now add new provocations towards Japan and the United States. 
And make no mistake--Monday's missile firing was a message to the Japanese and to us that North Korea can strike our vital interests throughout the region. Japan's declaration of intent to terminate funding in support of the Agreed Framework should be supported and followed in kind by the United States. 
At the time I spoke last summer, yet another North Korea-instigated border altercation had just transpired. Go back and look at the newspaper headlines pertaining to Korea at that time. The July 15, 1997, Washington Post included an article titled `U.S. Says it Will Double Food Aid to North Korea.' The following day, wire stories were headlined `Korea-Border Gunfire Exchanged.' That contrast is discouragingly consistent. Offers to agree to negotiate a final peace agreement with the South or provisions of food aid for North Korea's starving people regularly alternate with serious, often bloody transgressions against the South. But, the missile firing, while not entirely unexpected, expands significantly the scale of the threat to regional peace and stability posed by North Korea. 
At the time the Agreed Framework was signed in October 1994, I expressed grave misgivings about its viability. I spoke at length on the floor of the Senate regarding North Korea's abysmal record of compliance with its previous commitments regarding its nuclear weapons program, listing nine such violations. Further, I emphasized the danger of an agreement that failed to adequately provide for full inspections of current and past nuclear sites, as well as of future such activities, prior to the provision of assistance to the North Koreans. Four years and $86 million later, we are no more confident than we have ever been about North Korea's intentions and capabilities in the nuclear realm. I predicted back then that North Korea would violate the spirit and the letter of the Agreed Framework, and I believe today that I was correct.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce legislation, along with my colleague, Senator Jon Kyl, that will preserve a valuable tract of park land for future public enjoyment in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona. This proposal authorizes the U.S. Forest Service to develop a management plan to maintain the current recreational use of 583 acres known as Woodland Lake Park. 
Mr. President, I want to laud the cooperation forged between the U.S. Forest Service and the town of Pinetop-Lakeside. The initiative requires the acting supervisor of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, under the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture, to work with the town to ensure Woodland Lake Park remains open and accessible to the public. The parties will have 180 days to draft a management plan for the park. 
Although the town of Pinetop-Lakeside seeks to one day acquire Woodland Lake Park, the management of this land by the Forest Service is crucial to preserving this resource in the interim. Federal oversight will ensure that the estimated 50,000 residents every year who take pleasure in the lake and along the beautiful wooded trails will continue to do so for years to come. 
I look forward to continued constructive collaboration between the Forest Service and the town of Pinetop-Lakeside. I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be entered into the Record.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Delaware, who obviously is very knowledgeable on this issue and has stayed focused on these issues for many, many years. 
I also wish to thank the Senator from Indiana for his very forceful presentation. 
Mr. President, I believe everyone in this body knows that I have long had serious concerns about our mission in Bosnia. From the time the IFOR mission was first briefed to the Congress, I knew the job could not be completed in one year--nor against any arbitrary deadline. Instead, I urged the Administration to set concrete objectives and benchmarks for measuring success. 
Now, as many members have pointed out, we are in an open-ended and ill-defined military commitment. The Administration has scrapped all the artificial deadlines. But no clear set of objectives and well-defined military missions has taken its place. We seem to drift in and out of going after war criminals, of using the military to resettle refugees, and of taking on a direct political role in parts of Bosnia in the name of supporting international civilian authorities. The role of our military has expanded, and there is no end in sight. 
The answer to this problem, however, is not to go back and set new artificial deadlines or troop levels. And make no mistake about it, Mr. President. The amendment before us is little different than the one the Senate rejected last month. 
Bosnia is a long-term, complicated problem. It involves not only the warring factions, but has direct effects on Croatia and Serbia, including Kosovo, and threatens to spill over to the wider Balkan region. The credibility of NATO and especially the United States is tied up with finding a solution for the Bosnia crisis. It would be sheer irresponsibility, probably leading to renewed warfare, if we were to precipitously pull Out of Bosnia after investing so much. It would be a betrayal of our commitment to cooperating with our Allies. And it could well lead to an even more costly and dangerous re-introduction of American forces to stop the renewed fighting. 
Dealing with the Bosnia crisis--even if though our objective is to get American troops out of there--requires treating Bosnia as a serious long-term challenge. It is not an issue that lends itself to artificial deadlines for withdrawal. Nor is there any rationale to forcing the Congress to vote by some artificial deadline. Worse still would be a funding cut-off, which would only punish our troops for the failure of policy makers in Washington to craft a viable long term policy. 
I would like to offer six principles that I believe should guide our policy:

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in Secretary Cohen and General Shelton's letter the Senator from Indiana just referred to, it is very important to understand what they are saying here: 
Under a legislated approach, military commanders will be forced to restructure their force and mission tasks based on an arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on mission accomplishment, operational considerations and the fluid tactical situation they face. In addition, while those opposed to the Dayton Accords have been steadily isolated and diminished in their influence, legislating withdrawal of reduction dates would invite heightened intransigence and extremism. 
So that is the view of the people to whom we entrust the care of our men and women in the military. 
I think it would be very appropriate to have a vigorous and, I think, illuminating debate on the issue of whether the troops should be there at all. Congress clearly has the right to cut off funding for any military operation anywhere in the world. But I see nowhere in the Constitution where we have the right to, indeed, decide the levels of troops that should be there. I pride myself on the fact that I had some time in the service of our country wearing a uniform, but no way does that give me the expertise or the knowledge to set a troop level. That responsibility is entrusted to our civilian and military commanders. 
So it is with reluctance, because I agree with the thrust of what Senator Hutchison is saying, Mr. President, I move to table the Hutchison amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Nearing the moment, I think, according to the previous unanimous consent agreement, for me to make a motion to table, I would just like to make one quick point. 
Back several years ago, in 1990, I was speaking in support of an amendment--in support of the Bush administration, the President of the United States, not in opposition. And it was a peacetime deployment to Korea, a rearrangement of forces, not the situation in Bosnia. An important factor is, I was supporting the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense. 
The Hutchison amendment is in opposition to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense, as well as the President of the United States. 
I think there is a significant difference there. 
Second, one of the Members came to the floor and said that we need to debate this more. As the Senator from Indiana pointed out, this is the same amendment we voted on last May; basically, fundamentally the same thing. We did have lots of debate on it. 
As the distinguished chairman of the committee pointed out, we have 50 or 60 amendments that we need to address between tonight and tomorrow, all of which deserve also very thorough debate and discussion, as well, if we expect to get out at a reasonable timeframe either tomorrow or Saturday or Sunday, as the distinguished chairman and ranking member point out. 
The hour of 5:30 having arrived, I move to table the Hutchison amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be brief. I rise to offer an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 on behalf of Senator Kyl and myself. The amendment would authorize the Secretary of The Air Force to enter into an agreement to lease from the City of Phoenix, Arizona a parcel of land near Luke Air Force Base that is known as Auxiliary Field 3 for a cost not in excess of one dollar. 
I offer this amendment because the U.S. Air Force may foresee a need to acquire or lease land near Luke Air Force Base to more effectively manage public and private development compatibility with the Luke Air Force Base mission. Many communities on the west side of Phoenix are dedicated to ensuring that the Air Force has the additional flexibility it may need in the near and long term to meet Air Force operational and training requirements and preserve its overall readiness. 
Mr. President, this simple amendment is discretionary in nature and meets the criteria which I have ensured that my colleagues must meet when amendments are offered to appropriations bills. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a simple amendment to the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Appropriations bill on behalf of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and myself that merits bipartisan support and speedy passage. 
My amendment would repeal the limitations on the military departments to waive the requirement for reimbursement of expenses for foreign students at the service academies. Clearly, the authority to set rates and waive reimbursement expenses for persons from foreign countries undergoing instruction at U.S. service academies should rest with our military departments and not be subject to limitations on their ability to determine the costs of instruction of foreign nationals. 
Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee included this provision in its version of the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization bill, however it was subsequently dropped in Conference. The service academy superintendents all support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. President, I request that letters of support of my amendment from the service academy superintendents and others be placed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.

 Mr. McCAIN. 
Mr. President, today I am proud to rise with my colleague and dear friend, John Kerry, to introduce legislation which would help provide thousands, if not millions, of children with health care coverage. Clearly, a bipartisan priority in the 105th Congress has been to find a solution for providing access to health insurance for the approximately 10 million uninsured children in our nation. This matter has been a very high priority for me since coming to Congress. The legislation we are introducing today, the `Children's Health Assurance through the Medicaid Program' (CHAMP), would help our states reach more than 3 million uninsured children who are eligible for the Medicaid program but not enrolled. 
The consequences of lack of insurance are problematic for everyone, but they are particularly serious for children. Uninsured and low income children are less likely to receive vital primary and preventative care services. This is quite discouraging since it is repeatedly demonstrated that regular health care visits facilitate the continuity of care which plays a critical role in the development of a healthy child. For example, one analysis found that children living in families with incomes below the poverty line were more likely to go without a physician visit than those with Medicaid coverage or those with other insurance. The result is many uninsured, low-income children not seeking health care services until they are seriously sick. 
Studies have further demonstrated that many of these children are more likely to be hospitalized or receive their care in emergency rooms, which means higher health care costs for conditions that could have been treated with appropriate outpatient services or prevented through regular check ups. 
Last year, as Congress was searching for ways to reduce the number of uninsured children, I kept hearing about children who are uninsured, yet, could qualify for health care insurance through the Medicaid program. I was unable to find specific information about who these children are, where they reside, and why they are not enrolled in the Medicaid program. Subsequently, I requested that the General Accounting Office conduct an in-depth analysis to provide Congress data on uninsured Medicaid eligible children. This information would provide the necessary tools to develop community outreach strategies and education programs to address this problem. 
The GAO study was completed in March. The data shows that 3.4 million children are eligible for the Medicaid program (under the minimum federal standards) but are not enrolled. It also shows that these kids are more likely to be part of a working family with parents who are employed but earning a low income. A significant number of these children come from two-parent families rather than single-parent families. The study also discovered that more than thirty-five percent of these children are Hispanic, with seventy-four percent of them residing in Southern or Western states. Finally, the GAO report suggested that states need to be developing and implementing creative outreach and enrollment strategies which specifically target the unenrolled children. 
It is important that we build upon these findings and develop methods for states to reach out to these families and educate them about the resources which exist for their children. The CHAMP bill is an important step in this process and would assist these children by expanding the state offices which can presume Medicaid eligibility for a child. 
As you know, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act provided states with the option of utilizing `presumptive eligibility' as an outreach method for enrolling eligible children into their state Medicaid programs. Presumptive eligibility allows certain agencies to temporarily enroll children in the state Medicaid program for a brief period if the child appears to be eligible for the program based on their family's income. Health care services can be provided to these children if necessary during this `presumptive' period while the state Medicaid agency processes the child's application and makes a final determination of their eligibility. 
Presumptive eligibility is completely optional for the states and is not mandatory. 
Under current law, states are only given the limited choice of using a few specific community agencies for presumptive eligibility including: Head Start Centers, WIC clinics, Medicaid providers and state or local child care agencies. The McCain-Kerry CHAMP bill would expand the types of community-based organizations which would be recognized as qualified entities and permitted to presume eligibility for children. Under our bill, public schools, entities operating child welfare programs under Title IV-A, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) offices and the new Children Health Insurance Program (CHIP) offices would be permitted to help identify Medicaid eligible kids. Allowing more entities to participate in outreach would increase the opportunities for screening children and educating their families about the Medicaid services available to them. By increasing the `net' for states, we would be helping them `capture' more children who are going without health care services because their families are not familiar, comfortable or aware of the Medicaid program and its enrollment process. 
Our bill would help millions of children gain access to health care without creating a new government program, imposing mandates on states, or expanding the role of government in our communities. This is important to note--we would not be creating new agencies, bureaucracies or benefits. Instead we would be increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of a long-standing program designed to help one of our most vulnerable populations, children. We urge our colleagues to support this innovative piece of legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the effort to pass legislation dealing with biomaterials has been a long fight. I want to thank Senator Lieberman, and Congressman Gekas for their extraordinary leadership and hard work on the issue. It has been a great privilege and honor working with them over the past several years to gain passage of this vital legislation. 
I want to stress to my colleagues the importance of passing the Biomaterial Access Assurance Act. Over seven million lives depend upon an ample and reliable supply of medical devices and implants, such as pace makers and brain shunts. 
Unfortunately, the supply of these life-saving products is in serious danger. Those who provide the raw materials from which medical implants are fashioned have been dragged into costly litigation over claims of damage from the finished product. This is the case even though such suppliers are not involved in the design, manufacture or sale of the implant. Many suppliers are unwilling to expose themselves to this enormous and undue risk. This bill will extend appropriate protection to raw material suppliers, while assuring that medical implant manufacturers will remain liable for damages caused by their products. It would permit suppliers of biomaterials to be quickly dismissed from a lawsuit if they did not manufacture or sell the implant and if they met the contract specifications for the biomaterial. 
Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, the bill's provisions do not extend to suppliers of silicone gel and silicone envelopes used in silicone gel breast implants. 
I want to be quite clear this `carve-out' as it's been called, is intended to have no effect on tort cases related to breast implants. The question of whether and to what degree silicone breast implants are hazardous is a determination that must be made by scientific experts. The question of whether and to what degree raw material suppliers are or are not liable is a determination that the courts must render. 
Determining the safety or efficacy of a medical device is not the function of the Senate nor the United States Congress. This is not our role and nothing in this legislation should be construed otherwise. So, the exemption should not be interpreted as a judgement about silicone breast implants. 
Our goal in this regard remains simply to ensure that this legislation draws no conclusion about and has no impact upon pending suits. 
Finally, I would like to mention that this exemption should not be considered an invitation for additional carve-outs or exemptions for other raw material or component part suppliers. 
I do not wish to see suppliers, who trusting in the protections of this act, return to the medical device manufacturing marketplace only to find themselves again targeted as deep pockets in tort actions, and thereby threaten the supply of life saving products. I appreciate the opportunity to make this very important point about a bill vital to public health. 
This is an important piece of legislation and it will make a great difference to millions of Americans. 
Mr. President, I would now like to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin regarding several aspects of this legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. No. Although I do not believe that the situation you pose could happen very often--specifically that a supplier could be liable when the manufacturer is not--the language should be interpreted to mean that the claimant could bring a motion to implead the supplier whether or not the manufacturer is found liable in the underlying case, as long as the judgment is final.

Mr. McCAIN. Under current FDA regulations and under current tort law, the manufacturer is responsible for the entire product they produce, including defects in the raw materials. Therefore, the claimant may enter evidence in the underlying action against the manufacturer regarding defect in the biomaterials used.

This covers bankruptcy and other scenarios where the manufacturer cannot satisfy an adverse judgment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill for their hard work in putting forth this legislation which provides federal funding for numerous vital programs. The Senate will soon vote to adopt the Treasury and General Appropriations Bill for the Fiscal Year 1999. I intend to support this measure because it provides funding for the Treasury Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies. 
Mr. President, as elected officials, we bear no greater responsibility than to see the American people's hard earned tax dollars utilized in the most prudent fashion. We must remain committed to open and fair consideration of public expenditures. Our objective must always be to further the greatest public good. This must remain the cornerstone of the appropriations process. 
I admit that this is a difficult task. Each year the appropriators face the daunting task of supporting necessary governmental activities and balancing additional competing interests for funding. However, this is a challenge that we must firmly uphold with integrity. I come forward to this body to once again declare that we are undermining the national faith by continuing the practice of earmarking and inappropriately designating funding for projects based on erroneous criteria rather than national priority and necessity. 
After reviewing the Treasury Postal Appropriations Bill, it is painfully clear the subcommittee has not lost its appetite for pork-barrel spending. This bill has been fattened up with vast amounts of low-priority, unnecessary and wasteful spending. In fact, this appropriations bill contains well over $826 million in specifically earmarked pork-barrel spending. This is more than $791 million more than last year's pork-barrel spending total for this bill, which only contained $34.25 million in wasted funds. In addition, the bill and report directs that current year spending be maintained for hundreds of projects, without being specific about any dollar amount. 
We now have the first unified-budget surplus in nearly 30 years. CBO projects that we will have $1.6 billion of budget surpluses over the next 10 years. However, if we continue with our current levels of wasteful spending, these budget surpluses may not occur. Pork-barrel spending today not only robs well-deserving programs of much needed funds, it also jeopardizes our fiscal well-being into the next century. I would be remiss if I did not inform the American public of the seriousness and magnitude of wasteful spending endorsed by this body. These individual earmarks may not seem extravagant. However, taken together, they represent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to low priority programs at the expense of numerous programs that have undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. I take very strong exception to a large number of provisions in the bill before us today.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as a strong supporter of the credit union industry, I rise to express my support for H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, on which the Senate will vote today. 
As my colleagues are aware, this bill was overwhelmingly passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 411-8. I anticipate that the support for this bill in the Senate will reflect that of the House of Representatives, and will again pass with a notable bipartisan majority. 
Mr. President, this issue came to the forefront when the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Credit Union's arguments for increasing the size of their base membership. While I understand the objections which the banks raised regarding the growth of credit unions, I have always believed that consumers should have the broadest range of choices in financial services. 
I support the Credit Union Membership Access Act because I believe that members on both sides of the aisle have worked hard to ensure that this bill is fair and balanced and protects both the rights and securities of consumers.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, this week is the 8th anniversary of the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I would like to take a moment to remember this pivotal moment in the history of our nation's disabled community. 
As one of the principal sponsors of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), I am proud of the array of opportunities which have been opened by this law for millions of our citizens with disabilities, setting a standard of inclusion for the world. In the eight years since the ADA was enacted, our nation has become more accessible for people with a broad array of disabilities, who now have greater opportunities than ever before. This law has empowered millions of disabled Americans with both the confidence and the tools necessary to live an independent and fulfilling life. 
We must continue working together to ensure that the laudable goals of the ADA are achieved efficiently, equitably, and amicably. Continuing fair and reasonable implementation of this essential law will ensure that all people with disabilities have the opportunity to achieve their full potential. I look forward to a day when all Americans are rewarded for their abilities, not punished for their disabilities, and when Americans with disabilities face no barriers to achieving their highest goals. 
While some problems have occurred during the implementation of the ADA, most Americans have responded positively and creatively to this important, but sometimes complicated law. I remain committed to working with both public and private entities in their efforts to implement the ADA as intended at its creation. 
It is my firm belief that the ADA has helped demystify the world of disabilities and break down many barriers which have traditionally existed for the disabled. It has educated our nation and the world about the capabilities of all disabled individuals and achieved major transformations in society. I remain supportive of the achievements of the ADA and all that it has done for our nation over the past eight years, and I look forward to a future free of obstacles for all Americans.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to recognize an organization which began in 1988 with three Arizona businessmen on a fishing trip to Costa Rica. While there, they learned that regular voter turnout in that country was routinely 90 percent. They credit this to the Costa Rican tradition of having children accompany their parents to the polls. They observed first-hand the success this small country had achieved by instilling in children at an early age the importance of voting in a democracy. 
The three Arizona businessmen took this idea back to the United States with them and began `Kids Voting USA'. Today, this nonprofit, nonpartisan, grassroots organization is active in 40 states plus the District of Columbia, and includes 5 million students, 200,000 teachers, and 6,000 schools, and is growing fast. 
With voter turnout declining each year, this organization recognizes the need to educate our youth and instill in them respect for the right and the duty to vote. `Kids Voting USA' enables students to accompany their parent or guardian to local polling sites to cast a ballot similar to the official ballot. Although not a part of the official results, the students' vote are registered at schools and by the media. 
Mr. President, this year, Kids Voting Day is September 29th. I would like to recognize `Kids Voting USA' and commend them for all they have done to promote the future of democracy by educating and involving youth in the American election process.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Hazardous Materials Transportation Reauthorization Act of 1998. This legislation is identical to the reauthorizing provisions approved by the Senate earlier this year under Subtitle B of Title III of S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998. 
Mr. President, the Commerce Committee spent considerable time and effort developing and debating the safety provisions that were incorporated into the ISTEA reauthorization bill, ultimately entitled the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century--TEA--21 (P.L. 105-178). Once in conference with our House counterparts, we were faced with many difficult decisions and compromises. The one area that we did not reach agreement regarded the provisions associated with the Hazardous Materials Transportation programs administered by the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) of the Department of Transportation. 
Since the House had not acted to reauthorize this program in its version of ISTEA reauthorizing legislation, we found ourselves unable to reach agreement on including it in the conference report. Therefore, the Senate must again take action to reauthorize the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. 
Mr. President, I want to stress that this bill I am introducing today is identical to the hazardous materials reauthorization the Senate passed earlier this year. The legislation proposing reauthorizes funding for programs that ensure the safe transportation of hazardous materials. It also includes a number of provisions requested by the Administration that are intended to strengthen and improve the hazardous materials transportation program. And again Mr. President, I will reiterate, this bill is identical to the proposal passed by the Senate on March 12, 1998. 
Mr. President, it is very important for the Congress to complete its work and reauthorize all of our nation's critical transportation safety programs. Therefore, I will be seeking to move this legislation through the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in the very near future.

At least once a year, sometimes more often, we have to vote on whether we want to make progress on relations with Vietnam or whether we want to go back to a situation which existed for many years after the war. This would prevent the opening of a consulate in South Vietnam. It would basically prohibit us from being able to make progress on the resolution of the POW/MIA issue, which every objective observer in the Pentagon says has been going along well, and it would, frankly, inhibit our ability to reach a full accounting.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill for their hard work in putting forth annual legislation which provides federal funding for numerous vital programs. The Senate will soon vote to adopt the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill for the Fiscal Year 1999. I intend to support this measure because it provides funding for fighting crime, enhancing drug enforcement, and responding to threats of terrorism. This further addresses the shortcomings of the immigration process, continues the operating of the judicial process, facilitates commerce throughout the United States, and fulfills the needs of the State Department and various other agencies. 
However, I regret that I must again come forward this year to object to the millions of unrequested, low-priority, wasteful spending in this bill and its accompanying report. This year's bill has $361 million in pork-barrel spending. This is a slight improvement over last year's FY 98 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill, which contained $384.2 million in pork-barrel spending. However, $361 million is still an unacceptable amount of money to spend on low-priority, unrequested, wasteful projects. In short, Congress must curb its appetite for such unbridled spending. 
The multitude of unrequested earmarks buried in this proposal will undoubtedly further burden the American taxpayers. 
This statement highlighting wasteful and unnecessary spending in authorization and appropriations bills may appear to be a mere political ploy. This is not the case. $361 million spent on locality-specific, special interests, pork-barrel projects is not mere rhetoric. Wasteful spending of this amount warrants serious debate. Wasteful spending of this magnitude erodes the public's trust in our system of government. 
Sunshine is often the best disinfectant. Congress and the American public must be made aware of the magnitude of wasteful spending endorsed by this body. While the amounts associated with each individual earmark may not seem extravagant, taken together, they represent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to low priority programs at the expense of numerous programs that have undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. I take very strong exception to a large number of provisions in the bill before us today. 
I have compiled a lengthy list of the numerous add-ons, earmarks, and special exemptions provided to individual projects in this bill. It would take a substantial amount of time to recite this list to you. Instead, I request unanimous consent to include this list in the Record. However, I will discuss some of the more troubling provisions of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill in detail. 
$12 million is earmarked for the Director of the United States Information Agency in the state of Hawaii, in order to provide for carrying out the provisions of the Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West Act of 1960, and an additional $7 million dollars is earmarked for the East-West Center in Hawaii. 
$3 million is earmarked in this bill to carry out the provisions of the North/South Center Act of 1991 in Florida, known as the North/South Center, and, an additional $500,000 is earmarked in this bill for the North/South Center in Florida. 
$925,000 is set aside to allow the Utah State Olympic Public Safety Command to continue to develop and support a public safety program for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
$5 million is earmarked for the Utah Communication Agency Network for upgrades of security and communications infrastructure for law enforcement needed for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
An earmark of $750,000 to fund Chesapeake oyster research at Texas State University. 
Why are we spending $22.5 million on the East-West and North/South Centers alone. What makes these centers so extraordinary that they receive specific earmarks in this Appropriations bill. I am not condemning the North/South or East-West Centers. Nor am I condemning the merits of the purposes they serve. I am simply condemning the manner which they are receiving scarce government funds. 
I am sure there are other centers throughout the U.S. which serve the same or similar missions as the North-South and East-West Centers. Other well-deserving projects of merit and national necessity deserve to compete for the scarce funds gobbled up by locality specific earmarks such as the North/South and East-West Centers. Unfortunately, these projects will never receive fair deliberation if the Appropriations Committee pre-determines their fate by `recommending' and `urging' the Department to give special consideration to certain projects over others. In sum, it is patently unfair to divert scarce resources to pork-barrel, special interest projects, at the expense of well-deserving projects which would benefit the public as a whole. 
The bill also contains language that directs the Immigration and Naturalization Service to expand the duty station in Grand Junction, Colorado. Moreover, this language directs the INS to open new duty stations in Alamosa, Glenwood Springs, Craig, Durango, and Greely, Colorado. The Committee does not explain why specific sites are higher in priority than others, or why these sites are more deserving of funding. I fail to comprehend why these locations should receive such special attention while the rest of the nation must compete for funds in the appropriate merit-based selection process. 
Mr. President, I will not deliberate much longer on this subject, but I strongly object to the wasteful spending in this Appropriations bill. How can we combat the American public's cynicism towards our governmental system when we continue to fund low-priority, wasteful pork-barrel projects? 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the Capitol and on both sides of the aisle to develop a better standard which curbs our habit of funneling hard-earned taxpayer dollars to locality-specific special interests. Commitment to the public good must continue to be our priority. We can only live up to this challenge by eliminating the practice of catering to low-priority special interests, at the expense of the average American. 
As I have said in the past, I look forward to the day when Congress can present to the American people a budget that is both fiscally responsible and ends the practice of wasteful pork-barrel spending in Appropriations bills.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate has completed action on several of the annual appropriations bills that fund the federal government and its many programs. 
The appropriations bills that have cleared the Senate to date contain many good provisions and generally provide appropriate levels of funding to continue the necessary functions of the federal government. But, Mr. President, these bills regretfully continue the practice of earmarking billions of taxpayers dollars for pork-barrel projects. 
Over my tenure in Congress, I have consistently fought Congressional earmarks that direct money to particular projects or recipients, believing that such decisions are far better made through competitive, merit-based guidelines and procedures. 
Traditionally, earmarking has been more geared to political interests rather than public needs and priorities. Highway demonstration projects, earmarked by Congress, have been a classic case-in-point. Most of these projects, which totals more than $9 billion in the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), don't even appear on state priority lists. 
The same is true for many other Congressional earmarks. I find this an appalling waste of taxpayer dollars. And, S. 2307 is typical of the types of earmarks and set-asides that Members add to the multi-billion dollar appropriations bills we annually consider. 
This bill and report earmark more than $1.1 billion for site-specific bridge repairs and airport projects, research activities at selected universities, intelligent transportation projects, ferry systems, road improvements in ski areas, state-specific snow removal activities, bus purchases and transit projects. 
Mr. President, S. 2307 continues Amtrak's subsidies yet goes so far to concoct yet a new spending scheme to pay for its operating costs. I will be proposing an amendment to ensure Amtrak's financial situation is not a moving target and that the integrity of the reform legislation enacted just over six months ago is not jeopardized by the proposals in this measure. 
This bill further earmarks several million dollars of Amtrak's capital funds for new projects associated with Amtrak. The Committee report earmarks $1.4 million to relocate an Amtrak passenger station in Pennsylvania, $2.5 million to refurbish two turbo trainsets for Amtrak's empire corridor, and $1 million to install a speed monitoring system on locomotives operating between New Haven, CT and Boston, MA. The report also directs that $800,000 be used to restore the historic Southern Pines, NC, railroad station, which is owned by the State of North Carolina and served by Amtrak's Silver Star route. 
Didn't the Congress agree last year that Amtrak needs to operate like a legitimate business? Isn't that why we approved legislation which placed Amtrak on a glidepath to free itself of operating subsidies? How is directing Amtrak to carry out these projects or requiring it to spend its resources on certain stations going to help Amtrak ever achieve its financial goals? Amtrak should be permitted to expend its funds on those projects it deems most critical, not on projects required by the whims of Congress. 
Mr. President, in addition to the types of earmarking I have mentioned, the Appropriators have taken a number of actions that fall squarely under the authorizers' duties. For example, the bill would prohibit the Coast Guard from implementing any new navigation user fees. This means the Administration would be prevented from implementing even reasonable new user fees. I understand the concerns that the user fee proposed by the Administration are discriminatory in that they would target only certain users of the navigation system, but the language in the bill is overly restrictive. 
Mr. President, there are some small earmarks in this year's transportation appropriations bill as well as some very large earmarks. For example: 
More than 80 percent of the total funding provided for Intelligent Transportation Systems deployment projects are earmarked. The bill specifically sets aside more than $84 million for projects in 20 cities and counties, and in 13 states. 
Although no dollar amounts are set for individual bus projects, the bill prohibits the Federal Transit Administration from using any of the $393,550,000 provided in the bill for any project not designated in S. 2307. All of the 150 TEA-21 authorized bus projects are included in the bill, and more than 150 new projects are named. Some of these projects have been earmarked in the past and others are new additions to the bus earmark parade. 
The appropriators have earmarked all of the $902,800,000 provided for the new transit and transit system extensions program. Many of the projects are unauthorized and were not requested by the Administration. 
Examples of the earmarks for unauthorized projects include $2.5 million for multimodal transportation in Albuquerque/Santa Fe, New Mexico; $8 million for a transitway corridor in North Miami; and $250,000 for a micro rail trolley system in Sioux City, IA. 
Why are the appropriators so reluctant to permit projects to be awarded based on a competitive and meritorious process that would be fair for all the states and local communities? I suspect it is due to the fact they doubt the merits and worth of the very projects they are earmarking. 
The bill contains a legislative amendment to section 1110 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA). By making a simple definitional change, the provision would modify ANILCA to permit helicopters to land in all conservation system units in Alaska, including National Forests, National Wildlife Refuges, National Parks, and National Wilderness Areas. The legislative changes could result in large-scale helicopter tourism in these sensitive conservation system units. The transportation appropriations bill is not the appropriate forum to address a controversial environmental issue. A helicopter's ability to hover over an area is disruptive to wildlife, including large game species and nesting birds. In addition, the capability of a helicopter to land in areas where airplanes cannot causes concern for the integrity of the habitat. 
I have only mentioned a few of the examples of earmarks and special projects contained in this measure and I will not waste the time of the Senate going over each and every earmark. 
Mr. President, I also want to express the critical need for Congress to send a very clear message to Secretary Slater regarding the Department of Transportation's treatment of the committee report accompanying this bill. Earlier this week, I chaired a hearing on the Department's actions regarding discretionary funding decisions. Believe it or not, some of the DOT modal administrations do not even understand the clear delineation regarding statutory bill language and a committee report. While I did my best to impress upon these modes--particularly the Federal Transit Administration--that report language does not have the effect of law, I am still not sure they get it. 
Therefore, I urge Secretary Slater to take immediate action to educate his Department on the very clear and significant differences between the bill language and report language. Report language is not law. Report language does not have the effect of law. Report language is advisory. It's as simple as that.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very concerned over this bill's proposal concerning Amtrak's funding and will offer an amendment to ensure the proposed scheme does not jeopardize the integrity of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, P.L. 105-134, enacted on December 2, 1997. 
Congress worked for a number of years in a bipartisan manner and each side accepted compromises in order to provide Amtrak with the statutory reforms it said it needed to allow it a real chance to meet its financial goals. The reform bill was based on both Amtrak's Strategic Business Plan, a plan charting Amtrak's financial operating and capital needs, and its federal grant request. And of course, its ultimate approval was the key to releasing the $2.2 billion `tax credit' for capital investment. 
As my colleagues well know, I am not a proponent of a system that was intended to be privatized two years after it was created in 1971, but instead today has racked up more than $21 billion in taxpayer support even though it serves less than one percent of the traveling public. However, I worked in good faith with my colleagues and compromised to enable enactment of a legitimate reform bill. 
I have been standing by the deal I cut. I have done nothing to hinder Amtrak nor have I offered proposals to prevent it from having the opportunity to fulfill its goals. But am I the only one who believes a deal is a deal? 
Mr. President, I am sick and tired of the Administration and Amtrak seeking to change the agreement which is law. 
First the law required the establishment of an 11-member Amtrak Reform Council (ARC) comprised of individuals appointed by the House, Senate, and the President. The ARC is responsible for evaluating Amtrak's performance and make recommendations to Amtrak for further cost containment, productivity improvements, and financial reforms. The ARC is required to submit annual reports to Congress and it is responsible for determining if Amtrak is meeting its financial goals. 
While the House and Senate fulfilled its duties to appoint its members, the President has yet to make all of his appointments. As such, Senator Lott, myself, and Congressman Shuster encouraged the appointed members to meet and begin carrying out its duties. 
It seems the Administration thought they could hold up the ARC from doing its work if it dragged its feet long enough but that is not the case. In fact, the Department of Transportation even resisted fulfilling its administrative duties associated with the ARC in an attempt to hinder the ARC. But the ARC members have not let DOT hold them back and they have begun a steady meeting schedule. 
Next the law called for a new Reform Board to replace the Amtrak Board of Directors serving at the time of enactment. Since we expect Amtrak to try to reinvent itself and to operate like a real business, we included a provision to allow a new leadership to guide Amtrak and instill a `new culture' among Amtrak employees and management. 
Mr. President, several provisions concerning the establishment of the new Board were included in the reform bill in an attempt to prompt timely action by the Administration and Congress. Unfortunately, the spirit of these provisions was met with little regard. 
The law required the new Board to be in place by March 31, 1998. Yet, the Senate did not receive even a single nomination from the President until the eve of the Memorial Day Recess. Due to concerns that the Administration may drag its feet indefinitely, Amtrak's authorization was linked to the nomination and confirmation of a new Board. Specifically, the law provides that if the new Reform Board has not assumed the responsibilities of the Amtrak Board of Directors before July 1st, Amtrak's authorization would lapse. The law also automatically discharged pending Board nominations from the Senate Commerce Committee if the Committee had failed to act by June 1st. 
Presidential nominations require Senate confirmation, with hearings and review by the appropriate Senate Committees accompanying nominations. Yet due to the lack of timely action by the Administration, the Commerce Committee had no opportunity to carry out its duties prior to the statutory automatic June 1st discharge. It is my view the Administration's timing was a direct attempt to circumvent the Commerce Committee's authority in this regard. 
Mr. President, my position regarding the new Board was made clear from day one. I repeatedly voiced my concerns to the Administration each time I heard rumors of its plans to reappoint current members. I was very clear that the Commerce Committee would not report favorably any Board hold-overs and I remained firm on that position. I truly believed even the Administration would acknowledge we didn't create a new Board only to reappoint the same members. 
So what happened? The Administration sent up the nominations as Congress headed into a recess. Two of the six nominations needing confirmation were Board holdovers--that is, one-third. As I have said before, the Administration must have known that the Commerce Committee would be unable to fulfill its hearings and review prior to the statutory discharge date, given the Administration's stealth nomination submission. 
However, in an effort to ensure Amtrak's authorization remained intact, I again worked in good faith with the Majority Leader and others to confirm some of the nominations in order to meet the deadline. The Commerce Committee now has an opportunity to consider whether the pending Board nominees should be approved and sent to the full Senate for a vote. 
The law further provides for Amtrak to be free of operating subsidies within five years. If the ARC determines Amtrak is not meeting its fiscal goals, the ARC is to develop a plan for an alternative system. At the same time, Amtrak is to develop a plan for its liquidation. If at such time this occurs, the Congress will then need to approve a restructuring plan, or the liquidation proceeds. 
As I've mentioned, the sunset trigger is contingent upon Amtrak meeting its fiscal goals and being free of operating subsidies by fiscal year 2002. Yet the Administration is again attempting to get around the law. And this time, the Appropriators are helping. . 
The Appropriation bill proposes to permit Amtrak to pay for its operating expenses with its capital funds. I am told this proposal is strictly due to budgetary scoring concerns. However, I am not sold. 
With the stroke of a pen, this bill jeopardizes the integrity of the reform bill--specifically the sunset trigger. Amtrak's proponents could just waive this bill as a demonstration that Amtrak is free of operating subsidies, since the bill does not include a line item for operating expenses as historically has been the case. 
As I see it, Amtrak and the Administration are simply attempting to shift operating expenses into its capital budget, thereby backing away from agreements reached last year during the hard-fought reauthorization process. While the reauthorization placed a cap on the amount of money that may be appropriated in any one year for operational expenses or capital investments, the authorized levels were based on Amtrak's own projected financial needs. 
Mr. President, during the last days of negotiations on the reform legislation, you may recall certain members of the Amtrak Board of Directors negotiated a new labor agreement which raised salaries for union employees, thereby incurring a substantial increase in its operational costs. Amtrak's projected net loss for FY 1998 is greater than the previous year's in part due to the Board's own actions. Yet, the Board assured us at the time that the labor agreement would require no action by Congress--nor more importantly, would the labor agreement place any additional obligations on the American taxpayers. However, shifting labor costs into the `capital' account could clearly result in the taxpayers once again being forced to cover expenses due to Amtrak's poor management decisions. 
We authorized Amtrak at funding levels based on its own projected needs. Further, we directed an independent financial assessment of Amtrak be carried out under the direction of the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation. That audit will be based in part on Amtrak's Strategic Business Plan, including its projected operating and capital costs. Should Amtrak be permitted to significantly change the way it accounts for operating and capital expenses, an accurate accounting could be next to impossible. The proposed change in the use of capital funds raises legitimate concerns whether Amtrak and the Administration may be attempting to keep Amtrak's financial situation and Strategic Business Plan projections a moving target. 
Further, we have continually been told Amtrak has critical capital investment needs. Yet, I am told that more than $500 million of the $621 million for capital would likely go to cover labor and other operational costs under this latest proposed scheme. If Amtrak is permitted to shift capital funds to cover what traditionally have been considered operating costs, how will Amtrak make up for the corresponding loss in funding for its capital improvements? Time and again we have been told Amtrak faces critical infrastructure investment needs which must be met if Amtrak is to have any chance of becoming a viable operation. Time and again we have been told Amtrak needed a dedicated source of capital. As I see it, the change has the very real potential for jeopardizing Amtrak's abilities to meet its capital needs which it has sought so long to accomplish. 
Therefore, the amendment I will offer is intended to retain some semblance of legitimacy to P.L. 105-134.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I say to those who are interested, I will be glad to enter into a very short time agreement. I know the Senator from New Hampshire wants to finish up the bill, and so I will be glad to enter into a very short time agreement. 
Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It prohibits the Patent and Trademark Office from spending any funds to plan for or proceed with the consolidation and relocation of its facilities until 90 days after the General Services Administration submits a new report to the Congress on the costs versus benefits of relocating all Patent and Trademark Office facilities to a new facility or location, and the costs associated with leasing versus lease-purchase, Federal construction, or other alternatives for new space, and finally, a recommendation of the lowest cost alternative for the project. 
Most importantly, the amendment requires a GSA report to be prepared without regard to a specific geographic location. I want to repeat, Mr. President, so all my colleagues know, the amendment requires the GSA report to be prepared without regard to a specific geographic location. 
The proposal to consolidate and relocate the various offices of the Patent and Trademark Office is an enormous project, the largest real estate venture the Federal Government is expected to enter into in the next decade. The current proposal raises serious questions. 
First, the project is estimated to cost the taxpayers approximately $1.6 billion. About $1.3 billion of this amount is to pay for a 20-year lease of a new 2-million-square-foot facility somewhere in Northern Virginia. The additional $250 million is what the Patent and Trademark Office proposes to spend to `improve' the building, to bring it up to PTO standards, which appears to me extravagant and luxurious amenities that most of America's businesses do not provide to even their senior executives. 
Most alarming, the language contained in the committee bill imposes no enforceable ceiling on the potential costs of this huge project. 
Both the Citizens Against Government Waste and the National Taxpayers Union have raised serious concerns about the enormous cost of this project. 
How can we claim to wisely spend Americans' hard-earned tax dollars when we are essentially giving the Patent and Trademark Office a blank check for this project? I have no desire to prohibit the Patent and Trademark Office from streamlining and improving its operations. It may be that the PTO does need to consolidate and relocate. However, we have a responsibility to ensure that this consolidation takes place in a fiscally responsible manner. 
The proposed Patent and Trademark Office building complex is shamefully expensive and extravagant. In addition, in putting the proposal together, the Congress limited the Patent and Trademark Office to considering only sites in Northern Virginia, which is certainly not an inexpensive area for construction and leasing of office space. 
To make matters worse, the bill before the Senate does not effectively limit PTO's budget for this project. The amendment I propose would require GSA to reevaluate the site selection process and look at more cost-effective alternatives which are not tied to one specific locality. 
Mr. President, this $1.6 billion project is entirely too expensive. Under the current proposal, PTO plans to lease a 2-million-square-foot building `shell,' which is essentially a structure with walls, ceilings, floors, and windows, but without electrical wiring, computer and telecommunication lines, carpeting, furniture, and all the other necessary interior fixtures. 
The Patent and Trademark Office will not have to pay the costs of constructing the building `shell.' However, the Patent and Trademark Office plans to spend an outrageous amount of taxpayers' dollars to bring the building up to its `standards.' 
First, the PTO is authorized to spend up to $88 million to `build out' the shell. This includes such necessary items as carpeting, electric, plumbing fixtures, and necessary environmental control upgrades to support the computer-intensive work of the office. 
Unfortunately, compared to the Government's `standard' rate for this type of expenditure, building out the PTO building will cost 20 percent more than most Government buildings. 
For example, the PTO building costs are $44 per square foot. NASA's new building was $37 a square foot. FERC's building cost $36 per square foot. And the Government standard is $36.69 per square foot. 
On top of that $88 million, the PTO also plans to spend another $29 million for extravagant amenities, including extra elevators, granite and marble decor, jogging and walking trails, sculpture gardens, and outdoor amphitheaters. 
That is a total of $117 million to finish the interior of the building and to add millions of dollars of extravagant amenities. On a per-square-foot basis, that is $58 per square foot of occupiable space, or 58 percent over the Government standard. But that is not all. The PTO also plans to spend another $135 million to move into the building, install the telecommunications equipment and buy furniture. Almost half of this money, $65 million, is for the purchase of new furniture and furnishings, including $250 shower curtains--$250 shower curtains--$1,200 chairs, $1,000 coat racks and $562 mailroom stools. 
Mr. President, in case my colleagues missed that, I will repeat, $250 shower curtains--I would like to view that shower curtain--$1,200 chairs, $1,000 coat racks, and $560 mailroom stools. 
Altogether, then, the PTO will pay $250 million to bring the building up to its standards, standards which far exceed the Government's norms, and which can only be called luxurious by any standard. 
After spending $252 million to spruce up the premises, the PTO is prepared to pay $50 million per year for a 20-year lease, over and above the cost of its improvements listed above. That is approximately $1.3 billion in lease payments alone over the next 20 years. 
Altogether, now, the PTO project is expected to cost the taxpayers almost $1.6 billion, and we will not even own the building at the end of 20 years. Let me repeat, we will not even own the building at the end of 20 years. 
Remember how the cost of the Ronald Reagan building skyrocketed? The Ronald Reagan building, which is 3 million square feet, began at $362 million and ended up costing $800 million. That is a huge cost increase. This deal will be worse than the Ronald Reagan deal. The PTO project involves a 2.3 million square foot facility that will cost $1.6 billion when finally completed. 
The new PTO building will be smaller than the Reagan building, 700,000 square feet smaller, and it is much more expensive. We spent $800 million on the Reagan Center, but at least we own a building that is designed to last at least 200 years and includes rentable space to offset its costs. The PTO deal is insane. The taxpayers pay to finish the interior building, add a myriad of extravagancies, and then pay to lease it for a total of $1.6 billion over 20 years, and at the end of 20 years, we give the building back to the owner. What kind of a deal is that? I think it is remarkable, remarkable. 
The project was destined to become a fiscal nightmare. Our first mistake was we didn't allow ourselves to look at all possible locations to determine the most cost-effective facility to house the PTO complex. Instead, we only looked at sites in Northern Virginia. The sheer excesses in the PTO's proposals for the building's amenities are unbelievable: $250 shower curtains, $1,000 coatracks, and miles of walking and jogging paths. The tax dollars should be spent on processing patent applications. We should not be spending America's hard-earned tax dollars on extravagant perks. We should be spending tax dollars on processing patent applications, and we should make sure we spend them in the most cost-effective manner possible, by looking at all possible locations for this Government facility, not just one region. 
Mr. President, I am not trying to kill this project. Maybe the PTO does need to consolidate. However, I think we, as a body, have a responsibility to act to ensure that the cost of this project is justified and kept in check. The amendment will require the GSA to take another look at this project before we spend $1.6 billion on it. 
I would like to quote from a letter from the Citizens Against Government Waste:  
At a starting price tag of $1.3 billion, the PTO facility will dwarf the final cost of the $800 million Ronald Reagan International Trade Building, which has 700,000 more square feet. Adding insult to injury, at the end of the 20-year lease period, the government would not even own the PTO building. 
The PTO says it needs 2.3 million square feet. However, the Department of Commerce Inspector General has issued a report, Insufficient Planning is Jeopardizing PTO's Space Consolidation Project, which casts serious doubt on the appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of the venture. 
In the letter they mention not only $250 shower curtains and $1,000 coatracks but $700 baby cribs. 
On behalf of the 600,000 members of [Citizens Against Government Waste], we are pleased to endorse your amendment. . . . 
I have a letter from the National Taxpayers Union. 
. . . the Reagan Building is built to last 200 years, at about half the cost of the proposed 20-year PTO lease. 
That is just the start of this giant boondoggle. 
PTO's costs just for moving into the new headquarters could run more than $130 million. That ought to buy a new building, not just pay for relocation. 
As part of the move, PTO plans to purchase $65 million in brand new furniture, including $250 shower curtains, $750 cribs, $309 ash cans. . . . 
On that list are $309 ash cans. 
The environmental clean-up costs of possible PTO relocation sites could be as high as $194 million--some may contain carcinogens or even unexploded ordnance. 
. . . the PTO plan is `flawed because the lease development project lacks a defined cost ceiling.' By a 3 to 1 margin, PTO employees represented by the Patent Office Professional Association oppose the move to a new complex. 
I am surprised at that. Maybe they don't like $250 shower curtains. 
It would appear that PTO Commissioner Bruce Lehman is seeking a grand monument to his tenure, to be leased at government expense. If your amendment fails, the PTO lease will stand as the largest monument ever erected to government excess. 
For these reasons we endorse your PTO Amendment and urge your Senate colleagues to support it. The vote will be . . . weighted [et cetera]. 
I have a letter here from the American Intellectual Property Owners association.

My only comment is when somebody pays a fee to the Government for a service, I don't know how you differentiate between that and money being taken out of someone's paycheck--because they are paying. They are not receiving this Government service for free. So you can call it a user fee, but that is the same thing as when you and I buy an airline ticket and 10 percent of that goes to the FAA to keep the FAA in operation, the air traffic control system, et cetera.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Virginia. When he does talk, I would be interested in hearing him discuss the $250 shower curtains, $750 cribs, $309 ash cans, and $1,000 coatracks. I would be very interested in hearing--perhaps he has had an opportunity to view those. I would like to see them myself. In fact, perhaps we could have a hearing and view some of that, because it must be exciting stuff there, and all of the miles of trails. 
Also, I would have to ask about the logic of my friend from Virginia. We pay $1.3 billion over 20 years, we take a shell and we put in all the furnishings, all the wiring, all the plumbing and everything into it, and then after 20 years it is not even ours, after a payment of $1.3 billion. I don't understand it. 
By the way, let me mention two things to my friend from Virginia real quick. No. 1, I know this amendment will not be agreed to. That is why I am willing to have a relatively short time agreement. I have no illusions about that. But I think it is important to put all of this on the record here. 
I also am aware both Senators from Virginia are very committed to this project. I understand and admire their commitment. 
I also want to mention one thing about the chairman, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He is going to say, and I will respectfully agree with him, he has wrestled with this issue for years. He has done everything he can to try to resolve this issue. He has my utmost respect and appreciation for his efforts. I just happen to think this is the wrong answer. I think it is wrong to pay $250 for a shower curtain. I think it is wrong, after 20 years, to have to give back a building that you basically built, except for the shell. Frankly, I think it is wrong, in all due respect to my two friends from Virginia, that we should earmark any Government facility in a geographic-specific location. I think there should have been competition for this from all over the Washington, DC, area, if not from all over the United States of America. 
Mr. President, I will yield the floor. Again, I will be glad, for the sake of the managers, to enter into a time agreement with my colleagues who want to speak on this issue so we can move on to the next amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the bill was reported unanimously by the Commerce Committee. 
Mr. President, with cable television rates increasing at seven times the Consumer Price Index and three times the rate of inflation, Congress has an urgent interest in assuring that consumers have a choice of video providers at competitive rates. However, recent regulatory action threatens to raise the rates consumers pay for satellite television service, and therefore will hurt the ability of satellite television operators to compete effectively with cable operators. 
On October 27, 1997, the Librarian of Congress adopted a precipitous and unjustified increase in the copyright fees satellite carriers pay for superstation and network affiliate signals delivered to satellite TV households. 
Before this increase, satellite copyright rates were 14 cents per subscriber per month for each superstation signal and 6 cents per subscriber per month for each network signal. Cable operators, by comparison, pay much less for the same signals--an average of 9.7 cents for the exact same superstations and 2.7 cents for the exact same network signals. But, under the new copyright rates adopted last October, satellite carriers are forced to pay almost 270% more than cable pays for superstation signals, and 900% more than cable pays for network signals. 
These new copyright rates would add substantially to the regulatory and technical barriers satellite carriers already face in providing service that customer consider a fair substitute for cable television. They will hit consumers in rural areas particularly hard, because residents in those areas have traditionally relied on reasonably-priced satellite TV service as their only source of multichannel TV. 
This amendment rolls this unreasonable satellite TV copyright rate increase back to the rates in effect prior to January 1st of this year, and it delays the effective date of the rate increase to January 1, 2000. 
Mr. President, the 7.5 million U.S. households who currently subscribe to satellite television deserve to have the effect of this copyright fee increase on video competition reconsidered to ensure a less arbitrary and more consumer friendly result. This delay will give the FCC an opportunity to analyze the impact increased copyright fees would have on satellite's ability to compete with cable, and it will give Congress an opportunity to evaluate the FCC's report and respond accordingly. 
The bill also addresses an issue of continuing concern to the satellite TV industry. Signal theft represents a serious threat to satellite TV operators. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress confirmed the applicability of penalties for unauthorized decryption of satellite TV services. The amendment we propose would confirm the judicial interpretation that civil suits may be brought by satellite TV operators for signal theft. 
I thank the 27 Senators who co-sponsored this bill which affects every single consumer of multichannel video service. 
Mr. President, I thank the managers for allowing me to propose this amendment. Let me say briefly, we all know that cable rates are on the rise, that the American consumers are very angry about it and they want competition. This will provide more competition. 
There are other areas where we can provide more competition, such as the ability to broadcast local news and local weather. Even the cable industry does not oppose this move, because they know that in the interest of fairness, we need to have a better equalization of these copyright fees. 
I hope we can have the amendment adopted. I thank the managers of the bill. I thank the Senator from California if I went ahead of her in the queue. Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I certainly was entertained by the exchange. And I know that the Senator from Utah is going to speak right after me. I hope he will have some biblical stories as well. The biblical lesson that I am about to propound has to do with the fact that two well-meaning and well-intentioned Americans can join together and resolve our problems and differences. 
Mr. President, earlier today an amendment of mine was accepted that unintentionally the Senator from Utah, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was unaware of. After vigorous discussion, the Senator from Utah and I have agreed, along with the Senator from Vermont, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, that we would modify that amendment and that basically what this means is that the cable rates would be held in moratorium until March 31, 1999. 
Mr. President, this is a serious issue. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I also know that it is serious, and we intend to work together and get this issue resolved so that there is meaningful competition to the rising cable rates in America which have gone up 9 percent last year and 8 percent again this year. 
I think we reached an agreement that makes both of us slightly unhappy but I think will move this process along. I look forward to working with him in the weeks ahead, and hopefully by perhaps September we can get an agreement and move forward on this issue.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment to HR 4112 would direct the Director of the Congressional Research Service to post `CRS Reports to Congress' and `CRS Issue Briefs' on the Internet. My intention for offering this amendment would be to establish a web site for the public to access CRS products only through the THOMAS web site. This amendment is co-sponsored by Senators Coats, Leahy, Faircloth, Ashcroft, Kerrey, Robb, Feingold, Abraham, Enzi, and Wyden. 
I believe that it is important that the public be able to use this CRS information. For FY 1999, the American taxpayers will pay $67.9 million to fund CRS' operations. CRS is well-known for being composed of expert specialists who write reports on the important policy issues of the day that are both factual and unbiased--a rarity for Washington. The public has a right to see that its money is being well-spent and has the right to see the product of thier labors. 
The CRS products can play an important role in educating the American public. Public access to these documents will mark an important milestone in opening up the federal government. Our constituents will be able to see the research documents that influenced our decisions and understand the trade-offs and factors that we consider before a vote. This will give the public an accurate view of Congress, instead of the current cynical view that sometimes prevails. 
Also, constituents can learn a lot from these products. They can receive a concise, accurate summary of the issues before Congress. As elected representatives, we should do what we can to promote an informed, educated public. The educated voter is best able to make decisions and petition us to do the right things here. 
I would also like to make my colleagues aware that in many cases these products are already out on the Internet. `Black market' private vendors can charge $47 for a single report. Other web sites have outdated CRS products on them. It is not fair for the American people to have to pay a third party for out-of-date products that they have already footed the bill for. 
I know that my colleagues in the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration have proposed that Senators and Committee chairman be allowed to post CRS products as they see fit on the Internet. I appreciate that gesture, and believe that it is a first step. However, I am proposing this amendment as a way to take this process to the next logical step--a centralized web site. 
A centralized web site will make it much easier for the public to find CRS information. The public can just go to a web site and look up those products that interest them. That would be much easier than having them go through all of our web sites to find CRS reports. This web site will be attached to the Congressionally mandated THOMAS web site, so that our constituents can find legislation and the relevant CRS products--simple one-stop shopping. 
A centralized web site will also present the information in a nonpartisan format. I know that cynical constituents will look at the CRS reports on a Member's web page, and believe that those products are only put up to gain adherents to a particular political position. CRS is a nonpartisan organization, and its work should be presented on a non-partisan web site. This will allow the public to see CRS as it truly is, not as a political organization. 
This bill also gives the Director of CRS discretion to protect himself from liability suits. The Director will be allowed to remove the names and phone numbers of a CRS employee to keep the public from distracting them from doing their jobs. I have also been informed that CRS may not have permission to release copyrighted information over the Internet. While I hope that this situation can be quickly resolved, I have included a provision in the bill to allow the Director to remove unprotected copyrighted information from the bill. Finally, I have allowed a 30 day delay between the release of these CRS products to Members of Congress and the public. This will allow CRS to revise their products and make sure that it is accurate and up-to-date before releasing it to the public.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, in addition, I would like to point out that the Rules Committee has approved a decentralized system, where Senators can release CRS products on their private web pages. I see no difference between the release of CRS material on one hundred independent web pages and THOMAS, a Congressionally mandated web page. Both approaches should protect CRS equally. 
I also urge my colleagues not to believe other arguments that CRS will suffer from a huge rise in workload from this amendment. It will require only two computer technicians to set up this web site, and keep it updated. CRS already has a process for deciding which information goes up on their web site for Members of Congress. This bill only asks that they duplicate this process for a public version of that web page. Also, we release paper copies of these products to our constituents every day without causing a great strain to CRS staff. Finally, I have the results of an analysis of state legislative research organizations that do work similar to CRS and post these products on the Internet. None of these organizations have complained of a huge increased workload from releasing their products to the Internet. 
In conclusion, I would like to point out that a centralized web site has been endorsed by the Congressional Accountability Project, the League of Women Voters, the American Council on Education, the American Library Association, the American Association of Engineering Societies, IBM, America Online Corporation, Intel Corporation, The Washington Post, The Dallas Morning News, The Arizona Republic, and a host of other groups, businesses, and newspapers interested in maintaining an informed electorate. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It will give CRS wide discretion to set up a nonpartisan centralized web site that will benefit the public and allow it to continue to do its great work for us. 
Madam President, the number of people who use the Internet is increasing geometrically every single month. More and more Americans, especially young Americans, are relying on the Internet for information. Since we spend $67 million a year in turning out the best possible information we can from Members of Congress, it seems to me at a very, very modest cost we should share that information with our constituents on the Internet at the web site that is already designated, the so-called THOMAS web site. 
It is hard for me to understand why the Rules Committee has refused to act in an affirmative fashion on this issue. I hope we will be able to consider this amendment and that we will be able to have a voice vote on it and move forward and make this thing happen. If not, obviously, we will have to come back and back and back, but I have no doubt that the American people overwhelmingly, especially those who use the Internet to obtain information for themselves, for their classrooms, for their associates, for their families, should be privy to the same information that we are and that we provide our constituents in written form when requested rather than have to leaf through each of the 100 different web sites of Senators. It is time we caught up with the technology that is changing America. It is past time we caught up in a broad variety of ways, and this is one way we can do it. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the VA/HUD Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1999. The amendment will assist homeless veterans and seek to eliminate some of the suffering of those less fortunate Americans who served their country in the military. 
This amendment will develop better methods for identifying veterans who utilize federally funded homeless shelters so that they can be educated about veteran benefits to which they are entitled, including Department of Veterans Affairs health care. A homeless shelter which receives federal funding would be required to inquire if a person, man or woman, entering the shelter is a veteran. This information would be used solely to assist in tracking the number of homeless veterans and providing counseling to the veteran regarding all available benefits, including job search, veterans preference rights, and medical benefits. Additionally, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will coordinate these activities and specify a schedule for notifying the Department of Veteran Affairs of the status of these homeless veterans. It is the intent of this amendment to require homeless shelters to follow this procedures if they are to be eligible for additional Federal grants. 
Today, there is no easy or accurate way to track the number of homeless veterans in the United States. I find this astonishing. We just celebrated Independence Day, and this country owes a great deal to the men and women who bore arms to keep America free. It is astonishing to me that there would be no mechanism or process set up to accurately track or keep national records on homeless veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates the number of homeless veterans to be between 275,000 and 500,000 over the course of a year. Conservatively, one out of every three individuals who is sleeping in a doorway, alley, or box in our cities and rural communities has worn a uniform and served our country. Mr. President, the time is right, right now, to give a helping hand. 
Of the figures the Department of Veterans Affairs does acknowledge, homeless veterans are mostly male; about three percent are women. The vast majority are single; most come from poor, disadvantaged communities; forty percent suffer from mental illness; and half have substance abuse problems. More than seventy-five percent served our country for at least four years and Vietnam veterans account for more than forty percent of the total number estimated. 
Mr. President, there are many complex factors affecting all homelessness: extreme shortage of affordable housing, poverty, high unemployment in big cities, and disability. A large number of displaced and at-risk veterans live with lingering effects of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse, compounded by a lack of family and social support networks. 
I do not mean to be critical of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in offering this amendment. To a certain degree the Department of Veterans Affairs is responsive in taking care of some homeless veterans. But the ones that are receiving critical medical treatment and veterans benefits are those who know that such programs exist. It is incumbent on our government to reach out to all homeless veterans. However, to do that, there must be a process in place. 
Homeless veterans need a coordinated effort, between the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, that provides secure housing and nutritional meals, essential physical health care, substance abuse aftercare and mental health counseling. They may need job assessment, training and placement assistance. To those that may argue that this is a new entitlement program, I would say that these rights and benefits currently exist for veterans today. Why would we as a nation not do everything in our power to provide this help for those less fortunate veterans. 
Mr. President, our veterans deserve no less. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and support our veterans.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my strong support, as an original cosponsor of the amendment offered by Mr. Wellstone to the VA/HUD Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 which will rightfully transfer approximately $10.5 billion back to the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans programs. I understand from the managers of the bill that the vote on this critical amendment will not occur until tomorrow. I would have voted for this provision if I was not called out of town on a prior commitment. Furthermore, I urge my colleagues to show their support for veterans and vote for this measure. 
On July 8, 1998, I submitted for the Record a statement regarding veterans' health care activities for tobacco-related illnesses and disabilities. At that time, I had every intention to offer an amendment to the VA/HUD Appropriations bill that would restore the $10.5 billion in funding that was so egregiously and eagerly taken from our nation's veterans to fund pork-laden highway programs in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998 (ISTEA). Unfortunately, there was simply no possibility that this amendment would be adopted, simply because of the inflexibility of the Appropriations Committee's allocation of funds between the Transportation and VA/HUD Committees. 
Because of the arcane rules of the Senate, I and my cosponsors are precluded from righting this profound wrong that has been perpetrated against those who have served and sacrificed for our country. I am not sure that our efforts will be more successful this evening, but I do know, that it is the right thing to do. This issue is far from dead. 
It is important, I believe, that my colleagues fully understand the facts regarding the funding shortfall for veterans health care and compensation for tobacco related diseases. 
First, the Department of Veterans Affairs critical funding shortfall is a result of President Clinton's legislative proposal to Congress to disallow service-connected disability or death benefits based on tobacco-related diseases arising after discharge from the military. Congress, eager to fund pork-laden highway programs, then transferred nearly $10.5 billion to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998 (ISTEA), H.R. 2400, earlier this year. This egregious act was fully supported by President Clinton. 
Second, on April 2, 1998 the Senate voted for an amendment sponsored by Senators Domenici, Lott, and Craig on the Balanced Budget Act which transferred approximately $10.5 billion over five years from the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans' tobacco-related diseases to the ISTEA bill for transportation related projects. I voted for this amendment, in part, because I believed that the tobacco companies, rather than the taxpayers, should bear the burden for tobacco-related diseases caused partially by smoking and using other tobacco products while they were in military service. Military service did not force servicemembers to smoke, but I acknowledge that for morale reasons, the services made cigarettes available for free or at inexpensive prices. The services also give servicemembers condoms and birth control pills at no cost to military personnel, but that does not mean that they want our men and women in uniform to be promiscuous. 
Third, on the tobacco bill, I sponsored legislation that would provide not less than $600 million per year to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for veterans' health care activities for tobacco-related illnesses and disability and directed the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to assist such veterans as is appropriate. The amendment would have provided a minimum of $3 billion over five years for those veterans that are afflicted with tobacco-related illnesses and disability. Additionally, the amendment would have provided smoking cessation care to veterans from various programs established under the tobacco bill. 
Now that the tobacco bill has been returned to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I feel more compelled to rectify this situation. As a conferee on the ISTEA bill, I refused to support and sign the ISTEA Conference Report. I opposed the ISTEA Conference Report for a number of reasons, particularly because of my objections to shifting critical veterans funding to support pork barrel spending in this massive highway bill. It seems that the Congress has no hesitation in breaking budget agreements, when it suits their own purposes to do so, to spend far more on transportation than agreed to in the balanced budget plan. What's worse, it seems that the Congress has no problem with robbing from veterans, whose programs have been seriously under funded for years, to pay for this luxury. 
Furthermore, Mr. President, the facts are clear with respect to tobacco related health care costs and the impact on veterans: 
Tobacco-related diseases, for example, include cancers of the lip, oral cavity, and pharynx; esophagus; pancreas; larynx; lung; bladder; kidney; coronary heart disease; cerebrovascular disease (stroke); various circulatory diseases; and chronic bronchitis. 
The Department of Veteran Affairs' (VA) fiscal year 1997 expenditures for health care for veterans with tobacco-related illnesses are estimated to be $2.6-$3.6 billion. 
In fiscal year 1997, the VA treated 405,000 patients with at least one tobacco-related illness. 
In fiscal year 1997, the VAs' average cost per patient with at least one tobacco-related illness was $8,800. 
In fiscal year 1997, patients with tobacco-related illnesses accounted for over 6.5 million visits to the VAs' health care facilities. 
The projected additional health care costs for tobacco related-illnesses for the VA are estimated to be $2.9 billion over the next five years. 
The projected additional health care costs for tobacco related-illnesses for the VA are estimated to be negligible for fiscal year 1999. 
The projected cost for tobacco claims in fiscal year 1999 is about $500 million based on the number of claims that could be processed. Processing time for claims is expected to increase with an influx of tobacco claims. 
Our nation's veterans should not be excluded from payments by tobacco companies for health care costs associated with tobacco-related diseases. The failure to address the tobacco-related health care needs of our men and women who faithfully served their country in uniform would be wrong. Congress cannot continue to rob from veterans, whose programs have been seriously under funded for years, to pay for these and other special interest projects. 
Mr. President, our veterans deserve no less. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and support our veterans. Thank you.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in today's USA Today there is an article which states there is a possibility that on a live site, a web site--and I emphasize `possibility'; that is being advertised--that two 18-year-olds will have sex live on the Internet on August 4. 
It also noted that there is considerable doubt about the validity of this web site and, in fact, the entire site may be a hoax. For the sake of this Nation, I hope it is nothing but a hoax. If it is, it is neither clever nor humorous, and if it is not, then something has to be done, I think, to protect our children from witnessing this event. 
Again, I want to emphasize, I hope that this is a hoax and nothing more. But what it does is highlight the problem that exists concerning the proliferation of pornography on the Internet, some of that pornography being child pornography and some of it being the kind of obscenity that the U.S. Supreme Court has stated is beyond constitutional protections.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are not talking about censorship here. I want to emphasize, I do not support censorship in any form, and we are not talking about that. What we are talking about is legislation that would require schools and libraries to have some kind of filtering device on their computers. Children are not allowed into `Adult Only' stores that sell and make available adult material. Children are not allowed to purchase `Adult Only' magazines. And our society has decided, in its collective wisdom, that we should let children be children as long as possible and not expose them to certain activities and events. 
If individual parents want to make such information available to children, that is their choice. I do not begrudge them that. But children should not be allowed to enter school or a public library and gain access to material that their parents would never allow them to see and that most in society believe is inappropriate for those who are yet to be adults. It is for that reason I urge my colleagues to support and pass soon S. 1619, the Internet School Filtering Act. Senator Hollings, the ranking member of the committee, along with Senators Coats and Murray, has joined me in introducing this legislation. I thank them for their support.

When the Senate reconvenes at 11 a.m., under the previous order there will be 3 hours for debate equally divided on a Daschle amendment regarding marketing assistance loans. It is expected that some debate time will be yielded back, and therefore the first rollcall vote of today's session is expected to occur prior to 2 p.m. It is expected that the Senate will work late into the evening, with votes, in an effort to complete action on the agricultural appropriations bill.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we begin consideration of the spending bills for the next fiscal year, I commend the efforts of Chairman Cochran, Senator Bumpers and other members of the Subcommittee in putting forth this bill to fund the wide array of agricultural programs within the U.S. Department of Agriculture and related agencies. 
In the accompanying report, the Subcommittee stated its objective, to closely examine `[a]ll accounts in the bill' and `ensure that an appropriate level of funding is provided to carry out the programs.' Mr. President, I was delighted to read this statement. However, after reviewing the bill and its accompanying report language, my delight was brief at best. 
It is painfully clear the subcommittee has not lost its appetite for pork-barrel spending. This bill has been fattened up with vast amounts of low-priority, unnecessary and wasteful spending. In fact, this particular appropriations bill contains an astounding $241,486,300 in specifically earmarked pork-barrel spending. This is over $60 million more than last year's pork-barrel spending total for this bill, which was only $185 million in wasted funds. In addition, the bill and report direct that current year spending be maintained for hundreds of projects, without being specific as to the amount. 
To exemplify this egregious spending, I have compiled a lengthy list of the numerous add-ons, earmarks, and special exemptions provided to individual projects in this bill. 
Many of the programs funded in this bill are laughable. Yet there is nothing humorous about funneling Americans' hard-earned tax dollars to parochial interests. This bill is rife with examples. 
The subcommittee's recommendation for the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CRSEES) blatantly typifies the way my colleagues have irresponsibly put their own agendas ahead of national priorities. For CRSEES research and education activities, my colleagues added on $22,193,000 to the budget estimate. In fact, out of 106 special research grants for state universities, 99 projects were unrequested and earmarked to serve specific regions of the nation, such as: an earmark of $3,536,000 to Oregon, Mississippi, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Michigan for the wood utilization project; $150,000 for plant, drought, and disease resistance gene cataloging in New Mexico; $64,000 for nonfood uses of agricultural products in Nebraska; and, an earmark of $84,000 to Georgia for Vidalia Onions. Mr. President, you and I may love Vidalia Onions just as much as the next person, but an $84,000 earmark to Georgia for Vidalia Onions is absurd in this era of supposed fiscal restraint. 
Let's look at the earmarks in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service funding. 
The Committee directs the Department to continue funding at the current level for cattail management and blackbird control in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Louisiana. I would be surprised if there were no problems with excessive cattail growth and huge blackbird flocks in other areas of the country. 
$800,000 is earmarked for rabies control programs in Ohio, Vermont, and New York. Again, I am certain other areas of the country would benefit from rabies control funding. 
The Committee encourages the Department to consider grants to Burlington, Vermont, and Anchorage, Alaska, to assist these cities in developing public markets. 
The Committee notes that it `expects' the Agriculture Department to purchase surplus salmon, but only if there is surplus salmon at low prices continue. 
Mr. President, this type of locality-specific and special-interest earmarking is blatantly unfair to the taxpayers. It sets the tone, so evident in this bill, for a spending frenzy where honest hardworking Americans' tax dollars are thrown away on unrequested, low-priority, wasteful spending similar to the previous examples and hundreds like it. 
Similar flagrant violations of the appropriate merit-based review process permeate the FY `99 Agriculture Appropriations bill and report--a testament to my ongoing concerns about pork-barrel spending. Mr. President, I raised concerns over earmarks in the FY 1998 appropriations bill, yet funding continues to be provided without adequate justification for nonsensical programs and designated regional benefits, such as: the perennial add-on of $3,354,000 for the Shrimp Aquaculture project benefiting the states of Hawaii, Mississippi, Arizona, Massachusetts, South Carolina; $150,000 for the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness in Georgia; a $26 earmark million for additional spending to benefit the Lower Mississippi Delta region. 
Mr. President, most of the programs in this bill, such as grants, loans and other types of technical assistance programs, would normally be available to local, state and tribal entities in an open and competitive process. Many projects of merit and national necessity deserve to compete for the scarce funds gobbled up by wasteful pork-barrel spending. But these projects will never receive fair deliberation if this Committee pre-determines their fate by `expecting' and `urging' the Department to give special consideration to certain projects over others. 
This bill also continues the questionable practice of prohibiting facility closures and designating funding for maintaining administrative personnel. For example, an additional $1,400,000 is provided to the Rice Germplasm Laboratory in Stuttgart, AR, for additional staffing, and more than $20 million is provided to various agencies and field offices in order to maintain personnel. The bill also contains a section that prohibits the expenditure of any funds to close or relocate an FDA office in St. Louis. The Committee does not provide any justification on why we should be spending taxpayers dollars to preserve unneeded bureaucracy. Nor does the report explain why specific offices and laboratories are higher in priority than others and more deserving of continuing funding despite recommendations of closure. 
Mr. President, I will not deliberate much longer on the objectionable provisions of this bill. In closing, I simply ask my colleagues to apply fair and reasonable spending principles when appropriating funds to the multitude of priority and necessary programs in our appropriations bills. I look forward to the day when we can go before the American people with a budget that is both fiscally responsible and ends the practice of earmarking funds in the appropriations process.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Bill of 1998. I have 22 co-sponsors: Senator Barbara Mikulski, Senator James Inhofe, Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Lauch Faircloth, Senator Daniel Inouye, Senator Rick Santorum, Senator John Breaux, Senator Richard Durbin, Senator Max Cleland, Senator Edward Kennedy, Senator Paul Sarbanes, Senator Barbara Boxer, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Wendell Ford, Senator Ron Wyden, Senator Pat Roberts, Senator Daniel Akaka, Senator Harry Reid, Senator Richard Bryan, Senator Carl Levin, Senator Bob Graham, and Senator Charles Grassley. 
The OAA expired in 1995, and we are entering the fourth year without an OAA reauthorization. The bill would reauthorize the OAA thru the year 2001 using the language of the 1992 Act. This time frame would give needed stability to OAA programs while allowing a full evaluation of the OAA to ensure it is relevant to our current and future seniors. 
Reauthorization of the OAA is absolutely essential. It is the major vehicle for the delivery of such programs as: meals on wheels; congregate meals; home care (personal care, homemaker, and chore service); adult day care; senior centers; transportation; a job program with skills training for low income seniors; a long term care ombudsman; research and demonstration projects; and abuse prevention and elder rights. 
In addition, this is the cornerstone of programs for elderly Native Americans because it is the only federal program that allows tribes to directly plan for the needs of their elderly based on their own culture and traditions. 
The OAA is a coordinated system of care that can work alone or hand in hand with Medicare and Medicaid services for those seniors in greatest social and economic need. It also encourages public/private partnerships; promotes seniors volunteering to help one another; and spells out a planning and oversight mechanism that includes the seniors themselves. 
We all recognize and appreciate the hard work of the Sub-Committee on Aging to get an updated, reauthorized bill to us during this Congress, and I will continue to work in support of their effort. However, with our condensed legislative calendar, the likelihood of completing the full committee process is diminished. This legislation would provide a short term reauthorization in order to allow The Committee to continue its work to rewrite the 1992 law. 
This bill is endorsed by 32 of the major national aging organizations and associations, a list is attached. 
Mr. President, our nation's seniors and their families are very concerned that these vital services will stop. It is time to reassure them.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note with some concern the support of some of my colleagues for a weakening of the sanctions currently in place against India and Pakistan under the terms of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. Although I do not oppose the Farmers Export Relief Act of 1998, I would encourage members of Congress not to lose sight of the national security considerations which motivate our sanctions against India and Pakistan, and to tread warily along the path of haphazardly lifting those sanctions. 
In 1994, the United States Senate voted unanimously in favor of automatic sanctions against any country which `crashed the gates' of the nuclear club. The gravity of counter-proliferation sentiment in the Senate at the time was clearly expressed by the absence of the standard `national security waiver' that sanctions legislation typically contains. At the time, we believed that such a tough sanctions requirement would serve as an effective deterrent to any country which believed it had more to gain than lose by developing the ability to detonate a nuclear device. 
The tenor of the debate in the Senate today indicates that our 1994 sanctions legislation is viewed as a failure. India and Pakistan are now nuclear powers, attesting to the inability of the global non-proliferation regime to constrain their national ambitions. 
But can we say with any degree of certainty that our sanctions policy is as powerless as some suggest? The 1994 legislation was intended not only to deter countries from developing a nuclear weapons capability, but to punish countries that flouted the global consensus, embodied in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, against developing nuclear weapons as a legitimate instrument of national power. Sanctions against India and Pakistan have been in place for less than two months. It has been widely acknowledged that both countries, particularly Pakistan, have suffered from the cut-off in U.S. trade and investment and the cessation of loan guarantees from the international financial institutions. 
An earlier draft of the Farmers Export Relief Act of 1998 would have granted the President the authority to waive all the sanctions mandated by Congress by the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. I am pleased that this language was removed, as it would have been inconsistent with both the spirit and letter of the 1994 law. 
I support American farmer and agribusinesses who wish to export their products to South Asian markets. However, I am not convinced that the campaign to waive U.S. sanctions for agricultural products is driven by concern for American national security interests. What is the basis for singling out agricultural products, rather than any other category of goods, for a sanctions waiver? I am not convinced that the merits of exporting grain, cotton, or even tobacco--all agricultural goods that would be exempt from sanctions should this legislation pass--are such that agriculture should be singled out for a sanctions waiver. What national security logic drives this approach? 
Let me stress that I do not oppose this legislation to exempt agricultural goods from the sanctions regime in place against India and Pakistan. I simply wish to caution my colleagues against piecemeal efforts to take the teeth out of sanctions whose credibility and effectiveness hinge on their capacity to hurt countries which defy international norms and undermine American national security. we must approach sanctions policy with an eye for overall strategy rather than taking a more narrow, tactical approach that obscures the larger objectives of our foreign policy.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. 1882, the `Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 1998. This important piece of legislation provides the authority for a litany of education programs which are intended to provide low and moderate income families with opportunities for postsecondary education. 
It is my firm belief that our nation's colleges, universities, and post-secondary institutions have been and will continue to be the key to equal opportunity and economic advancement in our society. Each year, enrollment increases in postsecondary institutions around the country as more and more people realize the important role education plays in their economic future as well as the personal fulfillment and growth which can be achieved through higher education. It is imperative that we continue to encourage students of all ages to continue their studies and take advantage of the opportunities available for them at our nation's colleges, universities and postsecondary institutions, which are the finest in the world. 
The rising cost of college and higher education continues to be a major concern for American families. Tuition for college continues to skyrocket, making it harder and harder for working families to save and pay for their childrens' education. Over the last twenty years the average tuition at public 4 and 2 year educational institutions has increased by 400% while tuition at private 4 year institutions has increased more than 440%. These are unnerving statistics for parents just starting their families, but terrifying to families with college-bound children. 
This bill addresses these financial concerns of American families by increasing the availability of grants and loans to students and their families. It also provides students with the lowest loan interest rates in nearly two decades. These programs work together to help make college affordable for millions of Americans and alleviate their anxieties about incurring excessive debts. 
In addition to making college more affordable for all Americans, this piece of legislation includes many programs which help strengthen educational opportunities for millions of low income or high risk students. This bill expands early intervention programs such as TRIO. As many of my colleagues know, the TRIO program reaches out to high risk students in high school and provides them with the encouragement, tools and personal training necessary to succeed in college. Personally, I have seen the success of the TRIO program in my home state of Arizona where this program has played an important role in encouraging Native American and Hispanic children to finish high school and to go on to receive their college degree and often their masters degree. 
Another important component of this bill is the establishment of a comprehensive program promoting statewide reforms to enhance the performance of teachers in the classroom by improving the quality of teacher training. Having professional, well-trained teachers is an essential component for ensuring that our children achieve high educational standards. These new teacher training programs will be held to high standards and accountability to ensure that meaningful training is occurring. Finally, in our concerted effort to increase the number of students entering the teaching profession and serving our nation's underserved urban and rural areas this bill provides financial incentives for individuals who enter the teaching profession. 
By passing this piece of legislation, Congress is strengthening our nation's education system while helping students get a college education, which is an important and essential investment for our country. This is why I am proud to support this bill and commend my colleagues on the Labor Committee for their dedication to this important matter.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this nation needs legal reform. This bill before us--if passed into law--will deliver exactly that. While this legislation is not perfect, it does a great deal for small businesses across this nation. And for that reason, it should be supported and I hope it will become law. 
Before I discuss this matter further, I want to thank Senator Gorton for his tireless pursuit of legal reform in the area of product liability. Senator Gorton has worked hard on this important legislation for many years. I also want to thank Senator Rockefeller for all his efforts. 
Mr. President, I do have concerns regarding this bill. My primary concern with this measure is the narrow nature of the reforms it would institute. I had hoped we could pass a broader bill that would do more. But again, I want to repeat, the proposal has important features that would improve some imperfections in our legal landscape. 
I am especially encouraged that the bill before the Senate includes, as Title II, legislation that I introduced with Senator Lieberman to ensure the continued access to biomaterials. Biomaterials are used to produce implantable medical devices that both enhance and extend the lives of so many Americans. 
I am also pleased with other provisions taken from the bill as reported by the Commerce Committee. Those provisions include valuable revisions to the liability rules applicable to product sellers, renters, and lessors; a limitation on the amount of punitive damages that may be awarded against small businesses; and a provision to provide for the reduction of damages when a product has been misused or altered. 
My concern is not so much with what is in this compromise but in what it does not contain. The bill reported by the Commerce Committee has been significantly narrowed to appease the Administration. For example, the compromise would not provide a statute of repose applicable to all products, it would not reform joint and several liability, and it would not limit the amount of punitive damages that may be awarded certain sized business enterprise. 
The compromise proposal would provide limited reforms in the area of product liability. Those reforms, although limited, may be valuable and worth doing but they do not constitute comprehensive reform of product liability. 
I know that comprehensive product liability reform is not politically possible in this Congress due to the Administration's opposition. That, however, does not change the fact that comprehensive product liability reform is essential for America's consumers and for our businesses both large and small. Comprehensive product liability reform would make a larger array of products available to consumers at a lower price. Comprehensive product liability reform would create more jobs for American workers and make American businesses more competitive in international markets. 
General aviation is the best example of the benefits of legal reform. The general aviation industry was nearly dead in the United States. Production of new airplanes was declining steeply, and new technology was not being incorporated into the planes that were being built. As a result jobs were lost and consumers were deprived of better and safer airplanes. The General Aviation Revitalization Act rescued this industry by instituting a very narrow statute of repose. Due to this reform, thousands of new jobs have been created and more advanced airplanes are now available to the flying public. 
To best bring the advantages of legal reform to all consumers and industries, the country desperately needs product liability reform. Comprehensive reform would include common sense revisions to joint and several liability, limitations on punitive damages, and a statute of repose applicable to all products. All of these reforms were contained in the bill as reported by the Senate Commerce Committee. 
My deepest concern about the compromise proposal that Senator Gorton has negotiated is a fear that once Congress has acted on this compromise, the public will assume it is comprehensive legislation and the drive for additional necessary reforms will be hampered. I fear that a narrow product liability bill that makes incremental improvements will be used by the powerful interests that oppose any legal reform to claim that the narrow bill was supposed to solve all the problems and thereby condemn any further reform. 
But that fact withstanding, I still strongly support the bill before us. Obviously, a narrow bill cannot solve all of the numerous problems in our current system. I believe a narrow bill can make significant headway on some of those problems. As I began, this bill will help reform the legal system and will greatly benefit small business. I hope that its passage of this bill is the first step in a process of reform, not the beginning of the end. This measure deserves our support and I hope we will act quickly to pass it and send the bill to the President for his signature.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, our relationship with the People's Republic of China is perhaps the most complex of any within the realm of foreign policy. Absent the scale of confrontation the United States experienced with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, U.S. diplomacy must, for the foreseeable future, walk a very fine line between cooperation and challenge with the world's most populous nation. The very nature of the Soviet threat provided a level of clarity absent in our attempts at formulating a long-term policy for dealing with China. There is no justification for a policy of containment when there is no reason to believe that Chinese foreign policy is inherently expansionist. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that China's external ambitions extend beyond those with which we are already familiar: island chains in the South China Sea and the most dangerous issue of all dividing our two countries, the status of Taiwan. 
The complexity inherent in U.S.-China relations simply allows for neither the demonization of China, as many here would have it, nor the kind of alliance we enjoy with our closest allies. The issues are too varied, and the emotions surrounding them run too deep. The issues with which the United States takes exception relative to China, especially in the area of human rights and religious persecution, are too central to our values as a nation for us to ignore. With every dissident thrown into prison, for every item produced with forced prison labor, for the memory of those killed in Tiananmen Square, those charged with the conduct of American foreign policy must take the government in Beijing to task and demand, not ask, a measure of justice none of us really expects to materialize soon enough. And therein lies the dilemma we face in dealing with China: We demand of it something it has never had--freedom. 
President Jiang Zemin made clear the high priority his government places on social stability at the expense of personal liberty. President Clinton, to his credit, offered an articulate defense of the emphasis the United States places on freedom, and he placed it squarely in the context of an emerging world power struggling with the dichotomies of economic development and dictatorship. Economic freedom cannot forever coexist with authoritarian dictates in the political, social and cultural realms. 
The kind of technological innovation and rapid transition from laboratory to marketplace common to advanced industrialized countries is not possible when individual freedom is constrained and lacking essential legal protections. China's poor record on protection of intellectual property is symptomatic of this phenomenon. Furthermore, that it views religious and political freedom as a threat is a sign that it has some distance to go before it can join the community of nations represented in the G-7, as no nation can reach its full potential that fears the free expression of ideas by its own people. 
To a very large degree, the ongoing controversy involving technology transfers to China has its seeds in the inability of dictatorial societies to draw upon reservoirs of talent that cannot be created where the flow of information is tightly controlled and where the kind of intellectual exchanges that resulted in the great technological innovations of the 20th Century are constrained. It is no accident that the wealthiest nations on Earth are those that, since the Second World War, have pursued market economies within the framework of democratic forms of government. Japan and Singapore are completely lacking in natural resources, yet enjoy among the highest standards of living in the world. The Asian economic crisis is a serious warning of the need to reform certain government policies and business practices, but the accomplishments of the economic systems still warrant respect. 
President Clinton's trip to China has to be viewed within the context of what could realistically be expected of China. In one significant respect, his trip was a success. The access afforded him to the Chinese public was unprecedented, and the President did a fine job of expressing the importance of democratic values to the Chinese people. He further deserves gratitude for his denunciation of the Tiananmen Square massacre, an event of singular importance for post-Cold War relations between the two countries. The events of May and June 1989, occurring as they did while the central front of the Cold War was undergoing dramatic transformations that would reshape most of the world, were a sad reminder of the extremes to which governments that do not rule with the consent of the people will go to maintain their hold on power. By conveying the message directly to the Chinese people that the leader of what has historically been known as the `Free World' condemns the events of 4 June 1989, President Clinton communicated to pro-democracy elements in China the vital message that the United States supports their efforts. 
To the extent the President is criticized for a mission for which the only success was symbolic, it must be admitted there is little of substance to show for the effort. It is apparent that his sights were set low, and his achievements accordingly modest. To be fair, the kinds of change we hope to witness in China will not materialize over night; China is a country that thinks in terms of its thousands of years of history, and that history is replete with repression, foreign invasion and civil war. It is a deeply scarred nation, neither willing nor able to lose sight of its legacy of exploitation at the hands of others. But China today stands on the brink of becoming one of the world's premier powers and, as such, must understand that more is expected of it. The role it seeks to play, regionally and globally, must be firmly rooted in a moral foundation in which the worth of the individual lies at the center of its system of governance. Repression is alien to such a system, as is the insecurity all too often manifested in expressions of external aggression. If its goal is to instill in its neighbors a fear of its looming shadow, all it will have to show for its efforts is an element of regional hegemony in a region where countries have fought ferociously to resist such intimidation. It will then suffer economically, with the risk of social instability that President Jiang emphasized is one of his greatest concerns. 
The areas of trade, proliferation, the status of Tibet, and the future of Taiwan all remain largely unresolved--the latter dangerously so. The President's rejection of Taiwanese independence is consistent with previous Administration statements and U.S. policy going back to 1972, but only if loosely interpreted. United States policy remains `one China,' but the context in which the President's statement was made and the manner in which it was declared were painfully close to resolving the issue of Taiwan's status by fiat and in Beijing's favor. 
Taiwan is a complex country. It is torn internally between an historically indigenous Formosan population that claims independence from mainland China, and the large segment of the population that represents the mass migration from the mainland following the communist victory in 1949. The latter claims to be the legitimate government of all of China. The reality on the ground, of course, does not allow for a policy predicated upon such a claim. To have reaffirmed as the President did the so-called `three noes' policy, however, served only to exacerbate concerns in Taiwan about its security--legitimate concerns irrespective of where one stands on the issue of its independence--while possibly emboldening Beijing. Given how close our two nations came to armed confrontation in March 1996 over Taiwan's security and right to exist as a democratic country, a more sensitive articulation of U.S. policy was in order. 
Since coming to Congress, I have been a staunch advocate of free trade. The unprecedented period of economic growth that the United States has experienced is owed in no small part to our level of trade. We cannot and should not, however, expect the American public to countenance a level of Chinese imports that is not reciprocated. Trade deficits that result from the natural dynamics of free market mechanisms should not be feared; deficits that occur as a result of systematic imposition of barriers to free trade must be confronted. In this respect, the President's trip was an abject failure. U.S. companies must have unfettered access to the Chinese market, and ought not be compelled to compete with companies owned by the Chinese military, which comprise a disappointing number of those in the southern economic zone. 
On the extremely contentious issue of technology transfers, an entirely separate discussion is warranted to do it justice. At issue as far as U.S. exports are concerned is dual-use technology that, by its nature, presents considerable regulatory difficulty. As we in the Congress press the Department of Defense to make more use of commercial technologies, we should not be surprised that the Chinese are doing precisely that. The Commerce Committee will be holding hearings into the export licensing process, and I am aware of the number of hearings held in both chambers of Congress by various committees. Suffice to say for now, though, that we need to get a better handle on this issue. For American companies, the stakes are high; for our national security, they are higher. The latter must take precedence. It is questionable whether the President agrees with that supposition. 
This Administration's handling of export controls warrants close examination, as there is considerable evidence that dual-use technologies are finding their way into Chinese weapon systems. While I do not fear the kind of global confrontation with China that existed relative to the Soviet Union, I fear the threat to regional stability that can and will arise should Chinese military modernization enable it to project military power at the expense of its neighbors. And I fear for the future of Taiwan should China develop the means to militarily subdue that democratic bastion. China has a right to defend itself; it has a right to a modern army. The Pacific Rim is too fraught with tension, however, to ignore the regional and global implications of modernization untempered by moral or practical constraints. 
In the area of proliferation, the outcome of the China summit is unclear. China's continued refusal to join the Missile Technology Control Regime augurs ill for our ability to rein in its export of destabilizing military technologies. The recent nuclear detonations by India and Pakistan were testament to the dangers implicit in policies that seek to resolve border disputes through the brandishing of ever more destructive forms of weaponry. China's support of other countries' nuclear weapons programs is extremely dangerous. Its support of their development of the means of delivering those weapons is even more so. 
The one true consensus in the realm of national security affairs is the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. A cloud will continue to hang over U.S.-China relations until we are confident that China respects our concerns, as it expects us to respect its concerns. We should certainly not be exacerbating that problem through exports of our own to China that benefit its military-industrial complex. Administration policies in this regard deserve the close scrutiny they are now receiving. 
China will always act in its self-interest. It will always view the world through the prism of its own unique history, and through its own unique culture. Such perspective does not excuse its repressive domestic policies, and U.S. policy ought not make allowances for those policies. We should be under no illusions that China will be a strategic partner; in all likelihood, it will not. It is a relationship that should be managed, and that should start from the premise that Chinese foreign policy will, at times, run counter to our own. Our export policy must take that into account, even if that comes at the expense of business. 
Mr. President, it is sometimes said that the business of government is business. It is not. There is no constitutional prerogative for governmental intervention in the marketplace. There is a constitutional prerogative to provide for the common defense. As in any area of life, to some degree there is an element of balance that needs to be maintained. The current Administration's great failing is its inability to appreciate that fundamental requirement and to provide for the common defense. We should and do work with China for our mutual benefit. We must do so, however, without losing sight of the nature of the Chinese regime. President Jiang may prove an able leader; effusive praise usually reserved for Jeffersonian democrats, however, obscures the depth of the chasm that remains in the Sino-American relationship and the origins of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. That is not ideologically-driven rhetoric; it is a view of a dictatorial government through the prism of history. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. I want to thank the Chairman, and other members of the Finance Committee for their work in crafting this much-needed measure. 
This legislation is about more than merely reforming one Government agency. This bill is about fundamental fairness and the role of the Federal Government in our lives. The out-of-control IRS is a prime example of intrusive and unnecessary big government. 
Madam President, I have spent 15 years in Congress fighting to lower taxes, cut spending, and shrink the size of our bloated and intrusive Federal Government. 
Earlier this year, Senator Coverdell and I introduced the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1998, which is a step toward a simpler, flatter, fairer Tax Code. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act would deliver sweeping tax relief to 29 million lower- and middle-income taxpayers by increasing the number of individuals and married couples who pay the lowest tax rate, which is 15 percent. 
The bill raises the limit for the 15 percent bracket to $35,000 for an individual taxpayer. In addition, this bill significantly lessens the effect of one of the Tax Code's most onerous and inequitable provisions--the marriage penalty--by allowing married couples to earn as much as $70,000 and still pay only 15 percent in taxes. 
It is essential that we provide American families with relief from the excessive rate of taxation that saps job growth and robs them of the opportunity to provide for their needs and save for the future. The Middle-Class Tax Relief Act permits individuals to keep more of the money they earn. With this extra income, Americans will be able to save and invest more. Increased savings and investment are key to sustaining our Nation's current economic growth. 
Last year, Congress passed a major tax-relief bill, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which provided an estimated $96 billion in tax relief to Americans at all income levels. And I and others have sponsored numerous legislative proposals to eventually repeal the current Tax Code, and to lower or eliminate taxes on families, estates, charitable giving, farmers, Social Security benefits, tip income, Internet access and services, gasoline, and conservation efforts. 
Cutting taxes is only a part of the solution to the problems of big government. We must also cut spending. 
For 10 years, I fought to enact the line item veto legislation, which would have helped eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars from annual appropriations bills. When the Supreme Court struck down the 1996 law, Senator Coats and I introduced a revised line item veto authority, called separate enrollment. Our bill would avoid the Constitutional questions surrounding the original line-item veto, and we intend to push for its early enactment. 
Clearly, the line-item veto is a necessary tool to curb the Federal Government's appetite for pork-barrel spending. Last year alone, Congress added more than $8 billion in wasteful, unnecesssary, and low-priority spending to the appropriations bills. This year, with only about half the bills done, nearly $7.5 billion has been set aside for congressional earmarks. I intend to continue to oppose such wasteful spending when these bills come before the Senate, because these earmarks take money right out of the pockets of the taxpayers. 
In 1997, I supported the Balanced Budget Act which cut spending by $270 billion and led to the first balanced Federal budget in 30 years. In addition to refraining from adding unnecessary programs to the various agency budgets, we should be looking for savings and efficiencies in all areas of the Federal budget, including Congress' own funding. With the likelihood of significant budget surpluses on the horizon, we must now work to ensure that any extra money is returned to the people in the form of tax relief--not spent on pork-barrel projects or big-government programs. 
Some are probably wondering what this discussion of tax relief and spending cuts has to do with IRS reform. On the surface, the IRS reform bill is simply about reforming a Government agency. But this bill is about more, it is about fundamental fairness and the role of the Government in our lives. 
As the people's elected representatives, we cannot merely point the finger at this runaway agency. We have a responsibility to protect the American public's individual freedom and dignity from the IRS and any other agency that oversteps its boundaries and unduly infringes upon the American public's day-to-day existence. 
The reforms in this bill are carefully crafted structural reforms. They are reforms that will not only change the practices and procedures of the IRS, but its fundamental culture as well. These reforms will ensure that the IRS treats taxpayers fairly and with the respect they deserve. 
The IRS Restructuring Act of 1998 implants additional oversight and outside expertise into the management of the IRS. An entire title of this bill is devoted to taxpayer protection and taxpayer rights. Most important, this bill shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS. This measure has relief for innocent spouses from tax liabilities incurred by former spouses from whom they have been divorced or legally separated for at least 12 months. The fear of an audit looms over the heads of even honest taxpayers. After passage of this legislation, honest taxpayers will now have greater protections throughout the audit process. 
These management and administrative provisions are key to restoring fairness and efficiency to the management and administration of our tax laws. 
In addition, this conference agreement builds on last year's Taxpayer Relief Act. It provides $12.9 billion over the next 10 years in much-needed taxpayer relief for millions of hard-working Americans by eliminating the complex 18-month holding period that was required to realize the lowest applicable tax rate for capital gains. This provision is vital to America's middle class. Capital gains are no longer exclusively for the rich and powerful. The world of mutual funds, discount brokers, and the Internet has empowered the middle class with newfound prosperity. Simplifying and lowering the capital gains tax helps ensure the financial stability of our Nation's hard-working middle class. 
Let me close by saying that the IRS Restructuring Act of 1998 illustrates our continuing effort to change the way we collect our taxes, and on a larger note, the role of Government in our everyday lives. This bill is a step toward smaller and more efficient Government--less taxes and less spending, means less big government. 
Swift passage of this measure will send a loud and clear message to America. The message is that Congress hears your call for smaller, less intrusive Federal Government and for lowering the excessive tax burden, which saps job growth and robs Americans of the opportunity to provide for their needs and save for their future.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I had every intention to offer an amendment to the Veterans' Affairs/Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill that would restore the $10.5 billion in funding that was so egregiously and eagerly taken from our nation's veterans to fund pork-laden highway programs in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998 (ISTEA). Unfortunately, there was simply no possibility that this amendment would be adopted, simply because of the inflexibility of the Appropriations Committee's allocation of funds between the Transportation and VA/HUD Subcommittees. 
Because of the arcane rules of the Senate, I and my cosponsors are precluded from righting this profound wrong that has been perpetrated against those who have served and sacrificed for our country. 
This amendment would not have been my first attempt to rectify this shameful treatment of our Veterans. On the tobacco bill, I sponsored legislation that would provide not less than $600 million per year to the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans' health care activities for tobacco-related illnesses and disability and directed the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to assist such veterans as is appropriate. The amendment would have provided a minimum of $3 billion over five years for those veterans that are afflicted with tobacco-related illnesses and disability. Additionally, the amendment would have provided smoking cessation care to veterans from various programs established under the tobacco bill. Unfortunately, when the tobacco bill was returned to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, the funding vehicle for those afflicted veterans suffering from smoking-related illnesses, went with it. 
The failure to address the tobacco-related health care needs of our men and women who faithfully served their country in uniform would be wrong. Congress cannot continue to rob from veterans, whose programs have been seriously underfunded for years, to pay for special interest projects. 
Mr. President, I want to assure my colleagues, and more importantly, our veterans, that this issue is far from dead. I am even more compelled and committed to find a vehicle to restore the critical funding that was so selfishly taken by members of this body. Mr. President, our veterans--those who served and sacrificed, those who trusted, and in this case were betrayed by their government--deserve no less.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a new bipartisan proposal to improve several aspects of the professional boxing industry in the U.S. I am joined by Senator Bryan of Nevada in offering this legislation. He has been a great partner in my efforts to improve the safety and integrity of this major industry in the public interest. 
This bill is intended to protect boxers from some of the most egregious and onerous business practices which they have been subjected to across the U.S. over the last several decades. It will also help State officials provide more effective public oversight of boxing events held in their jurisdiction, so that they can better prevent business practice abuses and unethical conduct. Furthermore, this legislation will improve integrity and open competition in professional boxing, by curbing its most restrictive and anti-competitive business practices. This is a limited and modest proposal in many respects, but it is the product of months of consultation with experienced State athletic officials and the most respected and knowledgeable members of the boxing industry. 
Let me say a few words about the title of this legislation. I thought it would be a fitting tribute to name an important new reform measure on professional boxing after Muhammad Ali. Mr. Ali had perhaps the most impressive and exciting career in the history of professional boxing, and his many championships and achievements are legendary in the sport. Of course, Muhammad Ali's character, integrity, and personal charm appealed to tens of millions of Americans who did not even consider themselves to be boxing fans. His entire life has been a story of tremendous determination, accomplishment, and perseverance against daunting odds. I feel it most appropriate for the Congress pass a measure to protect the interests of boxers, encourage fair competition, and vastly improve the overall integrity of the boxing industry, that is named in his honor. I want to thank Mr. Ali for his graciousness in letting this legislation be so named. 
I have been deeply involved in exploring ways to improve the professional boxing industry for most of this decade. It is a complex task. Many of the steps that need to be taken to permanently end the disreputable and abusive business practices which have long marred the sport must be taken either by members of the industry, or by State officials. I firmly believe that State boxing commissioners and industry leaders must be the primary agents of reform in this sport. It is they who I have continually turned to for advice and recommendations on how the federal government might be of help, albeit in a limited and supportive role. 
This proposal seeks to remedy many of the anti-competitive, oppressive, and unethical business practices which have cheated professional boxers and denied the public the benefits of a truly honest and legitimate sport. This reform measure is designed to prohibit the harmful and arbitrary business practices which have clearly hurt the welfare of professional boxers, without imposing unnecessary restrictions or federal intrusions into the sport. I want to emphasize that this proposal requires no State or federal funding; creates no federal bureaucracy; imposes no 
mandates on State commissions; and requires no new regulatory actions by State boxing commissioners. It is a modest and practical measure that will establish several `fair contracting' standards to protect professional boxers, and enhance important financial disclosures that are made to State commissions by business entities in the industry. 
This bill also would establish certain federal standards with which boxing's `sanctioning organizations' must comply. These entities are notorious in the sport for engaging in arbitrary and manipulative activity with respect to their ratings of professional boxers. Though often foreign-based, these entities operate on an interstate basis in the U.S. with virtually no oversight at the State or federal level. For several decades they have been repeatedly and credibly criticized by boxers and sportswriters for business practices that are highly questionable. Their inconsistent and subjective methods of rating boxers, often in apparent collusion with powerful promoters in the sport, clearly has had negative consequences for boxers. A boxer's career can be effectively stalled or crippled by these entities' arbitrary decisions. This legislation would establish a series of prudent business conduct standards and financial disclosure requirements on sanctioning organizations to ensure they are subject to legitimate public oversight by State officials. 
I want to note the vital need for these reforms at the federal level, Mr. President. Boxing in the U.S. is regulated by individual State boxing commissions, many of which are severely underfunded and understaffed. Many do not have more than a single employee. Though many State commissions have extremely knowledgeable and dedicated members, they do not have the capacity to prevent the indefensible interstate business abuses which this legislation address. Indeed, when a small group of states boxing commissions tries to crack down on the promoters and others who are engaged in fraudulent or unethical activity, State officials face the prospect of losing all their professional boxing events to another jurisdiction. Promoters and sanctioning bodies can avoid State reforms by seeking out new forums where public interest protections are fewer and weaker. That is not good for the boxers who bear all the risks of this punishing profession, and it not good for the ticket-buying fans, either. 
Decades of scandals, controversy, and corruption have shown professional boxing to be an industry where public oversight is absolutely critical, Mr. President. Therefore, this limited series of national fair business standards and public disclosure requirements will be of tremendous service to the State officials and general public concerned about this industry. This bill will in no way interfere with any legitimate, good faith business practices in the sport. 
Senator Bryan and the many industry members that I have worked with over the past five months to develop this bill have come up with a solid, practical, and no-cost way to protect the interests of the athletes and the public in the boxing industry. The sole objectives of this bill are to ensure that boxers are not cheated of their fair earnings in the sport; that State officials are given better information with which to supervise major boxing events, and take corrective actions when necessary; and to encourage integrity and honest business practices by the business interests which dominate professional boxing. I have attached a one page summary of this proposal, and ask unanimous consent to print the bill and summary in the Record. I look forward to comments on this proposal by members of the industry and State commissioners across the U.S., and ask my colleagues for their support.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just make a couple comments on this amendment. 
One, there seems to be some debate as to whether base closing actually saves money or not--one of the more bizarre and interesting and illogical arguments I have heard in my time in the Senate. If closing bases didn't save money, after World War II we should have kept the thousands of bases that we had across America open. Look, closing bases saves money; it just depends on when. The sooner we get about that business, the sooner we will be able to have the money that would take care of force modernization, retention of qualified men and women, and so many other urgent requirements for national defense. 
Let me quickly add one of the practical effects of this amendment. It would prohibit any installation from being closed for 4 years following a realignment, where, as a result of the realignment, civilian employment dropped below 225--not military presence, civilian employment. My friends, there is nothing more revealing about the amendment than that the focus is on civilian employment. That could mean no installation could be closed--it could remain open, could be forced to remain open, with no military presence at all, no military people, but just 225 civilians, and the base being left open. It is incredible. 
Let me finally say, the Secretary of Defense has recommended a Presidential veto of this bill if this amendment goes through, and I strongly support that. This is a very dangerous thing for national security. 
I thank the Senator from Indiana.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is a line that has entered American slang, and that is, `That is a tough act to follow.' Mr. President, I think that certainly applies now when I make my remarks following those of our most distinguished Senator of the U.S. Senate, Senator Byrd. 
Senator Byrd, I know that Senator Coats will say this for himself, but both of us appreciate the honorable conduct of this many long years' debate that we have had together--and, unfortunately, we will have in the future, since Senator Coats and I do not intend to give up on this issue. 
More importantly, there was a seminal moment, I think after about 5 years of our debating this issue, when you walked up to Senator Coats and me and said, `I believe you're really sincere in your belief that the line-item veto is both constitutional and appropriate for America.' That was, frankly, one of the greatest compliments that either one of us have been paid in our time here in the Senate. 
May I say that Senator Coats and I continue to intend to fight this battle. I must say, in all sincerity, it will be much more difficult for me. It will be a much more arduous task without the companionship and friendship of an individual that has the highest moral standards and the highest dedication and commitment to the betterment of this Nation and its families than my dear friend from Indiana. He is not gone yet from this body, and we have the rest of the year to fight this battle, but one of my deepest regrets is that my dear friend and partner will not be there. 
Mr. President, I intend to speak briefly on this issue, and I know that Senator Coats does, also. Let me make just a couple of comments. 
One, it is important to point out that my understanding of the reason given by the Supreme Court for the 6-3 decision was that the Constitution requires every bill to be presented to the President for his approval or disapproval--every bill. In other words, my understanding of this decision is not that the concept of transferring this power to the President of the United States lacked constitutionality, but the fact that each bill was not sent to the President for approval or disapproval was where the Supreme Court made this decision. 
Now, if that is the case, it is an argument that S. 4--which Senator Coats and I cosponsored, and was passed by a vote of 69-29, known as separate enrollment--will be constitutional. As we all know, we went into negotiations with the House that passed enhanced recession--the budgeteers and Finance Committee people--and we made certain concessions which resulted in enhanced recession. But the original bill that was passed by a vote of 69-29 through the Senate was separate enrollment, which meant that every bill would separately be presented to the President of the United States for his approval or disapproval. 
In all due respect to my friend from Michigan, the allegation that somehow we were handing constitutional power--if I wrote the words down correctly--`to repeal or modify laws without congressional involvement,' clearly it calls for congressional involvement. The Senator from Michigan knows that. If he vetoes it, it comes back to the Congress of the United States for veto override. That is not noninvolvement. Let's be very clear here as to what the original bill that passed 69-29 said. 
Finally, we can't justify spending $150,000 to fund the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness, or $84,000 earmarked for Vidalia onions. My all-time favorite--one year we spent a couple million dollars to study the effect on the ozone layer of flatulence of cows. We can't do that kind of thing. 
Unfortunately, the President of the United States now, again, does not have the power that 43 Governors in America have, and that is the line-item veto power. 
Today, Senator Coats and I will reintroduce the separate enrollment bill that passed 69-29 through the U.S. Senate. We believe that clearly has constitutionality, and we will be getting expert opinions. But our initial understanding of the Supreme Court decision is based on the fact that these were not separate bills sent to the President of the United States for approval or disapproval. The fundamentals of the separate enrollment bill, which passed in the 104th Congress by a vote of 69-29, was exactly that and will meet those standards. 
We will have many more hours of discussion and debate on this issue both in the public forums around America as well as on the floor of the Senate. I thank Senator Byrd for his extreme courtesy. I look forward to further debate with him and others on this issue. I believe the time and the opinion of the American people, as well as the Constitution of the United States, is overwhelmingly in favor of the line-item veto in the form of separate enrollment. 
Today, The Supreme Court struck down the line-item veto in a 6-3 decision. I am very saddened by this decision. This 6-3 decision concludes that the line-item veto act violates the part of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the President for his approval. 
This is a bad decision. Polls from previous years indicate that 83 percent of the American people support giving the President the line-item veto. We need the line-item veto act to restore balance to the federal budget process. 
The line-item veto act was a vital force in restoring the appropriate balance of power, and eliminating wasteful, unnecessary pork-barrel spending. Unfortunately, pork barrel spending is alive and well. Most recently, the FY 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill had $241,486,300 million in specifically earmarked pork-barrel spending. The FY 1999 Energy Water Appropriations Bill contained approximately $649,428,000 million for specially earmarked projects that were not included in the budget request. 
We can not afford this magnitude of pork barrel spending when we have accumulated a multi-trillion dollar national debt. Right now, today, we use a huge portion of our federal budget to make the interest payments on our multi-trillion national debt. In fact, this interest payment almost equals the entire budget for national defense. 
Mr. President, we can not justify spending $150,000 to fund the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness, or an $84,000 earmark for vidalia onion, when we should be using this money to pay down the national debt, or provide tax cuts for hard-working middle class Americans. Until recently, we amassed huge budget deficits. If we are to realize our anticipated future budget surpluses, we must exercise fiscal restraint. 
Our past budget deficits can return to haunt us. These past deficits did not occur by accident. They occurred because we shifted the balance of power away from the executive branch to the legislative branch. In 1974 the Budget Impoundment Act was passed, which deprived the President of the United States of the authority to impound funds. This was a tremendous shift in power. This shift eroded the executive branch's ability to exercise fiscal responsibility and fiscal restraint. 
Our objective is to curb wasteful pork-barrel spending. Even though the line-item veto was recently struck down, there are other means to reaffirm the appropriate balance of power, and curb pork-barrel spending. 
Shortly, Senator Coats and I will introduce another approach to curbing Congress' appetite for mindless unnecessary and wasteful spending of hard-working American's tax dollars. 
Essentially, the Separate Enrollment Act of 1998 will require that each item in any appropriations measure or authorization shall be considered to be a separate item. 
Legal scholars contend that the separate enrollment concept is constitutional. Congress has the right to present a bill to the President of the United States. Separate enrollment merely addresses the question of what constitutes a bill. It does not erode or interfere with the presentment of the bill to the President. Under the rulemaking clause, Congress alone can determine the procedures for defining and enrolling a bill. Separate Enrollment is constitutional and will clearly work. 
Separate Enrollment is not a new concept. This concept is not controversial. The Senate adopted S.4, a separate enrollment bill in the 104th Congress, by a vote of 69 to 29. Its mechanics are simple * * *. This bill requires each spending item in legislation to be enrolled as a separate bill. If the President chose to veto one of these items, each of these vetoes would be returned to Congress separately for an override. 
The Separate Enrollment Act will help to restore some of the Executive Branch's role in the Federal budgeting process. The current budget process is in disarray. We have a huge national debt. We have budget surpluses that can easily be `spent' away. Our system of checks and balances is out of sync in the budget process. Congress has too much power over the federal purse strings, and the President has too little. While the line-item veto is not an instant fix to this dilemma, it is a valuable tool to realign the balance of powers, and check Congress' appetite for reckless pork barrel spending. 
This is a nonpartisan issue. The issue is fiscal responsibility. We have 100 Senators, and 435 Representatives. It is hard to place responsibility upon any one member. Thus, no one is accountable for our runaway budget process. The line-item veto act, or a separate enrollment bill would make it more difficult for the Congress to blame the President for not vetoing an entire appropriations bill. Our new proposal will allow the President to surgically remove wasteful pork-barrel spending from appropriations and authorizations bills. 
Past Presidents have sought the line-item veto. Congress finally agreed in 1995, when we passed the line item veto, to redistribute some of the power in the federal budget process. By giving the President a stronger role, the line-item veto, or a Separate Enrollment Act would instill additional Presidential accountability and Federal spending, and reduce the excesses of the congressional process that focus on locality specific earmarking, and caters to special interest, not the national interest, as it should. 
Mr. President, in closing, I simply ask my colleagues to be fair and reasonable when addressing the issue on fiscal responsibility. The line-item veto and the shifting the balance of power in the budget process is vital to curbing wasteful pork-barrel spending. Again, I look forward to the day when we can go before the American people with a budget that is both fiscally responsible and ends the practice of earmarking funds in the appropriations process. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time to the Senator from Indiana.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, every year I come down to the floor of the Senate and ruminate over the propensity of Members of Congress to add programs to spending bills solely, or at least primarily, for parochial reasons. The majority of us in Congress who supported the line-item veto were ostensibly doing so as an overdue reaction to the profligate spending practices that, over time, resulted in a $5.5 trillion federal deficit. The fact that we have a balanced budget for the first time since 1969 should not detract from the fact that we continue, as a result of past spending practices, to pay as much per year in interest on the federal debt as we do for national defense. 
The practice of adding programs to spending bills for parochial reasons has not abated, as a review of the ISTEA legislation reminds us. For many of us in the Senate, however, there has been a growing consensus that inadequate resources are being allocated for national defense, and that the financial burden associated with foreign operations like those in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, the funding for which is repeatedly ignored in Administration preparation of annual budget submissions, is seriously exacerbating readiness and modernization problems stemming from the combination of shrinking force structure and expanding commitments. When the stress from these conflicting trends is combined with the fact that no funding was added by Congress to the national defense portion of the federal budget for the first time since President Clinton took office, the seeds of a further, serious degradation in the state of our Armed Forces are firmly planted. 
Because Congress did not add to the Administration's request for national defense, it would have seemed to be incumbent upon Members to act with a modicum of responsibility and not perpetuate funding problems with a business as usual approach. Unfortunately, we have once again failed to live up to that relatively minor expectation. The bill before us is one more example of why the President's failure to adequately exercise his line-item veto authority last year has provided Members every incentive to manipulate the budget process for the good of individual districts or states and, often, at the expense of what is best for the Armed Forces. 
In my remarks last year, I was highly critical of the politicization of the services' unfunded priorities lists. That concern remains to some degree. My comments today include items that were added to the Administration's request and are on the unfunded priorities list both because of my concerns about the integrity of the process through which those lists are produced and because the lists were always submitted in the past within the context of congressionally-implemented additions to the defense budget. As additions to the budget request this year had to be offset within the 050 account, I have included projects added by Members even if they are on the lists because, in some instances, they are displacing funding from higher priority programs. 
I commend the chairman of the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee for his valiant effort at minimizing the usual considerable damage to science and technology programs that are the seed corn of our future. Senator Santorum deserves credit for the manner in which he has balanced the need to preserve high priority science and technology spending with the usual onslaught of frivolous pet projects inserted into the budget to mollify this university or that laboratory. It is unfortunate that he could not be spared the onerous and wasteful task of nevertheless finding funding for a number of highly questionable projects. Spending $1.5 million to study the effects on missile components of high frequency vibrations sounds reasonable. The only problem is, we have been studying that issue with regard to every missile and rocket designed since the dawn of the missile age. It is inclusive in the development of every such weapon system. This is not a better mousetrap; it s a classic waste of scarce resources. 
Similarly, the $3 million added to the budget for research into stainless steel double hull technologies ignores the fact that privately-owned shipyards seeking to profit from the oil pollution act, which mandated that all future oil tankers be double hulled, have already conducted ample research into that area with financial incentives courtesy of the Title XI loan guarantee program. Additionally, what can the Navy learn from this project that it doesn't already know from its years of experience with high strength, light weight steels such as are used in the construction of submarines? Mr. Chairman, this is precisely the type of spending the majority party was supposed to oppose--the kind that helped create a huge federal deficit while diverting funding from higher priority programs. 
No better example of Congress operating at its fiscal worst exists than the inclusion in the budget of more C-130J aircraft. The Air Force has repeatedly emphasized its huge surplus of C-130s, yet is forced to buy more completely irrespective of requirements and funding priorities. The annual addition to the defense budget of C-130Js--and we are buying enough of them to house the homeless in brand-new fuselages--is fiscally irresponsible in the extreme. To see four new aircraft added to the bill when the accompanying report is highly critical of the C-130J due to cost overruns and developmental problems sets a new standard for absurdity. What if we said, `we don't need the Sergeant York air defense gun, it was a developmental nightmare, we can't afford it, it was canceled by the Reagan Administration, so let's add the purchase of some to this budget?' It would be the only thing more incomprehensible than the continued acquisition of unrequested C-130s. 
Lest anyone think that I exaggerate the budgetary impact of purchasing four unrequested, unneeded C-130J airframes, consider this: The cost of those aircraft is over $200 million. That is a lot of money at a time when we are struggling to pay for important quality of life programs and maintain readiness. Yet, this is not even the most egregious example of unnecessary, unrequested spending in the budget. This bill also includes a $50 million down payment on a $1.5 billion amphibious assault ship that was not requested by the Navy. 
The defense authorization and appropriations bills cannot continue to be the vehicle for pumping tax dollars into favored districts and states. There are $2.5 billion in Member-adds in this bill, a bill, to reiterate, that did not enjoy an increase in its top line. That means that the funding for these programs had to be found within the Defense Department s request. It means that the priorities of the military were ignored in favor of channeling dollars toward projects of low or nonexistent priority. How much more should we provide to the flat panel display industry, which should be funding its own research? With all due respect to Norway, a NATO ally, how long are we going to allow it to leverage its weapons purchases from the United States against our purchase of Penguin missiles, which the Navy has not requested? 
Mr. President, there are a number of programs inserted into the budget by Members of Congress that bear little or no relation to the mission of providing for the common defense. There are programs that arguably will, over time, contribute to our national security. I further recognize that Congress does not exist to perfunctorily bless whatever recommendations emerge from the federal agencies we are tasked to oversee. The Constitution of the United States vests Congress with the authority to raise and support Armies. That is a responsibility some of us take very seriously. The practice of adding and earmarking funding for programs and activities that marginally contribute to the national defense in order to protect jobs, however, represents an abuse of that authority we should not countenance. We should take no pride in the fact that the Army was forced to accept the National Automotive Center as the focal point for the development of automotive technology. Why should the public not think the worst of us when they see their tax dollars handled so cavalierly? 
These statements, which I make on every spending bill, get tiresome after a while. My colleagues don't like to hear them, and I certainly don't win any popularity contests on account of them. I would like to wax poetic about charging windmills, but I am under no illusions that my Dulcinea waits outside the chamber or that a final reward awaits me in the great beyond. All I ask is for it to stop. Adding ships, planes, helicopters and the usual myriad of arcane research and development projects to a defense bill at a time when the state of the Armed Forces continues to suffer from high operational rates and contracting force structure, when we struggle to provide military retirees the medical care they were promised when they enlisted, when the services are repeatedly telling us that they don't need what we insist they buy, does not speak well of Congress as an institution. I urge my colleagues to heed the warning not of me, but of the combatant commanders and the men and women in the field who are tired and leaving the military because we cannot get our priorities in order.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate has confirmed three members to the new Amtrak Reform Board, as provided for under the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, P.L. 105-134. That law required a new 7-member Reform Board to replace Amtrak's current Board of Directors. By today's confirmation of Governor Tommy Thompson, Governor Michael Dukaskis, and Mayor John Robert Smith, along with the automatic confirmation of Secretary Rodney Slater, a quorum of new members will be constituted and in turn, the new Board will immediately assume the old Board's responsibilities. This action ensures Amtrak's authorization remains in tact. 
I think it is important to discuss the background leading up to today's confirmations. As my colleagues know, the Amtrak reform legislation enacted last December required Amtrak to operate more like a real business. After 27 years and more than $22 billion in taxpayers subsidies, that new law finally sends a real signal that this is Amtrak's `last chance' to turn itself into a viable operation. The status quo has been, and remains, unacceptable. If Amtrak cannot find a way to free itself from its subsidy `fix,' then the Amtrak we know today will cease to exist. 
Amtrak has been directed to institute substantive changes to enable it to operate free of subsidies by 2002. As such, Congress and the Administration agreed that new leadership at Amtrak was imperative, which is why we provided for a new Reform Board to replace the current Amtrak Board of Directors. It is absolutely necessary to instill a `new culture' among Amtrak employees and management if Amtrak is ever to become a legitimate business. And that new culture necessitates changes that start from the top. 
Let me remind my colleagues that during the last days of negotiations on the reform legislation, three members of the Amtrak Board of Directors, along with Secretary Slater who is also a Board member, negotiated a new labor agreement to give union employees a raise. In the real world it is not very typical for Board members to negotiate labor deals. Yet these three--and at times four--did. They agreed to raise salaries, which is projected to cost Amtrak $35 million in FY 1998 alone, as it is assumed its terms will be extended to all its other unions. It is further projected these costs will grow to $60 million in future year obligations. 
One must ask, how could these Board members have been upholding their fiduciary responsibilities by agreeing to increase Amtrak's obligations at the very time Amtrak is looming on the brink of bankruptcy? Amtrak's projected net loss for FY 1998 is greater than the previous year's due in part to the current Board's own actions. Its losses are growing, Mr. President, even though under the law Amtrak has less than two years to demonstrate it can achieve its financial goals, or risk dissolution. 
Mr. President, the Democratic Presidentially-appointed Board Members who negotiated the union salary hike assured us at the time that their high-priced labor agreement would require no action by Congress--nor more importantly, would the labor agreement place any additional obligations on the American taxpayers. That was their assurance, even though one of the agreement's contingencies was that the Administration had to request $1.4 billion in additional funding above Amtrak's glidepath projections. So, what has the Administration done? 
The Administration didn't request the additional funding, yet the Board did nothing to nullify the contract. Instead, the Administration and Amtrak are now asking Congress to agree to shuffle Amtrak's operating and capital costs. Specifically, they want us to agree to shift labor costs into Amtrak's `capital' account so that Amtrak can pay for the Board's labor agreement with funds currently directed for capital investment. 
When are we going to say enough is enough? Just how long are the American taxpayers going to be forced to cover the expenses stemming from Amtrak's poor management decisions? It surely won't be hard for Amtrak to tell Congress it met requirements to be free of operating subsidy if the current group at Amtrak can pull this one off. All operating costs could essentially vanish with the stroke of a pen and become capital costs. 
And, if Amtrak and the Administration are successful--and I acknowledge Amtrak's political clout in the Congress--how will Amtrak make up for its loss in capital? If Amtrak is permitted to shift capital funds to cover wage increases and other items 
traditionally considered operating costs, would someone please tell me how Amtrak will make up for the corresponding loss in funding for its capital improvements. I think I know how. Amtrak will just come a calling to Congress to bail it out, just like always. 
Mr. President, time and again we have been told Amtrak faces critical infrastructure investment needs which must be met if Amtrak is to have any chance of becoming a viable operation. Time and again we have been told Amtrak needs capital resources to invest in its future. But as I see it, the change they propose has the potential for completely jeopardizing Amtrak's abilities to meet its capital needs which it has sought so long to accomplish. 
Mr. President, it is unconscionable that while Congress was under intense negotiations to reach agreement on reform legislation, which was required to release the $2.3 billion so-called `tax credit' to Amtrak, the Amtrak Board was doing anything it could to appease the labor unions. Of course, it is no secret who the democratic party is beholden to. While Amtrak's financial situation is in dire straights--looming on the brink of bankruptcy--its democratic Board members agreed to raise union salaries, increasing Amtrak's opperating--and I stress operating--costs by millions of dollars annually. By adopting these wage increases, the current Board failed to fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities not only to Amtrak, but to the American taxpayer as well. Is it any wonder the Congress decided that the Board has to go? 
The Congress should be concerned about this situation because two of the six Presidential nominees for the new board are holdovers from the current Board. Another holdover is the Secretary of the Department of Transportation. That makes THREE holdovers according to my count. And these are three of the four that negotiated this sweetheart deal for labor. Surely we did not call for a new Board only to maintain the current members? Doesn't the Administration have any respect for Congressional intent? 
The Administration can not argue that it was unaware of Congressional intent because Administration representatives participated in the reform legislation negotiations. Let me remind the Administration about the provisions we discuss today. First, a new 7-member reform Board is to be established. Second, specific eligibility criteria was incorporated in the new law in an attempt to ensure that the new Board members would be qualified to perform their duties. Third, the law requires the new Board to be comprised of individuals with transportation, corporate, or financial expertise. 
To further enhance Amtrak's operations, several provisions were included to prompt timely action by the Administration and Congress on filling the new Board. Unfortunately, the spirit of these provisions was met with little respect by the Administration. 
The law required the new Board to be in place by March 31, 1998--more than 2 months ago. Yet, the Senate did not receive even a single nomination from the President until the eve of the Memorial Day Recess. Due to concerns that the Administration may drag its feet indefinitely--which only would hurt Amtrak--Amtrak's authorization was linked to the nomination and confirmation of a new Board. Specifically, the law provides that if the new Reform Board has not assumed the responsibilities of the Amtrak Board of Directors before July 1st, Amtrak's authorization lapses. The law also automatically discharged pending Board nomination from the Senate Commerce Committee if the Committee had failed to act by June 1st. 
As I said, the new Reform Board was to be in place more than two months ago. Presidential nominations require Senate confirmation, with hearings and review by the appropriate Senate Committees accompanying nominations. Yet due to the lack of timely action by the Administration, the Commerce Committee had no opportunity to carry out its duties prior to the statutory automatic June 1st discharge. I must ask, was the Administration's timing a direct attempt to circumvent the Commerce Committee's authority in this regard? 
Mr. President, my position regarding the new Board was made clear from day one. I repeatedly voiced my concerns to the Administration each time I heard rumors of its plans to reappoint current members. I was very clear that the Commerce Committee would not report favorably any Board hold-overs and I remained firm on that position. I truly believed even the Administration would acknowledge we didn't create a new Board only to reappoint the same members. 
So what happened? The Administration sent up the nominations as Congress headed into the Memorial Day recess. Two of the six nominations needing confirmation were Board holdovers--that is, one-third. The Administration must have known that the Commerce Committee would be unable to fulfill its hearings and review prior to the statutory discharge date, given the Administration's stealth nomination submission. 
Mr. President, if a new board is not constituted before July 1st, Amtrak's authorization will lapse. That is why the Majority Leader, myself and others are seeking to move forward with some of the nominations in order to meet that deadline. But I stand firm that we should not take these or any other confirmations lightly. 
We should demand the intent of the law be fulfilled. We should demand that the new Board not be riddled with potential conflicts of interest by members representing competing transportation businesses and serving on state transit agencies. We should demand some legitimacy to this operation if we really expect Amtrak is to ever become a viable transportation provider.

The Feingold amendment, 2 minutes of debate by the distinguished chairman, Senator Thurmond, on the Feingold amendment, which would then complete all debate on the Feingold amendment; the Bumpers amendment, relative to the F-22, limited to 30 minutes under the control of Senator Bumpers, 10 minutes under the control of the chairman, and 5 minutes under the control of Senator Cleland; the Byrd amendment, with 20 minutes reserved prior to a vote on the Byrd amendment, which would be 5 minutes for Senator Byrd, 5 minutes for Senator Levin, 5 minutes for Senator Snowe, and 5 minutes for Senator Kennedy. 
Following that, Senator Thompson will be recognized for a colloquy regarding State taxation. Senator Ford will be recognized on the same subject for up to 10 minutes. Following that will be a Thurmond-Levin amendment relative to pay, on which there will be 2 minutes, equally divided; a Burns amendment relative to milcon, with 5 minutes equally divided; a McCain second-degree amendment to the Burns amendment, limited to 5 minutes under the control of Senator McCain and 10 minutes under the control of Senator Stevens. Then the 2 managers will be recognized to do a series of cleared amendments. Following that will be a Warner-Levin-Lott amendment regarding the naming of the bill. 
I further ask that following the disposition or conclusion of debate on the above list of amendments, votes begin at no earlier than 8 p.m. and no later than 8:30 p.m. in a stacked sequence, and that the Byrd amendment relative to gender recur after disposition of the Bumpers amendment, with 10 minutes equally divided for closing remarks, and a vote to occur on the Byrd amendment. 
I further ask that following the disposition of the Byrd amendment, and prior to disposition of the Gramm amendment, 4 minutes be equally divided on the Gramm amendment; that the Gramm amendment be deemed agreed to, and the Senate proceed to the remaining sequenced votes, with 2 minutes for debate between each vote for explanation. 
I further ask that following the disposition of the above listed amendments, the bill be advanced to the third reading. 
Mr. President, in keeping with that, I have every expectation that not all time that is allowed will be used under this time agreement, in the interest of comity to other Senators who are having to leave the country tonight on official business. I hope we can shrink these times that have been agreed to.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I stand before this body to address the considerable number of low-priority, unrequested military construction projects that have been added to the FY 1999 Military Construction Appropriations Bill. 
Since the end of the `Cold War,' the budget that provides for the defense of this nation has been cut in half as a percentage of the gross domestic product and by over $120 billion in real terms. As a result of these drastic cuts, our military force structure has shrunk by more than 30 percent; Operations and Maintenance accounts have been reduced by 40 percent; procurement has declined by more than 50 percent, and paychecks for our service members now lag an embarrassing 13 percent behind their civilian counterparts. 
In stark contrast, our military has seen a 400 percent increase in operational commitments over the same period. The tempo of operations has never been so high in a time of peace. And yet, America's military personnel have performed admirably, bridging the gap between decreased funding and increased commitments with sheer dedication to duty and professionalism. Unfortunately, the damage caused by the Administration's continual practice of asking the military to `do more with less,' is becoming very evident. 
Retention rates throughout the military are down. Mid-grade officers and senior non-commissioned officers--groups traditionally thought of as career oriented personnel--are exiting the service in increasing numbers. All of the services are facing pilot shortages, no doubt precipitated by reductions in flight hours, declining aircraft availability, and increased time away from home. 
Recruitment goals are not being met. Except for the Marine Corps, all of the services are falling short of their recruiting to 7,000 recruits short by the end of the year. This follows the Navy's 12,000 recruit shortfall of last year. When recruiters offer potential recruits the opportunity to be over-worked, underpaid, spartanly supported and often away from home, many of America's best and brightest are saying `no thank you.' 
Readiness is in decline. Secretary Cohen, the service chiefs, regional commanders in chief, and various other military leaders have acknowledged that there are significant indicators of readiness problems. 
There are also significant shortages of critical spare parts. These shortages are forcing maintenance personnel to routinely use cannibalized parts--parts taken off of other supposedly operational systems--to keep equipment operating. 
All of these problems--declining readiness, retention and recruitment shortfalls, inoperative equipment--are the result of chronic under-funding of our nation's security interests. 
The Congress, most certainly, has not turned a blind eye to the needs of the services. In the previous three years, Congress has added more than $20 billion to the defense budget requests submitted by the Clinton Administration. So why do we still have these serious and growing deficiencies in readiness, pay, and modernization? Because the practice of Congress has tragically been to mis-use billions of these scarce defense dollars to add unrequested programs and building projects to the defense budget. 
This year's Military Construction Appropriations Bill was crafted under the spending caps of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. The agreement established firm limits to the National Defense budget. With these budget constraints in place, on would think that members would find it difficult to even consider adding projects of questionable merit, since the offsets required to pay for such requests would siphon precious dollars from areas of greater need within the defense budget. The temptation for members to pander to their parochial interests, I am sad to report, has proven too great to resist. 
One only needs to look at the 114 unrequested military construction projects, at a cost of nearly $800 million in the FY 1999 Military Construction Appropriations bill, to realize the pork habit has become an addiction. If this bill is accepted as written, we will have added $9 billion in unrequested military construction projects since 1990. Nine billion dollars! 
The question is not whether these unrequested military construction projects can be defended as meeting the Senate's review criteria or as actions within the prerogatives of Congress. The question is whether we are directing scarce defense resources where they will do the greatest good for our country and for the men and women of our All Volunteer Force. I believe we are not. 
This bill funds ten unrequested National Guard armories and Reserve centers at a cost of $65 million. Twelve million dollars is appropriated to replace existing dining facilities at two joint civilian/military airports--one, at Dannelly Field, Alabama and the other, at Ft. Wayne, Indiana. Hickman Air Force Base will get a new $5.1 million dollar civil engineering facility to replace the existing one. 
The folks at Fort Wainwright, Alaska will doubtless see readiness levels soar as they christen their new $3 million vehicle wash facility. Fort Bragg, South Carolina gets $8.3 million to erect mission critical fencing. 
At a time when many installations are closing libraries because of lack of use, this bill appropriates $8.5 million dollars to build a very impressive, yet unnecessary library at Shaw Air Force Base. 
Training at the National Training Center has suffered due to personnel and funding cuts, and the number of `Red Flag' air combat exercises has also been reduced due to funding cuts. Yet this bill appropriates nearly $14 million for a `Regional Training Institute' at Camp Dawson, West Virginia--a small National Guard weekend drill facility. 
Many of the additions to this bill were made in the name of service member quality of life. It is interesting to note that not a single one of the Chief of Naval Operations' unfunded priority, quality of life projects is in this bill. The Commandant of the Marine Corps has priority quality of life project on the list of adds. None of the Air Force's top six unfunded quality of life projects made this bill. Only one of the top 15 did. 
In contrast, 95 percent of the construction projects in the amendment are to be built in the States or districts of appropriations committee members. 
In closing, let me say that I am sure there are many good projects on this list. Many of these projects will serve to improve the quality of life of our military personnel, and they will provide facilities and improvements that will enhance mission readiness. But the real reason these projects are funded in this bill is that they provide economic benefit to certain states. 
With today's budget realities, it is absolutely critical that every defense dollar be spent where it will do the most good. We, the Congress, must stop the practice carving out our little portion of the Defense Budget to keep the folks at home happy. We must, instead, do what is best for the services as a whole. We owe nothing less to our men and women in uniform.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be brief; the hour is late. 
We have presently, Mr. President, 11,800 families who are eligible for food stamps. We have a hemorrhaging of qualified men and women out of the military. We are now dropping down, as far as our standards for recruiting, to a lower level than any time since the Vietnam war. 
All objective observers recognize that we are not modernizing our force, nor are we maintaining a level of readiness that is necessary obviously to carry out our responsibilities. And what we are finding more and more is an increasingly dangerous world. So when, as happens around here from time to time, $200 million was found and appeared, of course one might suppose that those pressing issues might be addressed. But, no; they came up with a list of 22, guess what, MilCon projects. 
I looked at the MilCon projects and examined them and had some study done by experts, and I could find only one commonality to these projects, and that is that 90 percent of them happened to be in the State or districts of members of the Appropriations Committees. 
I also found out that the Army got nine projects, one of which was on the unfunded priority list of the Chief of Staff of the Army. Two projects were removed from the original amendment because they could not be completed in the Future Years Defense Plan. So did the committee go to the list of priorities to find the next two most deserving projects? No. They found two other low priority projects from the same State. 
The Air Force had 40 items of higher priority projects on this list, only 40, about $2 billion worth of projects which were assessed by the Air Force to be a higher property. The Army had nearly $2.5 billion worth of higher priority projects than any of these projects. The Navy's list of unfunded priorities totaled $2.1 billion. Funding anything on the unfunded priority list of the Chief of Naval Operations would have been a higher priority since not one of these projects--not one--was on the list of the Chief of Naval Operations. 
The facts here are very interesting: 67 percent of the 27 projects were not scheduled to be funded until the last 2 years of the Future Year's Defense Plan. 
As I said before, not a single one was on the priority list of the Navy. None of the Air Force's top six unfunded quality-of-life projects made this list. Only 1 of the top 15 did. Ninety percent, as I mentioned, of the construction projects in the amendment are to be built in the States or districts of Senate and House Appropriations Committee members. 
Half of the added projects are for the Air Force. The Air Force is a fine, fine service, my friends, but it is the service that claims it will be able to meet the new one-plus-one barracks living standard a full 10 years ahead of any of the other services. 
The Marine Corps gets one project--one project--and it was second to the last on the Commandant's list. This is a service that will take nearly 40 years to meet the same standard as the Air Force 33 years after the Air Force. The Navy gets 25 percent of the total number of projects and 14 percent of the money. What is more egregious is the fact that the Navy won't get one priority project that the Navy asked for. 
Mr. President, these are quality-of-life projects. The Senator from Montana is right. But no objective observer can view this list as in any way addressing first the requirements of the military and much needed improvements in the military, much less the military construction projects that are needed. 
Mr. President, as I have said at the beginning of my comments, we live in a very dangerous world. We will have some serious foreign policy crises. I am not sure we have the military that is capable of meeting some of these foreseeable threats, but I know that what we are doing with this $200 million will not do a single thing to improve our ability to meet that threat. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 5 minutes. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his courtesy. 
Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment concerning the continuing U.S. military presence in Bosnia. This is a second degree amendment to amendment No. 2975. 
Mr. President, I believe everyone in this body knows that I have long had serious concerns about our mission in Bosnia. From the time the IFOR mission was first briefed to the Congress, I knew the job could not be completed in one year--nor against any arbitrary deadline. Instead, I urged the Administration to set concrete objectives and benchmarks for measuring success. 
Now, as many members have pointed out, we are in an open-ended and ill-defined military commitment. The Administration has scrapped all the artificial deadlines. But no clear set of objectives and well-defined military missions has taken its place. We seem to drift in and out of going after war criminals, of using the military to resettle refugees, and of taking on a direct political role in parts of Bosnia in the name of supporting international civilian authorities. The role of our military has expanded, and there is no end in sight. 
The answer to this problem, however, is not to go back and set new artificial deadlines. Bosnia is a long-term, complicated problem. It involves not only the warring factions, but has direct effects on Croatia and Serbia, including Kosovo, and threatens to spillover to the wider Balkan region. The credibility of NATO and especially the United States is tied up with finding a solution for the Bosnia crisis. It would be sheer irresponsibility, probably leading to renewed warfare, if we were to precipitously pull out of Bosnia after investing so much. It would be a betrayal of our commitment to cooperating with our Allies. And it could well lead to an even more costly and dangerous re-introduction of American forces to stop the renewed fighting. 
Dealing with the Bosnia crisis--even if though our objective is to get American troops out of there--requires treating Bosnia as a serious long-term challenge. It is not an issue that lends itself to artificial deadlines for withdrawal. Nor is there any rationale to forcing the Congress to vote by some artificial deadline. Worse still would be a funding cut-off, which would only punish our troops for the failure of policymakers in Washington to craft a viable long-term policy. 
Handling the Bosnia crisis requires us to look beyond just this fiscal year. It requires the United States to develop a multi-year strategy that sets out our objectives, the means for achieving these objectives, and a target timetable for getting us there--but no phony deadlines. For the sake of our troops, we need to set out clearly the military and non-military missions they are being asked to perform. `Creative ambiguity' may be useful in politics, but it is dangerous for soldiers. We need to be honest with ourselves about the risks we are asking our troops to face, and the costs to the taxpayers of continuing the mission. 
I am convinced that the direction we should be taking is to move toward a force made up of European nations inside Bosnia, with U.S. forces just `over-the-horizon' outside of Bosnia--providing a rapid response capability to deter or defeat security threats, and providing logistical, intelligence, and air support to the European forces inside Bosnia. This step would free up U.S. forces to prepare for other contingencies. 
But it is not possible to achieve this goal simply by setting arbitrary numbers and deadlines for troop withdrawals. Doing so could provoke a crisis with our Allies and could have the effect of simply setting a timetable for restoring violence to Bosnia. Instead, achieving this goal requires working together with our Allies and realistically taking account of the situation inside Bosnia. 
Mr. President, my amendment seeks to do exactly these things. It expresses the sense of the Senate that we need to have a clearer picture of our objectives, timetable, missions assigned to our military, risks, and costs. It expresses the sense of the Senate that we should be moving toward a European force inside Bosnia, and a U.S. `over-the-horizon' capability outside Bosnia. It also says it is time to stop treating Bosnia as an unplanned emergency and include funding for operations there as an addition to the defense budget. 
My amendment also imposes a number of reporting requirements. Each time the Administration submits a budget request for funding military operations in Bosnia, the Administration must clearly state its best assessment of six items:

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I make one remark before I move to table. We will be taking up the Department of Defense appropriations bill after this. I recommended that the Senator from New Hampshire propose a simple amendment which would cut off funding for further operations in Bosnia. That is a right, as part of our role as advice and consent--keeping with an earlier debate that we had--to somehow draw down and set troop levels in Bosnia. 
Therefore, since among other things I am opposed to the amendment in principle, but also there is a parliamentary standpoint, I think it would be much more appropriate to propose an amendment on the Department of Defense appropriations bill that would give us all a chance to be on record as to whether we support funding or not. 
I now move to table the Smith amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was looking at the amendment. I find it to be very interesting. 
First of all, there is a very strongly worded letter from the Secretary of Defense: 
Congress has given me the responsibility to organize and manage the Department's operations efficiently. I need to preserve my existing authority to fulfill that responsibility. 
I think Secretary Cohen's words are very important. We should keep them in mind. 
Mr. President, I was looking at this amendment. There is a prohibition, and there is a sense-of-the-Senate part of the prohibition which says, `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no action may be taken, and no funds appropriated, or otherwise available to the Department of Defense, may be obligated or expended to effect, or implement, the closure of a military installation within 4 years after the completion of a realignment of the installation.' 
That alone--`. . . or with other causes, reduce the number of civilian personnel employed at that installation below 225.' 
I find that an astonishing clause. First of all, civilian employment seems to be the case here. Second of all, 4 years? 
Suppose you had an installation--I ask the Senator from Oklahoma--that had 230 civilian employees, and a contract at the base at the Pentagon was canceled, therefore negating the need for the civilian workers, and reduce them by 6, down from 230, down to 224. Nothing can be done by the Secretary of Defense for 4 years? This is a very unusual restraint that we are attempting to impart on the Secretary of Defense. 
Second of all, on the sort of findings here, there is one finding that should be leading of all in this; that is, base closures save money. That is something that we seem to avoid in this debate--that fact. If base closures didn't save money, Mr. President, we made a horrible mistake at the end of World War II. Do you know? We made a terrible mistake at the end of World War II, because there were thousands of bases around America. Do you know what? We closed them. I can't imagine how much that must have cost the taxpayer in order to close those thousands of bases. 
I sit here and listen to arguments that closing bases costs money. Of course it costs money in the short term. You are cleaning up an installation. But everybody knows that in the long term it saves money. And, unless we do so, you cannot hope to fund the modernization of the force and all of the other requirements that we need to meet the challenges of the 21st century. 
Mr. President, the Department of Defense estimates that they need to close about 50 major facilities and realign 25 others. That is so they can match infrastructure to force size and structure. 
I hear many, many hours of debate on the base closing issue, but I don't hear the debate that I think is necessary on the floor of the Senate in order to maintain our national defense capability--the overall question. We are spending less and less on defense. We are putting more money into pork 
barrel projects, and we are allowing a base to close. The ultimate result is that you reduce the capability of the military force. 
Not only did we turn back in committee. I was sorry that the Senator from Virginia chose to vote against the amendment in committee. Not only did we vote in committee against any base closing round anytime in the near future, but now we are going to restrict even the ability of the Secretary of Defense to move people around from one base to another in keeping with the changing mission. 
I, frankly, first of all, don't understand the argument that somehow closing bases doesn't save money. As I say, if we did, we made a terrible mistake after World War II and after the Korean war and after the Vietnam war. 
The other thing I don't understand is how we can worry about the Congressional Budget Office. The May 1 review is ongoing, and it is for the Congressional Budget Office to take the time necessary to provide a thoughtful and accurate evaluation of DOD's report rather than issue a preliminary and potentially inaccurate assessment. 
The Congressional Budget Office, in a remarkable act of courage, says the Congressional Budget Office recommended the Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of base closing if the Department of Defense believes there is a surplus of military capacity. 
Is there anybody who thinks that the Department of Defense doesn't believe there is a surplus of military capacity? After all, BRAC rounds have been carried out. This consideration, however, should follow an interval during which DOD and independent analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have been taken thus far. 
Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. 
I ask for an additional minute from the Senator from Michigan.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope someday that we will address the issues on this floor--like 11,100 military families on food stamps, like men and women who are leaving the military in droves because they do not have the equipment to fight with and operate with, like the incredible long deployments that we are sending these men and women on, like the fact that we are not prepared to meet the post-cold-war challenges in any reasonable and responsible way. Instead, we seem to spend our time arguing and fighting over a base closing. I think, frankly, it is something we ought to get resolved and behind us. If we never want to close a base, let's do that. But let's not go through this every single year.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, we have a historic opportunity to honor one of America's truly heroic pioneers. Lieutenant General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., United States Air Force (ret), has earned a hallowed place in the history of our armed forces, the history of our great nation, and arguably, the history of mankind. 
Today, in order to pay a just and fitting tribute to the exceptional contributions of Lt. General Davis, I offer this amendment that would authorize the President of the United States to promote Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., to the rank of General on the retired list of the United States Air Force. This promotion would not entail any additional pay or benefits for General Davis or his family. 
Lt. General Benjamin Davis's life has epitomized sustained superior performance in the face of singularly distinctive challenges. Though given the `silent treatment,' he graduated 35th in a class of 276 as the first African American graduate of the 20th century from the United States Military Academy at West Point. He was the first African American officer in the Army Air Forces, and was a member of the first African American pilot training class held at Tuskegee Army Airfield, Alabama. He led the 99th Pursuit Squadron and 332nd Fighter Group--known as the Tuskegee Airmen--into air combat over many locations in the European Theater of Operations. 
Following the integration of the Air Force, Colonel Davis held several significant commands. He was Commander of the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing, Suwon, Korea. After promotion to Brigadier General in 1954, he served as director of operations and training at headquarters, Far East Air Forces, Tokyo, Japan. Brigadier General Davis was the first and only African American General Officer from 1954 through the 1970s. 
General Davis was promoted to Major General in 1959 and Lieutenant General in 1965. Lt. General Davis retired from the active Air Force in 1970. He later served as Assistant Secretary of Transportation from 1971 to 1975. 
Lt. General Davis holds five honorary doctorate degrees, has served on numerous public and private panels, and has been the deserving recipient of numerous other distinguished honors. 
Though Lt. General Benjamin Davis's record is replete with laudable accomplishments, those accomplishments are all the more inspiring and significant when viewed against the backdrop of the time in America's history in which they occurred. 
His perseverance against the prejudices of his day showed his great depth of character. His unqualified successes in the face of those prejudices not only were a credit to himself, but they served as catalysts for societal change--change that not only has directly impacted the life of every American, but change that has arguably affected the world. America owes him a great debt of gratitude. 
Mr. President, the singularly distinctive accomplishments of Benjamin O. Davis Jr., make him uniquely qualified to receive this tremendous honor, an honor I do not propose lightly. I ask my colleagues' unanimous support for this amendment. There is no one more deserving, and no better way to express the gratitude of a grateful nation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment sponsored by myself, Senator Kerry, and Senator Smith of New Hampshire to express the sense of Congress regarding the heroism, sacrifice, and service of former South Vietnamese Commandos who fought with the United States during the Vietnam war. 
From 1961 to 1970, South Vietnamese soldiers were trained and recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense to fight behind enemy lines on behalf of the United States. Although the majority of these individuals were captured alive and taken prisoner by North Vietnam, the U.S. government declared them dead in order to avoid paying them for their services. 
Senator Kerry and I sponsored legislation contained in the Fiscal year 1997 Defense Authorization bill authorizing payment of up to $30,000 to each Commando determined eligible by the Secretary of Defense. 
Our amendment to the FY 1999 Defense Authorization bill makes the following findings: 
South Vietnamese Commandos were recruited by the United States for covert operations under OPLAN 34A or its predecessor, OPLAN 35, from 1961 to 1970; 
The Commandos conducted covert operations in North Vietnam during the Vietnam conflict; 
Many of the Commandos were captured and imprisoned by North Vietnamese forces for periods of up to 20 years; 
The Commandos served and fought proudly during the Vietnam conflict; 
Many of the Commandos lost their lives serving in operations conducted by the United States during the Vietnam conflict; 
Many of the Vietnamese Commandos now reside in the United Stats. 
Consequently, our amendment recognizes and honors the former South Vietnamese Commandos for their service to the United States. We are in debt to these individuals for fighting valiantly on our side during the Vietnam war. They deserve our continued support and gratitude. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Kerry and Senator Smith of New Hampshire in offering this amendment to the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization bill to allow payment of funds to the surviving parents or siblings of deceased Vietnamese Commandos. 
From 1961 to 1970, South Vietnamese soldiers were trained and recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense to undertake covert operations behind enemy lines on behalf of the United States. Although the majority of these individuals were captured alive and taken prisoner by North Vietnam, the U.S. government declared them dead in order to avoid paying them for their services. 
In 1996, Congress passed legislation I sponsored with Senator Kerry authorizing payment of up to $40,000 to each Commando determined eligible by the Secretary of Defense. In the case of a deceased Commando, payment was authorized to be made to the surviving spouse or, if there was no surviving spouse, to the surviving children of the decedent. 
Unfortunately, we did not anticipate the case of deceased Commandos who died unmarried and thus left no spouse or children to claim payment. Our amendment to the FY 1999 Defense Authorization bill would expand eligibility for payments to include the surviving parents or, if there are no surviving parents, to the surviving siblings by blood of the deceased Commando. 
Because Congress has already authorized and appropriated funds for payment to each Commando, this amendment has no cost. However, it serves the cause of fairness by entitling relatives of unmarried, deceased Commandos to the payments authorized for those Commandos' service to this country. 
Although we did not intend to discriminate against unmarried childless Commandos in our original legislation, our original legislation unwittingly did just that. 
Our amendment rights that wrong. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation on behalf of those Commandos who bravely served behind enemy lines on behalf of the United States.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senator Kerry and Senator Smith of New Hampshire in sponsoring an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization bill to ensure that the Vietnamese Commandos receive their rightful share of the funds Congress authorized and appropriated in return for their service to this country. 
From 1961 to 1970, South Vietnamese soldiers were trained and recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense to undertake covert operations behind enemy lines on behalf of the United States. Although the majority of these individuals were captured alive and taken prisoner by North Vietnam, the U.S. government declared them dead in order to avoid paying them for their services. 
In 1996, Congress passed legislation I sponsored with Senator Kerry authorizing payment of up to $40,000 to each Commando deemed eligible by the Secretary of Defense. These payments were intended to be distributed directly to the Commandos, who could then use a portion of the funds to cover attorney fees and other costs associated with receiving their benefit. 
Regrettably, our 1996 legislation did not fully clarify the relationship between Commandos and their attorneys for the purposes of payments, with the result that payments have been flowing to the Commandos' attorneys for disbursement to their intended recipients. Consequently, our amendment seeks to clarify that the actual disbursement of a payment under our 1996 legislation may be made only to the person eligible for the payment, notwithstanding any agreement, including a power of attorney, to the contrary. 
It is my hope that this legislation will allow the Commandos to rightfully receive the full payments that are their due. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment on behalf of those Vietnamese Commandos who sacrificed so much for this country.

Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that authorizes the Department of Defense to continue `Special Pay: Diving Duty' for Career Divers in assignments where diving is performed as a non-primary duty. 
This amendment will allow the services to continue dive pay for individual career divers who maintain diving currency while serving in critical shore and staff assignments in execution of `duty of diving' orders. 
The services plan, as a part of the FY00 legislative review process, to incorporate this clear policy regarding dive pay. The Navy intends, in FY99, to terminate dive pay for divers on shore and staff duty pending legislative clarification. Terminating this pay for the intervening year would alienate each and every service member affected. It also makes no sense. 
Accepting this amendment will be cost neutral. It simply allows the services to continue paying these critical personnel in the same manner as they are currently being paid. In fact, as in previous years, the FY 1999 Presidential Budget Request includes the funds for this special pay. 
The costs associated with rejecting this amendment are much more dear. It will cost 4.5 times more to retrain career divers whose qualifications expire than it would to have those same personnel maintain currency. Additionally--and more importantly--terminating this pay for Army divers, Navy SEALs, Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel and Air Force Para-rescue members, will take money out of the pockets of the very highly skilled personnel that the services are desperately struggling to retain. 
Mr. President, this amendment provides a simple, fiscally smart solution to maintaining critical diving skills for our armed services, and at the same time, sends a positive message to our service personnel. I urge my colleagues to support this critical amendment.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I voted in favor of this bill, the FY 1999 Energy/Water Appropriations bill. There is much to support in the bill. 
In particular, it provides essential resources to preserve and maintain our nation's waterways, support safe and efficient cleanup of nuclear waste, and promote more constructive utilization of our energy resources. And while the bill increases spending for these items over last year's level, the overall spending provided in this bill is more than $350 million less than the amount requested by the Administration. 
However, as elected officials, we bear no greater responsibility than to ensure that the American people's hard-earned tax dollars are utilized in the most prudent fashion for essential government functions and services. Open and fair consideration of federal expenditures is the cornerstone of maintaining public confidence in their government. 
I fully realize the daunting task faced by the Appropriations Committee in allocating limited funds among diverse, competing interests and priorities. Yet I am disappointed when the decisions on priorities reflect not national priorities, but parochial and political priorities. 
As we begin the appropriations season with consideration of the FY 1999 Energy/Water Appropriations bill, I am once again astounded at the volume and creativity of the shortcuts that the Congress uses to circumvent the normal, merit-based review of spending decisions. 
This bill includes over $920 million for hundreds of earmarks in both bill and report language. These are earmarks for projects that are unrequested, unauthorized, and location-specific, and that have not been considered in the appropriate merit-based review process. It also contains earmarks for vaguely stated projects for which only a cursory explanation, or none at all, is provided to the Senate. 
Mr. President, I prepared a list of objectionable provisions in this bill, which totalled 19 pages. This list is available on my website at http://www.senate.gov/mccain. 
Let me take just a moment to bring to my colleagues' attention some of the most egregious provisions in this legislation: 
An earmark of an additional $3.9 million for maintaining outdoor recreation facilities at Ponce de Leon, Florida. It is somewhat hard to imagine what types of facilities in a single location require nearly $4 million in maintenance per year. 
An earmark of $200,000 for feasibility studies along the Alabama River below the Claiborne Lock and Dam to determine measures necessary to improve the navigation channel in order for projects along the river to realize their full economic potential. 
Certainly, it would be unfortunate if the businesses located along this stretch of the Alabama River were hindered in any way from economic success by virtue of the condition of the navigation channel. However, would it not be reasonable to expect those businesses and local communities to contribute at least to studying possible improvements to enhance their operations? 
An earmark of $8 million to initiate a general reevaluation report to determine the feasibility of further deepening the Miami Harbor Channel in Florida and providing reimbursement to local sponsors. Mind you, this is not $8 million to deepen the channel--it is simply to study the feasibility of deepening the channel. And this $8 million is not necessarily the full amount that will be required to complete that study and, of course, to reimburse local sponsors of the project. 
An earmark of an additional $5 million in the flood control account for construction at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Unfortunately, the committee report sheds no light on what type of construction is involved, nor does it provide any justification for an increase of $5 million above a request of just $400,000. 
An additional $2.3 million earmarked in a line item entitled `Project modification for improvement of the environment' for the Lower Hamm Creek, Washington, restoration project. This seems to be a start-to-finish sort of add-on; the report language states this funding is to be used to `complete plans and specifications, and initiate and complete construction' of the project. Let's hope there is not another add-on next year. 
An earmarked add-on of $5 million for the Alaska Power Administration, for which no funding was requested. This entity is in the process of being sold to the State of Alaska, but this bill requires the taxpayers to spend $5 million, in addition to the $2.5 million already spent, to repair or replace a cable prior to the sale. 
And finally, with all due respect to my colleague from Alaska, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I must question the earmark of $20 million to establish a new commission, called the Denali Commission. This commission is established to prepare a comprehensive plan to spur Alaska's economic growth. I have several concerns about this supposedly temporary commission. Why are all Americans required to contribute to the preparation of this study, which will benefit only Alaska? Will this commission follow the same costly footsteps as the Appalachian Regional Commission, which was established as a temporary entity and, 30 years later, will receive $67 million more from taxpayers across America? 
Mr. President, this is the kind of behind-the-scenes sidestepping of the checks and balances on federal spending that continues to undermine the public's trust in their elected officials. The practice of earmarking projects based on parochial, rather than national, interests is one of the principal reasons the public holds the Congress in low esteem. 
Ironically, Mr. President, the Committee admonishes the Administration for `inappropriate uses of appropriations' in its report language. Yet, this bill endorses, in fact, mandates inappropriate spending to the tune of $920 million. 
I had thought that we were making positive progress in eliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending from the legislative process. Unfortunately, the earmarks and set-asides in this bill greatly exceed the level in last year's Energy/Water Appropriations bill. Last year, the Senate earmarked $312 million in its version of the bill. This bill earmarks $920 million, which is nearly three times the amount of earmarks in last year's bill. 
Mr. President, is it any wonder that Americans continue to express a sense of cynicism about government? 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses to work harder to curb our habit of funneling resources to provincial ventures. Serving the public good must continue to be our mandate, and we can only live up to that charge by keeping the process free of unfair and unnecessary spending that further burdens the American taxpayer.

But right now I think we need to move forward with legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief remarks, and then I note the presence of the Democratic leader in the Chamber, and I know that he and others have some comments. 
But I think I would like to make a few brief comments now in anticipation that either tonight or tomorrow we will have a cloture vote on this legislation that we are now in our fourth week considering. 
First of all, I would like to point out, we have a lot of charges that are hurled at the bill, a lot of exaggeration, and more than a little fiction. Just this morning, one of our colleagues said that the bill has gone from $368.5 billion to $858 billion from the money grab. That is astounding--if it were true, and it is not. The first figure fails to include inflation, look-back penalties, and the second one does in order to make it look outlandishly bigger. First, it used to be too big a bill and too much spending, and now there is a revenue shortfall. We have covered most of the bases, Mr. President. So I congratulate the opponents of the bill and the industry on their memory loss and their creative accounting. 
When we decide the fate of this legislation--some have cast this as a vote over whether we believe in taxes or not-- it is really a question of whether or not we believe an industry should be allowed to lie to Congress and the American people and get away with it; whether an industry should be able to target kids to addict them to a deadly product and get away with it; whether to allow an industry to manipulate nicotine to better hook its customers and get away with it; whether to allow an industry to quash critical public health findings and get away with it; whether an industry can pay billions of dollars in campaign contributions for protection against their misdeeds and get away with it. 
This bill is not about taxes, it is about whether we are going to allow the death march of 418,000 Americans a year who die early from tobacco-related disease and do nothing; whether we are going to continue to heap $50 billion a year in smoking-related health care costs on the American taxpayer, and do nothing. It is about whether we are going to have the will to serve the public interest, or the special interests. So I hope every Senator, before making a decision about how he or she will vote, will be fully informed about what is and what is not in this bill, and whether they want to push the legislation process forward or to let it die. 
First of all, briefly, what is in this bill? A major youth smoking reduction program that addresses the single greatest cause of death and disease in America and will help stop one million kids a year from taking up a habit that will kill one-third of them. It stops the $50 billion annual health care tax on Americans, which is nearly $455 per household per year. It has a major provision to address the illegal narcotics problem in America, and additional resources to find treatment and cures for deadly diseases including breast cancer, heart disease, lung disease and many others. It is a $190 billion tax cut. What I do not understand is some on the other side of the aisle who said they favored this bill when it came out of the committee with no tax cuts, now are opposed to a $190 billion tax cut. Nearly 40 percent of the bill now, as it sits, is to reduce taxes, and every penny above the June 20 settlement goes to tax relief. 
Mr. President, $3 billion is earmarked for veterans who suffer from smoking-related disease. I have been over this issue before, but the fact is there is only one group of Americans that I know of that the Government encouraged to smoke, and that is the veterans who were conveniently left out of the ISTEA bill, as we so eagerly sought our highways and bridges and other pork barrel projects. Don't the veterans deserve something, Mr. President, in the way of treatment of tobacco-related illness from a Government that encouraged them to take up the habit? 
There is a cap on legal fees on tobacco suits so that more money can go to victims and not lawyers. No one in this body believed that we would pass an amendment, for the first time that I know of in this body, that caps legal fees; it caps them from any future bills at $500 an hour. I will admit that is quite a bit of money. But the reality of that impact is that it is an enormous break for both individuals and groups bringing suits against tobacco companies. 
It is a chance to settle State cases collectively and efficiently, and an antismuggling campaign that will stop those who today traffic in contraband. 
I keep hearing, again, `giant programs and huge bureaucracies.' The fact of the matter is there is no guaranteed spending in this bill for asbestos victims and none whatsoever for black lung. Spending on prevention, cessation research, international reimbursement, and for Indian health services, is all subject to appropriations, and there are no new Federal bureaucracies. All the functions will be conducted through existing Federal, State, local and private entities. 
I really did not appreciate the resurrection of the old Clinton health care plan bureaucracy chart. I am tempted, with legislation that I see coming before this body which is supported on both sides of the aisle, to make up a chart. But there are no new Federal bureaucracies associated with this legislation. 
We have heard that giving the FDA authority over tobacco is an abomination, even though the courts have already upheld FDA's ability to regulate nicotine under their current authority, giving them far more power than this legislation does. 
We have heard that retail licensing is absurd, even though 46 States already have tobacco licensing programs, and both the National Governors' Association and convenience stores support their provisions, which is basically the same as alcohol. We have heard the concept of look-backs are absurd, even though the industry itself endorsed the idea last June. And every day, we cite drug statistics on this floor and give them great credence. They are based on the same premise of surveys that we would be using on determining whether we were reducing teenage smoking or not. 
We have heard the bill contains Indian largess, and the Craig-Coverdell amendment eliminated the bill's authorization to set aside a percentage of money for Indian health services, although it is interesting to me that we seem to not understand that Indians, poorest of all our citizens, have a high incidence of tobacco-related illness and the Indian Health Service, like the VA, has spent vast sums of money covering smoking-related illness. 
What has caused the change in attitude since we reported this bill out by a 19-to-1 vote through the Commerce Committee? I don't know. I will leave that to others. I do think it is of note that some $50 million or more, the estimate is a minimum of $50 million, has been spent on tobacco company advertising. I think anybody who believes that an advertising campaign of that 
magnitude does not have an effect, obviously is not aware of the effect of advertising in America. 
What happens if we fail to invoke cloture, and after a lot of machinations that we leave this legislation and go on to other issues? I think it is important to point out that what happens is two things: One is that 36 attorneys generals go to court. They have said they will. They have cases pending. And the other is, of course, and most tragically, 3,000 more kids will start smoking every day that we fail to act. 
I have heard comments on the floor today, finally, Mr. President, about defining the Republican Party, about how we act on this legislation will define the Republican Party. You know, there may be something to that. There may be something to that. Because maybe we ought to remember the obligations that we incur when we govern America. Maybe we might remember the principles of the founder of our party when we are defining the Republican Party and how we vote on this legislation. We might understand that our obligation, first of all, is to those who cannot care for themselves in our society and that includes our children. Isn't it our obligation, shouldn't it define the Republican Party, that we should do everything we can to handle this scourge, this disease that is rampant throughout young children in America? Does that define the Republican Party, or at least have something to do with the definition of our party? I hope my colleagues might understand what our obligations are. 
I did not invent this bill. I did not seek the responsibility for it. But I believe in the strongest possible terms that we need to act. Otherwise we will act, sooner or later, and every day that it is later, more young Americans will die as a result of our inaction. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky has been waiting very patiently to propose his amendment. I just want to sum up what we just passed here, and I think it is very important. 
We passed limits on attorneys' fees of $4,000 per hour for actions filed before 12-31-94; $2,000 per hour for actions filed between 12-31-94 and 4-1-97; $1,000 per hour for actions filed between 4-1-97 and 6-15-98; and $500 per hour for actions filed after 6-15-98. 
Before the Senator from Washington leaves the floor, I would like to thank him for his amendment. I thank him for his persuasive arguments in a very close vote. Obviously, it was the effort of the Senator from Washington that tilted the vote in favor of this amendment, albeit by one vote. So I express my appreciation to the Senator from Washington. 
Mr. President, I just go on to say, it does not apply to any fees paid to attorneys that are defending tobacco companies. It does not apply to any fees actually remitted and received by an attorney before 6-15-98, nor to reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses approved by a court in such actions. 
It applies to all actions brought on behalf of a State or political subdivision, the Castano civil actions, and all tobacco actions brought on behalf of private litigants that are settled or `finally resolved' after June 15, 1998. 
It directs the courts to consider the following factors in determining an attorney's fee as: likelihood of success; time and labor invested; expenses incurred; novelty of the legal issues involved; skill required to prosecute the action; and results obtained. 
It permits the tobacco companies to petition to reduce fees that they had already agreed to pay to plaintiffs' attorneys in the States that have already settled. 
Mr. President, I think it is an important amendment. I do believe that my friend from Massachusetts would agree with me that really it is as outstanding as the agricultural issue, the farmers issue. 
We can go through iterations--and there are maybe hundreds of amendments filed--but except for the agriculture issue, we have pretty well resolved the outstanding issues that are associated with this legislation. And I would like to first express optimism that we can address that issue. I still hope we can reach a compromise between the two--the LEAF Act and the so-called Lugar Act. But in addition to that, I believe that we can invoke cloture and dispense with this bill this week. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation, and I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I say the Senator from Idaho came to the floor to argue that the tobacco legislation now spends more money than it takes in. The argument neglects one fundamental fact, and that is the legislation can't spend more than it takes in because the authorizations, including the drug amendment, come from the trust fund only. You can earmark all you want to, but unless the money is in the trust fund, it can't be spent. That is, obviously, up to the appropriators. 
Having only been here for 12 years, I have, time after time after time, observed authorizations of large amounts of money which are then reduced by the appropriators, as which is their job, to fit into the overall budget. These authorizations that are a result--the drug amendment, prevention, cessation, counterads, research, et cetera--that are authorized, cannot be appropriated unless the money is there in the trust fund. 
By the way, those who would argue that we need to reduce the size of this bill by about $100 billion, I say that is a very likely outcome if we are successful in reducing teen smoking, because the volume of cigarettes sold in America, if we are successful, would be reduced significantly, which would, first of all, mean less revenues and less payments into the trust fund which is set up, and over time, obviously, would then reduce the amount of money that can be spent. Most experts believe that if this legislation is enacted that we could effectively reduce teen smoking in America. 
So I say to my friend from Idaho when he comes to the floor, when we come to the floor in a day or so with a defense authorization bill which greatly exceeds the amount that is budgeted, I hope that he will make the same arguments that we exceeded in practically every other authorization bill. As the Senator from Idaho well knows, the way we do business around here is we authorize a certain amount of expenditures and then that is subject to the appropriators who are guided by the budget--in this case, guided by the amount of money that will be in the trust fund. I think it is important that be mentioned. 
I think most of us agree it is time we made a decision on this bill. I want to comment on the Gorton amendment. I think it is important. I think it is a good amendment. I think Senator Gorton, Senator Sessions, and Senator Faircloth have great credibility in this body--both Senator Gorton and Senator Sessions having been former attorneys general. I believe that it is appropriate if we are going to designate how the money is spent that comes from the increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes, then there should also be some limitation on the amount of money that is paid for legal expenses. 
Senator Gorton's amendment calls for initially $4,000 an hour and scales down as to what time in the calendar the legal entities entered into these settlements. I think most Americans would believe that $4,000 an hour is a rather generous wage. In fact, there are very few Americans who are compensated to the tune of $4,000 an hour. 
The argument will be made on the other side that we are dictating something that should be left up to the States, should be left up to arbitration. We have just passed several amendments that come from that side that dictate exactly what the States should do. We just passed one that said a certain amount of money had to go to early child development. We passed one that said a certain amount had to go to a specific kind of research. 
In all due respect to the arguments that somehow we are interfering with some kind of States rights here, then obviously an amendment should be supported that says the States can do whatever they want to with any of the money that goes to them, which contemplated in the original bill is some 30 to 40 percent of the entire amount of money that is collected. 
Most Americans, when asked if $4,000 per hour is adequate compensation to anyone--there may be some exception to that, perhaps brain surgery--but for legal services I think the overwhelming majority of Americans would view $4,000 per hour as more than generous compensation. In fact, if we pass the Gorton amendment, there will be some who will complain that this is far too generous. I remind observers that this is the third iteration we have attempted to try to bring some restraint to what many Americans are appalled to discover--that a single law firm, in the case of the Florida settlement, could make a couple of billion dollars. 
I don't think that is appropriate, and I believe that we ought to act overwhelmingly in favor of the Gorton amendment. 
We have been told of two possible substitute amendments--one by Senator Hatch and the other by Senators Gramm and Domenici. I hope and expect that if those amendments are to be offered, we can move to them shortly. 
As I said, the Senate has adopted several significant amendments, particularly with respect to how funding under this bill is apportioned. I thought it might be helpful to recap for the Senate where the bill stands in that regard. 
The Joint Tax Committee estimates that under the managers' amendment, $52 million would be available in the trust fund in the first 4 years and an additional $72 billion in the following 5 years, producing a 9-year total of $124 billion. 
The Senate adopted amendments to the bill to provide $3 billion to assist veterans with smoking-related diseases and $46 billion in tax cuts, leaving a total of $75 billion over 9 years for apportionment to the four major accounts authorized under the bill--the State account, the public health account, the research account, and the farmer assistance account. 
Under the bill, 40 percent of the money, or $30 billion over the next 9 years, would be made available to the States to settle their Medicaid and legal claims against the tobacco industry. This would mean a payout of approximately $3.3 billion per year, or an average of $66 million per State per year, to compensate State taxpayers. 
And 22 percent of the money, or $16.5 billion over 9 years, would be made available for public health programs, including counteradvertising, smoking prevention and cessation services, as well as for drug control programs authorized under the Coverdell-Craig amendment. As the bill currently stands, the precise amounts and selected purposes would be subject to appropriations. 
This means an amount of approximately $1.8 billion available for public health and subject to drug control purposes. Under the bill, 90 percent of the money reserved for public health is to be block-granted to the States. 
Another 22 percent of the funds, or $16.5 billion over 9 years, would be made available for health research at the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control. This would mean a payout of nearly $1.8 billion per year for advanced medical research. 
As you know, Mr. President, lately the public health groups have complained about some of the reductions as a result of setting aside $3 billion for veterans' treatment of tobacco-related illness as a result of tax cuts and as a result of an anti-illegal drug program. It still provides $1.8 billion per year for advanced medical research. I would say that is a significant amount of money. 
The bill designates 16 percent of the fund to tobacco farmer and farm community assistance. Also, Mr. President, $1.8 billion is available for public health. And $1.8 billion is, I think, a sizable amount of money. This is a total of $12 billion over 9 years, or a yearly payout of $1.3 billion. 
The farm provisions still have to be worked out. I hope we can accomplish that end expeditiously and in a manner that is fair and appropriate. 
I remind my colleagues again that the bill, as modified, contains measures of enormous benefit to the Nation, including vital anti-youth smoking initiatives that will stop 3,000 kids a 
day from taking up a habit that will kill one-third of them, critical funding for groundbreaking health research, and assistance to our Nation's veterans who suffer from smoking-related illnesses. 
I would like to mention again, Mr. President, that for reasons that are still not clear to me, money was taken to use for highways that should have been used for treating veterans who suffer from tobacco-related illnesses. This provision of the bill is an effort to provide some funding for veterans who were encouraged to smoke during the period of time they were serving this Nation. 
The bill will also fund a major antidrug effort to attack the serious threat posed by illegal drugs, and it contains one of the largest tax decreases ever to eliminate the marriage penalty for low- and moderate-income Americans, and achieve 100 percent deductibility of health insurance for self-employed individuals. In fact, every penny raised above the amount agreed to by the industry last June is returned to the American people in the form of a tax cut. 
Let me repeat that, Mr. President. I think it is rather important. It happens that this tax cut takes into consideration all of the additional funds above that which were agreed to by the attorneys general and the industry last June. 
The bill provides the opportunity to settle 36 pending State cases, collectively, efficiently, and in a timely fashion. I argue that it is now time to finish our business and move the process forward. 
There are those who labor under the unfortunate misapprehension that if we do nothing, the issue will go away. I don't believe that is correct. I don't believe it is correct because the facts won't go away. Mr. President, 3,000 kids take up the habit every day, teen smoking is on the rise, and that probably won't stop unless we do something. 
Mr. President, 418,000 Americans die of smoking-related illnesses every year--the No. 1 cause of preventable disease and death in America by far. This death march won't stop unless we do something. The taxpayers must shell out $50 billion a year to pay for smoking-related health care costs--nearly $455 per household. That number is increasing because the number of youth smokers is rising. I want to again repeat, those who call this a `big tax bill'--and I congratulate the tobacco industry for doing polling and finding that most Americans understandably are opposed to `big tax increases,' but I argue that the tobacco industry is responsible for one of the biggest tax increases in the history of this country. That tax increase is what taxpayers have to pay to treat tobacco-related illnesses. Those tobacco-related illnesses are directly related to the sale of their product. 
If the bill disappears--which would be much to the industry's delight--the State suits will not disappear with it. If we fail to act, the States will continue their suits and they will win judgments and the price of cigarettes will increase sharply. So please don't be misled by those who would have the public believe that killing this bill would eliminate taxes or relieve smokers of an undue price increase. Following the Minnesota settlement, the price of a pack of cigarettes went up 5 cents, on an average, throughout the country, not just in Minnesota. 
Mr. President, we have a tendency to throw around polling data quite frequently. Recently, there was a poll paid for by the tobacco companies, and some of the opponents took great heart in that the American people somehow did not support legislation to attack the problem of kids smoking. There was another telephone survey conducted by Market Facts TeleNation, which is an independent polling firm, and this poll was paid for by the Effective National Action to Control Tobacco. Mr. President, these polls' questions are always very important because how they shape the question quite often dictates the answer. We know very well how highly paid pollsters are. 
Here is the question:  
As you may know, the Congress is currently considering the McCain tobacco bill, which creates a national tobacco policy to reduce tobacco use among kids. Based on what you know about the bill, do you favor or oppose Congress passing the McCain bill? 
Registered voters in favor were 62 percent. It is broken down: 45 percent strongly favor; 17 percent somewhat favor; strongly oppose, 23 percent; somewhat oppose, 9 percent. All adults who favor are 62 percent; oppose, 30 percent. 
Question: The McCain bill includes public education to discourage kids from smoking, help for smokers to quit, enforcement of laws to prevent tobacco sales to kids and increases in the price of tobacco products to discourage use by kids. There would also be strict limitations on tobacco advertising and marketing to kids, as well as authority for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco like it does other consumer products. These programs would be funded by increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over the next 5 years. Knowing this about the McCain bill, do you favor or oppose the bill? 
This is what we call usually a `push question.' And the number goes up to 66 percent registered voters strongly favor, and about 4 percent oppose. 
Question: If two candidates for Congress were otherwise equal, but one supported the McCain bill and the other opposed it, would you be * * * 
More likely to support the candidate who supports the bill, 44 percent more likely; more likely to support the candidate who opposes the bill, 18 percent; 37 percent would say no effect on their vote; 44 percent would most likely support the candidate who supports the bill. 
Question: Some in Congress have proposed amendments to the McCain bill that address issues other than tobacco use--like tax reductions and the war on illegal drugs. Which of the following statements do you agree with most? 
The tobacco bill should address issues only, and other issues should be dealt with in separate legislation, 79 percent.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we do battle of the polls, there is one today that I think in many ways supports the argument that the American people want to do something about the issue. The other argument that I hear quite often is the American people do not care, that they care more about illegal drugs, that they care more about crime, that they care more about education. I agree with that. But they also care about tobacco. 
After this issue is taken up, I understand there will be efforts to take up the issue of patients' rights under the present health management regime in America. I haven't seen that in any polls. That is one of the most important issues. Yet, I think Members of this body think that it is of great importance. We are going to take up the defense bill, of which there will be several controversial issues, such as ballistic missile defense, our sanctions on China, et cetera. 
I haven't seen those in any polls either. But yet I think the American people care about our Nation's security, especially our ability to defend the Nation. 
Should we do something about illegal drugs? Yes. I hope we will. I believe that this bill has been improved by that. 
Should we do something about education? I believe that we have had significant and substantial debate on the floor of the Senate regarding that issue. The very excellent bill of Senator Coverdell was passed after a very difficult process. 
Should we do things about crime? Yes. 
But, Mr. President, I think we should also do something about this issue as well. 
As I began my comments, I believe that we are in an important period of time. I say the best way to proceed is to have a cloture vote proposed by the majority leader, which is the way we do business around here. If the Senate, in its wisdom, decides by 40 votes, and we don't have enough votes to conclude debate after being here in this fourth week, then we should go on to other issues. If there are sufficient votes, 60 votes to invoke cloture, I urge both proponents and opponents of the legislation to try to complete action on this legislation this week. 
We all know we have 13 appropriations bills; perhaps product liability reform; perhaps other issues that are important to the American people as well. 
I don't mind staying here all summer, if I may borrow a phrase from another leader of a different magnitude than I. But I believe that we have discussed and debated this issue at great length, and it is now time for us to make a decision as to whether we move forward on this bill or not, or throw the issue back to the States. Thirty-six attorneys general voted for it. Larger and larger settlements, and larger and larger legal fees will occur. But most importantly, as I have said on a number of occasions on the floor, today 3,000 kids will start to smoke, and tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish I could support the Reed amendment. If this amendment simply disallowed the tax deductibility of any advertising deemed in violation of FDA rules, I believe we might be in the ballpark. 
However, this amendment goes well beyond. It says that if a company advertises in any way, even unintentionally, that violates FDA rules, then that company may not deduct any advertising expenses incurred that year which are otherwise legal and deductible under current law. 
Mr. President, concerns have been expressed about the advertising deduction as generally applied. In fact, both the CATO and the Progressive Policy Institutes have identified this deduction as one that should be reformed. Perhaps that is something we should do in a manner that treats all taxpayers the same. But, this amendment is not a general reform, it is specific and I believe goes too far. 
I appreciate the motives of the Senator from Rhode Island but I will not vote for this amendment. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his kind remarks. As always, I am very appreciative. Sometimes, as he knows, it helps me a little more if he criticizes me from time to time, which he also does from time to time. I thank Senator Kennedy for his involvement in this issue. He has been in the Chamber talking about it quite a bit. Obviously, Senator Kennedy has not agreed with me on certain aspects of the bill, but we are in agreement--in fact, I think it is important that those who watch this debate understand that we are all interested, on both sides of the aisle, in trying to resolve this issue because we are concerned about our children and the fact that, as we know, teenage smoking in this country is on the rise.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the presence of Senator Reed, and I will be brief because I know he wants to discuss his amendment further. 
Later on, Senator Gramm will come to propose his amendment. I understand that Senator Gramm has to go to the dentist so he perhaps may not be in his usual sunny, rosy mood as he usually is when he comes to the floor, especially debating this issue, but I am told that he will come later this morning to propose his amendment which we do plan to vote on Monday, sometime after 5 o'clock, I believe is the unanimous consent agreement. 
Again, because of headlines that I have seen this morning and comments in the various newspapers about the attitude that some have taken towards the legislation, I would like to review where we have come and where we are. 
Yesterday, we made further progress. We are at the point wherein I believe we can and should finish our business expeditiously. I say that for two reasons. One is the progress that we have made, but also we are all aware now, as we have been on this bill for 3 weeks--and we are going to be on it next week. I will have to ask somebody to look up when was the last time we have spent 4 weeks on a single piece of legislation, but it is not very often, obviously. 
Mr. President, I think the point here is that we have been 3 weeks debating this bill. We have debated many aspects of it, some aspects of it, in the case of attorneys' fees, more than once, and that may be revisited again. But let us look at what we have done. We have provided critical funding for ground-breaking health research to find new treatment and cures for killer diseases including cancer and heart and lung diseases. These initiatives obviously are supported on both sides of the aisle. It includes assistance to our Nation's veterans who suffer from smoking-related illness. 
Mr. President, I thought one of the least laudatory things that took place in the ISTEA process was that we basically, at least at one point, declared that veterans who smoked while they were in the service were guilty of gross misconduct. 
I still find that unbelievable, since we all know that veterans and members of the Armed Forces were encouraged to smoke. Tobacco was provided along with meals--smoke breaks. We all know that smoking was encouraged. In this bill, now we are going to earmark $3 billion to try to treat veterans who have incurred tobacco-related illnesses. I think that is very important, that they receive that assistance. I think it has to be one of our highest priorities. 
We have included a major antidrug effort to attack the serious threat posed by illegal drugs, both through prevention education as well as interdiction. By the way, that is a Republican amendment, a conservative amendment, and one that was approved by both sides of the aisle because of the importance that the American people feel is associated with illegal drugs. 
It now contains one of the largest tax decreases in many years, a nearly $200 billion tax cut that would eliminate the marriage penalty for low- and moderate-income Americans and achieve 100 percent deductibility of health insurance for self-employed individuals. I think most of us on both sides of the aisle believe the marriage penalty is unfair and that low-income Americans should be the first ones to receive relief. We think it is unfair for companies and corporations to have tax deductibility for their health care insurance yet individuals do not. 
I think it is important that we understand, also, when we are talking about taxes on the American people, that today $50 billion of America's tax dollars go to treat tobacco-related illnesses, almost $455 per taxpaying household in every year. It provides the opportunity to settle 36 pending State cases collectively, efficiently, and in a timely fashion. 
I also want to mention again, some are of the impression that if this bill leaves the floor of the Senate, it disappears --as some, I am told, especially in the other body, would like to see happen. But there would still be 37 States that go to court. There will still be enormous legal fees. There will still be incredibly high settlements. In Minnesota, it was a $6.5 billion settlement, which was $2.5 billion above what was agreed to in the June 20 agreement. Just a few days ago, an individual won a court case that included punitive damages. There are literally thousands and thousands of cases lined up to go to court. Mr. President, those who believe that somehow this issue will not go on--the question is: Where does it go on? Does it go on in every courtroom in America? 
Does it go on in States, 37 of them now--and I cannot imagine the remaining 10 of the 40 that did not enter into agreement between the attorneys general and the industry will not join sooner or later. Would that not continue, in fact would that not accelerate? The attorneys general tell me they are just waiting to see what we do. 
There is a settlement in Mississippi. There is a settlement in Florida. There is a settlement in Minnesota. They entail billions and billions of dollars. What about the tax? According to reliable publications, the price of a pack of cigarettes just went up 5 cents because of the Minnesota settlement. Does anyone believe that when they make these massive payments the cost is not passed on to the consumer? 
So I want to remind everybody, we are coming up on a crucial week. It is hard for me to imagine that we would continue on this legislation for very much longer. We can either move forward to a conclusion, because we have addressed most of the issues--the farm issue is still out there and we need to get a reasonable resolution of it--but for the life of me, I do not know of another major issue associated with this legislation. There may be substitutes that refine it, or even change it substantially, but the general outlines of the legislation we all know. So we are either going to move forward and cloture will be invoked, which puts us on autopilot to completion, or we will not. 
I am not an expert on tobacco. I am not an expert on public health, nor have I ever claimed to be. I claim some expertise on national defense and security issues. I claim some expertise on telecommunications, aviation--other issues. I don't claim expertise on this. But I was asked by the leadership to move a bill through the Commerce Committee. We did, with a 19 to 1 vote. Then the majority leader scheduled the bill to come to the floor. I did not. I didn't make the scheduling decisions. Obviously, since the legislation went through the committee which I chair, I am the manager of this bill. I do not seek any sympathy for the fact that I have been criticized by both sides of the political spectrum rather severely, including a $100 million, so I am told, tobacco advertising campaign. But I do believe that all of us have the right to expect now to move to a conclusion to this issue. That conclusion is either a final passage or, somehow, the bill leaves the floor--although I am not sure my friends on the other side of the aisle would do so with alacrity. 
But if the decision is made, or if we are unable to move forward, please, let no one be under the illusion that the issue is going away if it leaves the floor of the U.S. Senate. There will be a myriad of lawsuits. There will be incredible activity 
in the courts of America. And to those who are concerned about lawyers getting rich, I guarantee, they will get a lot richer under those circumstances than under ours. But that doesn't bother me. The thing that bothers me is, if we do not move forward, as I mentioned the other day, there are winners and losers; and the winners will, obviously, be the tobacco companies. They will have gotten a significant return from their $100 million ad campaign. The losers may be me, maybe even the Senator from Massachusetts, but the real losers will be the children of America. 
Today, 3,000 kids start smoking. One thousand of them will die early. Tomorrow, the same, and the next day, the same, and it is on the rise. We will address, as a nation, the issue of tobacco and the issue of kids smoking. There is no doubt of that in my mind, because of the obligation we have. It is a question of how, and when. By moving this legislation forward, we can do it sooner rather than later. I am more than willing to stay on this floor all summer, if necessary. But I do not think we can afford to do that, because of the compelling legislation that we have to achieve legislative results on by the beginning of October when, there is no doubt in my mind, given the fact that it is an even-numbered year, we will go out of session. 
So I urge all of my colleagues to recognize that we are now reaching a point, next week, where we either have to move forward or not. I will abide by the will of the majority and what the leadership on both sides of this body decide. I will regret it, obviously, if we do not move forward. But I also will far, far more regret the effect that it will have on the children of America. 
I note the presence of my friend from Massachusetts as well as the Senator from Rhode Island, and I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we had agreed earlier, I will in a few seconds propose to table the Kerry amendment. Following that, under a previous agreement, Senator Faircloth and Senator Sessions will be recognized for their amendment, which I understand has to do with attorneys' fees, and I hope we can complete that in a reasonable length of time. This issue has been fairly well ventilated in the past and is well known now. 
I think it is well known that the amount of money attorneys would receive under this settlement and are receiving or scheduled to receive under State settlements is inordinately high, to make one of the grossest understatements of this debate. I think it is important Senator Faircloth and Senator Sessions intend to debate this.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take a second to thank the Senator from Oklahoma. He and his very capable staff have been through this bill with a fine-toothed comb. By the way, I say this with full understanding that the Senator from Oklahoma does not agree with this legislation. But what he and his staff have done has been extremely constructive. 
There have been several provisions, as would be the case with a very large bill, where mistakes were made either through unintentional or erroneous technical printing of the bill. 
This is not the first time that the Senator from Oklahoma has found unintentional provisions of the bill violating existing law and the jurisdiction of other committees, and I appreciate very much his effort, because I think whether the bill passes or not, it has been significantly improved due to his efforts.

Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I won't object, the Senator knows that we always have an objection from this side, but we have always acted back and forth. I can assure the Senator that, if necessary, I will seek first recognition so that the amendment from that side could be allowed.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after consultation with the majority leader and the Democrat leader and the Senator from Massachusetts, it is now our intention to move to an amendment on the Democratic side and lay it down, tomorrow morning debate it, and then move to a Gramm amendment after that. 
It is my understanding that it is the intention of the majority leader, and I am sure he will make it clear, to have votes on these some time around 6 o'clock on Monday evening, dispose of those amendments, and it would be our intention to go back to a Democrat amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have now been on this legislation for 3 weeks. We have taken some very important votes, and the bill has been significantly modified. I think it is time for us to complete our business and do so with dispatch. Obviously, if we don't, the proponents of the status quo will achieve by delay what they can't with a majority of votes; and that is, obviously, to kill tobacco legislation that is aimed at saving the lives of over 1 million children. 
The bill, as it has been modified, contains measures of enormous benefit to the Nation, including vital antiuse smoking initiatives that will stop or reduce the compelling aspect of this entire legislation--that is, the 3,000 children a day from taking up a habit that will kill a third of them. There is critical funding for ground-breaking health research, assistance to our Nation's veterans who suffer from smoking-related illnesses, a major antidrug effort to attack the serious threat that is posed by illegal drugs, the magnitude and importance of which was described very effectively by the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from Idaho, and others. 
This legislation contains one of the largest tax decreases ever, and it eliminates the marriage penalty for low- and moderate-income Americans and achieves 100 percent deductibility of health insurance for self-employed individuals. It provides the opportunity to settle 36 pending State cases collectively and in a timely fashion. 
I argue that those provisions which I just described--research, veterans, tax cut, attacking the problem of illegal drugs, and settling pending legislation--I believe have made this legislation far more important than it was when it was introduced. 
We all know that the time is to finish the business and move the process forward. I think it is also clear for anyone who has turned on the television or listened to the radio or read the newspaper that the objective of the tobacco companies is to kill the legislation. I am sure they have come to expect a return on their enormous campaign contributions. 
If we kill the bill, it doesn't do anything to stop tobacco companies from marketing to kids, it doesn't do anything to stop the death march of teenagers who are taking up a killer habit, and it does nothing to promote ground-breaking research on new treatments and cures for these terrible diseases, including cancer and heart and lung disease. We will not take a step forward to stop the flow of abuse of illegal drugs, and we will do nothing to assist our Nation's veterans. Inaction doesn't do anything to relieve the burden on the Nation's taxpayers, a burden not only in the form of a marriage penalty but in the $50 billion taxpayers have to shell out to treat smoking-related disease, which is almost $455 tax per household per year. 
As I was driving from one place to another last night, I heard another one of these commercials. I do want to again express my appreciation to the tobacco companies for raising my name ID all over America, especially in the States of Arizona, Iowa, and New Hampshire. So I am very appreciative of almost making my name a household word--what 
kind of a household word, obviously, is up to interpretation. But I just want to repeat that there are two attacks that the tobacco companies are making on this legislation. We polled it, and one is that it is a `big tax bill,' and the other is the issue of `contraband.' I have addressed those issues before, but I want to point out again and again because the attacks are made again and again. Right now, today, $50 billion per year is paid by the taxpayers to treat tobacco-related illness. Mr. President, that number is bound to go up. If teenage smoking is going up, then the tax bill is going up. 
Now, you can argue, as some in the tobacco companies have argued, and some of my colleagues particularly on this side of the aisle have argued, that there is no way you can reduce teen smoking; that there is nothing you can do; that raising the price of price of cigarettes won't work and antismoking campaigns won't work. 
This tax bill is big and it is getting bigger. Some don't accept--and I am not clear why--the view of the Centers for Disease Control that teenage smoking is on the rise in America. I think a visit to any local high school in your State or district might indicate that teenage smoking is on the rise. But, more important, people whose statistics on these public health issues that were unchallenged are now being challenged as to whether teenage smoking is on the rise or not. I think the burden of proof is on those who disagree to prove that these statistics are wrong, given the credibility of the organizations who state that teenage smoking is on the rise. If you accept the fact that teenage smoking is on the rise, then over time there would be more people who would require treatment for tobacco-related illnesses. The tax bill goes up. It is sort of elemental, but it needs to be said over and over again. If we are paying this huge tax bill to treat people as a result of tobacco-related illness, and it is getting bigger, then it seems to me that you have a much bigger tax bill than the costs associated with this legislation. 
Mr. President, I believe we are reaching a crucial point, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks. We are either going to have to invoke cloture and address the germane amendments, which is still part of cloture, part of the Senate procedures after the invocation of cloture, or we are going to have to move on to other things. At that point, as is usual, we assess winners and losers. That is appropriate and fun here, especially inside the beltway. I don't disagree with that approach. 
I think we ought to understand who the losers will be. The losers will be the children of America. They are the only ones who lose. Anybody else who loses can probably survive, probably go on to other things, probably lead their well and healthy lives. But I don't believe that the American people will treat us kindly, nor should they, if we fail to act on this issue. Is it the most important and compelling issue that affects America today? Probably not. Crime is important, drugs are important, education is of critical importance. But do we use that rationale to ignore this problem? Is that appropriate logic? Do we say, well, crime and education are far more important issues to the American people than teenage smoking; OK, so therefore ignore it? 
I don't get that logic, Mr. President. I was reading in some of the newspapers this morning that there are polls out now that have convinced some Americans--and perhaps in the view of some pollsters, a majority of Americans--that this is a `big tax bill.' A lot of Americans believe we really aren't going to do anything about kids smoking. Why would anybody be surprised at that? If you spend $100 million, which is what many--or suppose only $50 million on advertising, it is going to sway American public opinion. But the effect of those kinds of advertising campaigns fades. The American people then focus back on the problem because the problem will remain. And if we do nothing to address it as a body, I think the American people have every reason to be less than pleased at our performance at addressing what I believe most Americans correctly view as a very important issue, which is--obviously, we have stated many times --our children. 
So I think it is important that we recognize that we are now ending the third week of considering this legislation, and we are going to have to either file cloture and move forward with a vote on it, and if the vote carries, move to a conclusion. Otherwise, I believe that we should obviously move on to other things, and with the full and certain knowledge that the issue is not going away because the problem is not going away. 
I understand that my friend from Massachusetts will have an amendment, and that an agreement has been made with the majority leader. I hope we can reach a time agreement on that and then move to our side for an amendment. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just say that may even go until 12:30. The problem is the amendment we had agreed to take up next--that would have been Senator Gramm, Senator Domenici, and Senator Roth--they have not completed the language so the other side is able to examine this language, which is a courtesy, obviously, that is expected around here. But we do expect to move forward with the Gramm amendment and debate on it either within a half-hour or an hour. 
Mr. President, let me just say again, it is my understanding that Senator Hatch had a substitute he wanted considered, that Senator Gramm and Senator Domenici had a substitute, and there is also the very important issue of the farmer aspect of this bill to which the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, is obviously very involved in and committed. There is also the issue of attorneys' fees that would be the subject of an amendment. 
I also am aware that there are several hundred, maybe, other amendments that have been--quote--filed. Those are amendments which I know in the view of the sponsors are important amendments, but I have to say I do not believe that they are vital to the progress of this bill. Many of them we could accept. Many of them I think could be dispensed with in a short period of time. 
After the disposition of the Gramm amendment, which I understand there will be a time agreement on, I hope then that would be an appropriate time to determine not only where we go for the rest of the day, but for the rest of this bill. We are in the middle of the third week of consideration of this legislation. I thought the passage of the drug amendment yesterday was important. A tax cut, as we may enact today--although there certainly are some concerns I have about the size of it--if it passes, then I think it is important for us to determine on both sides of the aisle as to where we want to go after that.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader for his hard work in putting together this unanimous consent agreement. At the completion of it, we will have made progress on two of the very important key issues associated with this legislation, the drugs and tax cut. I also want to thank him for comity in giving the other side, obviously, an opportunity to propose their amendment. I am very encouraged by this. It seems to me, and the majority leader I hope would agree, that there are a couple of substitutes--attorneys' fees and the agricultural issues--that are the difference between Lugar and the LEAF bill that would keep us from completing action on this legislation. 
I want to thank the majority leader, again.

Mr. McCAIN. I think they are two important provisions. Obviously, we have had significant debate on both the issue of drugs and tax cuts. I'm very pleased that we are going to make progress on both of those issues. 
I hope the substitutes--one, I understand by Senator Hatch, and the other by Senators Gramm and Domenici would be ready for us to start debating and discussing. We also plan to have another amendment on attorneys' fees, and then what remains, I think we could hopefully get time agreements on the amendments. 
As we go through this process, one, we don't have a lot of time left; and, two, we have our up days and our down days. I suggest that all of us try to take and keep a steady stream as we work our way through this important issue. 
I thank my friend from Massachusetts for his sincere and very valiant effort to try and maintain the comity on both sides of the aisle. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will vote for the Craig-Coverdell amendment because I believe that we should move forward with this bill. While I agree with the thrust of the amendment, I am seriously concerned that all of the revenue to fund this effort will come from the tobacco trust fund. 
If we are to have legislation that provides for settlement of State cases, funding for smoking prevention and cessation, funding for research, farmer assistance and a tax cut, we must allow for funding for the drug amendment under additional accounts including the violent crime trust fund. 
Clearly, the President will not sign legislation that does not provide the funding necessary for the basic purposes of this act. So, while I will support the drug amendment, my vote is to keep the process moving. 
This is but one wicket in the legislative process and at the end of the day, if we are to have a meaningful bill, we must reconcile the various demands for trust fund revenues in a manner that will achieve the essential purposes of this bill, and which will best serve the public health and the public interest.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have now dispensed with the issue of addressing the problem of drugs in America. Tomorrow, we will take up the tax cut issue. There will be an amendment on this side of the aisle and an amendment on the other side of the aisle. 
It is our hope that, following that, we will be able to take up the substitute. There are, I understand, two important substitutes, one by the Senator from Utah, which he has talked about at some length, and also one by perhaps Senator Gramm and Senator Domenici. There is still concern about the issue of attorneys' fees. I would not be surprised if there was another amendment on that issue, and, of course, there is the remaining issue of the agriculture section of the bill, which could be addressed after cloture, if necessary. 
Frankly, Mr. President, I don't know of any other major issues that are affecting this legislation. I hope that we can not only move forward but, at the appropriate time this week, hopefully the majority leader can propose a cloture vote so we can bring this issue to a close. 
All of us are aware that we are in our third week on this legislation. All of us are aware that we have other legislation that we need to address, including very important appropriations bills. 
I must say that on this day I am pleased with the progress that we have made, and I am pleased that we are going to address the issue of taxes, which is important to Members on both sides of the aisle. 
So, Mr. President, I say, in the words of the late Mark Twain, the reports of the death of this legislation are premature. However, we certainly, by no means, have total confidence that we will reach a successful conclusion. But I think those of us who are supporting this legislation can be pleased at the progress we are making at this time. And it does not in any way mean that we do not have a lot of difficult hurdles to get over before we have a final vote. 
I yield the floor.

The Senate will then convene at 11 a.m. and immediately proceed to the second attempt to invoke cloture on the pending tobacco bill. Assuming cloture is not invoked, it will be the leader's intention to try to reach an agreement similar to the agreement reached today with respect to the drug issue, which will call for two votes on the marriage penalty issue, at 1 p.m. or 2 p.m. on Wednesday. 
Therefore, votes will occur during Wednesday's session of the Senate, with the first vote being the second attempt to invoke cloture on the tobacco bill.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alabama leaves the floor, I want to thank him for not only the great, important remarks he has made about the pending amendment concerning the problem of drugs in America, but I want to also thank him for his efforts to resolve another very contentious aspect of this legislation, and that is the issue of lawyers' fees. 
There was an amendment that the Senator from Alabama proposed which was defeated, perhaps because the amount of money involved in compensation for the plaintiffs' lawyers was too low. But I know that he and the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, and others are working on another amendment I hope we could add to this bill before we vote on final passage that would properly compensate the legal profession who has been involved in this issue, but at the same time not deprive the victims from the compensation they deserve, deprive the programs from the funding that is absolutely critical and needed if we are going to address this issue. The reality is we cannot divert as much money as being contemplated in the State settlements as well as in other areas that would go to the legal profession. 
I thank the Senator from Alabama for his work on that. As we all know, in his previous incarnation he served as attorney general of the State of Alabama, and I appreciate his efforts in that direction. I also appreciate the comments he made, his opening comments, and that is, he believes we need to pass this legislation. I believe that still reflects the majority view here in the Senate. And I am eager for the Senate to complete its work on the bill. 
Mr. President, we are, I know, in the third week now of contemplation of this legislation and amendments and debate and discussion. Unfortunately, last week's activities were truncated, to some degree, by a requirement for a large number of us to attend the funeral of my predecessor, Barry Goldwater. I think it is clear we are reaching a point in this legislation where we either come to closure or then we have to move on to other issues. 
I believe at the right time that cloture should be invoked, if that is what it takes to complete our work in a timely fashion. I hope that rather than cloture we could agree to time agreements on the amendments. I hope we could agree to narrow the amendments even further, and we could dispose of the issues at hand. I think it is important to point out that we have pending amendments which have to do with drugs, we have tax cut alternatives, and we have substitute measures as well as I mentioned earlier an additional amendment on the attorneys' fees issue. 
Very frankly, Mr. President, there are not any other significant issues or amendments that would affect this legislation. So I think they could be disposed of in short order if we can enter into time agreements. That will be my effort this morning as we enter into discussions with other Members who have an interest in the bill. 
I would not vote for cloture at this time until it is clear to me that we have exhausted our efforts to come to time agreements and dispose of pending amendments. I think that is a far better way of proceeding as, frankly, we do on most pieces of legislation that come before the body. 
Mr. President, I also point out that there are interests that want to see this legislation fail. 
I think we should acknowledge that. It is interesting, which parts of the political spectrum these efforts come from. 
I do not question the motives of any opponent of this legislation, and they may succeed. I remind opponents of this legislation that if it does not move forward and we have to move to other issues, the issue is not going away. No matter what is done on the other side of the aisle, or if nothing is done on the other side of the aisle, there will be, in the words of one well known plaintiff's lawyer in the America, `a rush to the courthouse.' There will be 37 States who will proceed with their suits. There will be settlements. If the past four have been any guideline, those judgments are substantial. And, by the way, they have entailed substantial plaintiff fees--in the case of the State of Florida, I believe over $2 billion, if my memory serves me correctly. So the issue of children and tobacco is not going to go away. 
I hope that when colleagues of mine on both sides of the aisle who would rather see this bill die, for whatever reason--whether it be a philosophical problem they have with a `big government solution' or whether it be, in all candor, perhaps, the use of this issue in the November elections to some political advantage, or whatever reason--the issue isn't going away. 
Every day that we do delay, there are 3,000 children who start to smoke, and 1,000 of them will die early. I appeal to the better angels of our natures here in this body and ask for a lowering of the rhetoric. I am not sure it does any real good to attack someone else's position on an issue. I don't think it does any good to even question anyone's motives, whether they agree or disagree with this legislation. For the first couple of weeks, or at least the first week or 10 days as we addressed this issue, it was characterized by respect for one another's views and, I think, was very helpful as an educational debate. 
Beginning the end of last week, obviously that atmosphere of comity was dramatically reduced, if not disappearing. I hope my colleagues will not get too partisan on this issue. It is not one that should be partisan. It is one that should be, indeed, nonpartisan rather than bipartisan, because it is a problem that transcends party lines. 
I intend, as I said, to work this morning in trying to get some time agreements on pending legislation. We clearly have debated the drug amendment to a significant degree, and I think we could vote on that very soon. We continue to talk with Senator Gramm about his tax cut amendment. There may be another one besides that, and then substitute measures, and attorneys' fees. I have to say, in all candor, Mr. President, there is no reason to delay any more after we have resolved those issues. 
Let me just make a couple comments about the drug amendment. Obviously, illegal drugs are a terrible problem in America. It continues to pose a serious threat to our youth, and I strongly support many aspects of the pending amendment to attack the problem. 
I am compelled, however, to mention that one of the criticisms that has been leveled at the pending legislation is the `new bureaucracies' issue: There are new bureaucracies and new programs, and this is a big-government solution. Let me just list some of the new programs and bureaucracies that are in this amendment: Drug Testing Demonstration Program, Driving Work Grant Program, Student Safety and Family Choice Program, Victim and Witness Assistance Program, Victim/Witness Assistance 
Grants, Report Card Grants, Random Drug Testing Grants, Parental Consent Drug Testing Demonstration Projects, Drug-Free Workplace Grants, Small Business Development Centers, Convicted Drug Dealers Grants, on and on. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that those of my colleagues who are supportive of this legislation, as I am, will perhaps better understand why there is money spent for specific reasons in the overall tobacco bill for basically the same reason money is spent for `bureaucracies' in the drug bill--because we have to have some kind of vehicle within existing bureaucracies to attack the problem. None of us should want to say OK, Federal Government, here is the money, do whatever you want to attack either the drug problem or the tobacco problem. We have to specify as to how this body, in its wisdom, with the advice of the experts, can best dispense those funds in programs that will attack the problem. 
I think a Driving Grant Program is probably important. I think a Student Safety and Family Choice Program is important. I think Report Card Grants are important. And on and on and on. So those who support this amendment--and I know it is a majority of my colleagues certainly on this side of the aisle--I hope they will understand better why the arguments about `new bureaucracies' is not necessarily valid when we are attempting to address a specific issue with specific programs. 
Finally, on the issue of the money, I believe the tobacco trust fund should pay a fair share in taking action that will defend efforts to prevent and cease drug use in America. But I also hope we can take some of the money from the violent crime trust fund and other sources of revenue and ensure that funding for tobacco, for drug enforcement purposes, does not undermine the basic purposes for which the fund was established. 
As I said before, I do not support a cloture vote at this time. I am hopeful that we can, as we go through this morning and early afternoon, agree on time agreements on amendments. I do believe that if we can't do that, then we either vote for cloture or we move on to other issues that are important. I believe we can move forward. I believe the majority of the American people want us to move forward, and I am still confident that we can complete this legislation in a timely fashion. 
I note the presence of my colleague from Massachusetts on the floor, and I yield the floor.

I wonder if, with the knowledge that the Senator from Texas and I are continuing negotiations in the next few minutes, the distinguished Democratic leader would agree to withhold that until, say, an extra additional 15 minutes just so I can make one final attempt to get an agreement with the Senator from Texas on his amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. What is happening now is what I feared would happen to this bill. It is starting to get very partisan. A lot of things are being said which are not necessarily helpful to the process. I hope that we can end this dialog, now that we have all made our points, and try and sit down and move forward or agree to just move on to other things. I don't think it helps anybody for us to start accusing each other of bad faith or parliamentary maneuvering. I hope that we can move at least----

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I respect the views expressed by the Senator from Missouri. He has spoken long and eloquently on this issue in the Chamber. I did hear him just say that bad decisions by free people to smoke--bad decisions by free people to smoke--shouldn't be taxed. 
I am intrigued by that comment, especially since what we are talking about here is free children. I thought that the obligation of my party and Government was to care for children, was to keep them out of harm's way, and do what we can to lead them into better lives. 
When the Senator from Missouri said `bad decisions by free people,' I was really sort of shocked, because the Senator from Missouri should understand the intent of this legislation. The intent of the legislation is to try to stop companies that have been enticing the children--my children, all America's children--to take up a habit that is going to kill them. So it can be interpreted as a massive tax increase; that is what the latest media reports I see are--$60 million worth of attack ads calling it a tax increase. That seems to have been sort of accepted by the American people as fact. I guess if you spend enough money on an advertising campaign, it may have some significant effects. 
It seems to me that for Americans to believe that this is simply a reason to tax them, then there has been a very significant effect. 
But I think we are all aware that what we are trying to do here is cut taxes on the American people. You do that by stopping people from smoking, because right now $50 billion a year in Americans' tax dollars go to treatment of tobacco-related illnesses. And that $50 billion a year, Mr. President, is not a static number, because according to the Centers for Disease Control, and other sources, children smoking is going up in America; therefore, you are going to have more people who need treatment because approximately a third of those children who begin to smoke will die early or need treatment for tobacco-related illnesses. So the present $50 billion tax per year that the American people are paying will increase. So I don't know why it is so hard for some people to understand that if we do nothing and the present trend continues, the tax burden on all Americans--high income, low-income Americans--will go up, not down. 
I think it is also important to address the issue that seems to be talked about so much by opponents of the legislation, about the burden that this tax--I am beginning to do it myself--that this increase in the cost of a pack of cigarettes will have on low-income Americans. 
First of all, to state the obvious, as the Senator from Missouri said, it was a bad decision, and these people do smoke, which is their choice. And I certainly sympathize with those who find it nearly impossible or impossible to stop. It is extremely difficult, because it is an extremely addictive substance, but it still is a voluntary act. But also, we find out, and it is very disheartening, that it is the children of lower-income Americans whose smoking is increasing in America. And to somehow feel that low-income or middle-income or high-income Americans would not do whatever is necessary not just for themselves but for their children I think is contradictory to what I know and believe about the American people. 
Mr. President, we had not the most pleasant exchange that I have observed in this Chamber recently, not the most unpleasant either, by the way, but it wasn't pleasant. Obviously, we have been on the bill now nearly 2 weeks. We know we have the press of other business. We know we have legislation that needs to be addressed--the Department of Defense bill, 13 appropriations bills, and others are necessary. There is a certain level of frustration that was manifested here. I believe we must come to a point where we should decide to end the debate--which, as I say, now has been going on for nearly 2 weeks--or move forward with the bill. In the event of cloture, as we all know, germane amendments to the bill would still be in order. 
I should also like to remind my colleagues of the consequences of going off the bill. If we do not pass this legislation through the Senate and through the House and then in conference and signed by the President, I think some think the issue will therefore disappear from the American scene. 
Quite the contrary, Mr. President. The reality is that if the Congress does nothing, then there are 37, and perhaps more, attorneys general who are lined up to sue the tobacco companies for the injuries that have been inflicted on the people of their States. 
I think there are several drawbacks to this course of action. One of them, to state the obvious, is that the amount of legal fees that will go, the amount of money that will go in the form of legal fees, to the plaintiffs' lawyers will be dramatically higher than that envisioned by this bill and, frankly, will be much higher than what I would envision in an amendment that will be passed in the Senate which will place further restrictions on attorneys' fees. 
Second, of course, is that it will be a long, drawn out process. I do not think there is any doubt as to who would prevail. There have been trials in four States, all of which have not gone to a jury because the tobacco companies, for obvious reasons, have chosen to settle, the last being the State of Minnesota--$6.5 billion was the agreement by the industry. And along with that agreement, with that settlement, was an agreement by the tobacco companies to do many of the things that have been attacked on this floor. 
A massive tax hike? Guess what, the price of cigarettes all over America went up 5 cents because of the requirement to settle the Minnesota case. I think it is also of some interest that the $6.5 billion that the tobacco industry agreed to is roughly double the amount that would have been received under the settlement that was an agreement entered into between the attorneys general and the tobacco industry. So the cost, if you go on a State-by-State basis, assuming that they all either settle or juries award large settlements, then the cost goes up. And the so-called tax, massive tax that is so concerning to many of my colleagues, is higher. When you extrapolate it out over all 40 States that are in court--and I imagine the other 10 would join sooner or later--then that is more money added to the cost of a pack of cigarettes than envisioned by this legislation. 
But let me tell you what bothers me the most about having these cases go to the States--which they will. I would like the Senator from Missouri to find me one legal expert in America who does not believe that the day that this legislation leaves the floor of the Senate there will be, in the words of a well-known plaintiff's lawyer, a `rush to the courthouse,' not only by the attorneys general but by many of the plaintiffs' lawyers in America. 
But what bothers me the most about this, and the reason I am saddened a bit to contemplate it, is the fundamental purpose of this legislation is to act as soon as possible to stop the children from beginning to smoke. The day the President signed this bill, massive amounts of money would be spent to begin youth smoking cessation programs. Large amounts of money would be spent on research, not only to find out what causes kids to smoke, but also to find cures for these terrible diseases, the largest causes of death in America--the heart disease, the lung cancer, the emphysema--the terrible ways that people die as a result of the use of tobacco. So, all that will be delayed. And the most terrible delay, of course, will be the effect that we could have, in a beneficial fashion, on children in America. 
There are some on this floor who have said raising the price of a pack of cigarettes will not do it, these cessation 
programs don't do it, et cetera. I think they are entitled to their opinions on that issue, but I depend upon the opinion of experts. I depend upon the opinion of every living Surgeon General since 1973--every living Surgeon General in America. Their letter has long ago been made part of the Record. They say that you have to have a comprehensive approach to this problem. I agree with every--literally every--public health group in America, whoever they are, you name them--I read the list of them into the Record the other day--who say you have to have a comprehensive settlement if you want to stop kids from smoking. I agree with Dr. Koop. I agree with Dr. Kessler. I agree with the eminent people in America who have spent their lives, literally, on this issue, who say don't think you can solve it by just a simple tax increase. 
I would also like to say I think the States deserve reimbursement. We, on this side of the aisle, at least, have always advocated a situation where we try to reduce the financial burden on the States. We are always pleased and proud when we pass things like no unfunded mandates and return money to the States to use however they want, since, after all, it is theirs that they send to Washington, DC. If we do not do this settlement, of course, there will be no money that goes back to the States; it will all just come to the Federal coffers, and bureaucrats will then decide, or one can make the case that the appropriators will decide. 
So the Senator from Missouri made an eloquent argument that we should continue debate on this issue and that we should not cut off debate because the American people need to be better informed. I would say to the Senator from Missouri, who I note is here on the floor, they have been pretty well informed by somewhere between a $60 million and a $100 million tobacco advertising campaign by the tobacco companies. They have been pretty well saturated in that area. Most major pieces of legislation--the expansion of NATO, for example--in the 12 years that I have been here, almost every major piece of legislation takes about 2 to 3 weeks. And, of course, that is only the largest legislation that we consider. 
I also think there are many, many organizations out there who are informing the American people. But, again, far more important than that, there are people who are suffering from very terrible diseases as a result of their use of tobacco, and the sooner we get money into research and find cures for these terrible diseases, the better off they will be and we will be as a nation. Every single day that we debate this issue and not bring it to some conclusion or the other, 3,000 children will begin to smoke. We can debate whether this is a good bill or a bad bill and how it should be changed, but there is one fact that cannot be changed, and that is what it is doing to the young people of America. 
So I would argue if, at the end of today, 3,000 more children have started to smoke and 1,000 of them will die early, maybe we ought to spend more time here and get this issue resolved and maybe not go home this weekend. Maybe we should spend this weekend debating this issue, trying to reach some conclusion. Instead, either late tonight or early tomorrow morning we will all be gone. The majority leader just talked a little while ago about how hard it is to get people here on Monday. 
Perhaps--perhaps--we will go to work maybe on Tuesday. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday--4 days; 12,000 young people will begin to smoke while we enjoy our extended weekend. 
I believe that we should try and keep that in mind. My argument, Mr. President, in a rather drawn-out fashion, is that there are compelling reasons why we should act on this issue either one way or another. Maybe in the wisdom of the Senate this is not a good piece of legislation, and we should drop it. But let's go ahead and drop it sooner rather than later so that the process will begin in the other 36 States that have sued the Federal Government; the additional 10 that, I am sure, will be in line; so that the plaintiffs who have suffered injury and the relatives of those who have suffered deaths because of tobacco can begin their trip to the courthouse so that they can receive the compensation they feel they deserve because of what happened to them as a result of years of tobacco--whether they deserve that or not is up to a judge and jury--but especially the attorneys general awaiting to see what the U.S. Congress does. I hope that we can act in as rapid and efficient fashion as possible. 
I remind my colleagues that I was asked, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate and to get it through my committee. We had a full day of markup, and I am in disagreement with the remarks the Senator from Missouri made the other day about discouraging amendments. I, in fact, encouraged amendments, and the Senator from Missouri had several which were voted on. They had to do with product liability. They didn't have anything to do with reduction of taxes. But that was the right of the Senator from Missouri. 
I don't believe he could find any of my colleagues who would argue that there wasn't a full addressing of that legislation during that day. At no time did I try to cut off anyone's right to propose an amendment on a piece of legislation that serious. In fact, if I remember, I was somewhat entertained the Senator from Missouri even proposed as an amendment a piece of legislation which I and Senator Lieberman have cosponsored, which was his right. But I don't believe that anyone was shorted during that very interesting markup. In fact, literally every Senator on the committee was heard from and, again, in my 12 years on the committee, I have never seen nor been part of such an extensive markup as took place on this bill in the Commerce Committee. 
I was asked to bring this bill to the floor, and it was reported out of the committee by a 19-to-1 vote. Then the majority leader scheduled it for floor debate, which is the responsibility of the majority leader. 
I, along with the Senator from Massachusetts, have tried to manage this bill. But I say to my colleagues, there is no point in us staying on this bill forever. It is obvious that we won't. For example, today we have not had a single amendment voted on, and we seem to be hung up in some kind of parliamentary maneuvering which some observers might say is a reason to impede the progress of the bill, because we all know we don't stay on any piece of legislation forever. 
I hope we can work out our differences. There are pending amendments. There is a very important drug amendment we would have liked to have brought up today. I don't know if we will. It is nearly 4 o'clock now. But I believe it is important that we either move forward and resolve the issue, or we go on to other issues that are compelling issues as well. The Department 
of Defense authorization bill--and I am a member of the Armed Services Committee--is waiting to be debated and resolved. It is very important that we address the needs of the men and women in the military and our Nation's security. There are many other pieces of legislation that are awaiting action on the part of the Senate, which argues that we proceed with this legislation or move off it. 
I would feel rather badly if we do, but I also point out that, in my own very subjective view, I would have done whatever I could to see that this issue was brought to completion. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, very briefly, the Senator from Missouri states that there are many studies and documents that indicate that increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes will not have an effect on kids smoking. 
Let me refer him to the people who know it best, the absolute ultimate experts on the cost of a pack of cigarettes in America--the tobacco companies. I say to the Senator from Missouri, in the documents revealed by the tobacco companies themselves, a Philip Morris document: 
In any event, and for whatever reason, it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers. . .. 
I hope that the Senator from Missouri would read from the documents that the tobacco companies themselves had to disclose because of court order. 
Philip Morris: The following quotes are from a Philip Morris 1981 document based on the company's review of research by the National Bureau of Economic Research on the impact of price on tobacco use. Because of the quality of the work, the prestige and objectivity of the National Bureau of Economic Research has not changed in 30 years. I think we need to take seriously their statement that, `If future reductions in youth smoking are desired, an increase in Federal excise tax is a potent policy to accomplish this goal.' 
In any event, and for whatever reason, it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers, and that the goals of reducing teenage smoking and balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the federal excise tax on cigarettes. 
Philip Morris, in a quote from a 1987 document: Philip Morris laments the teen smokers that it lost due to price increases. 
You may recall from the article I sent you that Jeffrey Harris of MIT calculated . . . the 1982 and 1983 round of price increases caused two million adults to quit smoking and prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. Those teenagers are now 18 to 21 years old, and 35 percent of older smokers smoke a PM brand. This means that 700,000 of those adult quitters have been PM smokers and 420,000 of the nonsmokers would have been PM smokers. 
A 1982 RJR document, on the tobacco industry's analysis that price increases have a significant impact on youth smoking: This analysis actually calculates the number of new smokers lost among kids as young as 13 years old, and every other age between 13 and 18, if prices are increased. Philip Morris--the chief financial officer for Philip Morris, less than a year ago, told everyone involved in the tobacco industry negotiations that, `Children are three times more price responsive than adults.' 
That is the chief financial officer for Philip Morris. 
The National Academy of Sciences, in its 1998 report, `Taking Action to Reduce Tobacco Use'--the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences concluded that `the single most direct and reliable method for reducing consumption is to increase the price of tobacco products, thus encouraging the cessation and reducing the level. . ..' 
This list goes on and on. I know the Senator from West Virginia was here a second ago and wants to talk. 
The 1994 Surgeon General's report preventing tobacco use among young people--now, the Surgeon General is fairly well respected--reached the conclusion that increases in the real price of cigarettes significantly reduce cigarette smoking, and that the young people are at least as price sensitive as adults. 
The 1998 Surgeon General's report issued within the last month agrees with this conclusion. 
What is important, though, really, are the tobacco companies themselves. I say if you can believe anybody, maybe you might believe the people who are in the business of enticing kids to smoke. 
Brown & Williamson: 
The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for starting, their brand preferences as well as the starting behavior of children as young at five years old. The studies examined younger smokers' attitudes toward addiction, containing multiple references as to how very young smokers first believe they cannot become addicted only to later discover to their regret, that they are. 
Brown & Williamson: 
. . . nicotine is addictive. We are then in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug, effective in the release of stress mechanism. 
RJR consultant: 
Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in its variety of physiological actions. 
I won't go on except to summarize again from the Philip Morris document: 
In any event, for whatever reason, it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking preference of teenagers. 
I imagine there are studies that the Senator from Missouri could produce to which he referred. 
The people who are the final experts on this are the people who sold it to the kids. And they know, and we all know, that it is price sensitive as far as kids smoking is concerned. To think otherwise flies in the face of the overwhelming body of evidence, not only in the words of the tobacco companies, but the Surgeon General of the United States of America. 
We want to call it a tax, call it a tax. Don't say it isn't going to affect kids smoking, because the overwhelming body of evidence says that it does. Everybody is entitled to their opinion but not everybody is entitled to the facts. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am interested to hear these comments by Senator Domenici. Just a short time ago--a month ago--Senator Coverdell proposed an amendment on the budget resolution that would have repealed the marriage penalty or marriage tax, and a budget point of order was lodged against it. The Senator from New Mexico, apparently, for reasons that are not clear, voted against waiving the Budget Act. Now the Senator from New Mexico will say that he didn't want to waive the Budget Act. The fact is that if the Budget Act had been waived, the marriage penalty would have been repealed.

It was rejected 38-62; 38 Republicans felt strongly that the marriage tax should be repealed. Those who voted against it were Senators Bond, Chafee, Coats, Cochran, Collins, D'Amato, DeWine, Domenici, Gorton, Grassley, Hagel, Jeffords, Lugar, Mack, Snowe, Specter, and Stevens.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico clearly feels that the money needs to go to the Federal Government. I feel, and I think conservative Republicans feel, it should go back to the States who incurred the expenses. If the Senator from New Mexico doesn't want the money to go to the States, then he will continue to see two things happen--the money never coming to the Federal Government because the States will continue their lawsuits and the settlements--at least in the last four States--of as much as $6.5 billion, as in the case of Minnesota; and none of that money will go to the Federal Government. Not a penny. The fact is that the money will go back to the States to repay the huge tax bill they are paying now; $50 billion in citizens' tax dollars are going to pay, in the case of Medicare and Medicaid expenses, for tobacco-related illnesses. 
Now, there are some who want this to come to the Federal Government so that the appropriators and the Budget Committee can assign the funds to wherever they want. I want a significant amount of that money to go to the States. They are the ones who have been paying a big part of the bill. If the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Texas want to kill this bill, then there will be 37 States that go to court, beginning the day after this legislation dies, and they will fight this out in court. They seem to win every time. They don't even go to a jury trial, Mr. President. 
The tobacco companies settle, and guess what they do? They agree to smoking cessation programs and they agree to all the huge bureaucracies that have been pointed out. They go to reimburse Medicaid expenses. They pay for antitobacco advertising because the States that get the money believe that in order to stop kids from smoking, you don't just raise a tax--although that is important. You don't just raise revenue, but you have to do other things as well. 
So I hope my colleagues will pay attention to the letter from the 36 Governors--I am sure the other 14 will be joining--as to how they feel about legislation that doesn't repay them for the expenses that they incurred as a result of tobacco-related illnesses. 
I see that my colleague from Massachusetts wants to speak as well. Let's dispense with this myth about this being a `big tax bill.' What it is is a much smaller tax bill than the tax bill that the American people are already paying in the form of Medicare and Medicaid expenses in order to pay for tobacco-related illnesses. And with children smoking going up, guess what, Mr. President? That tax bill goes up. It will get bigger and bigger. So if you want to worry about big tax bills, there is a huge tax bill we are paying right now. We will be paying a much larger tax bill if this trend of kids smoking continues to grow. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just briefly, I would like to congratulate the Senator from Illinois on the significant vote. In fact, a number of Senators experienced an epiphany late in the vote because of his persuasive powers. So I congratulate the Senator on his vote. 
I just want to make it clear, Mr. President, we intend to move forward. We will have a vote on the Gramm amendment. We may have a Daschle amendment. I happen to think it is fair that we go back to what we originally started doing--one amendment on either side. I think that is the fair way that most legislation has been conducted on the floor since I have been here. 
We intend to move forward. We intend to reach a conclusion. I hope that both the majority leader and Democratic leader will consider trying to bring this to closure next week. We have had now 2 weeks of extensive debate and amending on the issues. 
It seems to me outstanding are the tax issues that Senator Gramm and Senator Daschle may have; the issue of attorneys' fees is going to come back up, I believe; and, of course, then there is the agricultural issue outstanding. But aside from that, Mr. President, I do not think there is a lot of new ground to be plowed. I think we need to move forward. I believe we will move forward. And I am still confident--I am still confident--that we will bring this issue to conclusion sooner rather than later, to coin a phrase. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, lately we have heard a lot of hyperbole from the opponents of tobacco legislation, particularly regarding the notion that the bill should be killed because it concocts new bureaucracies. Last week, one Senator gave the number of 17 new bureaucracies and another said 30 new bureaucracies; and the Senator from Missouri used a very busy chart diagraming previous tobacco legislation which, unfortunately, did not represent the measure we are debating. The industry is certainly determined that this is an effective tool to divert the issue in trying to kill the bill. 
Interestingly, Mr. Goldstone, the CEO of RJR, has been passing out the outdated diagram that was manufactured by one of our colleagues, a development I find to be quite curious and rather discouraging. It is the type of thing that reinforces the public's perception about the relationship between the Congress and the tobacco industry. In fact, Mr. President, Mr. Goldstone was out in my home State of Arizona to speak to a local civic club and passed out this same chart to many of my constituents, of course, whom I do not expect to know that that chart was outdated when it was printed. But it is an interesting symbiotic relationship that is developing between the opponents of the bill and the tobacco industry. 
So, Mr. President, we developed a little chart here of our own. It does not take enormous skills--you do not have to be a genius nor be employed at the space agency to figure out a chart. But I thought it would be enlightening to my colleagues to look at a chart that has to do with what exactly happens when we do not pass tobacco legislation--I emphasize `when we do not.' 
Of course, we begin with tobacco campaign contributions, which have been $30 million since 1987 to the U.S. Congress. Now, if we stopped at tobacco legislation there, a result of inaction would be--the number of kids who are smoking is up 32.4 percent since 1991. The average young person smoker begins at age 13, and 90 percent of our adult smokers in America begin before the age of 18. That might help my colleagues understand better why we are trying to attack the problem of youth smoking. 
Adult smoking, that costs a lot of money to us who do not smoke. In fact, it is $50 billion a year in increased taxes on nonsmokers as well as smokers to pay for Medicare and Medicaid bills that are incurred as a direct result of treating the illnesses associated with smoking. 
Again, I think it is important to remember, 90 percent of the adults who smoke in America began before the age of 18. That is why the critical focus is on kids smoking. Ten million smoking-related deaths have occurred since the first Surgeon General report was issued in 1964--10 million. 
Mr. President, I have a chart around here someplace, which I will show later on, which shows the relationship between tobacco-related illness and all other causes of death in America. Smoking-related deaths are by far--by far--the highest. So when my colleagues say, `Then you are going to move on to alcohol and hamburgers, and then you are going to move on to whatever,' they may; I cannot predict the future; but I can argue that if you just looked at the number of smoking-related deaths in America, you would see that they dwarf all other causes themselves. 
And 430,730 deaths, or 20 percent of all deaths in 
America--430,700 deaths, 20 percent of all deaths in America, are, guess what, smoking-related deaths. Premature deaths of smokers who are under age 18, in 1995, were 5 million. The combined potential life lost is 64 million years. And one-third--one-third--of all deaths by cancer in America are attributed to tobacco. 
Mr. President, these are not my figures; these are the Surgeon General's, the Centers for Disease Control's, and other Government and nongovernmental organizations. 
And there are 136,000 lung cancer deaths every year. There are 136,000 lung cancer deaths every year. Mr. President, that should be disturbing enough. But what is more disturbing is that youth smoking is on the rise in America--not on the decline, it is on the rise. If 136,000 people are dying of lung cancer every year and there are 430,700 deaths every year, those deaths eventually are going to go up. And your taxes are going to go up. The American people's taxes are going to go up, because we have to pay to treat the tobacco-related illnesses. 
So when I keep hearing this malarkey about a big tax bill, my friends, we are paying a big tax bill as we speak, a huge tax bill, that is going to get a lot bigger if we do not attack this problem. 
So I would ask my colleagues who keep buying and parroting the tobacco advertisements--according to the New York Times, now $60 million has been spent--please keep in mind the big tax bill that is paid every day of every year in this country to treat tobacco-related illnesses, not to mention the big human tax that results from premature death. Every day, today--today--3,000 kids will start to smoke, and 1,000 of them will die early. One thousand of them will die from lung cancer--emphysema, pneumonia, influenza, and other terrible causes of death. 
There are 200,000 heart disease deaths per year. One-fifth of all the deaths attributed to heart disease are directly attributed to tobacco. There are 90,000 coronary heart disease deaths a year. 
There are 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year due to secondhand smoke. There are 84,000 lung disease deaths every year, from pneumonia, influenza, bronchitis and emphysema, and 90 percent of all emphysema cases in America--90 percent--are attributed to smoking--90 percent. 
Mr. President, one of the most heartwrenching things I have ever seen in my life is to go down to the VA in Phoenix, AZ, and see veterans outside, because they are no longer allowed to smoke inside, sitting outside with oxygen tanks and taking the mask away and smoking a cigarette. Mr. President, if there was ever a living, breathing example of the addictive aspects of nicotine, it is that terrible sight. 
And 163,100 fires were caused by smoking in 1992. That is the latest information we have on that. And 2,000 deaths were caused by smoking-related fires. 
Mr. President, that is the result of inaction on the issue of tobacco. That is the result. I will not go through them again, but I think it should be pretty compelling. So 430,700 deaths, or 20 percent of all deaths for all other causes, are directly related to smoking and tobacco. 
The American taxpayer, Mr. President, through the costs of Medicare and Medicaid--the tobacco-related costs are $130 billion, and the health care costs alone are $50 billion; that is Medicaid, Medicare, private health insurance and small business insurance. 
Loss of economic productivity is $80 billion. Smokers cause $501 billion in excess health care costs in America. 
Maternal smoking costs in medical expenditures are $661 million, and 6,200 children die every year as a result of parents smoking. Forty percent to 60 percent of children's asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing is due to secondhand smoke--an extra 160,000 cases of asthma and an extra 79,000 cases of bronchitis, and an extra 172,000 cases of wheezing. 
Prenatal smokers raise health care costs by $175 extra per child under the age of 2, and smoking-related fires cost $500 million. Complicated births, $1 billion per year. Pregnant women smokers are 50 percent more likely to have a mentally handicapped child. Prenatal smokers cause 48,000 low birth weights per year. Between 150,000 and 300,000 children under 1 1/2 years must be hospitalized for secondhand smoke: bronchitis, pneumonia, ear infection, and asthma. Developmental difficulties for complicated deliveries in low-weight babies costs $4 billion a year for children of women who smoke. 
There are two enormous costs associated with smoking and tobacco use in America. Both of them are pretty compelling. One, obviously, is the huge number of deaths, 20 percent of all the deaths in America that are attributed to it. And the problem is not getting better; it is bound to be getting worse. Of course, these enormous costs go to the taxpayers, as well. 
When we are arguing this debate, and sometimes it gets a little emotional, I think we ought to keep in mind what we are talking about here. It is a compelling and very emotional situation when so many young Americans are afflicted with this addiction. 
In Arizona, State medical costs, total medical costs from tobacco are $559 million; Pennsylvania, $1.982 billion. Those are the total medical costs, as a result of tobacco, to the States. 
Mr. President, according to the New York Times on May 22:  
More than a third of high school students who try cigarettes develop a daily smoking habit before they graduate, the Government said today. 
In a survey of more than 16,000 students nationwide, nearly 36 percent who had ever smoked said their smoking had escalated to at least a cigarette a day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
Nearly 73 percent of the students with a daily habit said they had tried to quit. Of those who tried to quit, 13.5 percent were successful, the agency said. 
Seventy percent of students surveyed said they had tried cigarettes at least once. The percentage is probably higher among teen-agers over all because the survey did not include dropouts [Mr. Eriksen said]. Previous studies had estimated that 33 percent to 50 percent of people who experiment with cigarettes become regular smokers. 
I just went through the costs per State of tobacco costs. Probably far more compelling than that is the number of kids currently under 18 who will die prematurely from a tobacco-related disease. In my home State of Arizona, 98,516 children will die prematurely--98,516. That is a lot of young people. I think that, obviously, we have an obligation to do something about it. 
Title I of the bill provides the Food and Drug Administration with authority over tobacco, tobacco products, and nicotine. The FDA is not a new bureaucracy. It is a fairly old agency with an important mission that most Americans fully support--to protect public health and risk to our food supply, drugs, and other substances ingested into the human body, including cigarettes. The FDA already serves as authority over cigarettes under their current power, something in large part upheld in the courts. This was not made up by the bill's authors. In fact, the industry agreed to broad FDA authority over tobacco products last June. So those who argue that this bill grants large, huge new powers to the FDA, please remember, as in many other aspects of this bill, it was modeled after the June 20 agreement last year between the tobacco industry and the 40 attorneys general themselves. It provided broad new authority over tobacco products, as does this bill. 
What nefarious activities will the FDA undertake with authority over tobacco--which I reemphasize the industry agreed the FDA should exercise? First, the FDA will oversee ingredients to ensure that cigarettes are not adulterated with `putrid or poisonous substances.' Most Americans, including smokers, don't like the idea that tobacco companies have put additives such as ammonia into cigarettes to increase addictiveness. Two, the FDA will oversee branding to ensure health and other claims are true, establish youth access rules, and oversee marketing to stop appeals to children, accept performance standards to better protect health without creating demand for contraband, and medically assist the developing and marketing of safer tobacco products. 
The courts have already upheld that the FDA has most of these authorities under current law. This bill wisely places those authorities into a separate body of law so that nontobacco foods, drugs and devices are not affected by rules that should be targeted solely to cigarettes and the regulation of nicotine. I want to emphasize, those who worry about the expansion of FDA authority into other products, this is a separate chapter. This 
is a separate body of law. 
I find it curious that those who believe FDA should have no such authority seek greater protection for the tobacco industry than the industry itself which agreed to broad overall FDA oversight last June. So, we are not talking about any new bureaucracies here. 
Title II sets underage tobacco use reduction targets. Again, not something concocted by the bill's authors. The targets are the same as what the industry agreed to last year, entailing no new bureaucracies. 
Part (b) of title II establishes a State retailing licensing program with respect to tobacco products. Retail licensing was requested by the 40 States attorneys general and agreed to by the industry last June. It is designed to hold sellers accountable and to better enforce the prohibition in every single State against selling tobacco products to minors. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control, 256 million packs of cigarettes are illegally sold each year to underage youth--the same youth that the industry so vigorously targeted in its marketing. Representatives of the National Association of Convenience Stores have assured me they support licensing. They don't want bad actors selling to kids, and licensure, in the same manner we do with alcohol, is a means of achieving that goal. 
This brings me to another aspect of the attack on this bill, and that is the issue of black market and contraband. Why is it we are able to pretty well prevent, if not totally eradicate, black market or contraband as far as alcohol is concerned? One of the major reasons is because we license the sale of alcohol. So those who are concerned about the increase in contraband, the so-called black market, might support rather than oppose this bill because of the licensing provisions associated with it. 
Earlier I submitted for the Record a letter from the Convenience Store Association expressing no opposition to this legislation. I also submitted a letter from the National Governors' Association expressing appreciation that the licensing program is flexible. It respects States rights and is paid for by the tobacco bill. We have heard much scorn and outrage expressed about the licensing provision, even though it is basically the same mechanism in place for alcohol sales. Do Senators who find tobacco licensing to be such an abomination believe we should have one standard for alcohol and another for tobacco when tobacco kills far more people every year and over 90 percent of smokers begin long before they are of legal age? Does it matter that over a quarter of a billion packs of cigarettes are sold to minors every year? 
Part (c) of title II provides for the distribution of tobacco money for smoke cessation and prevention activities by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. HHS already has an office of smoking and health--not a new bureaucracy. Over 90 percent of these moneys are block granted to the States and will use existing public and private nonprofit organizations--not new bureaucracies. 
Do the opponents of this bill and those opposed collectively to settling the State suits truly believe we should not provide smoking prevention and cessation activities? 
Again, these are the essential elements of stopping 3,000 kids a day from taking up a habit that will kill a third of them --activities that the industry agreed to and that were contemplated in the June 20 agreement. 
Mr. President, I want to emphasize again that every public health group in America and every living Surgeon General back to 1973--every expert in the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health--every single one of them says that if you want to stop kids from smoking or reduce the number of children who smoke in America, you have to have a comprehensive approach. Part 1: Raise the price of a pack of cigarettes which, by the way, the tobacco industry agreed to last June 20--not as much as contemplated in this bill, but they agreed to it. The second is active cessation programs. You can't do that without a comprehensive bill. 
Mr. President, there is an organization of people called the ENACT Coalition. They are a major public health organization; they formed a coalition called ENACT to promote effective national action to control tobacco. This growing coalition has pledged to work with Congress and the administration, the public health community, and the American people to pass comprehensive, sustainable, effective well-funded national tobacco legislation. 
Mr. President, let me tell you who is in this coalition. They are the Allergy and Asthma Network; American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; American Academy of Family Physicians; American Academy of Pediatrics; American Association of Respiratory Care; American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin; American Cancer Society; American College of Cardiology; American College of Chest Physicians; American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine; American College of Physicians; American College of Preventive Medicine; American Dental Association; American Heart Association; American Medical Association; American Psychiatric Association; American Psychological Association; American School Health Association; American Society of Anesthesiologists; American Society of Clinical Oncology; American Society of Internal Medicine; Association of American Medical Colleges; Association of Black Cardiologists; Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs; Association of Schools of Public Health; Association of State and Territorial Health Officials; Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine; Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids; Children's Defense Fund; College on Problems of Drug Dependence; Community Antidrug Coalitions of America; Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists; Family Voices; Federation of Behavioral, Psychological and Cognitive Sciences; HMO group; Inter-religious Coalition on Smoking and Health; Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco; National Association of Children's Hospitals; National Association of County and City Health Officials; National Association of Local Boards of Health; 
National Hispanic Medical Association; National Mental Health Association; Oncology Nursing Society; Partnership for Prevention; Society of Public Health Education; Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco; Society of Behavioral Medicine, and the Summit Health Coalition. 
Mr. President, I would have to submit that this is a fairly reputable and respectable group of experts on the issue of health care in America. This is a very impressive coalition. I have not seen one quite like it. And for us to ignore their plea for a comprehensive settlement, I think, would be a great disservice not only to them, but to the people that they represent. 
Surgeon General Koop and Dr. Kessler--and I have a letter from every living Surgeon General, Republican, Democrat, liberal conservative--are saying that we have to enact this bill. 
Mr. President, this part of the bill also provides health research money to the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Science Foundation, all of which are well-established, respected and world-renowned health research institutions--not new bureaucracies. 
We are at a critical stage in history, on the brink of breakthrough treatments and cures and treatments for scourges such as breast and lung cancer, heart disease, and countless other devastating human illnesses. I am sorry that some of my colleagues prefer to ignore the possibilities and opt instead for loaded buzzword attacks to change the subject. 
Finally, this title of the bill calls for a comprehensive tobacco counteradvertising campaign, as agreed to by the attorneys general, public health advocates, and the industry last year, and is among the most important weapons in stopping kids from smoking. Every tobacco bill that has been introduced, including alternative measures being prepared by opponents of the pending legislation contemplates a large investment in counteradvertising. 
I tell my colleagues that the advertising section does include what some have characterized as a `new bureaucracy.' The `bureaucracy' is known as the Tobacco-Free Education Board, a part-time, bipartisan, unsalaried advisory committee designed to help formulate and execute a nationwide antismoking advertising campaign. 
So if you want to call that a new bureaucracy, guilty as charged. 
The alternative to this advisory panel would be to give millions of dollars to a political appointee to determine, unfettered, how such public appeal campaigns should be designed and executed--powers that neither Republicans or Democrats are eager to hand over to the other. 
Even opponents of the bill who have expressed outrage about `bureaucracies' and might otherwise dedicate themselves to ridding the Nation of the terrible burden imposed by a part-time advisory panel probably would not prefer the alternative. 
Title III of the bill provides for an array of new tobacco warnings and calls for the public disclosure of cigarette ingredients--something most cigarette smokers deserve and would like to know. Both items were agreed to by the industry and, again, require no new bureaucracies. 
Title IV creates a single trust fund to receive and disburse revenues generated by the bill. The fund would be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury--a position that has been in existence since the Nation was founded, and it does 
not constitute a new bureaucracy. The bulk of the money will go to States to reimburse their taxpayers for Medicaid losses. Half of the State money, which represents the Federal share of Medicaid, may be used on a menu of seven options, from drug-free school initiatives to children's health care, each of which is an existing program--not a new bureaucracy. 
Title V contains new standards for exposure to secondary smoke. The 40 States attorneys general who were part of the June 20 agreement called for a mandatory national environmental smoke standard to be enforced federally and by the States. This bill allows the State to opt out of the Federal program if it adopts and enforces its own. The establishment and enforcement of standards can be done through existing agencies--not new bureaucracies. 
Title VI of the bill deals with Indian tribes and ensures that reservations don't become a safe haven for youth access to tobacco. Price increasing will affect reservations as they do all other areas of the Nation. This section allows tribes to receive smoking prevention and cessation grants as States--in the same vein that we administer all other Federal grant programs. None of this entails new bureaucracies, but simply fulfills our obligation to tribes and Native Americans to whom the Federal Government has a trust responsibility. 
Title VII, as amended, contains various civil liability provisions, including an initiative that assists individual plaintiffs in seeking and obtaining just commendation--no new bureaucracies. 
Title VIII calls on the industry to submit an annual report on how the companies are meeting their obligations under this act in the State settlement decrees, and calls on existing Federal authorities, including the Surgeon General, to evaluate that progress. This section also protects industry whistleblowers from threats and workplace retaliation--not any new bureaucracies. 
Title IX calls on the industry to make available to the public documents they have been illegally hiding to avoid disclosure of their misdeeds and data on the health risks of tobacco products. A panel of sitting judges will make determinations on the propriety of attorney-client privilege assertions. Calling on sitting judges to perform a judicial task is not--I repeat, not--a new bureaucracy. 
Title X contains the farm provisions which include various grant programs and farm community assistance initiatives. Some feel strongly opposed, but let us not lose sight of the fact that the debate between the LEAF Act and the Lugar alternative is not about whether we will have these assistance programs. It is a debate over how much we will spend on them and whether buyouts should be concluded at a time certain. 
Title XI contains provisions related to international marketing, smuggling, and vending machines. In the international arena, the bill calls for multilateral and bilateral agreements regarding tobacco marketing and advertising to kids. These agreements can be consummated through existing authorities--not new bureaucracies. 
To address concerns raised by many of our colleagues that our Nation should not simply export the problem of kids smoking to children overseas, this section does authorize an international tobacco control awareness program which is subject to appropriations and, if funded, can operate through existing institutions. 
Antismuggling initiatives are also contained in this section, including a call for tobacco package markers to distinguish licensed products from contraband, requiring licensure of manufacturers and wholesalers, and recordkeeping for large transactions. Will this entail additional law enforcement activities? I suspect so. But we have heard a number of our colleagues express concern about black market and contraband. These provisions will address those concerns. 
Unfortunately, many have not yet grasped the reality that with or without this legislation the cost of cigarettes will increase dramatically. If every State settles under the same terms as Minnesota, we might well anticipate increases of $2 per pack. 
The June 20 settlement called for a per pack increase of 65 cents and, I might point out, agreed to by the administration--65 cents. Some of the most vociferous opponents of this bill on the basis of black market and contraband are preparing alternatives that would impose an excise tax of 75 cents per pack. So I trust that antismuggling activities is not among the bureaucracy about which we are hearing. 
Also included in this title is a non-Federal, private corporation to reimburse vending machine owners for losses due to banned cigarette machines, a major conduit of tobacco to children. Again, some of those who have decried bureaucracy were among those most adamant about ensuring a mechanism to compensate vending machine owners. We do this without creating a new Federal bureaucracy. 
Title XII authorizes appropriations from the trust fund to compensate asbestos victims whose conditions were exacerbated by tobacco use should Congress under separate legislation establish such a process for so doing as the Supreme Court invited. No new bureaucracies. 
Title XIII permits the Veterans Administration to sue tobacco manufacturers to recoup the loss for treating veterans for smoking-related illnesses, a power some believe the VA already has and includes no new bureaucracies. 
Finally, title XIV contains the process by which those manufacturers that wish to formally settle their State suits must agree to, including the up-front payment, additional advertising restrictions, et cetera, and no new bureaucracies. 
So, Mr. President, I hope we are keeping an eye on the ball 
about what this is all about in addition to the bureaucracy red herring. 
We have heard from opponents who object to this bill because it will increase the price of tobacco. Let us stop kidding ourselves. If we fail to pass this bill, the States will go back to court to win in judgment or settlement what we might more efficiently accomplish with national legislation and the price of cigarettes will increase. It was recently announced by the tobacco companies as a result of the Minnesota settlement there would be an increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes in Minnesota. 
The experts say a price increase is a critical component--not the only component but a critical component--in the effort to stop 3,000 kids from starting to smoke. We have heard from opponents who say the bill is about `tax and spend.' Providing $195 billion to States in settlement of their cases so that State taxes can be lowered and half of it can be used for a menu of public health-related options agreed to by the Nation's Governors is not `tax and spend.' 
Do opponents of this bill suggest that we should not dedicate a portion of tobacco settlement money for health research as agreed to in the June 20 agreement? Should we not have additional resources for smoking prevention, cessation, and counteradvertising as agreed to on June 20? Should we not assist tobacco farmers and farm communities that will be affected by changes in tobacco consumption, the same people who have been urged to grow tobacco by the Federal Government for years? 
And let me point out that one of the most scurrilous activities of the tobacco industry is to go to the farmers and say that the passage of this legislation will harm you. If they were concerned about the farmers, why is it that in the June 20 agreement they made with 40 attorneys general there was no provision for the tobacco farmers of America--none, not one word. It is remarkable. It is remarkable that they should go to the tobacco farm communities and now oppose this legislation when they had no provision to take care of the farmers in their agreement of last June 20. 
Should we not dedicate a portion of tobacco settlement money to assist veterans suffering from smoking-related illnesses when the Federal Government handed out cigarettes in their mess kits? 
I ask my friends why we are not talking more about the real `tax and spend' associated with tobacco--tax and spend that tobacco companies impose on the American people every year in the form of $50 billion in smoking-related health care costs including Medicare and Medicaid--almost $455 for every household in America? Every household in America, whether they smoke or not, pays $455 a year in taxes every single year, and that is going up, to treat tobacco-related illnesses. 
This is a tax of epic proportion paid by every taxpayer, every hard-working American who must purchase health insurance for his or her family and every small business struggling to provide employees with affordable health care coverage. Do the tobacco companies worry about taxpayers as they entice their `youth market' to begin a lifetime habit that sickens and kills hundreds of thousands a year, the cost of which others must bear? I don't think so. This bill intends to stop some of that and stop it immediately. 
We have heard from opponents who say we don't need a 
comprehensive bill to stop kids from smoking. With all due respect to my colleagues who are so wise and expert in so many areas, prudence and good sense dictates that the Nation take the advice of the experts who maintain unanimously that only a comprehensive bill will address what they refer to as a `pediatric epidemic,' including every living Surgeon General, Republican and Democrat, the American Medical Association, and the organizations that I just quoted. 
For those who wish to kill this bill, let us examine what we are really talking about. We are talking about 418,000 Americans a year who die of smoking-related diseases, the number one cause of preventable disease and death in America by far. 
I had the privilege of hearing a speech by the head of the National Cancer Society who put it into perspective:  
Among a graduating high school class of 1,000, 6 will die from violence, 12 will die from motor vehicle accidents, 250 will die in mid life from a smoking-related disease and another 250 will die later in life but far earlier than necessary from smoking-related illness. 
Let me just repeat that. 
Among a graduating high school class of 1,000-- 
This from the head of the National Cancer Society-- 6 will die from violence, 12 will die from motor vehicle accidents, 250 will die in mid life from a smoking-related disease and another 250 will die later in life but far earlier than necessary from smoking-related illness. 
So I have great respect for my colleagues who oppose the bill, and everybody is entitled to their opinion, but they are not entitled to the facts. It all comes down to this very simple premise: The tobacco companies target kids to sustain their cigarette sales. Kids take the hook; 3,000 a day start the habit, and that number is increasing. Smoking is the single greatest killer in the United States by far. What physicians call a `pediatric epidemic' won't change unless we do something. This bill is a bipartisan opportunity to act. If it fails, the industry will go away happy but the death march will continue. I ask my colleagues, which it is going to be? 
Finally, let me make one more additional comment. I know my friend from Massachusetts wants to speak as well. 
Mr. President, over the last week or so in the formulation of the highway bill, some very bad things were done to the veterans of America. 
I am ashamed and embarrassed. These men and women who have served our country deserve better than what they got out of that highway bill. In fact, some of the money earmarked to treat their illness is now going to highways and bridges. 
I know that fewer and fewer of my colleagues have had time in the military. Those of us who are a little older have a vivid memory of smoke breaks, of C-rations that contained cigarettes, of the end of the chow line where cigarettes were given out for free. If there is any group of Americans that deserves to be reimbursed for tobacco-related illness, it is the veterans of America. 
We used to call, as my friend from Massachusetts recalls, smoke breaks. We would have smoke breaks all the time. In times of tension in combat, cigarettes were smoked for relaxation, for relief of tension. And the Armed Forces and our Government encouraged those men and women in the military to smoke. 
At the appropriate time, the Senator from Massachusetts and I, along with the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, who has played a very important role, will propose an amendment to put approximately $3 billion into treatment of veterans for tobacco-related illness. I urge my colleagues to support such a move. We intend to have some debate on that particular amendment, and I believe it should pass overwhelmingly. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that debate only be in order prior to the Senate reconvening at 2:15 today.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his important statement and the important comments he has made. I will yield the floor in a minute to Senator Wellstone, who is waiting. 
I want to make a couple additional points here. One of the aspects of this bill that has been raised is, of course, the legal fees. There is no doubt that that issue has to be addressed. The President tried to address it in one of his amendments, which I supported. I believe that he and others are working together to try to guarantee that most of the money goes to the public and would still leave the lawyers plenty of room to get rich. That is our goal here, and I think we can achieve that without too much difficulty on a consensus basis. 
On the issue of the look-back, the so-called Durbin amendment that we are specifically debating, let me point out that if the so-called look-back provisions are made strictly company-specific--remembering that in the bill we have an uncapped company-by-company surcharge of $1,000 per youth smoker--there can be wild gyrations in the cost of a pack of cigarettes, which would really drive those specific companies out of business. If it were strictly company by company, if one company did not achieve the goals and had to increase its payments by a significant amount, those costs would have to be passed on, as we know, to the consumer. That would drive the tobacco company out of business. 
I repeat, we are not trying to drive the tobacco companies out of business, we are trying to drive them out of the business of marketing to kids. What you would really end up doing if we adopted the Durbin amendment is basically cause wild gyrations in the cost of a pack of cigarettes and drive companies out of business. Mr. President, what we have done in the managers' amendment is basically strike a compromise between an overall penalty to the industry, but also a specific penalty of $1,000 per youth smoker, which, by the way, is double the amount a young person spends on cigarettes per year. 
That is a very significant penalty. I would point out that the Durbin amendment would also increase the cost to about $7 billion where ours is approximately $4 billion. 
Mr. President, I do not see the Senator from Massachusetts in the Chamber, but I think it is important for us to recognize something else here, too, that has been going on. I know that many of my colleagues dislike the tobacco companies. I have to say, in all candor, I have grown to like them less as I have been seeing my name splashed all over newspapers, television and listened to it on radio for about the last month, but let us not forget what we are trying to do here. Are we trying to just drive tobacco companies out of business, which probably would not upset me if I did not believe and know that 40 million adult Americans would still smoke. 
If American tobacco companies went out of business, two things would happen: One, there would be a Marlboro or a Camel or another coming out of Mexico, El Salvador, whatever; they would be exporting cigarettes into the United States, which we would not have nearly as much control over. So people would not stop smoking immediately if we drove all the tobacco companies out of business. So it is not in our interest to drive all the tobacco companies out of business, particularly since we would also be deprived of the funds to be used to try to convince children in America not to smoke. 
So with all due respect to my colleague, what I see going on here, interestingly, from both ends of the political spectrum is such punitive amendments that we will drive the tobacco companies out of business. Now, we will feel good; we will be able to go back and tell our constituents: I voted for this amendment; I voted for that amendment; I took away any protection that they had; I voted to increase the price of a pack of cigarettes; I voted to make those punitive provisions stronger and, by God, I showed those tobacco companies. 
Well, that may be a short-term gain, but it will not solve the problem of kids smoking. That is why this bill had better not get too far out of kilter. Now, I do rely on the experts. I do rely on their opinion. I am not an expert. I am not an expert on smoking. I freely admit that. But I listened to the Treasury Department. I listened to the public health groups. I listened to the experts who told me that if it becomes too punitive, too big in penalties, too big a price for the tobacco companies to pay, they will do what the asbestos companies did and that is declare bankruptcy and go out of business. So it may feel real good to vote for an amendment that punishes the tobacco companies further. 
Now, I will admit, Mr. President, I have some subjectivity here because I spent weeks and my staff spent hundreds, thousands of hours sitting down saying, what is the best, carefully balanced package we can come up with which achieves our goal. And that is why we received a 19-to-1 vote through the committee--because it had balance. We are in danger of knocking this thing way out of balance, if we haven't already. 
Now, again, I will stop because the Senator from Minnesota is on the floor, but we could sit here day after day, week after week, if we want to, voting for amendments that punish the tobacco companies more and more. But that will not stop a kid from smoking. Every day that goes by 3,000 kids will start smoking. Today 3,000 kids will start smoking. Tomorrow 3,000 kids will start smoking. 
So I urge my colleagues to understand what our goal here is--not to drive the tobacco companies out of business, but to stop kids from smoking. If you drive the tobacco companies out of business, which may make one feel good, one, you are still going to have 40 million adult smokers in America and probably kids smoking, too; and, two, you are not going to effectively address this problem that we are trying to through this legislation which was addressed on last June 20. 
So I hope my colleagues will keep that in mind as we vote for amendments and show how macho and tough we are on the tobacco companies. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we resume debate on the issue of the tobacco bill, I want to discuss a very serious issue that arose concerning veterans and smoking and has to do with the highway bill, which some may think a little strange but probably has a lot to do with how we juggle numbers around around here and the way we `pay' for things and not `pay' for things. 
Let me quote from an article that was in the Washington Post on Saturday, `Veterans Livid About `Willful Misconduct' Tag on Smokers.'  
Veterans groups were furious last week when Congress voted to finance the pending highway bill by denying billions of dollars to veterans suffering from tobacco-related illnesses. This week, the groups were stunned to discover that the lawmakers actually went further than that and declared any veteran who smoked on active duty could be considered to have engaged in `willful misconduct.' 
That is the same standard that the Department of Veterans Affairs uses to deny benefits to alcoholics and drug abusers. The comparison has made veterans groups livid and yesterday they vowed to force a second vote on the issue. 
`We're hoping to get one more shot at it,' said Bob Wallace, deputy executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The groups have sent messages out to their memberships hoping to flood Capitol Hill with protests from the nation's 26 million veterans. 
The veterans groups delivered their complaints to President Clinton at a Memorial Day breakfast. . . . 
A spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said Congress will consider the technical corrections bill soon but many members may be unhappy to have to vote directly on the veterans issue. 
Besides denying compensation, the highway bill also may have gone so far as to block the VA from taking care of veterans who become ill on active duty with tobacco-related illnesses, such as lung cancer and heart ailments, a VA official suggested. The VA long has accepted those individuals for care and benefits, but a spokesman said VA lawyers are now debating whether the new law will allow their continued care. 
That is pretty remarkable, Mr. President. That is pretty remarkable. 
What the Congress has done is to `retroactively redefine conduct that was not only legal but it was also encouraged by the military,' said Phil Budahn, a spokesman for the American Legion, the Nation's largest veterans organization. He and other veterans noted that the military provided free cigarettes to service personnel as recently as the Vietnam War. 
Until the highway bill came along, Congress had avoided the issue. Because denying the tobacco benefits would create a budgetary savings of as much as $23.8 billion over five years, promoters of the highway bill latched on to the idea as a way to pay for increased highway spending. 
PVA's Fuller said Congress simply saw the VA as a `cash cow' and used the veterans' money for bridges and highways. 
`They saw the money, and that's all they wanted to do,' said Dave Autry, associate national director of Disabled American Veterans.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, shortly, after some consultation, we would like to propose an amendment concerning veterans and tobacco. I expect to have that agreement shortly. 
While we are waiting, I want to quote from some letters that we have received from some of the veterans organizations in America. 
This one is from the Disabled American Veterans:  
Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the more than one million members of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), I write to express our extreme disappointment that Congress chose to raid veterans' disability compensation to pay for an already bloated transportation bill. This action was particularly egregious because it also came on the eve of Memorial Day, a day set aside by a grateful Nation to pay tribute and honor to those men and women of our Armed Forces who made the ultimate sacrifice so that all Americans, and many others around the world, could savor the freedoms we so richly enjoy. 
What I find so amazing is the willingness of the leadership and many others in Congress to debase the legislative process to ensure an offset for huge spending increases for transportation. Congress pulled out all the stops to guarantee that the end justified the means. Clearly, the American public, and particularly veterans, were the losers in this battle. 
To reach the unjustified end--robbing veterans' disability compensation to pay for transportation programs--this Congress took the unprecedented action of usurping the authorizing committee's jurisdiction. As the authorizing committee was considering the merits of the issue of paying disability compensation for tobacco-related illnesses, the Congressional leadership laid claim to all of the so-called `savings' from veterans' disability compensation, $10.5 billion, for transportation programs during the Senate Budget Committee deliberations. Further, the Senate's vote to take away this benefit was based on gross inaccuracies and misrepresentations contained in the Republican Policy Committee's talking points. 
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the `savings' from veterans' disability compensation at $10.5 billion. Although that figure was used by the Senate Budget Committee and passed by the full Senate by a margin of 6 votes, the transportation conference report on H.R. 2400 used the Administration's higher figure of $15.5 billion. This was done behind closed doors and without the knowledge of many of the transportation bill conferees. It was also accomplished with total disregard for the sense of the Congress, passed by an overwhelming majority in the House, and the motion to instruct the conferees not to use veterans' disability compensation to fund transportation. 
It was appalling to watch how quickly the Administration lent its support to this misguided effort to plunder veterans' programs when the Congressional leadership chose to use the Administration's higher cost-savings estimate, thereby guaranteeing fewer cuts in the Administration's favorite programs. 
Even worse was how quickly the leadership moved the transportation bill conference report to a vote to ensure that members would not defect after going home and meeting with their constituents on Memorial Day. 
The vote is now a part of history, as is what Congress has done to veterans. However, as Congress focuses on the appropriation process in the upcoming weeks, I call upon you to make your voice heard to ensure that veterans' programs receive adequate funding. 
While Congress can never make up for the injustice it recently perpetrated against veterans, it can ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system receives at least $1.1 billion in appropriations above the Administration's proposed budget to allow VA to provide necessary medical care to our Nation's sick and disabled veterans. Congress must also provide sufficient funding for VA to increase its employment levels in Compensation and Pension above the 7 new employees provided in the Administration's proposed budget. Too many veterans die before their claims can be properly adjudicated and too many dependents and survivors are forced to accept a small fraction of what the veteran would have been entitled to had he or she survived the enormous delays encountered in an understaffed adjudication division. 
Instead of the patriotic speeches that veterans hear twice a year, on Memorial Day and Veterans' Day, and during tough debates on the floors of Congress, I call upon you to get involved, in a meaningful way, and make your voice heard to ensure that VA receives adequate funding. Please do not sit back and wait for others to do what is right. Let your colleagues know that you support adequate funding levels for VA. 
Thank you for your support of our efforts to obtain adequate resources to substantially improve the quality and timeliness of the VA benefits delivery and health care systems.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I thank Senator Bond and Senator Specter, as well as Senator Rockefeller and Senator Campbell, for their advocacy on this issue. I believe the amendment that we are proposing, which will provide $3 billion--$600 million a year--taken out of all four of the funds that are funded by this bill is appropriate. I don't believe it is enough, given the number of veterans who are afflicted by tobacco-related illnesses, but I think it is a step in the right direction. I hope it will provide some solace and comfort to the obviously outraged and injured veterans community in America. 
I understand that everybody has their priorities around here. Highways are important. Bridges and subways are important. I was up in Massachusetts recently, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, and the `Big Dig' in Boston Harbor, which may never be completed--it may be one of the ongoing projects in history--is important. But I have to ask a question that I think deserves an answer: Are our priorities such that the men and women who served in the military, who we encouraged to smoke up to and including the Vietnam conflict, are to have a lower priority than a highway or a bridge? 
I am puzzled and obviously somewhat angered that the procedure happened as it did where a veteran who incurs a tobacco-related illness is now labeled `malicious conduct.' That is just something I do not understand nor, frankly, do most of my colleagues. I hope it can be fixed. I understand there may be a technical corrections bill to the highway bill, and I hope it can be fixed. But at the same time, I feel in the strongest terms that we ought to address this issue of tobacco-related illness as it applies to veterans.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on the conference report on H.R. 2400, the ISTEA reauthorization legislation. I regret that I am unable to be here to vote on this important piece of legislation, but I must depart momentarily to speak to the 25th Anniversary Reunion of Vietnam-Era Prisoners of War in Dallas, Texas. 
If I were able to record my vote, however, I would vote against this conference agreement. This legislation is likely the most pork-laden legislation ever to be considered by Congress in the 20th Century. This conference report should be defeated, despite the inclusion of many important and commendable provisions. 
I cannot support this conference report despite the fact that it does include significant motor carrier, highway and boating safety initiatives developed by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The Commerce Committee conferees, Senator Hollings, Senator Stevens, and I, worked diligently and responsibly to ensure that effective truck safety inspection and enforcement activities are continued, that safety initiatives on motor vehicle occupant protection are created, and that recreational boating activities are advanced. 
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation portion of the conference report also requires the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) to change existing passenger car air bag standards so that the risks air bags pose to infants, children, and other individuals are minimized. I also want to take this opportunity to express my personal thanks to Senator Kempthorne. Without his involvement, I doubt our efforts to improve passenger car air bags would have succeeded as they did. 
Yet despite these notable achievements, I regret I cannot support the ISTEA reauthorization conference report. I object for several key reasons: the budgetary offsets, donor state inequity, and pork barrel spending. 
On April 2nd, I reluctantly voted for an amendment sponsored by Senators Domenici, Lott, and Craig on the Balanced Budget Act which proposed to transfer approximately $10.5 billion over five years from the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans' tobacco-related diseases to pay for the transportation reauthorization legislation. In part, I did this because I believe that the tobacco companies, rather than the taxpayers, should bear the burden for veterans' tobacco-related diseases caused partially by smoking and using other tobacco products while they were in military service. 
Military service did not force servicemembers to smoke, but I do acknowledge that for morale reasons, the services made cigarettes available for free or at inexpensive prices. The services also give servicemembers condoms and birth control pills at no cost to military personnel, but that does not mean that they want our men and women in uniform to be promiscuous. 
As a conferee on this multi-year highway funding reauthorization bill, I have refused to support or sign the ISTEA conference report. As I mentioned earlier, of the three reasons for my opposition, the shifting of critical veterans funding to perpetuate donor state inequity and support the pork barrel spending in this massive highway bill is egregious. 
Additionally, I will seek to ensure that any tobacco bill that passes the Senate includes money for the veterans health care system to help reimburse the costs of treating veterans with tobacco-related diseases. Our nation's veterans should not be excluded from payments by tobacco companies for health care costs associated with tobacco-related diseases. The failure to address the tobacco-related health care needs of our men and women who faithfully served their country in uniform would be wrong. 
Congress cannot continue to rob from veterans, whose programs have been seriously underfunded for years, to pay for a bill that ranks as the largest pork-barrel spending bill ever written. 
Two months ago during the debate on the McCain/Mack/Graham/ Thurmond/Coats/Brownback/Kyl amendment, I discussed the history of highway bill demonstration projects. Those remarks are as relevant today as they were two months ago, because if we adopt this conference report as presently written, we will shatter all pork-barrel spending records. 
In 1982, the highway bill had 10 demonstration projects, costing a total of $362 million. In 1987, 152 demonstration projects were created, costing a total of $1.4 billion. In 1991, what was then felt to be the mother lode of all demo project bills, the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act (ISTEA), 538 location-specific projects totaling $6.23 billion were created. 
Where are we today? H.R. 2400 doesn't just double the number of location-specific project, but it more than triples the number of earmarked projects. The bill individually targets more than 1,850 projects. The costs have risen as well. H.R. 2400 sets aside more than $9 billion to pay for these 1,850 specified highway projects. That is $9 billion of highway funding that Congress is mandating the states allocate to carry out whimsical projects. That is $9 billion that states cannot allocate to those infrastructure projects they deem most appropriate. Scores of other projects are listed in other sections of the legislation. 
A new name has even been created. We used to hear about `demonstration' projects and `innovative' projects. Under H.R. 2400, we now have `high priority projects.' Just what is a `high priority' project? Let me mention just a few examples of the type of project that the conferees believe are definitive projects. 
Funds are included to initiate `traffic calming projects' in West Palm Beach, Florida and Fauquier County, Virginia. Money is included to build a coal heritage trail in West Virginia. Millions of dollars are set aside in selected towns throughout the country to construct location-specific bike paths. If traffic calming activities and constructing boardwalks fail in some minds to qualify as a `high priority' project, there's always the funding set aside to produce a documentary film on infrastructure. 
I fail to see how items like these can seriously be considered `high' transportation priorities. 
Priorities are traditionally established after thorough review and discussion. While our colleagues in the other body maintain that their projects were selected after a review process, I do know that the process in the Senate was not. 
At 5:30 last night, Senate transportation aides received an e-mail message announcing that a limited number of Senate high priority projects were about to be added to the conference report. Transportation aides were advised to inform the Environment and Public Works Committee if their members wanted any projects earmarked. Staff was advised that no more than half of the proposed State allocation amount should be earmarked. Explicit direction was provided on how a Member might make such a request, including that it must be in writing and the description of the project must not exceed 216 characters. In addition, a name and phone number was provided where staff could call to find out just how much extra money had been set aside for their state. 
Mr. President, this borders on the absurd. What ever happened to funding projects based on legitimate needs? 
Mr. President, this reauthorization would be comical if it weren't such an abrogation of our responsibilities to the American taxpayer. 
I am not alone in my disdain for this raid on the highway trust fund. Public interest groups have strongly criticized projects like these. The Heritage Foundation recently called on Congress to eliminate the House earmarks and to `instead allow each state to use its share of the highway trust fund for projects that meet locally and state determined needs and priorities.' Citizens Against Government Waste states that the House-passed legislation `guarantees that federal highway dollars will continue to be doled out to regions with political muscle, rather than to areas that truly need it.' 
Two of the originally-stated goals in ISTEA's reauthorization were to promote state highway funding flexibility and to utilize limited resources responsibly. Rather than perpetuate Congressional earmarks, we should place our confidence in our elected Governors' and Mayors' decision-making capabilities. Local- and state-elected officials should make the final decisions on local and state roads. 
Lastly, I remain concerned over donor state equity. Currently, taxpayers living in donor states are forced to subsidize transportation projects in donee states. Arizona, for example, receives only about 85 cents for every gas-tax dollar it contributes to the highway trust fund. The 85-cent return ratio is reality despite the fact that the original ISTEA legislation `guaranteed,' and I stress the word guaranteed, donor states a 90-cent return by 1997. The 1991 `guarantee' simply was never fulfilled. 
Now donor states are being told the new funding formula will guarantee they'll receive 90.5 cents back for every gas tax dollar sent to Washington. That's a mere half-penny increase over the 1991 guarantee that was never realized. 
Today, many of our colleagues will announce that the conference report provides critical funding to meet the transportation needs `for the 21st Century.' The conferees have gone so far as to entitle the bill `the Transportation Equity Act' yet nothing could be further from the truth. We will be told the dramatic increase in highway spending--a portion of which I remind my colleagues comes at the expense of veterans programs and other domestic activities--will fill a critical gap in transportation spending. Yet I ask my colleagues, how can anyone realistically believe that a half-penny hike will meet the transportation needs for the fastest growing states in the nation. States like Arizona and Nevada are not being treated fairly or reasonably. 
Mr. President, the only guarantee that donor states should expect from this legislation is that they will continue to subsidize road projects in other states for the next six years. 
Mr. President, I also want to mention a purely procedural matter which deeply concerns me. When staff of the Senate conferees first met on the legislation, the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation was told specifically that several projects designated in the House-passed bill were squarely within our jurisdiction. The Environment and Public Works Committee in essence gave those projects over to the Commerce Committee. The Commerce Committee never resolved those issues, so I was quite surprised to see that the projects that EPW specifically gave over to Commerce Committee to handle quietly found their way into the conference report we debate today. 
I also formally protest the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and Environment and Public Works Committee conferees' inclusion of a provision which is squarely within the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction. Those conferees included language to exempt winter home heating oil delivery drivers from hours of service regulations for the next two years. 
Let me be very clear. The Environment and Public Works Committee has no jurisdiction over federal motor carrier safety regulations governing hours of service. Federal hours of service regulations are the primary protection for the traveling public against truck drivers being forced to drive excessive hours in a fatigued condition. The Senate Commerce Committee has sole jurisdiction over hours of service and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee not only didn't ask for our input in the issue, but surreptitiously snuck it into the bill. 
As a conferee on the legislation I find this action reprehensible. As the Chairman of the Commerce Committee I find action inexcusable. And I assure my colleagues that this Senator will not let this action stand and I pledge that I will do all that I can to have this provision stripped from the legislation. 
Mr. President, this conference report is a sham. The so-called Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century is a fraud. We should not fool taxpayers into believing that this legislation is anything more than a raid on gasoline tax dollars at the expense of veterans benefits. I urge my colleagues to vote against the conference report.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my several of my colleagues from the Hispanic Task Force to submit a Resolution on English-Plus. This resolution is intended to express the importance of the English language in our society, PLUS the importance of knowing, understanding and speaking other languages in addition to English. 
As a member of the Hispanic Task Force, I have been working closely with my colleagues, Senators Domenici and Hatch, in developing this resolution. Many of our colleagues may be curious to know what we mean when we say `English Plus.' `English-Plus' reflects our firm belief that all members of our society need to recognized and understand the importance of being fluent in English, Plus one or more additional languages. 
Everyone agrees that all Americans must be fluent in English in order to succeed in today's society. Not only is English the common language of our nation, it is also the most popular and widely used language internationally in the areas of finance, trade, technology, diplomacy and entertainment. This is why it is critical that we continue encouraging all members of our society to be fluent in the English language. 
However, I believe it is equally important for each of us to encourage all members of our society to study and develop an understanding of, if not a fluency, in one or more languages in addition to English. Individuals who have the capability to communicate in multiple languages have access to a wealth of opportunities economically, socially, professionally and personally. 
Encouraging our citizens to be bilingual or multilingual serves as a tremendous resource to the United States, because it enhances our competitiveness in global markets by enabling communication and cross-cultural understanding while trading and conducting international business. In addition, multilingualism enhances our nation's diplomatic efforts and leadership role on the international front by fostering greater communication and understanding between nations and their people. 
Foreign language skills also serve as a powerful tool for promoting greater cross-cultural understanding between the multitude of racial and ethnic groups in our country. One in five Americans will be of Hispanic descent by the year 2030. According to the 1990 Census, Spanish is the second most widely used language in the world. It is my firm belief that developing a greater knowledge of the Spanish language will benefit the economic and cultural interests of our entire country. Being proficient or fluent in languages besides English, combined with an understanding of various cultures, will significantly enhance communication and understanding between the various racial and ethnic groups in our country. 
This resolution highlights the importance of implementing policies in our country which support and encourage all Americans to master English, plus one or more other languages of the world. It is critical that we continue supporting policies and programs which stress the importance of English but we should also encourage all Americans to study, learn and familiarize themselves with the languages of many other cultures. 
I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution, which sends a clear message to our citizens and the people of the world that Americans are committed to encouraging proficiency in English as well as other international languages.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of the Gregg-Leahy amendment pending to the tobacco legislation. It is the chairman's intention to move to table the Gregg-Leahy amendment at approximately 11 a.m. 
I want to point out that that vote may be a little later, because I had a large number of Senators who have asked to speak before that vote. So that may be delayed past 11 a.m. All Senators will be notified when that vote occurs. 
Following that vote, it is believed that the Democrats will be prepared to offer an amendment under a short time agreement. Following disposition of the Democrat amendment, it is hoped that the Senate could then consider the farmers' protection issue. 
Therefore, the first vote of today's session is expected sometime after 11 a.m., and Members should expect rollcall votes throughout today's session in order to make good progress on this important tobacco legislation. 
Also at the end of this week, it is hoped that the Senate will be able to complete action on the ISTEA conference report, if available, and the Iran sanctions bill under a previous consent agreement. 
Once again, the cooperation of all Senators will be necessary for the Senate to complete its work prior to the Memorial Day recess.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his thoughtful and measured remarks, and I appreciate his willingness to compromise, which has been a trademark of the Senator from Nebraska for a long time. 
I would not ask him if he felt the same way about our relations, congressional relations with Governors when he was Governor of the State of Nebraska. I will leave that question unanswered at this time. But I do again thank him for his thoughtful approach. Obviously, he has studied this very complex issue and a number of his recommendations, I believe, are important and may be adopted either by agreement or in amendment form. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. 
Mr. President, because of the schedules of Senators, it is now my intention to move to table the amendment sometime around 2 o'clock. A number of Senators are off the Hill and will not be back until that time. Also, I understand the distinguished Democratic leader would like to make some remarks before the vote. 
Mr. President, I know that the Senator from California and the Senator from Illinois and my friend from Texas all want to make remarks. But I will just take about 2 or 3 minutes to say I paid attention to the remarks of the Senator from Oklahoma. I appreciate them. Many of them were constructive. Many of them I profoundly disagree with and cannot and will not at this time respond to over an hour of comments and an in-depth discussion of the bill. 
But the criticisms of the Senator from Oklahoma basically boil down to four fundamentals: One is a tax increase; second is big spending; the third is big government; and the fourth is the argument that it will not stop kids from smoking. 
I will briefly address that in general terms and at a later time I will give more specific responses to the Senator's very strong and, by the way, well-meaning criticisms of the Senator from Oklahoma. 
The argument that this is nothing but a tax increase would have some validity if it were not for the fact that there will be an increase in the price of cigarettes even if this body and the Congress of the United States do nothing. 
Two weeks ago, there was another settlement, the fourth made between the industry and a State. It was between the industry and the State of Minnesota. What was the agreement? It was a $6.5 billion agreement, the largest yet on a per capita basis. And guess what is the result of that agreement? An increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes in Minnesota in order to pay for the settlement. 
I might point out that settlement was double the settlement that was achieved by the attorneys general with the tobacco industry last June 20. As we see settlement after settlement after settlement, we will see an increase and an increase and an increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes. So we will either enact an increase in the price of the pack of cigarettes, earmark it to the worthy causes, the four that we have laid out, the States, public health, research, and the farmers, or we will watch as State after State goes to court, achieves a settlement or a jury verdict, and we see the same result. 
What is the problem with that? The only problem with that is 3,000 teens start smoking every day and 1,000 will die early as a result of health-related illness. So, Mr. President, if you want to call this a price increase, that is fine. But if anybody in America believes there is not going to be a dramatic increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes as a result of negotiations or litigation, they simply have not observed what has happened in the case of the four previous States in the past several months. And 36 more States, at least, are lined up to go to court. 
Now, this also does touch to some degree the argument my friends have about attorney's fees. The last I saw--and I don't keep close track of what happens in Florida--the plaintiff lawyers were going to get $2 billion out of the settlement. I think we need to address the issue of lawyer's fees, but if you are worried about it, I would think you would then support a comprehensive settlement as opposed to watching this go on. It isn't just the lawyer's fees that will cost the taxpayers. It is the cost of litigation, which we know is serious. 
So if you want to call it a tax increase and quote the biggest in history, blah, blah, blah, then that is your right. But I think in all fairness, in all fairness, you ought to understand the consequences of failure to act, which will be larger increases in the cost of a pack of cigarettes, larger litigation and more delay and, finally, of course, the problem that we need to address and that is the issue of kids smoking. 
The second argument is that it is big spending. Let me point out that 40 percent, the biggest chunk of this settlement, goes to States that have incurred costs associated with Medicaid. That is where 40 percent of the money goes. And we also know that we don't know--that we don't know--exactly what it is that causes kids to smoke. 
We have some pretty good ideas. And, by the way, every single expert, including--including the chief executive of Philip Morris, who, while they were negotiating with the attorneys general, said, `We all know that price rates are more sensitive to kids smoking than adults.' That makes sense, obviously, since kids generally don't have as much money as adults do. 
But if you want to call it a big spending bill, let's look at where the money is going to, and that is for research, and it is to go to health care, and it is also to go to farmers who are going to be dislocated by this. Remember also that much of the smoking prevention and cessation is in block grants so that the States will be able to do what they think is best with it. 
Big government? This may be a big government solution. This may not be the solution that I would have had envisioned nor that the Senator from Massachusetts would have envisioned. This is as a direct result of the agreement which was reached between the attorneys general, 40 of them, and the tobacco industry, which set the stage for the fact that the U.S. Congress needs to act--or at least address the issue. We may not act. We may not act. We may decide, as my friend, the Senator from Texas, will so eloquently argue, that we can't do this. But when the stage was set with that agreement last June 20, and we were going to have to act it out, what we did in the Commerce Committee by a 19-to-1 vote was put our imprint on it, and the benefit of our wisdom, our knowledge, and, frankly, that of every public health group in America, as well as many other organizations. 
Finally, and I apologize to the Senator from California for taking this much time, but the other is that it will not stop kids from smoking. You know, I challenge anyone who says this bill will not reduce teenage smoking to find a single public health organization in America, that is legitimate, that is not on the payroll of the tobacco companies, that will say that an increase in the cost of a pack of cigarettes, plus youth cessation programs, will not have a beneficial effect on this terrible problem. 
There was a chart, the Senator from Massachusetts saw it the other day, of the deaths in America. The bar graph was dramatically higher, tobacco-related illnesses death, as opposed to drunk driving, as opposed to many other causes of death in America. 
If it will not work, then are we satisfied with the status quo? Are we satisfied that in America today this problem is not only real but growing? We had a Centers for Disease Control study just recently, teenage smoking is on the rise. Minorities in America, those teenagers are starting to resort more and more and more to the use of cigarettes. 
So maybe it will not--maybe it will not stop kids from smoking. Maybe this will not work. But to accept the status quo, in my view, and think that just by passing a tax increase on cigarettes we will address that issue, will not do it. I challenge my friend from Texas, who is waiting to speak, I think, very soon. If the Senator from Texas can find a single public health organization in America--the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the Coalition for Tobacco-Free Kids, any living--any living Surgeon General of the United States of America, who will say to you and this body: OK, just pass a tax increase, fund some tobacco cessation programs and that will do the job--then I think that should be an important part of this debate. 
But the reality is, not a single one of those organizations will say that anything less than a comprehensive approach to this problem will do the job. 
So I just wanted to take a few minutes to respond to the very well thought out and very studied and scholarly, in many cases, objections that were raised by the Senator from Oklahoma. That is what this process is supposed to be all about. I appreciate his input, as I do that of my dearest friend, the Senator from Texas, who has promised me, and I have promised him, we will remain smiling throughout this debate. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from Massachusetts who wishes to speak. I will yield the floor in just a minute, because I don't want to have him delayed, because I know he has a schedule. Of course, I note the presence on the floor of the sponsor of the pending amendment, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire. 
Mr. President, I thought yesterday we made good progress. We have addressed the issue of attorneys' fees, although I don't believe that will be the final consideration of that issue since there are some very strongly held views on it. But we did have good and vigorous debate on that issue. 
Yesterday, also, I think the parameters of this legislation were determined to a significant degree when the Ashcroft amendment was tabled. Then the majority of the Senate decided that we would not remove these fees that will be imposed on the tobacco industry as part of this legislation and settlement. 
On the other side, when the Kennedy amendment was rejected, also the majority of the Senate declared its position at $1.10, which was approximately where the price of a pack of cigarettes would be. 
Today, we will address the Gregg amendment, which will have to do with another important part of the bill. And that is the cap on the amount of payments that the tobacco companies would make on an annual basis, which I intend to discuss at more length, because I am not sure that this Senate understands, one, the exact meaning of that and the implications of removing it, because, very frankly, the implications of removing it will mean much higher costs to the taxpayers and to the consumers at the end of the day. 
Finally, after that issue is resolved, we intend to take up one of the other major portions of this proposed legislation. And that is the agriculture portions of the bill, and, of course, there are extremely strongly held views on that particular issue. 
Mr. President, I believe at the end of today we would have addressed--the Senate--admittedly from time to time in somewhat prolonged fashion, the major issues pertaining to this legislation. 
I am pleased with the progress we have made so far. Apparently, we may not be able to complete action on this legislation before going into recess. But hopefully the realization will set in that we have addressed by the end of the day the major portions of this bill. And we could then conclude consideration of this legislation upon return. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for a very enlightening and informative debate. It has been an important discussion, not on the amendment just voted on, but on the bill itself. Obviously, we attempted to table the Gregg amendment, and it is something that is unfortunate, in my view, for the entire bill. At the same time, just like with the attorneys' fees and other aspects of this issue, we will revisit this issue again. I believe it is important for us to continue to work through the bill and get it through the U.S. Senate. 
I think the American people expect us to do that, and I think it is important that we continue to work on the many amendments of significant importance to the bill. I believe this aspect of it not only will be revisited, but it is another chapter in a very long saga. Yesterday, we had two very significant victories. Today, we had a defeat. There will be more victories and more defeats as we go through this very difficult process. 
But at the end of the day, I am totally confident that this body and the Congress will act in a responsible manner and adopt a comprehensive piece of legislation that will attack the nationwide problem of 3,000 children beginning to smoke every day and 1,000 of them being caused to die early as a result of tobacco-related illnesses. I thank all those who voted in favor of the amendment. And for those who opposed it, I respect the opposition. But I believe we will move forward with a comprehensive piece of legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I need to respond, of course, to the Senator from Oklahoma who somehow now regrets or complains about the fact that this legislation went through the Commerce Committee. My understanding is, unless I am having some mental lapse, that the decision was made by the leadership to move the bill through the Commerce Committee. 
My understanding is that was the instruction of the distinguished assistant majority leader and the other members of the leadership, to move it through the Commerce Committee, because it was clear it was not going to go through the other committees. Now the Senator from Oklahoma seems terribly distraught that it didn't go through the other committees when he was the major person to move it through the Commerce Committee.

Mr. McCAIN. If you don't have a question, then I suggest you wait until the expiration of my time. 
The second point is that the Finance Committee did insist, insist, insist and got this bill, and they came up with a result that the Senator from Oklahoma didn't like. There were amendments pending, that is my understanding, in the Finance Committee--I was watching on C-SPAN--that would have done even more damage to the legislation, at least from the viewpoint of the Senator from Oklahoma, who thinks that the bill is too encompassing, too large a tax increase, et cetera, which he has spoken at length about on this floor today. I am curious about what would have happened if the Finance Committee had kept the bill even longer. 
As far as the Agriculture Committee is concerned, the Agriculture Committee bill is in the bill as a result of the majority leader inserting it. The Senate will have its way on that. 
But I want to come back to the fundamental issue of the look-back provision. Mr. President, I didn't invent the look-back provision. It wasn't my idea. I have very talented staff and advisers and friends. The look-back provision came 
from the agreement that was entered into by the attorneys general of the 40 States and the industry. 
Have they changed? Yes, the look-back provisions have changed. Should they be changed back? Should I support the Durbin amendment? No, because I think it makes it worse. But the look-back provision concept was generated by the belief of every public health group in America that you can't trust the tobacco companies. 
Perhaps the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from New Mexico and others trust the tobacco companies and believe that they will really try to reduce teen smoking. They may do that, but most observers believe that after commitment after commitment and promise after promise and lying to Congress about the fact of whether they enticed kids to smoke or not, the fact is we found out they did. So the look-back provision, I inform my colleagues, does not mean you have any connection with the tobacco industry, but you ignore the fact that the tobacco industry can't be trusted, and unless there are penalties involved, then the industry will not do what they say they will do, because they have already said they would try not to entice kids to smoke, and they did. That is the reason for the look-back provision. 
Philosophically, that may not be something that is acceptable to the Senator from Oklahoma, the Senator from Texas, or the Senator from New Mexico. But the reality is that is the view of every public health organization in America. Every living--every living--Surgeon General in America today has said you have to have these provisions in the legislation if you want to attack the issue of kids smoking. 
That is the view--and we have the letter, I have the letter from the Surgeons General, every Surgeon General since 1973. Perhaps those who oppose this know more than they do. I don't know, I don't know more than they do. 
With startling candor, Dr. Claude Teague set forth the plain facts about the addictive nature of nicotine in his chilling 1972 internal memorandum discussing the crucial role of nicotine. He said: 
Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in its variety of physiological actions. Realistically, if our company is to survive and prosper over the long term, we must get our share of the youth market. 
`We must get our share of the youth market.' 
I commend this to the reading of the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Oklahoma. It is clear that the tobacco companies attempted to entice youths to smoke. So, therefore, in the agreement made by the tobacco companies, freely entered into by the tobacco companies, there were look-back provisions. Perhaps the Senator from Oklahoma doesn't like the size of them, but it is hard for me to understand how he can argue against the rationale behind it. 
Another slip occurred----

Mr. McCAIN. In 1987, just months before the national launch of the Joe Camel campaign, on October 15, 1987, a memorandum stamped `RJ secret' from a file that, incredibly, bears the name `youth target': 
Project LF is a wider circumference nonmenthol cigarette targeted at younger adult male smokers, primarily 14- to 24-year-old male smokers. 
I can go through document after document for the Senator 
from Oklahoma. What I am asking him to understand is why these look-back provisions are there, because the tobacco companies tried to entice young people to smoke, and here are the documents. In the agreement of June 20, 1997, the tobacco industry admitted that they had enticed kids to smoke. Therefore, since they could not be trusted, then there should be provisions that penalize the tobacco companies if, indeed, youth smoking went up, which they are committed not to do. That is something in which they freely engaged. 
I can understand if the Senator from Oklahoma has a problem with the size of those look-back provisions. I cannot understand why the Senator from Oklahoma would not understand why the look-back provisions are there. When we talk about all the adjectives that the Senator from Oklahoma has described these look-back provisions, the facts are, according to every living Surgeon General, according to every public health organization in America, according to Dr. Koop, according to Dr. Kessler, according to every health expert in America, the fact is there has to be provisions that will punish the tobacco companies, as well as incentivize them to stop and reduce teenage smoking. 
Now that, I suggest, is reality. Again, I am not speaking from my knowledge and expertise. I am not speaking from my background. I have to go, when I don't know about issues, to the experts. It is rarely that I find experts who are completely in agreement on an issue, and every expert in America is unanimous in saying we have to have some provisions that punish the tobacco companies if they don't do what they say they are going to do. 
When the tobacco industry entered into the agreement, they promised to do everything they could to reduce teen smoking. That was part of the agreement they entered into. So how in the world somebody would say that when you swear to defend the Constitution of the United States that you would totally disagree with every health expert in America, frankly, is something I don't understand. 
These proposals have been pummeled pretty heavily for the last couple of days, including from the Senator from Texas who has been here quite awhile, and including others. 
I want to say, I am coming to respond to this because this legislation is based on an agreement the tobacco industry voluntarily entered into. It seems to me the Senator from Oklahoma's and the Senator from Texas' problem is not with this legislation, it is with the original agreement. And, frankly, they have every right to disagree with it. 
But the reason why many of the provisions were put in that legislation and were entered into was because the best minds in America on this issue said, `You need look-back provisions, you need to restrict advertising, you need to have programs that have to do with youth cessation, you need to have research, you need to have funding for the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control. This is what you need in order to stop kids from smoking.'

You made some remarks about it, et cetera, and I just felt I would defend it. But at the same time, the Senator from Oklahoma is sincere in his beliefs, and they are held with integrity. And I do not in any way imply that there is any relationship there. I wanted to clear that up.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, although we haven't established an exact time for the tabling motion, as I mentioned last night, we will try to do them sometime around 11 o'clock. But I do want the proponents and opponents of these amendments to have ample time to discuss and debate. I think we are working on an informal agreement that we will go from side to side. I see the Senator from Missouri here. If it is agreeable, I would like for him to have recognition next. I will just comment briefly, if I could. 
If the Ashcroft amendment is agreed to, smokers won't be relieved of any price increase in this bill. Quite the contrary. If the amendment prevails, the States, at an enormous time and expense, will resume their suits, as we all know. There have been four settlements already, and 36 other States are in line. As we know from the other four States, they will prevail. There were four suits, four settlements. Minnesota is receiving twice--double--what they would have received as a result of the June 20 agreement between the attorneys general in the industry. 
So let's not have any mistake. This amendment won't eliminate an increase in cigarette prices, because when the tobacco companies agree to pay the State of Minnesota a certain amount of money, they increase the price for a pack of cigarettes in order to be able to make a settlement. That is 
 how it computes. Make no mistake, its passage will delay getting about the business at hand, and 3,000 kids a day will begin to smoke and a thousand will die substantially earlier as a result. 
Mr. President, I will make more comments later. Have no doubt about the effect of the Ashcroft amendment, which would be simply to delay price increases and delay our ability to attack the issue of kids smoking, because there will be added expenses passed on to the consumer as a result of these settlements. In case the Senator from Missouri missed it, Minnesota and the tobacco companies just settled for double what had been in the original settlement. Those costs will be passed on to the person who purchases a pack of cigarettes. Economics work that way. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow morning at 9:30 the Senate will resume consideration of the Gregg-Leahy amendment pending to the tobacco legislation. 
It is the chairman's intention to move to table the Gregg-Leahy amendment at approximately 11 a.m. I add at this point, it could be later than that because we have had numerous requests to speak on this amendment. So it could be later than that. 
Following that vote, it is hoped that the Democrats would be prepared to offer an amendment under a short time agreement. Following disposition of the Democrat amendment, it is hoped the Senate could then consider the farmers' protection issue. At the conclusion of debate on the protection issue, the Senate would proceed to a vote on a motion to strike the Ford language, followed by a vote to strike the McConnell-Lugar language. Therefore, the first vote of Thursday's session is expected at approximately 11 a.m. or later, and Members should expect rollcall votes throughout Thursday's session in order to make good progress on this important tobacco legislation. 
Once again, the cooperation of all Senators would be necessary for the Senate to complete its work prior to the Memorial Day recess.

I will do so after it appears that most Members on both sides have had an opportunity to talk about the issue. I think the Senator from Massachusetts agrees that we would not want to have a tabling motion since the other side has not had an opportunity to speak.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am going to make a motion to table the Kennedy amendment. Before I do, I would like to, for the benefit of my colleagues who would like to know what is going on here, say our intention is--and none of this is by unanimous consent--but our intention is to move to the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, who has an amendment concerning immunity. 
In our custom of going back and forth, since Senator Gramm was the last speaker, I would like to have Senator Kerrey of Nebraska be able to speak for about 15 minutes. Then we would move to Senator Gregg. 
I would like to have a vote on that tonight. But I also urge my colleagues to come and talk on the bill as well as its amendment, because I have been told by Members on both sides of the aisle that there is great frustration that they have not been able to address the entire bill, much less amendments. 
I intend to stay tonight as long as is necessary. I will force the Senator from Massachusetts to do the same thing, and we will try to get as much debate and discussion of this very important bill before we leave tonight. 
Madam President, at this time I move to table the Kennedy amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

So I just mention administratively that, after discussion with the Senator from Massachusetts and with the majority leader, it would be our intention to have either a tabling motion or an up-or-down vote on this amendment and the second-degree amendment around 10 o'clock tomorrow. It is my understanding that we will be in at about 9:30, and that would give a half-hour tomorrow morning. So whether we have the unanimous consent agreement or not, that would be the intention of the Senator from Massachusetts and myself. 
Second, the majority leader has asked me to announce that there will be no further rollcall votes tonight. 
I would like to say, and point out to my colleagues, that I have heard all day today that some of my colleagues have felt that they have not been able to speak on the bill. There are others who want to speak on the amendment. I encourage you to come over. As I mentioned earlier, the Senator from Massachusetts and I will remain here until such time as everyone is heard both on the bill and on the amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Before my colleague from Oregon leaves the floor, I express to him, first of all, my appreciation for his kind remarks, which I do not deserve. Second of all, I thank him for all the work that he has done on this legislation. Without him and his incredibly active participation in this effort, we would not have been able to reach the goal of getting a bill through the Commerce Committee and now to the floor of the Senate. 
But most importantly, I thank the Senator from Oregon because he was involved in this issue very long before I or most of the Members of this body were involved. He and former Congressman Synar embarked on this effort long ago. And sometimes we have a reputation, which is well deserved as politicians, of butterflying from one issue to the other and forgetting the one of yesterday for the one of today and tomorrow. 
Senator Wyden does not take that approach on any issue, but on this issue he has been steadfast. He has been courageous. And, very frankly, he has been criticized from time to time, when the mood of the country was not as it is today. There was a time when we did not know all of the details about the tobacco companies having deceived the American people. There was a time when the tobacco lobby, we all know, had a much greater influence on both sides of the Capitol than today. It was during those times that Senator Wyden carried the torch for the children of America. 
I will always be grateful to him. And history will record that Senator Wyden was a key and vital player in that effort. So I extend my gratitude to Senator Wyden and remind him that we have a great deal yet to do. I know I can count on him to do it.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have several comments to make. 
First of all, it is time we started getting a list of the amendments. So we would appreciate it if on both sides we could have Members get their amendments so that we could start in the process, as we always do, of narrowing down the amendments and seeing which can be agreed to and start looking at time agreements. 
Mr. President, the second thing I mention is that we will now be going, as we have agreed amongst us to go, to the other side for an amendment. It is my understanding that amendment will be the issue of raising from $1.10 to $1.50 a pack. We would like to work on a unanimous consent agreement so that it would read that there would be the amendment relative to $1.50, and no second-degree amendments be in order to the amendment prior to the motion to table. Further, we would ask if the amendment is not tabled, it be open to relevant second-degree amendments, and the time between now and that time to be determined be equally divided, with a vote occurring on or in relation to the amendment. 
The Senator from New Hampshire wants assurance as to when his amendment will be considered. We are trying to work that out with the majority leader. I know there are people on the other side who also want assurances for their amendments. I believe the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, is also looking for the same. But it would be our intention at this time, after the usual formalities, to move to the amendment on that side.

I just wanted to allow the other side to propose an amendment and then we will work on making sure everybody has their views and this amendment is debated and discussed thoroughly, and then we would look forward, obviously, to a time where we could vote on the issue.

Mr. McCAIN. Just a brief comment: I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his concerns, and the Senator from Texas, the Senator from Utah as well. We would like to get amendments together so we can move forward. I understand the concerns. They have been made to me, and on this floor. We look forward to a vigorous debate. 
I thank the Senator for his willingness to work, all of us together. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his indulgence. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not support this amendment. I don't doubt that the goals of the Senator from Massachusetts and those who support this amendment are the same as those who support the underlying bill, which is $1.10. I reject the notion that more is automatically better. There is a point at which we have gone too far. Some believe strongly we have already passed that threshold. We just had a little discussion while we were waiting, while the Senator from Massachusetts was waiting to propose his amendment, that amplified the concerns of many who believe this legislation has gone too far. On the other side, there are some, including the sponsor of this amendment, who believe we have not gone far enough. I don't want us to engage in a bidding war. If $1.50 is acceptable, then why not $2 or $3 or $5, et cetera? 
I point out to my colleagues a very important point here. The bill already has a mechanism for increasing the price of tobacco if other methods fail. That is what we call the look-back provisions. The look-back provisions are penalties that are both company specific and industry wide, if there is not a decrease in teenage smoking. 
If our goal is to reduce teenage smoking, which it is, then these look-back provisions achieve what the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts seeks. I have not been around as 
long as some, but too often our fidelity to a cause is measured only by how high a price we can extract and how much we are willing to bid up. 
It was back in March when the Commerce Committee began work on this issue. We worked for a long time and we came out with a package by a 19 to 1 vote. As part of that package, it was determined that $1.10 was the appropriate cost--the price of a pack of cigarettes. I might add that was also the position of the White House, the administration, that $1.10 was the appropriate number. 
Since then, we have toughened the look-back provisions. We have raised the cap on how much liability the tobacco companies would have on an annual basis. We have toughened up this bill to the point where it has been of great concern on the other side of the aisle. The $1.10 was part of a carefully negotiated package. In and of itself it was not a magic number. The $1.10 was a tradeoff in return for a cap on liability, in return for the look-back provisions, in return for a number of other things--the language concerning the authority of the FDA. So, this was all put together in a package. 
I say to the Senator from Massachusetts that he was not part of those negotiations because he is not part of the committee. That is very understandable, although I noted during the time we were doing those negotiations the Senator from Massachusetts was very vociferous in his opposition to almost anything that we did. In fact, he was quoted in the newspaper, much to my surprise, as criticizing the committee, which I chair. I was somewhat intrigued by that, but that certainly is the right of the Senator from Massachusetts to question the credibility of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. 
I respect the commitment of the Senator from Massachusetts to the children of America. I respect his belief that $1.50 will do more than will $1.10. But I urge my colleagues to understand that the $1.10 was not plucked out of the air. The $1.10 was the best expert advice we could get and with the concurrence of the administration. There are those in the public health community who agree with the Senator from Massachusetts that it is not high enough. There are others in the public health community who say that $1.50 is not enough. There are those on both sides of the aisle who think we should have no protections of any kind nor anything for the tobacco industry. Frankly, I believe that would just kill the tobacco industry. 
We are not in the business of trying to kill the tobacco industry. Let's keep that in mind. Because, if 40 million Americans are going to smoke, they are going to continue to smoke, and we are not going to be able to prohibit that. We tried that with alcohol many years ago. But if we are trying to attack the issue of kids smoking, we do have a problem with too high a cost for a pack of cigarettes. That has been highlighted by the Senator from Utah concerning the possibility of contraband. There is a problem, obviously, with too high a cost for a pack of cigarettes, that there would be a black market that would spring up in America. We used the best advice that we could get from throughout the administration, from the public health community, and from many others, which allowed us to come up with $1.10 as the cost of a pack of cigarettes to achieve the goal of reducing teenage smoking, along with the other aspects of this comprehensive settlement. 
I point out again to my colleague from Massachusetts, we have a look-back provision in the bill. For every child over the quota in the percentage that is not reduced by the tobacco companies, there is a $1,000-per-child penalty provision in this bill. 
That effectively achieves the goal which I believe this amendment seeks. 
Mr. President, I know there are many other speakers. We will probably discuss this some more between now and final passage. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I have been authorized by the majority leader to announce there will be no further votes this evening. The Senate will remain in session for those Members interested in debating this important issue. 
By mid to late morning tomorrow, I intend to move to table the pending Ashcroft amendment and the Kennedy amendment, all in an effort to move this bill along. Again, the next vote should occur around 11 a.m. on Wednesday. 
While I have the floor, Mr. President, I make one comment. I am the father of four children. I come from a high-income bracket. I love my children. I believe that low-income Americans love their children, as well. And I have talked to many low-income Americans, both in person and by mail and on talk shows, who have said, `Senator McCain, I smoke. I wish I didn't smoke. My children are beginning to smoke. Please do everything you can to stop it.' 
Mr. President, to believe somehow that low-income families aren't as concerned about their children and whether they are going to smoke or not, frankly, is not something that I agree with, nor I believe is it fair to low-income families all over America. Low-income families in America love their children as I love my children. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank the Senator from North Dakota for not only his kind remarks but for the enormous contributions he has made to this effort. He has worked tirelessly. He has appeared with our committee--not before our committee, but with our committee, where we had one of the most stimulating, I think, dialog and exchange of views since I have been a member of that committee. 
I want to thank him. I know there will continue to be areas where we are not in agreement. The fact is, we disagree very agreeably. 
I also want to mention again our friends, the attorneys general who began this process. Forty of them settled a suit with the industry back on June 20. This legislation that we are considering now is a direct result of that initial effort on their part. They have been extremely helpful as we moved this process along. 
It is my understanding that the Senator from Massachusetts has agreed to conclude his remarks after the wrap-up. Is that correct?

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have reached an understanding with the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Massachusetts that the Senator from Kentucky would like to speak for half an hour. Senator Faircloth will be recognized for his first-degree amendment following the statement by the Senator from Kentucky. Following that it is our understanding there will either be a second-degree amendment to the Faircloth amendment, or, if not, the Faircloth amendment will be disposed of, and following that it was our understanding that the other side of the aisle would have the next amendment, and go back and forth as is the tradition of this body, from one side to the other with amendments. All amendments which are in the first degree will be open, obviously, to second-degree amendments. As the Faircloth amendment would be open to second-degree amendment, so will the next Democrat amendment be open to second-degree amendments. 
I expect shortly the Senator from Kentucky to come to speak for approximately half an hour. The Senator from North Carolina is agreeable. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank the Senator from Texas, as always, for his thoughtful and insightful views. Obviously, I am not in agreement on a number of the things he said, but his and my disagreements have always been very agreeable. I believe he has contributed an enormous amount. I do agree with him, I don't know what would have happened if we had given the Finance Committee another 24 hours, which I think is, as he mentioned, a cautionary lesson as to what we have had to go through and what we will go through on the floor and what might have happened if it had gone to other committees. 
Just one other point I want to make for my friend from Texas. Yes, the attacks have started. Millions of dollars have been directed at me, so I do know what it is like. You say you don't know what it is like. I know what it is like. I am a big boy, and I can take it, but I have been rather interested at the ferocity of these attacks and how personal they have been. Obviously, I will not respond in kind. I would have liked to have seen the tobacco companies spend some of this money on trying to stop kids from smoking and other worthwhile efforts. But it is their right as corporate citizens to do so. 
I mention to my colleagues, Senator Hollings has remarks that he would like to make, and it is my understanding, after that, I say to Senator Faircloth, that we will propound a unanimous consent request which will make his amendment in order, with a motion to table at a time certain after that. That will be at the completion of Senator Hollings' remarks, so we can move forward with the amending process. 
I thank Senator Faircloth for his patience and good humor throughout this delay this morning. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Abraham for the fine job he has done in guiding S. 1723 through the legislative process. The American Competitiveness Act is an important step forward in ensuring that America's high-technology companies have the skilled personnel they need to compete both domestically and globally. 
There is one area that I regret we were not able to work out: the issue of the exploitation of visas, including H-1B visas, by foreign countries for training individuals in fields essential for the development of weapons of mass destruction. I attempted to negotiate language with the gentleman from Michigan that would ensure that countries like India, which recently detonated five nuclear weapons, would not be able to send individuals to work in the United States in a capacity that would enable them to return home with sensitive knowledge on developing nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Unfortunately, those negotiations ended without a satisfactory resolution, and I remain very concerned about this very serious problem. 
When those of us who are original cosponsors of the American Competitiveness Act chose to support this bill, we did not envision the most glaring and ominous violation of international norms to occur: the testing of multiple nuclear weapons by the government of India. The repercussions of that series of tests are serious indeed; India's relations with Pakistan and China have long been confrontational, with four wars occurring between it and its neighbors since it attained independence from Britain. This ill-timed, ill-considered decision to conduct nuclear tests, emanating as it did from the most infantile and dangerous of motives--the desire to be respected as a nuclear power--fully warranted the immediate implementation of sanctions against India. 
If there is a consensus about any aspect of U.S. national security policy since the end of the Cold War, it is the threat to international stability posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons. By running on a platform of elevating its `bomb in the basement' capability to one of overtly brandishing its capability to inflict widespread destruction, India's new government has undermined our ability to contain the arms race in one of the world's most inherently volatile regions. It is now imperative that the United States adopt every measure to ensure we do not inadvertently contribute to India's ability to further refine its nuclear weapons capabilities. For this reason, I had hoped to have an amendment adopted that would have addressed this concern. 
As a cosponsor of the American Competitiveness Act, I understand the requirements of U.S. industry for highly skilled workers. Raising the cap on H-1B visas will aid American companies in meeting that requirement. To the extent that India's military-industrial complex can benefit from sending technicians and scientists to the United States, however, the program can work against our own national security interests. My amendment would have helped to prevent that situation from coming about by prohibiting Indian nationals associated with its nuclear weapons program from attaining H-1B visas. 
I hope to work with the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee on the future to help the Congress attain a better understanding of any possible correlation between foreign technicians, engineers and scientists working in the United States and the problem of proliferation. In the meantime, I reiterate my strong support of S. 1723 and again thank the gentleman from Michigan for his hard and productive work on this legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. This is a difficult situation and not the first that we have been through in this process, nor regrettably, I feel, will it be the last. I have great sympathy for my two dear friends--one from Kentucky, one from South Carolina--who fought very hard for the people they represent. I also understand, and I think we all should, the position of the majority leader, who, despite the predictions of many, has been steadfast throughout as far as saying this bill would come to the floor and we would resolve it, if there was anything within his power to do it. 
It was my understanding I would be managing this bill with the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. I will make every effort to make sure that fairness is the order of the day, which has been the way we have conducted our relationship and our negotiations throughout this bill. I will do everything in my power. 
I understand very well how concerned the Senators from South Carolina and Kentucky are. I also understand that the majority leader has the right to do these things. We saw them when the other side of the aisle was in the majority. I saw it on several bills where modifications were put into bills which made it no longer a 60-vote proposition but 51-49. I didn't like that at the time. But it is perfectly correct in the parliamentary fashion. 
I would, again, like to echo the words of the majority leader. We are going to hear attacks. There are people waiting right now to attack this bill in the most vociferous and passionate fashion, and there are people on the other side who will say: You guys aren't tough enough on these tobacco companies; you have got to do more. The first amendment is going to smack them for a buck 50 instead of a buck ten. We will hear over here: This is the biggest tax increase in history; you are doing way too much. 
But I believe the great center will hold on this bill, and I believe that a fair procedure will follow. And I want to commit to my colleagues that will happen. I am sorry, I say to my friends from South Carolina and from Kentucky, this has been distressing to them, but I hope we can move forward in a fair and equitable fashion.

Mr. McCAIN. Thank you. Mr. President, the Senate will now take up the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act (S. 1415). Six weeks ago, the Senate Commerce Committee approved this measure by an overwhelming vote of 19-1. 
I want to thank the Majority Leader and Senator Daschle, and all Senators for allowing this bill to come to the floor. Thanks to the work of so many people including the medical community, especially Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler; the attorneys general, and so many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle over many years, Congress has a rare and historic opportunity to put an end to what the American Medical Association calls a `pediatric epidemic.' 
Mr. President tobacco is a legal product that adults may acquire if they choose to do so. Under this bill it will remain so. But the widespread use of tobacco in this country presents a problem every responsible adult would concede will not go away on its own. 
Three thousand American children take up the smoking habit every day. For one thousand of them the decision will prove to be fatal. Those children will be among the 460,000 Americans a year who die early--substantially early--from smoking related disease including cancer, emphysema, stroke and heart disease. Warnings about the lethal effect of tobacco have not discouraged juvenile smoking. Sadly, the Center for Disease Control reports that teen smoking is on the rise today. 
In recent years, we have learned how callously indifferent tobacco companies are to the loss and suffering their product causes. We have learned how tobacco companies will undermine any public good if it serves their commercial interests. We have learned that nothing, not even the health of children, is off limits to tobacco companies if it serves their bottom line. What profits the nation is a matter of no consequence to tobacco companies if it does not profit them. 
Mr. President, we have learned that the tobacco companies, well aware that kids make up the vast majority of their `replacement' market have, for years, intentionally and systematically targeted children in their marketing and advertising--kids as young as 13 years old, and even younger. 
The disclosure of truckloads of internal industry documents have exposed once and for all the appallingly malicious lie that tobacco executives have for years sworn, often under oath, to be true--that they do not market to children. 
They not only have marketed to children, they have thrived on it. And I am entirely confident that they will continue to do so unless we who are elected to protect the national interest, stand up, at long last, to the tobacco interests. That is what this legislation is intended to do. 
Studies show that children are particularly susceptible to the industry's marketing pitches. So effective have these companies been at appealing to youth, many children can identify Joe Camel as readily as they do Barney or cartoon characters. 
We have come to learn that as part of their strategy to hook kids early, at any cost, tobacco companies manipulated nicotine levels to enhance its addictive qualities; engaged in sham medical research; quashed information about the danger and addictiveness of tobacco; abused the nation's laws to cloak their activities and lied to Congress and the American people. 
Tobacco companies have long hoped that money, in the form of campaign contributions, would enable them to maintain the status quo, and insulate them from the consequences of their actions. For too long, I fear, they have been right. 
We are all too familiar with the influence of tobacco money. I appeal to my colleagues, now is the time to stop tobacco companies from buying political indulgence of their intentional sacrifice of our children to the imperatives of preserving a market for their product. 
It is illegal for children to purchase tobacco in every state in the country. And in every state in the country, tobacco companies have invested enormous sums of money and time to encourage widespread law breaking. 
Now is the time to put an end to it. And, Mr. President, now is also the time to stop the endless drain on taxpayers, which amounts to an annual tax of $50 billion imposed on taxpayers to underwrite tobacco related health care costs--an estimated $1.7 trillion over the life of this bill. 
Over the past 3 weeks, the tobacco companies have launched a massive campaign of diversion. Once again, they hope to use their vast resources to divert the country from the truth, and to frustrate us in our task to defend against the threat they pose to our children. As they have so often in the past, the tobacco companies are lying to all of us again, and using their wealth to frighten us all into submission. 
I would like to quote Dr. C. Everett Koop who said about this campaign.  
When you see the advertising from the tobacco industry consider the source. These people are experts at manipulation and have been lying to the American people for decades. 
Dr. Koop called on all Members of Congress to support tough tobacco legislation. Mr. President, the bill we are presenting to the Senate is indeed tough medicine, for a tough problem. Every expert medical witness who has testified before Congress, as well as every living Surgeon General has called on Congress to pass tough, comprehensive tobacco legislation. The measure we will now consider is exactly that--tough, comprehensive legislation. 
The bill is based on the framework of the June 20th settlement between the industry and the state attorneys general and contains the six major elements experts agree are essential if we are to stop kids from smoking. 
These include restrictions on marketing aimed at youth; stronger youth access prohibitions; deterrant price increases; regulatory oversight of tobacco ingredients; and counteradvertising campaigns to educate youth. 
I would like to address each of these in greater detail. First, like the June 20th settlement, the bill imposes advertising restrictions to eliminate marketing appeals to youth. The bill would implement the FDA rules banning tobacco billboard and outdoor advertising around schools, playgrounds and other areas frequented by children. 
It would restrict point-of-sale advertising to ensure that cigarette pitches aren't directed at children and would require bold new warning labels on cigarette packaging. 
Second, as contemplated in the June 20th agreement, the bill will raise cigarette prices sufficient to deter youth consumption. Experts say the most important step to deter youth consumption is a substantial hike in the price of tobacco products. I want to say that again, Mr. President. Experts say the most important step to deter youth consumption is a substantial hike in the price of tobacco products. 
The Centers for Disease Control reports that smoking less than 100 cigarettes can result in clinical addiction, and that higher pricing is essential to deter underage use. Accordingly, the bill would increase the price per pack of cigarettes by a 
minimum of $1.10 over five years with a commensurate rise in the price of smokeless tobacco. The administration believes that this hike, included in the President's budget request, would cut youth consumption in half. 
Three, the bill establishes the same youth smoking reduction targets agreed to by the industry last summer. Four and one-half million underage Americans use tobacco and the number is growing. The bill calls for a 60 percent reduction in youth consumption within 10 years and levies heavy financial assessments on the industry if they are not achieved. Tobacco companies have skillfully determined how to induce kids to smoke. With ample motivation they can apply those skills to help reverse their handiwork. 
Four, stronger enforcement of youth access rules. While smoking by minors is prohibited in every state, kids continue to buy tobacco. The bill would require retailers to be licensed by the state and card tobacco purchasers in the same manner as alcohol sales. And it requires that tobacco products be stored in areas inaccessible to youth. In addition, the bill would ban cigarette sales from vending machines, a major conduit of tobacco products to kids. all of these restrictions were part of last year's settlement. 
Five, cigarette ingredient regulation. Cigarettes contain numerous active ingredients harmful to health including nicotine, tar and ammonia. Evidence suggests that the tobacco industry has manipulated these ingredients to enhance their addictive qualities, and in some instances added benign substances such as molasses to sweeten the taste for introductory users, which is how the industry refers to children. 
The bill would permit the FDA to oversee and regulate tobacco products to protect public health, and promote the development of safer cigarettes. In rulemaking two years ago, FDA asserted authority over tobacco under its existing `drug device powers.' This bill, thanks to the Presiding Officer, Senator Frist--Dr. Frist establishes basically the same authorities, but in a separate and distinct chapter of law that addresses tobacco products only. 
The legislation, however, imposes several important checks on the FDA authority. Any ban on nicotine or class of tobacco product could not go into effect for two years, enabling Congress market potential of any modification to cigarettes that would push smokers to contraband. 
Again, the attorneys general, in their agreement with the industry called for greater FDA oversight of tobacco. 
Six, the bill provides funding for smoking prevention and cessation programs; counter-advertising campaigns, and vital health research. These initiatives are financed by annual payments made by the industry. 
Smoking related health care costs exceed $50 billion per year. The bill would require the industry to pay $526 billion over the next 25 years to reimburse taxpayers for costs to Medicare and state health care programs. Last summer's agreement called on the industry to pay $368.5 billion. This would have raised the price per pack of cigarettes by $68 cents over 5 years, an amount public health authorities found insufficient to effect youth usage. And the sums would not have been sufficient to pay for assistance to farmers, who were left out of last year's agreement by the industry. 
Finally, the bill would place a cap on the tobacco industry's yearly liability exposure without barring any individual or group's ability to sue or receive compensation. The tobacco industry has successfully fended off lawsuits for years. However, the trend is changing and as massive new judgments are awarded against the tobacco industry, bankruptcy is always a possibility. 
Experts agree that bankruptcy is an undesirable outcome for the nation economically, legally and medically. Involving bankruptcy would permit the industry to shield themselves from their financial responsibilities including compensation to victims. When the asbestos companies went bankrupt and left a financial and legal mess that is still with us, only the lawyers made out. Moreover, the extinction of domestic manufacturers would simply push tobacco users to foreign brands or unregulated contraband which would constitute a public health crisis. 
We have heard many opinions about whether the industry will submit to this legislation. Legal challenges, of course, would delay reforms, so industry cooperation would be advantageous. While, according to public health authorities, price hikes are essential, they, alone, won't do the job. The proposed advertising restrictions and youth usage penalties, which industry is threatening to challenge, are also essential parts of the solution. 
The National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act, however, was never intended to be a `deal' with the tobacco industry. Our mission was to pass the best possible legislation to stop children from smoking. 
As I said, tobacco is a legal product and the decision to use it, though risky, is a choice for adults to make. Nevertheless, the Nation requires that the tobacco industry join us in the fight to protect our children. If they choose not to, the American people will respond accordingly, Congress will act, and the States will resume their lawsuits to extract in court what we might more efficiently achieve through cooperation. 
Mr. President, we sent a modification to the bill to the desk in the form of a committee substitute. I would like to take a moment to explain how it would modify the bill as passed by the committee. 
First, the amendment addresses the concern expressed by some that the bill was too `bureaucratic.' Although the bulk of the panels and boards were temporary, advisory and entailed little or no additional federal costs, and the majority were contemplated in the June 20th Agreement, the Committee substitute eliminates all but three: an unpaid Scientific advisory board at FDA to help assess lower risk tobacco products; a part time board to help formulate counter-advertising strategies; and a three judge panel to assess attorney client privilege claims. 
Second, all receipts and disbursements under the act are routed through a single, on-budget, trust fund operated by the Secretary of the Treasury. The amendment eliminates, the role of special trustees; the international trust fund, the farmers trust fund as well as the asbestos trust funds and associated trustees. All funding under the act will come from the single Tobacco trust. 
Third, the amendment toughens enforcement against contraband smuggling by requiring that manufacturers and wholesalers be licensed; that records be kept for large transactions. These and other anti-smuggling measures were worked out with the administration. 
Four, the amendment drops certain provisions with respect to international marketing that had constitutional problems, or were violations of international law. Among the items dropped was the special licensing fee, the designated trust fund; prohibitions with respect to duty free shops, extra-territorial criminal provisions. 
Five, the amendment imposes tougher look-back assessments on the industry. The Committee reported bill capped look-back assessments at $3.5 billion per year. The amendment raises the ceiling to $4 billion, and establishes a company-specific penalty 
of $1,000 per underage user of a particular tobacco brand beyond the target level. 
Six, the amendment modifies the committee bill with respect to second hand smoke. Under the bill as reported, states were given the opportunity to opt out of the federal program. Under the amendment, negotiated with the White House, state can only opt out if they implement their own program that is as effective in protecting public health, based on the best available science. 
Seven, the amendment eliminates the asbestos trust fund. In its place the modification authorizes appropriations from the main fund to assist asbestos victims should Congress establish a program to do so. 
Eight, the amendment ensures that with certain deminimus exceptions, all tobacco companies, whether it choses to settle its state cases or not, are responsible for the annual payments to effect the $1.10 price increase. 
The requirement that non-participating manufacturers pay 150% of the annual payment has been dropped. Instead, manufacturers that wish to settle their state cases must pay the upfront payment they agreed to last year, and sign the state protocols binding them to the additional requirements they agreed to with the state attorneys general, including tougher advertising and marketing restrictions. In return for agreeing to the broader restrictions, and not to challenge their obligations under the protocols, participating companies would receive a yearly liability cap of $8 billion. 
In addition, the committee modification drops several civil liability provisions, including a requirement that civil actions be directed at the tobacco manufacturer not its parent company. 
Finally, the Committee modification sets out funding parameters for the trust fund. 
The Joint Committee on Tax anticipates receipts into the trust fund of nearly $65 billion over five years. Because the payments are volume adjusted, this number could rise or fall depending upon the volume of tobacco sales. 
For this reason, the amendment expresses annual funding in terms of percentage of yearly receipts and, except for state funding, places a dollar ceiling should receipt exceed expectations. Any amount above the ceiling would be transferred to the Medicare Trust funds. 
Under the modifications, the States would receive 40 percent of the yearly receipts; health research--22 percent; public health programs--22 percent; and farmer assistance--16 percent. 
The Office of Management and Budget estimates that under this prescription, States would receive a total of $26 billion over five years. In a modification agreed to by the National Governors Association, 50 percent of the state funds--regarded as the federal share of Medicaid recoupment--will be made available to the states for a menu of purposes, including safe and drug free schools, Child Care and Development Block Grants, substance abuse grants and others. As I said, this menu was agreed to by the National Governors Association. 
The other half of the State money would have no menu attached and would be used at the sole discretion of the State. 
Mr. President, I would like to briefly comment on the chief criticism of this bill launched by the industry--that it is all about tax and spend Government. 
The industry agreed last summer to pay $368 billion and to submit itself to almost every aspect of the legislation we are debating. The agreed to increase the price per pack of cigarettes to reduce youth consumption. They agreed to abide by advertising restrictions. They agreed to submit themselves to lookback assessments. They agreed to enhanced FDA authority over their products. They agreed to stiffer youth access rules and they agreed to open up their documents to the public. And they agreed to finance smoking prevention and cessation programs and health research. 
Are the measures tougher than they agreed to? Yes, without question. 
Now because the industry fears that the bill may actually achieve what it purports to, the effort has been transmuted from enlightened public policy to tax and spend Government. 
Let us be clear, those who vote against this measure because they believe it is tax will merely kill the ability to settle State suits collectively and efficiently so that we can move on to the job at hand--protecting the health of our kids. 
If this bill is killed, the States will merely resume their suits, at great cost in terms of money and time, and the outcome will be the same as it has been in Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota. If we take that unwise course, the ultimate prices in cigarettes will be little different from what might result from this bill, but we will pay an awful price in terms of the 3,000 children a day who will become regular users of tobacco and consign themselves to the consequences before they are adult enough to make that life or death decision. 
Mr. President, I asserted earlier that tobacco companies have long sought refuge in lies. They have lied about the effects of their product and about the strategies they use to market them. They are lying about the purposes and effect of the bill we are now considering. They have spared no expense to cover their purposes with lies. They have lied, no matter the cost to public health. They have sacrificed the truth and our children to their greed. They have lied, because lying has been profitable, Mr. President, because lying worked. No more. No more. The lying stops today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to transfer certain works, facilities, and titles of the Gila Project, and designated lands to the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District. This legislation will allow the Bureau of Reclamation to carry out a transfer under the terms and conditions of a cooperative agreement between the Bureau and the District. 
I am pleased that my colleague from Arizona, Senator Jon Kyl, has taken the lead in crafting this important proposal. It will enable the Bureau of Reclamation to divest its responsibility for the operation, maintenance, management, and regulation of Wellton-Mohawk. The Wellton-Mohawk project includes 375 miles of irrigation/drainage canals and laterals, and three major pumping plants, all of which support 63,000 acres of prime agricultural lands. This transfer will eliminate Federal government oversight of Wellton-Mohawk and will empower the District management to take over the title. 
Mr. President, the Wellton-Mohawk District is a major contributor to the economy of Yuma County, which is the most agriculturally developed county in Arizona. The farms in the region provide an estimated economic impact of three-quarters of a billion dollars every year. Conveyance of the project to the local management would help to sustain the economic viability of area agricultural interests. 
The cooperation by the administration and the district over the last few years, especially at the regional level, has spurred this privatization initiative. This legislation anticipates an aggressive time line for the Bureau of Reclamation and the District to lay out the terms and conditions of the conveyance under a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), During a hearing before the House Subcommittee on Water and Power Resources, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation called the Wellton-Mohawk project a `good candidate for transfer' and furthermore stated that the administration would endorse legislation that allows the District and the Secretary to negotiate the terms of a transfer pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement. 
Under the terms of the legislation, the parties will establish a process by which the fair market value of the transfer will be assessed. The Memorandum will also lay out a plan for an environmental impact analysis in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Secretary of the Inferior is expected to carry out the transfer if the terms are decided upon in the Memorandum of Agreement by a set date, However, the conveyance may not go forward if the appraisal or the NEPA process have not been completed. 
I want to make clear that this legislation is not a directed transfer, but simply implements the MOA as decided upon between the Administration and the District. If consensus cannot be reached in the form of an MOA, this legislation to privatize Wellton-Mohawk will have no effect and will not require the government to transfer total or otherwise divest itself of any assets. 
Mr. President, I laud the considerable efforts of the Wellton Mohawk District in forgoing this agreement. I look forward to working with Senator Kyl to see this initiative through to smooth and expedient completion.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Act, of which I am proud to be an original co-sponsor. Although it deals ostensibly with the visa cap on foreign-born high-tech workers, its effect would be far more profound--to enhance the competitiveness of the American economy at a time when U.S. companies, if given access to the necessary resources, are poised to dominate the Information Age for decades to come. As the representatives of the American people, we in Congress should do all we can to contribute to their potential for success in the global economy. 
Mr. President, I want to say a special thanks to the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham. Senator Abraham brought this issue to the attention of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle a long time ago. It is a critical issue. It is far more important than it appears on its surface. As I mentioned earlier when we discussed this bill upon the contemplation of it coming before the Senate, the high-tech community, the `silicon valleys' all over America, are saying that they need to have skilled workers if we are going to maintain the dominance of this industry and remain competitive throughout the world. 
The fact is that this piece of legislation is as important to our high-tech community as any that we will consider this year before the U.S. Senate. The taxing of the Internet is close. The issue of pornography on the Internet is close. But this issue of being able to have enough skilled workers to continue this incredible revolution going on in Silicon Valley, I believe, is of the utmost importance. The Senator from Michigan has led on this issue, and all of us are very grateful for his participation. 
I might add that he had to go through some very delicate negotiations with the other side of the aisle in order to bring this issue to its conclusion. 
I am convinced that the best thing government can do to advance the fortunes of the private sector is to stay out of its way. I support this bill because it makes progress toward that end while providing for the regulatory framework and new educational opportunities to protect and promote American workers. By raising the arbitrary cap on temporary immigrant visas for skilled foreign workers--a cap set in 1990, when the Democrats controlled Congress and the American economy was in recession--this legislation gets government out of the way of American companies, universities, and research labs which simply cannot hire the skilled professionals they need in the domestic labor market because of an arbitrary, anachronistic cap on H-1B visas that does not reflect the forces of supply and demand in the American economy today. 
Opponents of this legislation surely cannot believe that government knows better than business what's best for business in America. We cannot and should not condemn American companies for wishing to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Indeed, we should encourage the companies that employ our citizens, contribute to our tax base, and produce the goods and services we consume daily to retain the competitive edge that has sustained them by whatever means are available within the law. If we do not consent to raising the cap on H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, we will be handicapping the very American companies and their employees we profess to support as legislators empowered by the people to advance the public interest. 
Critics having charged that this legislation subordinates the public interest to the private interests of American companies engaged in a vast conspiracy to hoodwink Congress and the American people so that they may replace American professionals with skilled foreign workers content with below-market salaries and no benefits. 
Had these critics read our bill or spoken with those of us who support it, they would have had to devise new arguments against raising the H-1B cap by virtue of the emptiness of their own rhetoric. It is a fact that this legislation penalizes any employer which lays off an American worker in order to replace him with an H-1B visa holder and pays that individual anything less than the average prevailing wage in that line of work--a standard which often results in a higher salary than made by American entry-level workers. It is also a fact that the Department of Labor is empowered under the law to investigate and penalize willful abuse of the H-1B visa program and has done so repeatedly since the program began in 1990--a fact which disarms those militants who insist that there exist rampant fraud and abuse within the H-1B market. 
This is not a debate about the facts, which are unambiguous. This is a debate about the way in which American society responds to the new challenges and opportunities offered by economic globalization and a knowledge-based economy. We can row with the tide or against it, but we will not have an equal prospect for success. Allowing more skilled professionals to enter the U.S. job market to fill jobs Americans are not filling will enhance the dynamism of the American economy by allowing it to more efficiently produce the goods and services demanded by the American consumer and those who buy American exports overseas. 
Erecting barriers to the inflow of valuable human capital will not help American businesses, workers, or consumers. Businesses will suffer from the costs of a labor shortage which they are powerless to change in the short term. Workers will suffer when their companies lose the profits that would accrue from hiring the skilled workers that are unavailable. And consumers will pay higher prices for the goods and services which are available while going without those which are not. Everyone will lose as American companies shift production overseas to the sources of the specialized labor they cannot attract in the United States. 
Mr. President, the Information Technology Association of America estimates that there are more than 346,000 unfilled positions for highly-skilled workers in American companies today. 
A recent Department of Labor study estimates that the American economy will generate 1.3 million new jobs during each of the next ten years in the computer and information-technology industries. The same study predicts that American universities will be able to supply only a quarter of the graduates needed to fill those jobs during that period. The Hudson Institute predicts that in a few years this worker shortage, if not addressed, will cause a five percent drop in the growth rate of the gross domestic product, which breaks down to a startling $200 billion loss in national output. 
In the words of T.J. Rodgers, President and CEO of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, `It takes two percent of Americans to feed us all, and five percent to make everything we need. Everything else will be service and information technology, and in that world humans and brains will be the key variable. Any country that would limit its brain power to single select group from that country alone is going to self-destruct.' 
I support this bill because I do not wish to encourage more U.S. companies to set up shop in India, Pakistan, Costa Rica, and other sources of skilled labor unavailable in sufficient quantities in the United States. I support this bill because I do not think a job is better going unfilled that going to an educated foreign national on a temporary visa to the United States. I support this bill because I believe the Information Age will be built upon a globalized market for people and technology, not upon barriers to the free flow of goods, services, and professional workers. I support this bill because I do not believe the endless advertisements for specialized labor at attractive salaries in the Employment section of the Sunday newspaper represent a conspiracy by Big Business to fool us all into thinking there really are jobs on offer in many of America's fastest-growing companies. I support this bill because I do not think the government is a better judge of the needs of American companies, universities, and laboratories than are the very companies, universities, and laboratories that have urged us to write this legislation. 
Mr. President, I, for one, do not take the health of the American economy or the fabulous returns offered by Wall Street for granted. America prospers when we allow entrepreneurs, small businesses, companies, universities, and research labs to create wealth and knowledge. Government does not cause economic growth; hard-working people do. It is appalling to think that we would stand in the way of those who would temporarily come to our country to add their value to the economy by working in jobs Americans cannot and do not fill. 
Over the long term, we must see to it that American workers possess the skills and know-how to fill the jobs created by American high-tech firms. For this reason, our legislation provides for 20,000 new college scholarships annually for low-income students in math, engineering, and computer science through the State Student Incentive Grant program. Our bill also sunsets the higher H-1B visa cap after five years so we can determine whether an increased supply of foreign professionals remains necessary to our economic well-being. 
American unemployment levels stand at their lowest levels in over two decades. Americans are not responding to the `Wanted' ads in their local newspapers for high-tech and other skilled positions at U.S. companies, universities, and research centers. Company recruiters are hounding college students--on campus, in the libraries, even at the beach during Spring Break--to sign on to lucrative contracts with American firms. 
Mr. President, we simply cannot afford to allow this desperate trend to continue. The 65,000-person cap on H-1B workers for Fiscal Year 1998 was reached last week. American companies cannot meet their hiring needs until the new Fiscal Year begins on October 1 unless Congress acts now. Should we fail to do so, we will all pay the price imposed by our shortsightedness. The Information Age and the global marketplace are a reality which we neglect at our peril when we refuse to provide the regulatory framework within which the American economy can thrive and Americans can prosper. The American Competitiveness Act deserves our support. 
Mr. President, in addition, this is the last of several bills that we call high-tech bills. I think it is the most important one. I hope that we in the Senate recognize that we need to enact further legislation to help high-tech industries in America. 
What has happened is remarkable. What has happened is fragile. And what has happened deserves our attention and support as we provide an enormous growth in opportunity, growth in the way of economy and opportunity to provide knowledge to all Americans and all citizens of the world in the most unprecedented fashion; in fact, the most remarkable changes taking place in the world since the industrial revolution. 
I appreciate the cognizance by the Senator from Michigan of this fact and his responsibility for this important legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment will give the Secretary of Defense authority to compensate our men and women in uniform that are serving in remote areas, in very difficult situations. Specifically, this amendment amends hardship duty location pay and allows the Secretary of Defense to designate certain `duties' as a hardship rather than limiting the pay to hardship duty `locations' only. This will allow for designation of certain missions like Joint Task Force Full Accounting (JTF-FA), the POW/MIA search teams, and the Central Identification Lab (CILHI) to be designated for receipt of the hardship duty pay. These teams are exposed to the most arduous conditions while deployed to remote, isolated areas of Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, North Korea and China to conduct excavations of crash sites and identification of remains of U.S. servicemembers. 
This amendment also allows the Secretary to recognize members serving in high operation tempo missions and eliminates the restriction on members receiving sea pay and hardship duty pay simultaneously. This would allow naval members who are serving in high operations tempo units to receive the added benefit. The hardship duty pay limit of $300 per month would not be changed. 
I commend my friends of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) for bringing this to my attention. Their concern for the state of the military and those that serve is unsurpassed. During a recent trip to Southeast Asia, the VFW learned that personnel deployed under the command of JTF-FA are not authorized and do not receive imminent danger pay when deployed on Joint Field Activity operations in Laos and Vietnam. They reported their concerns to me because many of the crash sites were in extremely difficult terrain, littered by unexploded munitions. 
At one Joint Field Activity excavation site that they visited in western Laos, the area in which the team was conducting excavations was littered with unexploded BLU-26 cluster bomb units. Another crash site excavation was located next to sidewinder missiles. In addition, the teams are exposed to resistant strains of malaria, dengue fever, and other diseases while they are deployed in these isolated and remote areas. Furthermore, most of these sites are far removed from any modern medical facility. 
Mr. President, I feel it not only the right thing to do, but that it will help the services to adequately compensate our men and women in uniform so as to entice these young Americans to stay in the service and to consider a career in the military. For the difficult and dangerous duties that they do, they deserve no less.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the S.1046, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1998. This amendment authorizes the National Science Foundation for a period of three fiscal years, 1998, 1999 and 2000. 
I am very pleased to see that this amendment represents a bi-partisan effort by both the Commerce and the Labor Committees. These two Committees share jurisdiction of the National Science Foundation. I would also like to thank the co-sponsors of this amendment, Senators Jeffords, Hollings, Kennedy, Frist and Rockefeller, for their support of this amendment. 
The National Science Foundation (NSF) plays a critical role in the development of much of this country's science and technology infrastructure. Its efforts cover a variety of issues such as education--from the kindergarten to the post-doctorate levels--research and development, and Internet development. 
Given that half of the new economic growth in the economy is due to technological advancements, the role of the National Science Foundation in basic research is an important one. Many companies in the private sector have indicated that they cannot afford to conduct the long term basic research required for many of these technological advances. They have come to rely upon the basic research of the National Science Foundation and other government agencies as the basis for many of their commercial products. For it is through the commercialization process of these research results that the government and the American public benefits. From this process, new industries are started, jobs are created, and many new products are generated to improve our quality of life of all people. 
Because of the research at the National Science Foundation, we have the Internet today. The growth of the Internet and the role it is playing in electronic commerce today is far beyond anyone's expectations when the project was started. We look forward to the National Science Foundation's involvement in the Next Generation Internet project. 
In a time when we are hearing of the terrible performance of America's students in math and science education, it is important that we do our jobs as members of the Senate and authorize agencies' such as the National Science Foundation to ensure that the federal government is doing its share to improve upon the lives of all Americans through education and other related research activities. 
I urge the other members of the Senate to support this amendment and the final passage of the bill. Again, I would like to thank the co-sponsors of this amendment for their support and hard work.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to vote for this conference agreement. 
For the most part, the bill provides funding to address legitimate needs of farmers and the agriculture industry for crop insurance, research, and extension and education programs. I applaud the conferees for including provisions throughout the bill which establish competitive, merit-based, or peer-reviewed selection procedures for awarding grants and contracts and allocating funds for various programs. 
The bill also requires most recipients of funds to contribute matching amounts from non-federal sources. It also broadens the scope of many established programs to require a national, regional, or multi-state focus or benefit. 
While the bill contains language regarding the establishment or continuation of several specific programs, it does not require the Secretary of Agriculture to comply with the direction in the bill, in most cases. For example, the bill authorizes, but does not require, the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire and operate the National Swine Research Center in Ames, Iowa--an institution which has received earmarked funds in appropriations bills for as long as I can remember. I would hope that the Secretary would exercise the discretion provided in this bill and resist the temptation to expand the federal bureaucracy to include this wholly unnecessary swine research facility. 
Let me also take a moment to express my support for the provisions in Title V of the bill that make food stamps available to certain categories of legal immigrants who may fall on hard times. These provisions simply restore eligibility for food stamps to certain categories of immigrants who were eligible for assistance prior to August 22, 1996, when sweeping welfare reform legislation was enacted. Only refugees and asylees, disabled and elderly immigrants, children of legal immigrants, certain Indians, and certain Hmong and Highland Laotians, all of whom had to be lawfully residing in the United States on August 22, 1996, are again eligible for food stamps. 
In these times of economic prosperity, Americans can certainly afford to be compassionate to our most vulnerable immigrants. Last year, the Congress restored to these same categories of immigrants eligibility for Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid. Finally, it should be noted that the cost of providing assistance to an estimated 250,000 individuals is offset in its entirety by reductions in the administrative expenses of the food stamp program and other programs. 
Again, I thank the conferees for including these many excellent provisions in this bill. 
However, as usual, there are a number of glaring exceptions to the otherwise good-government approach taken by the conferees. 
Mr. President, most disturbing among the objectionable provisions in this bill is Section 401, which establishes a new entitlement program, called the Initiative for Future Agricultural and Food Systems, which is funded at $120 million per year for five years. Although the grants under this new program will be competitively awarded and recipients must provide matching funds, I am concerned that the conferees would find it advisable to establish a brand new mandatory spending program without regard to its effect on other high-priority agriculture programs. 
Clearly, this new entitlement is intended to bypass the spending caps that limit how much is spent on agriculture program grants in the annual appropriations process. It violates the spirit and intent of the budget process that has resulted, finally, in a projected federal budget surplus for this year. 
Mr. President, I intend to take a very careful look at the appropriations bill for agriculture programs this year. If, as in previous years, another $100 million or more is allocated for the same programs that are to be funded under this new entitlement program, I will be offering an amendment to remove that duplicative funding from the appropriations bill. I hope to have my colleagues' support to prevent this effort to circumvent the budget prioritization process and essentially double the funding for these types of programs. 
Other objectionable provisions in the bill establish new bureaucracies and boards to coordinate activities which should be within the capabilities of the existing Department of Agriculture bureaucracy. One such provision establishes a Thomas Jefferson Initiative for Crop Diversification, a program coordinated by a nonprofit center to coordinate cooperative research by public and private entities on new and non-traditional crops. Another is the provision authorizing a grant program for precision agriculture programs and establishing precision agriculture partnerships. Other provisions include the establishment of an Office of Pest Management Policy and a Food Safety Research Information Office, and a mandate to continue the operation of the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Database program. 
Funding for these new programs is subject to future appropriations and participants are required to provide non-federal matching funds. However, the parameters and criteria specified in the bill will require new regulations and bureaucracies for implementation. These efforts have both monetary costs and potentially negative effects on other agriculture priorities.

Mr. McCAIN. Because of the inclusion of these low priority, unnecessary, and wasteful programs, I voted in favor of Senator Gramm's motion to recommit the bill to conference so that these provisions could be addressed again and, hopefully, deleted from the bill or revised to prevent the waste of taxpayer dollars. 
Unfortunately, the motion to recommit was defeated by a wide margin. However, since I believe the many positive aspects of this bill outweigh these onerous provisions, I intend to support the conference agreement.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of a series of bills dealing with critical issues raised by the transformation and rapid growth of the telecommunications industry. 
This transformation in telecommunications is being driven by constant changes in telecommunications technology. The small mass media universe of fifty years ago, occupied by a few large AM radio stations, has given way to an electronic marketplace teeming with alternative sources of information and entertainment. FM radio, TV, cable and satellite television, and the Internet have become sometimes competing, and sometimes complementary, mass media outlets. In the world of telecommunications, the days of Ma Bell were numbered by the advent of microwave radio and satellite technology. First there was competition for long-distance service; then wireless services appeared and exploded. Cellular radio, paging, and now personal communications services--all are now an indispensable part of everyday American life. 
For those of you old enough to remember back twenty years--and I think the Presiding Officer can do that--think of how different your life is today than it was then. Most of these changes were due to the growth of telecommunications. For those of you too young to remember that far back, I can assure you that twenty years from now, you will look back on today and marvel at the changes you will have seen. 
Today the driving force in telecommunications is digital technology. Digital technology has not only made some of today's new services possible--it is also causing formerly different services to converge, and it is promising Americans new and exciting services in the future. The convergence of your television and your computer is on the horizon. So also is a telephone that can simultaneously translate conversations held in different languages. 
We need no longer talk about the Information Age in the future tense. It's here and now, and it's reshaping our world. 
As telecommunications technology changes the way we live, our laws must change to keep pace. The growth of competition in the long-distance industry now gives consumers over 500 companies to choose from. Because of that competition, the consumer is better off. But the growth in long-distance competition has also given rise to cut-throat marketing practices. 
The first bill we will consider and debate today is S. 1618, the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998. It is offered by myself and my good friend and distinguished colleague Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, the distinguished Ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee. Joining us as cosponsors are the distinguished Majority Leader, Senator Lott, and Senators Frist, Bryan, Johnson, Kerry, Abraham, Shelby, Snowe, Feingold, and Bob Smith. 
The Consumer Anti-Slamming Act is designed to put a stop, once and for all, to inexcusable marketing tactics that lead to a consumers' long-distance telephone company being switched without consent. Right now two consumers are `slammed' every minute of every day, which makes slamming far and away the most pervasive consumer problem in telecommunications today. 
We will then shift our focus to Internet-related issues. The information technology industry is estimated to account for one-third of our real economic growth. Currently, electronic commerce is in the neighborhood of several billion dollars per year, but that figure is expected to skyrocket into hundreds of billions in only a few years more. 
The growth and continued expansion of the information technology industry has vastly increased the need for highly-skilled individuals to work in this industry. We need these workers, and their skills, to retain our nation's leadership in Information Age technology. Unfortunately, however, our country isn't producing them in the numbers needed. Therefore, temporary solutions must be found to enable our high-tech industries to remain competitive, while we address problems in the educational system that have led to our inability to produce the needed workforce in this country.

Mr. McCAIN. The AARP writes: 
The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) commends you for introducing S. 1618, a bill to improve the protection of consumers against the unauthorized switching of long distance telephone service providers. According to the FCC, this practice, known as `slamming' is the fastest growing consumer complaint in telecommunications. We believe that the provisions in your bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to curtail `slamming' are good for consumers. * * * * * 
AARP believes that, as competition develops throughout the telecommunications industry, all telephone carriers should be subject to provisions similar to these. We also believe that the issues attendant the practice of `cramming' need to be addressed in the near future. We look forward to working with you toward that goal. In the meantime, the provisions of this bill move consumer protections in the right direction. The Association stands ready to work with you as you seek final passage of this important piece of legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr President, this amendment defines `subscriber' in a way that allows the person named on the billing statement or account, or those authorized by such a person, to consent to carrier changes. 
It clarifies that the time period the FCC prescribes for a carrier to resolve a slamming complaint, which is not to exceed 120 days, applies when a carrier receives notice directly from the subscriber of the complaint. 
It makes clear that if a carrier does not resolve a complaint within the period prescribed by the Commission, it must notify the subscriber in writing of the subscriber's rights and remedies only under Section 258 of the Communications Act, not under any other law. 
It clarifies that the FCC may dispose of a slamming complaint within the 150-day period established in the bill by issuing a `decision or ruling.' The FCC will not be required to issue a formal `order' each time it resolves a complaint. It also clarifies that the 150-day period in the bill is intended to be used by the FCC to determine if slamming has occurred, and if slamming has occurred, the FCC has another 90 days, if such additional time is necessary, to determine what damages and penalties should be assessed. 
In discussing the amount of damages that may be awarded by the FCC, the original bill referred to the FCC as `resolving a complaint.' This change removes that language and the implication that `resolving a complaint' requires a finding of a violation of the slamming rules. It states that the FCC may award damages only if slamming has occurred. 
It allows state Attorneys General to bring an action for each alleged slamming violation to enjoin unauthorized changes and to recover damages, to bring an action to seek criminal sanctions for willful violations, and to bring an action to seek a penalty of not less than $40,000 for the first slamming offense and not less than $150,000 for each subsequent offense. A court may reduce the amount of these penalties if it determines that there are mitigating circumstances involved. The district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all of these actions. 
It clarifies that states are not preempted from imposing more restrictive requirements, regulations, damages, and penalties on unauthorized changes in a subscriber's telephone exchange service or telephone toll service provider than are imposed under Section 258 of the Communication Act, as amended by this bill. 
It clarifies that when the FCC is resolving slamming complaints, it is not instituting a `civil action.' In addition, while a particular slamming compliant involving a particular carrier is pending before the FCC, no state may institute a civil action against the same carrier for the same alleged violation. 
It allows the FCC to use the fact of a carrier's nonpayment of a forfeiture for a slamming or billing violation as a basis for revoking, denying or limiting that carrier's operating authority. 
It imposes duties on all billing agents, both those that are telecommunications carriers that render bills to consumers and those that operate as billing clearinghouses for carriers. It requires any billing agent that issues telephone bills to follow a certain format for the bill. The bill must list telecommunications services separately from other services and must identify the names of each provider and the services they have provided. Billing agents also must provide information to enable a consumer to contact a service provider about a billing dispute. This provision also prohibits billing agents from submitting charges for a consumer's bill if they know or should know that the consumer did not authorize such charges or if the charges are otherwise improper. 
It given the Commission jurisdiction over billing agents that are not telecommunications carriers but provide billing services for such carriers or for other companies whose charges appear on telephone bills. 
It instructs the FCC to include in the report required by Section 6 of the bill an examination of telemarketing and other solicitation practices, such as contests and sweepstakes, used by carriers to obtain carrier changes. The FCC also is required to study whether a third party should verify carrier changes and whether an independent third party should administer carrier changes. This provision will address concerns about the possibility of anti-competitive behavior by the local phone companies once they start to provide long-distance service. Enforcement of slamming rules will remain the responsibility of the FCC.

Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 1 minute. 
Senator Hollings and I incorporated an amendment in the managers' amendment on behalf of Senator Snowe. 
This amendment prevents the FCC from taking any actions that would jeopardize the current ability of consumers to `freeze' their long-distance carrier in place. Once the consumer elects to use a freeze, the long-distance carrier of choice can only be changed by the express authorization of the consumer to the local phone company. 
Long-distance carriers are concerned about how this amendment might affect their marketing efforts. But reports now show that two consumers are slammed every minute. Given the severity of the slamming problem, the interest we have in preserving safeguards that will project consumers against any 
unauthorized carrier changes certainly overrides any concerns the industry may have about their marketing efforts. 
I thank Senator Snowe for her amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. McCain. I appreciate the questions of the Senator from Maine, and believe it is important that the intent of this legislation be fully understood. This bill is designed to ensure that companies are deterred from the reprehensible practice of slamming, and that harsh penalties are imposed as a form of punishment if the practice is undertaken by an unscrupulous company. However, the penalties in this bill are not intended to be used for cases of innocent or accidental changes of carriers, such as the situation described by my colleague, Senator Snowe--and the language of this bill has been crafted accordingly. Specifically, the bill provides that the Commission can waive the minimum penalties if they determine that there are mitigating circumstances, which would include cases of innocent or accidental changes of carriers.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I must respectfully oppose the amendment offered by my good friend and colleague, Senator Rockefeller. 
Let me explain why I am opposed. I take no issue with the Senator's commitment to the principles of universal telephone service. And I most certainly take no issue with the principle that consumers have a right to clear and correct information about material adjustments to their bills. I also believe that companies have an absolute right to inform consumers about increases to their bills that companies have made in response to federal and nonfederal requirements. 
But, with all due respect, that's not what's really at issue here. 
Mr. President, what's really at issue here is an attempt to rationalize the rate adjustments imposed by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Unlike Senator Rockefeller, I didn't vote for that act, in part because I thought it would produce precisely the result it is producing--little competition, lots of consolidation, and lots of bill adjustments--mostly increases. 
If my colleague's amendment wants to give consumers facts, let's talk about those facts. The telephone industry is built on a very complex system of implicit internal subsidies. Making them explicit, while at the same time adjusting them for the advent of competition, makes adjustments in consumer bills inevitable. Now add these further facts: the Telecom Act creates a whole new multibillion-dollar subsidy, and it requires local telephone companies and interexchange companies to expend billions of dollars to implement the Act's supposedly pro-competitive provisions. 
So here are the bottom-line facts. First of all, given this hideously convoluted situation, complete `truthful' disclosure of all the adjustments inherent in a consumer's monthly phone bill would add pages and pages to a bill without necessarily doing much to enlighten the consumer. For example, if a requirement like this were currently in effect, a consumer might today be reading something like this:  
Your long-distance bill might have been lower if your long-distance carrier's reduction in access charge payments to your local carrier had been reflected in your long-distance bill instead of being used to help pay for the schools' and libraries' wiring subsidy. Then again, of course, the FCC, your long-distance carrier, and your local carrier disagree on whether your long-distance carrier is really lowering your bills as much as it might, and maybe someday we'll know the answer--or maybe not. In the meantime, you're being assessed a per-subscriber line charge which may or may not reflect the real cost of your service, but the FCC's working on it. Of course, if you live in the suburbs you should also know that a portion of your bill goes to subsidize rural areas and another portion subsidizes low-income subscribers. And be aware that starting next year there's going to be another substantial increase in some local phone bills as local phone companies start passing along the costs of implementing local number portability, which may or may not accurately reflect all their true costs, which will otherwise be recovered by * * *. 
And on and on and on. 
I would also note that the Senator's bill would require the FCC to examine the bills of all telecommunications carriers. This would not only require the FCC to investigate the bills of the over 500 long-distance telephone companies that currently exist; it would also require them to investigate the bills rendered by the thousands upon thousands of wireless paging, cellular telephone, and PCS companies too. This would require an enormous expansion of the current FCC bureaucracy. 
Mr. President, you get the picture: given the complexities of pricing offsets in changing telephone industry economics, this attempt at so-called truthful disclosure won't work. It will only confuse the consumer to no useful purpose and wind up involving the FCC and the FTC in neverending regulatory micromanagement in an effort to ascertain the unascertainable. 
If those who voted for the 1996 Telecom Act are now concerned that the act is unexpectedly driving prices upward, the way to solve the problem is to change the Act--not to present attempted excuses in the form of confusing additions to consumers' bills. 
Having said why it's unrealistic to try and explain every single thing that has an impact on every single consumer telecom bill, I emphatically endorse the proposition that consumers have a right to be told why their bills have gone up--especially when an increase is results from a federal or State levy. I would like to offer my own amendment to assure consumers have access to that information.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I had intended to propound a unanimous consent agreement concerning S. 1723, the skilled workers immigration bill, which Senator Abraham has worked on for at least a year and a half that I know of, and worked very hard. There are still some objections. I do not think those objections are major on the other side of the aisle. And since those objections would be voiced, I will not propound that unanimous consent request at this time. 
I hope we can work with the other side of the aisle so that there can be an agreement on relevant amendments and we can move forward on this issue. It is a very, very important issue, as Senator Abraham pointed out earlier today. We have now reached our quota of H-1B workers for the year. Our high-tech industries need workers. And this modest proposal, although an important one, would simply raise that limit by at least enough to get these high-tech industries through this year. 
I understand the concerns on the other side of the aisle about this bill, and yet I believe that we could address those through the amending process. So it would be our intention tomorrow to try and work out any concerns there might be and move forward tomorrow with the legislation. 
Mr. President, as soon as the staff is ready, it will be my intention to move to adjourn. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I intend to, on behalf of the majority leader, propound a unanimous consent request. I understand that at this time the Democratic leader may have to oppose this unanimous consent request. But I also believe that given the next couple of hours perhaps we can get some agreement. Both Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, I understand, are in discussion. But I think we ought to move forward as we told the Senate we would and at least start discussions of these bills. 
So, therefore, understanding that we have some optimism about a unanimous consent agreement within the next couple of hours, I will propound the unanimous consent request. I understand Senator Dorgan, the Senator from North Dakota, will object. 
Madam President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, may proceed to the consideration of S. 1618. 
I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form. I further ask that the only amendment in order other than the committee amendments be a managers' amendment. 
I finally ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above amendments the bill be read a third time and the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage of S. 1618 with no intervening action or debate. 
Madam President, that is the antislamming bill, on which, as we know, there have been numerous hearings and discussion and debate not only within the Senate but in the entire country. 
Additionally, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, may proceed to the consideration of S. 1723. I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form. I further ask that no amendment be in order other than the committee-reported substitute amendment. 
I finally ask unanimous consent that following disposition of the above amendment, the bill be read a third time and the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage of S. 1723 with no intervening action or debate. That, Madam President, is the skilled workers immigration bill that is sponsored by Senator Abraham. 
I also ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, may proceed to the consideration of S. 1260. I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form. I further ask that no amendments be in order other than the committee-reported substitute amendment. 
I finally ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above amendment, the bill be read a third time and the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage of S. 1260 with no intervening action or debate. That bill is the Uniform Standards Act. 
Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, may proceed to the consideration of S. 2037. I further ask consent there be a total of 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form, with an additional 15 minutes under the control of Senator Ashcroft. I further ask that no amendment be in order to the bill. 
I finally ask unanimous consent that following the expiration or yielding back of the time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on the passage of S. 2037 with no intervening action or debate. 
Madam President, that is the so-called WIPO copyright legislation from Senator Hatch, reported out of the Judiciary Committee. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to quote from the Department of Commerce: 
During the past few years, the U.S. economy has performed beyond most expectations. A shrinking budget deficit, low interest rates, a stable macroeconomic environment, expanding international trade with fewer barriers, and effective private sector management are all credited with playing a role in this healthy economic performance. Many observers believe that advances in information technology driven by the growth of the Internet have also contributed to creating this healthier than expected economy. 
In recent testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan noted: 
`Our Nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of productivity--output per hour worked--in recent years. The dramatic improvements in computing power and communication and information technology appear to have been a major force behind this beneficial trend.' 
Madam President, we all pay close attention to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, and usually, especially in this case, we agree. 
Some have even suggested that these advances will create a long boom which will take the economy to new heights over the next quarter century. 
While the full impact of information technology cannot yet be precisely evaluated, its impact is significant. Information technology industries have been growing at more than double the rate of the overall economy, a trend that is likely to continue. Investments in information technology now represent over 45 percent of all business equipment investment. Declining prices for information technology products have lowered overall inflation. 
Because the Internet is new and its uses are developing very rapidly, reliable economy-wide statistics are hard to find and further research is needed. Therefore, we have to use industry and company examples to illustrate the rapid pace at which Internet commerce is being deployed and benefits are being realized. Examples showing the growth of the Internet in electronic commerce this past year are numerous. 
Fewer than 40 million people around the world were connected to the Internet during 1996. By the end of 1997, more than 100 million people were using the Internet. As of December 1996, about 627,000 Internet domain names had been registered. By the end of 1997, the number of domain names more than doubled to reach 1.5 million. 
Traffic on the Internet has been doubling every 100 days. 
Madam President, I feel compelled to repeat that. 
Traffic on the Internet has been doubling every 100 days. 
Cisco Systems closed 1996 having booked just over $100 million in sales on the Internet. By the end of 1997, its Internet sales were running at a $3.2 billion annual rate. 
In 1996, Amazon.com, the first Internet bookstore, recorded sales of less than $16 million. In 1997, it sold $148 million worth of books to Internet customers. 
One of the Nation's largest book retailers, Barnes & Noble, launched its own on-line bookstore in 1997 to compete with Amazon for this rapidly growing on-line market. 
In January 1997, Dell Computers was selling less than $1 million of computers per day on the Internet. The company reported reaching daily sales of $6 million several times during the December 1997 holiday period. 
Auto-by-Tel, a web-based automotive marketplace, processed a total of 345,000 purchase requests for autos through its web site in 1996 for $1.8 billion in auto sales. As of the end of November 1997, the web site was generating $500 million a month in auto sales, which is $6 billion annualized, and processed over 100,000 purchase requests each month. 
Madam President, that is just a few examples of the way this industry is exploding into American life and through all parts of it. How it is changing America is dramatic and, frankly, there are very few of us who know exactly what the end results are going to be. And there are differing opinions among different experts as to what these impacts are going to be, but there is one area of agreement, and that is it has changed American commerce and perhaps the world's commerce and flow of information in a way that will fundamentally change a lot of the precepts under which we have operated since the Industrial Revolution.  
If the trend suggested by this preliminary analysis continues, it, and electronic commerce, can be expected to drive economic growth for many years to come. To realize this potential, however, the private sector and governments must work together to create a predictable, market-driven legal framework to facilitate electronic commerce, to create nonbureaucratic means that ensure that the Internet is a safe environment, and to create human resource policies that endow students and workers with the skills necessary for jobs in the new digital economy. 
Thus, in real terms, the expansion of the IT sector accounts for an even larger share of overall economic growth in the mid- to late 1990s. In recent years, IT industries have been responsible for more than one-quarter of real economic growth. 
Despite these impressive trends, the digital revolution is just beginning. Growth could accelerate in the coming years not only in the IT sector itself, but across all sectors of the economy as the number of people connected to the Internet multiplies and as its commercial use grows. The growth will be driven by four types of economic activity: 
Building out the Internet: In 1994, three million people, most of them in the United States, used the Internet. In 1998, 100 million people around the world use the Internet. Some experts believe that one billion people may be connected to the Internet by 2005. This expansion is driving dramatic increases in computer, software, services and communications investments. 
Electronic commerce among businesses: Businesses began using the Internet for commercial transactions with their business partners about two years ago. Early users already report significant productivity improvements from using electronic networks to create, buy, distribute, sell, and service products and services. By 2002, the Internet may be used for more than $300 billion worth of commerce between businesses. 
Digital delivery of goods and services: Software programs, newspapers, and music CDs no longer need to be packaged and delivered to stores, homes or news kiosks. They can be delivered electronically over the Internet. Airline tickets and securities transactions over the Internet already occur in large numbers. Other industries such as consulting services, entertainment, banking and insurance, education and health care face some hurdles but are also beginning to use the Internet to change the way they do business. Over time, the sale and transmission of goods and services electronically is likely to be the largest and most visible driver of the new digital economy. 
Retail sale of tangible goods: The Internet can also be used to order tangible goods and services that are produced, stored and physically delivered. Though Internet sales are less than 1 percent of total retail sales today, sales of certain products such as computers, software, cars, books and flowers are growing rapidly. 
Where advances in telecommunications and computing largely occurred side-by-side in the past, today, they converge in the Internet. Soon, virtually all information technology investment will be part of interlinked communications system, whether internal to a business, between businesses, between individuals and businesses, or individual to individual. 
However measured, the Internet is expanding at a very rapid pace. 
For instance, the number of Americans using the Internet has grown from fewer than 5 million in 1993 to as many as 62 million by 1997. . . . 
The number of names registered in the domain name system grew from 26,000 in July 1993 to 1.3 million in four years . . . 
In January 1995, just over 27,000 top-level commercial (com) domain names were assigned. Most businesses used them for little more than posting product and company descriptions, store locations, annual reports and information about how to contact corporate headquarters. Two and a half years later, commercial domain names number 764,000. Static brochures and bulletin boards are giving way to full-fledged businesses offering financial services, news and information, manufactured goods, and travel and entertainment to individuals and businesses. 
To meet this increased demand, consumer electronics companies, media giants, phone companies, computer companies, software firms, satellite builders, cell phone businesses, Internet service providers, televisions cable companies and, in a few cases, electric utilities, are aggressively investing to build out the Internet. 
Madam President, I made the opening statement as we take up, frankly, what are some very modest bills, pieces of legislation which have to do with the telecommunications industry. I hope this is a beginning. My fundamental premise is, we should get out of the way and stay out of the way of this burgeoning, incredible revolution we are seeing take place throughout the world. 
But there are times where we have to act. I would argue that we have to act in a deregulatory manner and a procompetitive manner. One of the issues that the Senator from North Dakota and I have discussed on many occasions and will continue to discuss--and hopefully we can reach some agreement--is the issue of Internet taxation. Other issues that we are going to take up, which are visible and very important to many Americans, like this business of slamming, will have to be addressed. 
Madam President, the Presiding Officer now in the chair, you have been very significantly involved in this issue. Your findings and recommendations have been made part of this bill. I understand you may have additional changes that you wish to be made. But we are in agreement this abuse has to stop, and it has to stop immediately. 
I hope the Congress, as representatives of the people, will understand that this industry we are talking about today, the telecommunications industry, opens broad new vistas for our children and grandchildren. It also opens vistas for people and countries who have never had access to information and knowledge before. It opens up new vistas and ways for people in rural parts of America, and in low-income parts of urban America, to receive information and knowledge. It seems to me that it has to be one of the most important issues that we address in a comprehensive, cooperative, bipartisan fashion. 
I see no reason for partisanship on an issue which really is so important to the future of America. I know we are in agreement that we want to see it grow and expand. And all of us are astonished, literally astonished, at the amount of growth that we have seen. It is not just us neophytes. Literally every expert who has studied the telecommunications industry has underestimated, sometimes by a factor of 10, the growth that has taken place in the past few years. So, therefore, it is very likely they are underestimating the dramatic changes and growth that we will see in the future. 
There are some who argue that the information technology we are exporting around the world makes our trade deficit far less meaningful than it has been in the past. There are some who argue that we, as a body, and as a nation, are going to have to address this issue of the proliferation of pornography that now penetrates and permeates every part of the Internet, to the point where young children today, when they go on the Internet and dial an innocuous word like `White House' or `teen' or `nurse,' are treated, as the search engine comes upon them, to enticements to people to take advantage of the pornography which is available. I am not advocating censorship here. I don't believe the majority of this body is. But it is a problem. It is an issue that we need to address as well. But it is one of many. 
I could spend many hours on the floor here, discussing the challenges of this telecommunications transformation that we are observing. I hope what we do in the next couple of days will do several things. One is to address these relatively modest issues, although slamming is certainly a very important one, but, at the same time, make a commitment that we, as a body, understand, appreciate, the importance of this industry to the future of America, and that we will address these issues in an orderly and bipartisan fashion. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation. Again, I thank the chairman and other members of the Finance Committee for their work in crafting this measure. 
The vast majority of Americans comply with our country's tax laws. In the same vein, most IRS workers do their jobs in a conscientious fashion. 
We have heard numerous accounts of abuses and mismanagement at the IRS. We have had months of hearings and hours of debate. Some of the reported incidents of taxpayer abuse have been so outrageous that it is hard to believe that they actually took place. Clearly, the system that guides and directs workflow at the IRS needs to be overhauled. 
Today, we are poised to go beyond talking about IRS reform. We are actually doing something about IRS abuse of innocent individuals. 
The reforms in this bill are carefully crafted structural reforms. They are reforms that will not only change the practices and procedures of the IRS, but its fundamental culture as well. These reforms will ensure that the IRS treats taxpayers fairly and with the respect they deserve. 
As with any proposal, there are improvements that can be made. Our colleagues have sponsored several amendments to make this bill even better. 
I am a strong advocate of IRS initiatives which provide increased customer service, fiscally responsible computer modernization, management and employee accountability and overall protection of citizens' rights. I support measures that would remove the union representative and the Secretary of the Treasury from the IRS Oversight Board, as well as a measure to create a full-time oversight board for the IRS. 
I also support a measure that would establish a Spanish-language help line at the IRS to ensure that all citizens can get needed assistance in paying the taxes they owe. 
I support an amendment that would greatly reduce unnecessary and onerous reporting requirements on colleges and universities that were imposed in last year's Taxpayer Relief Act in support of two new educational tax credits. 
I support an amendment to suspend interest and penalties on deferred taxes due from individuals who are in officially declared disaster areas. 
In addition, I support amendments to protect innocent spouses from undue harassment in an effort to collect taxes from their spouse. 
Finally, Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of a Coverdell amendment to this bill which outlaws random audits. Numerical quotas and random audits are inherently unfair. A culture that permits and encourages such practices is counterproductive to overall fairness and accountability. It is difficult to find another area of American society where you become subject to such intense Government scrutiny based solely on a random selection process. 
It is fundamentally unfair to impose the burden of a tax audit on an individual taxpayer for no reason other than his or her name was randomly selected. 
Reforming the tax collection and enforcement agency is only part of the solution of reducing the burden of excessive taxation on Americans. We still must continue our efforts to simplify the existing Tax Code and provide additional tax relief to all Americans. 
I am an original cosponsor of the Coverdell-McCain Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1998, which is a step toward a simpler, flatter, fairer Tax Code. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act would deliver sweeping tax relief to lower- and middle-income taxpayers by increasing the number of individuals who pay the lowest tax rate, which is 15 percent. In 1998 alone, this bill will place approximately 10 million taxpayers, now in the 28 percent tax bracket, into the 15 percent tax bracket. Preliminary estimates by the Tax Foundation indicate that 23 million taxpayers would benefit from this broad-based middle-class tax relief in 1998 alone. 
Mr. President, I supported the Middle Class Tax Relief Act because it is a step forward to further reform, it helps ordinary middle-class families who are struggling to make ends meet without asking the Government to help out, and it promotes future economic prosperity by increasing the amount of money taxpayers have available for their own savings and investments. 
In addition, this bill significantly lessens the effect of one of the Tax Code's most inequitable provisions--the marriage penalty. Our current Tax Code taxes a married couple's income more heavily than it taxes a single individual earning the same amount of income as the married couple. This bill reduces this inequity by taxing a married couple's joint income and a single individual earning the same income as the married couple at essentially the same effective rates. 
It is essential that we provide American families with relief from the excessive rate of taxation that saps job growth and robs them of the opportunity to provide for their needs and save for the future. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.

Mr. McCAIN. This measure permits individuals to keep more of the money they earn. This extra income will allow individuals to save and invest more. The increased savings and investment are key to sustaining our current economic growth. 
In sum, the Coverdell-McCain measure is a win for individuals and a win for America as a whole. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act is a good bill, and I am hopeful that we can move forward on this bill during this Congress. 
Mr. President, regarding action taken yesterday on the IRS reform bill, let me note that I supported the chairman's amendment to fully offset the costs of implementing these reforms. However, I do have some concerns about one of the funding sources. Specifically, the relaxed IRA rollover rule may create greater long-term revenue losses than anticipated. Because we cannot accurately score a bill beyond 10 years, it is difficult to determine how much additional revenue we may lose in the future as more individuals take advantage of the relaxed IRA rollover rules and make tax-free withdrawals from their accounts. I raise this concern simply to bring it to the attention of the managers of the bill as an item to be considered in conference with the House. 
Mr. President, let me close by saying that the IRS Restructuring Act of 1998 illustrates our continuing effort to change the way we collect our taxes and, on a larger note, the role of Government in our everyday lives. This bill reinstates the principles of fundamental fairness and overall efficiency to the operation of the IRS. 
We should pass this bill today and move forward to provide additional tax relief to all Americans. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.  
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support for HR 1385, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This bill is the result of several years of hard work and bipartisan cooperation by Congress on behalf of our nation's workforce and employers. 
Our present job training system has become overly bureaucratic, fragmented and duplicative without adequate accountability or assessment measures. Currently, the federal government administers 163 separate programs, scattered across 15 agencies, at a cost of more than $20 billion a year. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act addresses these problems by consolidating and reforming the nation's federal vocational education, job training, and adult literacy programs. Bluntly, this bill reduces Federal bureaucracy and unnecessary requirements. 
This legislation builds upon the monumental welfare reform bill of 1996 by giving our states and communities the appropriate tools for providing individuals with the education, skills and training necessary to obtain meaningful, long term employment. This is something which our current system has been unable to consistently and effectively provide for our workforce. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will provide individuals with an opportunity to increase their skills while obtaining a job. This will help millions of Americans attempting to move themselves out of the welfare system. If the historic welfare reforms made in 1996 are to work we must have an effective system of job training and vocational and adult education. 
Over and over again, I hear from employers in my home state of Arizona who are concerned about the lack of individuals qualified to fill their rapidly growing high-tech and high-paying positions. And I know this isn't just a problem in Arizona. This is a problem throughout our entire country. Nationally, the number of unfilled high-tech jobs is about 350,000. We cannot allow this trend to continue. If we do allow this trend to continue, we will be killing our ability to compete in the global market and remain ahead of our international competitors. 
An important aspect of this legislation is the flexibility and freedom it provides to the individual states for developing and designing their own tailored-made workforce development systems. Under this bill, states and local communities, can tailor their programs to best suit their unique populations and employment needs. 
Another important aspect of this legislation is that it contains reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act for seven years. The Rehabilitation Act is the country's only Federally supported program which provides job training and placement services for people with disabilities. Too many disabled individuals are falling between the gaps in the existing vocational systems which is why the Workforce Investment Partnership Act links the vocational rehabilitation system to the new workforce systems of each state. This will result in providing better jobs for more of our nation's disabled individuals. 
The success of our nation in this increasingly globalized, competitive economy depends upon a highly skilled workforce, and a comprehensive, sophisticated system of work preparation, training, and retraining. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is a positive step toward accommodating these needs. Again, I am pleased to support this bill which will create a more efficient and effective job training system for our country.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the conference agreement on the FY 1998 Supplemental Appropriations Bill which funds the necessary costs of ongoing U.S. military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia and provides relief for those affected by the devastating natural disasters which swept through the United States in recent months. 
Mr. President, frankly, I have to applaud the conferees on this bill. They did not include in the conference bill much of the pork-barrel spending that was contained in the individual House and Senate bills. In addition, the conferees wisely agreed to the House position to offset the domestic spending in this bill with other non-defense reductions, designating only the $2.8 billion in must-pay defense funding as emergency spending. This defense and disaster supplemental appropriations bill will cost the American taxpayer only $3.6 billion. 
Now that is not to say, Mr. President, that this bill is pork-free. In fact, this bill contains $52.3 million in low-priority, wasteful, and unnecessary spending. Even though the bill is a step in the right direction, it still wastes millions of taxpayer dollars. 
Eliminating pork-barrel spending is key to realizing the federal budget surpluses that are projected for the next several years. Paying down our national debt is vital to our nation's long-term economic health, and providing greater tax relief to all Americans will improve their quality of life and help sustain our robust economy. In addition, a balanced federal budget coupled with a sustained strong economy will enable us to protect Social Security and Medicare for current and future generations. 
If we do not curb pork-barrel spending, future anticipated budget surpluses will not occur, and this historic opportunity to reduce our federal debt will pass us by. 
Mr. President, again, the amount of wasteful spending in this bill is less onerous than in most other bills I have seen. However, I still must object strenuously to the inclusion of $52.3 million in earmarks and add-ons in conference agreement. We cannot afford pork-barrel spending, even in the amount contained in this bill, because the cumulative effect of each million wasted is a million dollars in debt on which we must pay interest. 
Some of the more egregious items earmarked in this bill include: 
$14 million for a tree assistance program. This amount is an increase of $9.3 million and $5.3 million over what was proposed by the House and Senate respectively. 
$1 million to conduct `transit investment analysis' in Hawaii. 
$4 million for maple sugar producers. 
$222,000 for boll weevil eradication loans. 
$20 million for the implementation of the Capitol Square perimeter security plan. 
$7.5 million for repairs to the Capital Dome. 
$1 million to increase the emergency preparedness of the State of Alabama. 
$1.5 million for the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record at this point a list of the projects contained in this measure that meet at least one of the five objective criteria which I have used for many years to evaluate spending bills. 
On Friday, May 1, I sent a letter to the President urging him to use his line-item veto authority to eliminate these low-priority, unnecessary, and wasteful programs from the bill. 
Mr. President, even the relatively small amount of pork-barrel spending in this bill undercuts our efforts to keep the federal budget in balance and ensure we are spending the taxpayers dollars wisely, as they have entrusted us to do. Pork-barrel spending robs funds from other worthwhile programs and prevents us from further reducing taxes and paying down our national debt. 
In the upcoming FY 1999 appropriations season, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to ensure that we do not waste taxpayers dollars on projects that are low-priority, wasteful, or unnecessary, and that have not been evaluated in the appropriate merit-based review process.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to have become a cosponsor of S. 1724, the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act. As many of my colleagues know, this bill would repeal the reporting requirements imposed on colleges and universities when Congress enacted the HOPE scholarships and the Lifetime Learning Tax credit last year. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 contained many important provisions for American families, particularly in the area of education. As a part of this bill, Congress created several new initiatives to make college and higher education more affordable for students throughout our country. The Hope and Opportunity for Postsecondary Education (HOPE) scholarship provides students with a 100% tax credit for up to $1,000 of their tuition costs for higher education and a 50% credit for the next $1,000 spent on their tuition. This credit can be claimed by the student, their spouse, or parents if they are still a dependent. Another program created by Congress to ease the financial burden of higher education for our working families is the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. 
Both of these programs are helping make college and postsecondary education more affordable. Unfortunately, when Congress created these new education programs, we inadvertently levied very costly and burdensome reporting requirements on our educational institutions. Beginning in the 1998 tax year, schools are required to compile and issue annual reports on their students for the Internal Revenue Services. Under the new law, schools are now responsible for providing detailed information on all their students, including name, address, Social Security number, attendance records, academic information, tuition data, along with the amount of qualified student aid. 
Preliminary studies indicate that the cost to our nation's universities and colleges to comply with the new reporting requirements will range from $125 million to $150 million for just the first year. The three colleges in my home state of Arizona expect that this new requirement will cost them approximately $400,000 to begin the reporting system, which will turn into an annual expense of $200,000 for each of the institutions. 
This reporting requirement is costly and counterproductive. At a time when Congress and the Federal government are trying to make college affordable, contain costs, and make higher education more accessible to millions of students, we are subjecting schools to excessive and unnecessary reporting requirements. According to the Commission on the Cost of Higher Education, a primary factor contributing to escalating tuition costs is excessive government regulation and reporting requirements. 
This is why I am cosponsoring Senator Collins' bill, the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act, which repeals the requirement for schools to report personal information on their students to the IRS. Instead, the new HOPE scholarships and Lifetime Learning Tax Credit will be treated like all other existing tax credits. The individual taxpayer will be responsible for providing the IRS with the pertinent information on their tax returns and maintaining appropriate records to substantiate their claims. 
This important piece of legislation prevents the limited resources of our colleges and universities from being wasted on unneccesary administrative costs and allows them to focus on our students and their education.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to begin by stating my opposition to the Ashcroft amendment which would too narrowly limit NATO's freedom of action by permitting NATO missions only for collective self-defense, or in response to a threat to the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of a NATO member. 
I believe that is understandable--the concerns that have led to this amendment being proposed, and some valid points have been made. Clearly, the NATO military forces must not be used frivolously. I do not believe that NATO is an organization that should take on worldwide military missions that have nothing to do with European security. 
I think these types of problems, however, should be avoided as NATO makes decisions--not limitations to be placed on NATO's ability to make decisions. When real-world challenges arise, we need the ability to have free and unfettered consultations with our allies on all possible courses of action before a decision is reached. Article IV of the NATO treaty already permits this kind of unrestricted consultation, as it has ever since Dean Acheson 
first presented it to the Senate 49 years ago. 
The Ashcroft amendment would for the first time restrict the scope of such article IV consultation by preventing NATO from considering taking action in many cases--even if we and our allies believed that such action would serve our common security interests. This is an unwarranted restriction on our freedom to consult and take joint action with our allies through NATO. 
The fear that NATO might take on missions that the United States opposes is unfounded. We already have all the safeguards we need at NATO because we have a veto. There can be no NATO mission, no military operation, no out-of-area deployment, unless the United States specifically supports that decision. Mr. President, not only do we have a veto but the United States is a leader of NATO. Rather than our getting dragged into missions we do not want, the reality at NATO is the opposite. The United States has always been the country to take a strong leadership position and to seek support from our European allies. We are the ones who seek to spread the burdens of maintaining security to our allies, not the other way around. The Ashcroft amendment would give a powerful tool to those allies who may seek to dodge burden sharing, who may want to prevent an active NATO role, or who would otherwise oppose a strong U.S. leadership role. 
I suspect that part of the motivation behind this amendment is a lack of confidence that the current U.S. administration will say no to military operations when it has to. That is a concern I fully understand. But a lack of confidence in the current administration is one thing to be dealt with between the Congress and the White House. Putting a hard and fast limit on NATO, the most successful military alliance in history, and the best tool we have for spreading the burdens of common security, is quite another thing. 
Mr. President, this is a serious amendment and one that I think would have serious consequences on our alliance and our relations with our allies, as well as our ability to act in the United States vital national security interests. 
Finally, I oppose the Warner amendment because I believe it is an artificial barrier. I don't believe that we want to keep countries out of NATO. We can do that already because we have a veto of NATO. If the administration were to make a bad decision, we in the Senate could still withhold our consent at that time. 
But if we decide our own national security interests warrant bringing a qualified country into NATO in less than 3 years, this amendment would prevent us from doing so. I don't see why we would want to limit ourselves in this way. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. My colleagues know all too well my frustrations with Amtrak. However, I worked in good faith with my colleagues and the Administration to move the Amtrak reform legislation through the legislative process. Therefore, I expected similar `good faith' to be applied in fulfilling the statutory provisions under the Act. 
I find it unconscionable the Administration continues to obstruct the independent assessment. This is one of the most critical elements in the entire reform package. How can anyone determine if Amtrak is meeting its financial obligations if we don't have a baseline to start? What is it about Amtrak's finances the Administration is trying to keep covered up? 
Equally troubling to me is the Administration's lack of regard for upholding the statute. A new Reform Board was to be in place nearly a month ago. These positions require Senate confirmation which necessitates hearings and review by the Commerce Committee. I have every intention to uphold our Committee's responsibilities. Yet, we have not received even ONE nomination from the President. 
Worse still, the rumors we hear is that the Administration is considering reappointing current Board members. I have been very clear, that the Commerce Committee will not report favorably any Board hold-overs and I stand firm on that position. I would think even the Administration would acknowledge we didn't create a new Board only to reappoint the same members. 
Why isn't the Administration interested in fixing Amtrak's problems while it is under their watch? I never cease to be amazed. 
Mr. President, the Congress worked long and hard in a bipartisan fashion to give Amtrak one more opportunity to do what they keep telling us they can do given the chance. The President let Amtrak, Congress, and the taxpayers think Amtrak was being given that chance. Sadly, the Administrations subsequent lack of interest is quickly taking that chance away.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, much has been said and written about the tobacco bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee 19 to 1, three weeks ago. 
The Senate will soon have an opportunity to debate, offer amendments and vote on tobacco legislation. I know the Senate can and must work cooperatively and without partisanship, as we have on the Commerce Committee, to improve the measure, and assure that it serves the public health interests of our nation--most particularly our children. 
The Commerce Committee measure is a bipartisan bill that was developed in consultation with the attorneys general, the administration and the public health representatives including Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler, and Matt Myers of the National Center for Tobacco Free-Kids. 
It's a comprehensive bill aimed at dramatically reducing youth smoking. Every living Surgeon General has signed a letter to Congress urging us to pass comprehensive legislation this year to address what is our nation's number one public health problem. 
The tobacco industry is now embarked on a campaign of diversion to change the subject from health and children. They are trying to take attention away from the facts, and use specious `buzz word' attacks to kill a bill they know might actually stop kids from smoking and reduce their ability to lock teens in as lifetime smokers. 
So, Mr. President, this is about money--the tobacco industry's money--and the lengths they'll go to make more, including lieing to Congress, manipulating nicotine to hook customers and marketing to kids. 
Mr. President, I would like to quote recent newspaper items responding to the industry's attacks and regarding new evidence of the prevalence of smoking among minority children as reported in the Washington Post. First, from USA Today: 
Some, ever eager for some raw meat, were sucked right in by the rhetoric. But before you believe it, pause a moment for one little bit of truth: Everything the industry is railing against today it agreed to in some form just 10 months ago. Here's the rundown: 
Big tax boost. Half a trillion dollars. That's how much those greedy lawmakers want to take from smokers. And a disproportionate amount would come from poor people because they smoke more. 
But wait a minute. Where were these brave champions of the downtrodden last June? Ooops. They were signing a settlement deal with a group of state attorneys general to dig $400 billion from smokers' pockets. The AGs and congress sought high prices to discourage smoking, particularly in the teen years when most smokers start. The poor? Flip the tax idea around. Imagine what the reaction would be to a plan that lowered their costs in order to lure them into a deadly habit. 
Big government. Standing athwart the onward march of big government, tobacco executives now warn that `Washington wants to create 17 new bureaucracies.' Memories of Clintoncare dance in their heads. 
Just don't pay any attention to the fact that 10 months ago these same executives were whipping big government on. The June settlement gave the Food and Drug Administration a 30% boost in its budget, the feds new powers to ban indoor smoking, and on and on. 
Ad restrictions. Why those do-gooders in Washington even want to strip the industry of its First Amendment rights by sharply restricting advertising. No human images, no color ads, and so on. Yet somehow all this was perfectly fine with the industry last June. 
Tobacco farmers. Congress' plan would put hundreds, if not thousands, of tobacco farmers out of work. The Senate bill does set aside some $28 billion in a trust fund to help growers and their communities dislocated by the cut in smoking rates. Guess how much the industry secured for these beloved farmers when cutting its June deal? Zip. Zero. Nada. 
What changed between June and today is this: Congress started to give the appearance of closing loopholes the industry had artfully built into the June deal--a tactic it has exploited in the past. Penalties for failing to reduce teen smoking, for instance, were too small to matter. 
Some observers have suggested that the industry quit negotiations now only to improve chances for a weak deal later. That remains to be seen, but one thing is certain. All Big Tobacco has done for two weeks is blow smoke. 
As reported in the Washington Post:  
The latest annual report by the surgeon general, David Satcher, showed what other studies have highlighted: that smoking continues to increase in allure to young people even as fewer adults smoke. Over the past six years, it said, youth smoking has risen by nearly a third, and some 40 percent of white high school students smoke. Smoking by high school-age blacks, who still smoke less than white counterparts, rose by nearly 80 percent from 1991 to 1997. The smoking rate among Hispanic students rose by 34 percent, the study found. 
Here are the facts. 
First the statistics on youth smoking are clear and alarming: 3000 kids a day start smoking every day; 1000 of them will die early from smoking related disease; and one out of every three adolescents uses tobacco by age 18. Mr. President, we're not talking about kids who sneak a cigarette out of their mother's purse. According to a Surgeon General's report: Seventy-one percent of youth smokers, use tobacco daily. 
The Centers for Disease Control reports that youth smoking is on the rise, a trend that the American Cancer Society calls a `pediatric epidemic.' Ninety percent of lifetime smokers take up the habit before the age of 18--when it is illegal to buy tobacco products in every state in the union. We know from documents discovered in state suits against the tobacco industry that they have long understood the adverse health impacts and addictiveness of their products, yet actively marketed to children, including studying 5-7 year olds. 
The cost of this problem is enormous! 
Mr. President, 435 thousand Americans die from smoking related illness every year--the single greatest cause of preventable disease and death in America by far. Every year, taxpayers must foot the bill for $50 billion in health care costs to treat smoking related disease. According to the Department of the Treasury, smoking related injury, damage and economic cost exceed over $130 billion annually. To recoup some of these costs to taxpayers, 41 states have sued the industry. 
Mr. President, the severity and urgency of the problem is beyond question. Now is the time for action. As I said, every living surgeon general of the United States has signed a letter urging Congress to pass comprehensive tobacco control legislation. 
The bill passed by the Commerce Committee is comprehensive and mirrors the framework of the tobacco settlement reached between the industry and the attorney general. 
The bill: Restricts tobacco advertising and marketing aimed at kids; sets aggressive but achievable youth smoking reduction targets, and holds the industry responsible for failing to achieve the reductions; increases the price-per-pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over five years to reduce youth consumption. Experts agree such a hike is a critical part of the overall effort to curb youth from smoking. 
It provides the Food and Drug Administration with authority to oversee nicotine and tobacco product ingredients and marketing. It requires the industry to pay up to $516 billion over 25 years to compensate states for tobacco related costs to Medicaid and public health programs; to fund youth smoking reduction and health research initiatives; and to assist tobacco farmers. 
The bill is about our kids, it's about accountability and it's about solving a national problem. The industry wants to change the subject with the tried and true tactics of diversion. 
I understand they now intend to spend $100 million for print and broadcast media to maintain the status quo. Perhaps if the industry had spent some of their resources on legitimate anti-youth smoking activities, we wouldn't have the problem we do today. 
The industry diversion play book consists of four themes.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I became an official cosponsor of S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act introduced by Senator Abraham. This bill addresses a very critical problem impacting our nation's families and their children, abortion. Under this bill, adults who take children across state lines to receive an abortion without the knowledge of their parents would be committing a federal offense. 
Currently, 22 states require parental notification if a minor is going to receive an abortion. Yet, each and every day adults help thousands of children travel across state lines to receive abortions in states which do not require the notification of a parent. 
Being an ardent opponent of abortion, I am gravely concerned about the children who are being taken by adults, who are not their parents, into different states to receive abortions. This process is wrong and must be stopped. We cannot allow adults to circumvent state laws by transporting a minor across state lines for an abortion without parental consent and involvement. 
The decision to have an abortion is a critical decision, one which I personally hope that women of all ages would elect not to have. However, despite an individual's personal opinion on abortion, the majority of Americans, myself included, believe it is imperative for minor children to involve their parents in this life altering decision. According to a 1996 Gallup poll, 74 percent of Americans supported requiring minors to get parental consent for an abortion. According to the Supreme Court, `the medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting; this is particularly so when the patient is immature.' Clearly, our nation's children should not be kept from their parents when making an important life decision with such broad ramifications as an abortion. 
This is why I am cosponsoring Senator Abraham's bill, the `Child Custody Protection Act.' This bill would make it a federal offense to transport a minor across state lines with intent to avoid state laws requiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion. 
It is my firm belief that we must pass this law and stop people from bypassing the laws of our individual states. This legislation protects our children from making a life altering decision without the guidance of their most trusted advisors, their parents.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and honor two young Arizona students who have achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Eliza Robinson of Scottsdale and Jason Kelley of Prescott have just been named State honorees in the 1998 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on only one high school student and one middle school student in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
Ms. Eliza Robinson is being recognized for her many years of dedication and service to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, culminating with a term as spokesman for that wonderful organization. 
Mr. Kelley is being recognized for his efforts to start a Youth Chamber of Commerce. Jason's organization will give other young people in his community the opportunity to participate in Chamber events similar to those sponsored by their local Chamber of Commerce, as well as interact with business leaders from the area. 
In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young people have made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Mr. Kelley and Ms. Robinson are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. 
The program that brought these young role models to our attention--The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by the Prudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly valued and to inspire other young people to follow their example. In only three years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, with more than 30,000 youngsters participating. 
Ms. Robinson and Mr. Kelley should be extremely proud to have been singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of their recognition, they will come to Washington in early May, along with other 1998 honorees from across the country, for several days of special events, including a Congressional breakfast reception on Capitol Hill. While in Washington, ten will be named America's top youth volunteers of the year by a distinguished national selection committee co-chaired by our colleagues, Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas. 
I heartily applaud Mr. Kelley and Ms. Robinson for their initiative in seeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the positive impact they have had on the lives of others. I also would like to salute four other young people in my state who were named Distinguished Finalists by the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteer service. They are: Chrissy Weiers of Maricopa, who has demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to make her peers aware of the dangers of drugs; Christina Barela of Glendale, who helped organize a day camp for elementary school girls; Purvi Patel of Yuma, who designed and built a park adjacent to her school with five peers from the Gifted and Talented Education Program; and Tirzah Orcutt of Phoenix, who created a volunteer project to paint a mural on the Veterans Administration Medical Nursing Home Care unit in Phoenix. 
All these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and deserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that young Americans can--and do--play important roles in their communities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to cast my wholehearted support for a very important piece of legislation for our children and our nation's future, H.R. 2646, the A-Plus Education Savings Account Act. As my colleagues know, this bill would provide families with the economic freedom to save their own money, tax-free for their children's elementary and secondary educational needs. 
I am excited that the Senate is about to pass a bill which addresses the unique educational needs of all our children while making significant strides toward improving their academic performance. This bill is an important step toward returning to parents and communities the means and responsibility to provide for their children's education. This is why I support the A+ bill and will continue to support innovative, flexible programs which focus on the best interests of our children, our future. 
As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I have consistently worked with my colleagues to ensure passage of this bill and have looked forward to the day when it would pass the full Senate. 
Unfortunately, I will be unavoidably absent for the final vote on this crucial education measure. I am very disappointed that the vote on final passage for this measure was unexpectedly delayed. If I had been able to be present this evening, I would have voted yes for this bill. 
Again, I want to reiterate my commitment for this bill and regret my absence for witnessing the passage of such a monumental measure. Finally, I would like to take a moment to applaud the leadership of my colleague, Senator Coverdell and his staff for his commitment to this proposal. He has fought tirelessly on behalf of our nation's children and should be commended for his efforts.

Mr. MCCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment which would mandate a study of multilingualism in the United States. This amendment would direct the Comptroller General of the United States to identify, examine and analyze the number of individuals who are proficient in English, but are also proficient in one or more additional languages. 
I believe that we can all agree that it is imperative for everyone in the United States to be fluent in English in order to succeed in today's society. This is why we need to continue encouraging all members of our society to be fluent in the English language. However, I believe it is equally important for us to encourage all members of our society to understand English--Plus one or more additional languages. Currently, I am working with members of the Hispanic task force in this effort to stress the importance of speaking English--Plus other languages. This study of multilingualism is a practical step in our efforts to encourage English--Plus the knowledge of many other languages. 
As I have stated, English is clearly the common language in the United States and is an important aspect of our society and individual success. However, it is equally important that we encourage and support efforts by individuals to become proficient in additional languages and broaden their opportunities for success. 
I wholeheartedly applaud people who have the capability to communicate in multiple languages. Not only do they posses valuable language skills, but their knowledge of various languages affords them a multitude of opportunities economically, socially, professionally and personally. 
The ability to speak one or more languages, in addition to English, is a tremendous resource to the United States because it enhances our competitiveness in global markets by enabling improved communication and cross-cultural understanding while trading and conducting international business. In addition, multilingualism enhances our nation's diplomatic efforts and leadership role on the international front by fostering greater communication and understanding between nations and their people. 
Foreign language skills also serve as a powerful tool for promoting greater cross-cultural understanding between the multitude of racial and ethnic groups in our country. 
The data collected from the study required by this legislation would enable us to identify the linguistic strengths and weaknesses in our society. Based upon this study we would be able to develop innovate initiatives which would promote the importance of foreign language skills, while providing a basis for expanding our nation's linguistic abilities. 
The information we gather from this study will be invaluable in many aspects of our society. It is important that we encourage and support everybody, no matter what their age, in learning one or more languages in addition to English, since the opportunities which exist for individuals who can master additional languages are endless.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the accomplishments of Hurvie E. Davis. It is an honor and a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and to commend him for the superb service he has provided our nation and the state of Arizona. 
Upon his retirement on May 29, 1998, he will have served 42 years in both federal and municipal government. Hurvie's expertise lies primarily in the transportation field, having served the federal Department of Transportation in Washington, D.C., and regionally in San Diego, Portland, Oregon, and most recently in Tucson. Hurvie was the Director of Transportation for the City of Tucson for 15 years before going into the private sector as a transportation consultant. 
In 1992, Hurvie became the Town Manager for the Town of Marana. As Manager, Hurvie has accomplished many difficult tasks, and in doing so, has brought Marana positive recognition throughout the Southern Arizona region of municipal governments. His leadership and commitment to excellence has put Marana in a strong financial position to encourage residential and business development. 
Mr. President, Hurvie Davis has made many sacrifices during his 42 years of public service, and has contributed significantly to the many people he has worked with. I commend him on behalf of the United States Senate and wish him the very best as he begins another journey in retirement.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding naval officer and dear friend, Admiral Charles R. Larson. It is an honor and a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and to commend him for the superb service he has provided the United States Navy and our great nation during a truly distinguished military career. Admiral Larson's achievements over his 40-year career are unparalleled in our modern Navy. In addition to being a superb naval officer and my well-respected classmate at the United States Naval Academy, Admiral Larson was the youngest officer in the history of our Navy to be promoted to Admiral. Upon retirement in June, he will have served in 11 positions spanning more than 19 years as a flag officer. 
Admiral Charles R. Larson assumed duties as the 55th Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy on 1 August 1994. Prior to his arrival, Admiral Lawson served from March 1991-July 1994 as Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command (CINCPAC) located in Honolulu, Hawaii. As the senior U.S. military commander in the Pacific and Indian Ocean areas, he led the largest of the unified commands and directed all Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force operations across 103 million square miles--more than 50 percent of the Earth's surface. In his position as Commander of CINCPAC, Admiral Larson had primary responsibility for 350,000 personnel and the readiness of all U.S. forces in the theater, and was accountable to the President and the Secretary of the Defense. He was also the U.S. Military representative for collective defense arrangements in the Pacific and worked with 44 countries in the Pacific Rim. 
Admiral Larson was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A graduate of North High School in Omaha, Nebraska, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy with distinction in 1958. After being commissioned in the U.S. Navy, he reported to flight training in Pensacola, Florida, and was designated a naval aviator in May 1960. He then reported to Attack Squadron 176, where he flew missions from the aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La (CVA 38). 
In April 1963, he volunteered and was accepted for nuclear power training. Upon completion, he served in two fleet ballistic submarines, USS Nathan Hale and USS Nathanael Greene, before reporting as executive officer of the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Bergal. 
Admiral Larson was the first naval officer selected as a White House Fellow, serving in 1968 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Interior. From January 1969 to April 1971, he served as Naval Aide to the President of the United States. He reported back to sea duty as executive officer of the nuclear-powered submarine USS Sculpin. From August 1973 to July 1976, he served as commanding officer of the nuclear submarine USS Halibut. In August 1976, Admiral Larson assumed duties as Commander, Submarine Development Group ONE, in San Diego, California. In this assignment, he headed the Navy's worldwide deep submergence 
program with a variety of submarines, surface ships, deep submersibles, and diving systems under his command. 
As a Flag Officer, Admiral Larson has served in nine assignments both ashore and afloat subsequent to his promotion to Rear Admiral in March 1979. These include: Director of the Strategic Submarine Division and Trident Coordinator on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations; Director, Long Range Planning Group, an organization he established to assist the Chief of Naval Operations identify and prioritize long-range Naval objectives for planning the Navy of the early 21st century; Commander, Submarine Group EIGHT; Commander, Area Anti-Submarine Warfare Forces, SIXTH Fleet; and Commander, Submarines Mediterranean (NATO) in Naples, Italy. 
From August 1983 to August 1986, he served as the 51st Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. In August 1986, Admiral Larson was promoted to Vice Admiral prior to reporting as Commander, Striking Fleet Atlantic/Commander, SECOND FLEET. In August 1988, he reported as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy and Operations. 
Admiral Larson was promoted to four-star rank in February 1990 upon being assigned as Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet the Navy component commander in the Pacific theater. After one year in this position, Admiral Larson was nominated by the President and assumed duties as Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command. 
Admiral Laron's decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, six Navy Distinguished Service Medals, three Legions of Merit, Bronze Star Medal, Navy Commendation Medal, and Navy Achievement Medal. 
For the past four years, Admiral Larson has served as the 55th Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. Admiral Larson was asked to assume the duties as Superintendent to return honor, discipline, and a sense of commitment to the 4,000 midshipmen, in the wake of the most trying scandals that the Naval Academy has faced in its 152-year history. As background, on September 27, 1993, the Naval Academy Board of Visitors created the Honor Review Committee, known as the Armitage Committee, named after the Chairman, Ambassador Richard L. Armitage. The Armitage Committee was charged with reviewing the concept, process, and effectiveness of the Naval Academy Honor Concept, particularly in light of the December 1992 compromising of an Electric Engineering exam at the Academy. One significant recommendation of the Amitage Committee was to increase the Superintendent's Academy tour length to four years and make the Superintendent a more senior flag officer than the two-star admirals who had previously served in that position. Admiral Larson was the top choice among several stellar candidates given his maturity, four-star rank, experience, academic background, outstanding character and integrity, and his known ability to reach out and unify all Academy efforts aimed at improving character development: administration, academic departments, athletic department (including varsity athletics), extra-curricular activities, the 
Office of Chaplains, and the Brigade Honor Committee. 
As a member of the Naval Academy's Board of Visitors, I can report that we recently conducted a comprehensive investigation of every aspect of the Naval Academy. We concluded that the Naval Academy is fundamentally sound and on the right track for the 21st century. For that positive endorsement, we have Admiral Larson to thank. I would like to cite a few of the significant changes that Admiral Larson has instituted at the Naval Academy, which I believe will have positive effects for the future of our service academies: 
Established a New Leadership Curriculum. The leadership curriculum has been completely revamped, emphasizing a continuum of leadership both in the classroom and in the fleet. 
Established a New Ethics Course. A three-credit course, `Moral Reasoning for Naval Leaders,' provides a weekly lecture by a faculty philosopher and seminars taught by senior officers with extensive fleet experience. 
Instituted Integrity Development Seminars. During these monthly sessions, midshipmen work to define and clarify their basic moral values, and to determine the importance of those values and their significance to a career as a military officer. 
Established Distinguished Chair of Ethics. A world-renowned ethicist has been appointed, who adds considerable expertise to all of the Naval Academy's character development efforts. 
Established a Distinguished Professor of Leadership. The current Professor of Leadership is focusing efforts on improving how leadership is taught and practiced, both in the Division of Professional Development and in Bancroft Hall. 
Reaffirmed Honor Concept and Education. Midshipmen ownership of the Naval Academy's Honor Concept has been reaffirmed, and efforts to educate all midshipmen about the history, significance, and value of the Naval Academy Honor Concept have been strengthened. 
Returned to a Traditional Plebe Summer. With an emphasis on leadership by example, Admiral Larson returned the Naval Academy to a more traditional summer training period for new midshipmen, challenging them to reach new heights in physical, intellectual, and moral performance, and emphasizing the importance of respect for the dignity of others. 
Established a Masters Program for Company Officers. This program allows exceptional junior officers from the fleet to spend their first year in an intense 
academic environment where they will earn a master's degree in leadership. After being awarded an academic degree, the officers would then use this knowledge, combined with their fleet experience, to become more effective leaders and models for the midshipmen. 
Instituted Company Chief Petty Officers. Each Company has been assigned a senior chief petty officer or a Marine Corps gunnery sergeant who provides considerable first-hand fleet experience to the young officers-in-training. 
Renewed Accreditation of Academic Program. Under Admiral Larson's leadership, the Naval Academy received renewed academic accreditation in 1986 and 1996. His direction of the academic program for the long term engendered laudatory comments by the inspection teams. 
Key Brigade Accomplishments in Academic Year 1996-1997: 
74 Midshipmen from the Class of '97 were selected or nominated for graduate education programs, 10 of whom were women--a record number of female participants. 
Midshipmen participated in over 16,000 hours of community service, a new record. This effort represents the exponential growth of community service in the Brigade. 
Fifteen varsity athletes were named All-Americans for '96-'97. Two of 15 were also GTE Academic All-Americans. 
Mr. President, my good friend Chuck Larson, his wife Sally, and daughters Sigrid, Erica, and Kirsten have made many sacrifices during his 40-year naval career, and have contributed significantly to the outstanding naval forces upon which our country relies so heavily. Admiral Larson is a great credit to both the Navy and the country he so proudly serves. As this truly history-making officer now departs for another career, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him fair winds and following seas. He will be greatly missed. '58 is great!

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a bill to repeal the three percent federal excise tax that all Americans pay every time they use a telephone. 
Under current law, the federal government taxes you three percent of your monthly phone bill for the so-called `privilege' of using your phone lines. This tax was first imposed one hundred years ago. To help finance the Spanish-American War, the federal government taxed telephone service, which in 1898 was a luxury service enjoyed by relatively few. The tax reappeared as a means of raising revenue for World War I, and continued as a revenue-raiser during the Great Depression, World War II, the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and the chronic federal budget deficits of the last twenty years. 
Earlier this month, however, we received some long-overdue good news: thanks to the Balanced Budget Act enacted by the Congress in 1997, the Congressional Budget Office projected an $8 billion federal budget surplus for 1998. Mr. President, that announcement should mean the end of the federal phone excise tax. 
Here's why. First of all, the telephone is a modern-day necessity, not like alcohol, or furs, or jewelry, or other items of the sort that the government taxes this way. The Congress specifically recognized the need for all Americans to have affordable telephone service when it enacted the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The universal service provisions of the Act are intended to assure that all Americans, regardless of where they live or how much money they make, have access to affordable telephone service. The telephone excise tax, which bears no relationship to any government service received by the consumer, is flatly inconsistent with the goal of universal telephone service. 
It's also a highly regressive and unfair tax that hurts low-income and rural Americans even more than other Americans. Low-income families spend a higher percentage of their income than medium- or high-income families on telephone service, and that means the telephone tax hits low-income families much harder. For that reason the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that increases in the telephone tax would have a greater impact on low-income families than tax increases on alcohol or tobacco products. And a study by the American Agriculture Movement concluded that excise taxes like the telephone tax impose a disproportionately large tax burden on rural customers, too, who rely on telephone service in isolated areas. 
But, in addition to being unfair and unnecessary, there is another reason why we should eliminate the telephone excise tax. Implementation of the Telecom Act of 1996 requires all telecommunications carriers--local, long-distance, and wireless--to incur new costs in order to produce a new, more competitive market for telecommunications services of all kinds. 
Unfortunately, the cost increases are arriving far more quickly than the new, more competitive market. The Telecom Act created a new subsidy program for wiring schools and libraries to the Internet, and the cost of funding that subsidy has already increased bills for business users of long-distance telephone service and for consumers of wireless services. Because of more universal service subsidy requirements and other new Telecom Act mandates, more rate increases for all users will occur later this year and next year. 
Mr. President, the fact that the Telecom Act is imposing new charges on consumers' bills makes it absolutely incumbent upon us to strip away any unnecessary old charges. And that means the telephone excise tax. 
Mr. President, the telephone excise tax isn't a harmless artifact from bygone days. It collects money for wars that are already over, and for budget deficits that no longer exist, from people who can least afford to spend it now and from people who will have new bills to foot as the 1996 Telecom Act gets implemented. That's unfair, that's wrong, and that must be stopped. 
San Juan Hill and Pork Chop Hill have now gone down in history, and so should this tax.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm a commitment made by the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, to establish a National Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund in the FY'99 Budget Resolution. My colleague, Senator Stevens, and I reached an agreement last year with the Budget Committee Chairman to designate this fund from the interest derived from an $800 million land settlement for the protection and enhancement of our national parks. 
The fund will become a reality upon enactment of this year's budget resolution. I believe the reasons for creation of this fund could not be more compelling when directed toward the protection of our most coveted natural areas. The General Accounting Office found that while the park system and park visitation are growing, the financial resources available to protect and maintain our parks continue to fall short of the need. The estimated unmet capital needs has reached nearly $8 billion. In times of budgetary constraint, the interest from the fund, which could reach $50 million annually, will allow the Federal government to pay for much needed capital improvements within our National Parks and begin to address the multi-billion dollar backlog in repairs and maintenance. Beginning in FY'99, the interest targeted to the fund will allocate 40 percent to national parks, 40 percent for state grants and 20 percent for marine research. 
Mr. President, our National Park System is our natural and historical heritage, set aside for the benefit of present and future generations. The National Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund will help us to fulfill our stewardship responsibilities and protect the integrity of our natural environment. 
I applaud the leadership of my distinguished colleague, Senator Domenici, for including the fund as part of this year's budget resolution.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coverdell for his leadership on this issue. It is one that is important to American families. It represents an important step toward a flatter, fairer tax system, and it also provides immediate tax relief for hard-working Americans and their families. The amendment provides broad-based middle class tax relief by increasing the number of individuals who pay the lowest tax rates of 15 percent and significantly lessening the impact of one of the Tax Code's most inequitable provisions, the marriage penalty. An estimated 28 percent of Americans would reap some benefit from the broad-based tax relief provisions in the bill, according to the Tax Foundation. 
Again, I thank Senator Coverdell for his leadership on this issue in the ongoing efforts to reduce the tax burden on the American citizens. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague from Georgia in offering this amendment to incorporate the provisions of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1998 into the assumptions underlying the Fiscal Year 1999 Budget Resolution. 
On January 22, 1998, Senators Coverdell, Gramm, and I introduced S. 1569, a bill which would deliver sweeping tax relief to lower- and middle-income taxpayers. The bill would increase the number of individuals who pay the lowest tax rates of 15% and significantly lessen the impact of one of the Tax Code's most inequitable provisions--the marriage penalty. 
In 1998, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act would place approximately 10 million taxpayers now in the 28% tax-bracket into the 15% tax-bracket. An estimated 28 million Americans would reap some benefit from the broad-based tax relief provisions in the bill, according to the Tax Foundation. 
The amendment we are offering today provides the budgetary flexibility to deliver this broad-based tax relief to Americans. It pays for this tax relief by trimming more of the fat from our bloated federal government and closing inequitable and unnecessary tax loopholes for big businesses. 
The middle-class tax cut plan in S. 1569 would reduce revenues by approximately $195.5 billion from 1999 through 2003. This amendment establishes a reserve fund, comprised of spending cuts and increased revenues from closing tax loopholes, to fully offset this loss of revenue. 
We eliminate $94 billion in special-interest tax loopholes over five years. These inequitable provisions--like the ethanol fuel tax credit, taxation of coal sales as capital gains, special tax treatment of shipping companies' capital construction funds, and dozens of other provisions--benefit corporations and businesses at the expense of middle-class Americans. 
The amendment cuts $101.5 billion from non-defense discretionary spending, an average reduction of 6.9 percent over five years. At the same time, we recognize that tax relief cannot come at the expense of those programs that ensure the well-being and health of our nation's elderly and most needy. Our amendment makes no cuts in Social Security or Medicare. It also specifically protects programs that support education and child nutrition, support medical priorities, help low-income families make ends meet, curb illegal drug use among children, and reduce illegal immigration. None of the spending cuts would come from these programs. 
The cost of providing middle-class tax relief--$195.5 billion--amounts to only 2 percent of the more than $9 trillion that the federal government will spend over the next five years. 
Our amendment supports the enactment of S. 1569 without throwing the budget into imbalance or even affecting the growing federal budget surplus. The surpluses expected in future years are the key to beginning to pay down our massive $5.4 trillion federal debt and shoring up the ailing Social Security system. Middle-class tax relief would, in fact, contribute to a stronger economy and thus to even greater budget surpluses. 
Mr. President, this amendment offers Senators an opportunity to reaffirm their continued support for fundamental tax reform for middle-class Americans. Last year, we passed, with bipartisan support, the Taxpayer Relief Act which was a broad-reaching bill to address certain very specific problems, like capital gains taxation, taxes on home sales, and the like. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act continues the momentum for tax relief to remove the overly burdensome tax load that most Americans bear. 
The Middle Class Tax Relief Act focuses directly on addressing the middle-class tax squeeze. It is essential that we provide American families with relief from the excessive rate of taxation that saps job growth and robs them of the opportunity to provide for their needs and save for the future. 
First, the bill targets tax relief to the individuals who feel the tax squeeze the most: lower and middle-income taxpayers. For example, under this bill, unmarried individuals could make $35,000 and married individuals could make $70,000, and still be in the lowest tax bracket. 
Second, the bill is simple and provides broad-based tax relief. It bases taxation on income alone, rather than the number of school-age children. 
Third, the measure results in taxpayers being able to keep more of the money they earn. This extra income will allow individuals to save and invest more. Increased savings and investment are key to sustaining our current economic growth. 
Last, the bill minimizes the effect of the marriage penalty. Our current tax code taxes a married couple's income more heavily than it would tax a single individual earning the same amount of income as the married couple. The bill reduces this inequity by taxing a married couple's joint income and a single individual earning the same income as the married couple at essentially the same effective rates. 
In sum, the measure is a win for individuals, for families, and for America. Millions of Americans would realize some tax relief from this legislation. Thus, more Americans will be able to keep more of what they earn. This, in turn, will insure that Americans have more of the resources they need to invest in their own individual futures, and America's future. 
Mr. President, on a broader scale, I believe we should abandon our existing tax code altogether and create a new system. This new system should have one tax rate, which taxes income only one time. This new system should also reduce the time to prepare tax returns from days to minutes, and the expense to prepare tax returns from thousands of dollars to pennies. But I recognize that scrapping the Tax Code now is not a realistic expectation, so we must settle for a more gradual approach to relieving the tax burden on Americans. 
Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was a step in the right direction to provide tax relief to lower and middle-income families. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1998 represents an important further step toward a flatter, fairer tax system, which also provides immediate tax relief for hard-working Americans and their families. 
Mr. President, on behalf of the millions of Americans in need of relief from over-taxation, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and demonstrate their continued commitment to tax reform and relief.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I voted yesterday against the legislation to disapprove the certification of Mexico as cooperating with U.S. counter-narcotics efforts. Given the level of attention that has been paid recently to continuing problems with Mexican anti-drug efforts, I want to make clear the reasons for my vote. 
I am under no illusions about Mexican performance in combating drug trafficking and corruption. But the question we face is whether decertification would make the situation better or worse. 
We have a long land border with Mexico. Our economies are closely linked. Our relationship with Mexico is much more diverse and significant than the single issue of drugs. We need Mexico's cooperation on drugs, and we need it on a host of other issues as well. If we were to decertify Mexico, we would kill all cooperation in the drug war and spoil the atmosphere in the rest of our relationship as well. We would be sending a message of a complete loss of confidence in Mexico. I do not believe that this is a message we really want to send. 
Fighting the drug war is no simple task. A country's efforts cannot be reduced to a simple statement of `fully cooperating' with the United States or not. In this respect, the entire drug certification process is fatally flawed. While the senior leadership in Mexico is committed to fighting drugs, the task before them is enormous. Even the most strenuous efforts by a government could not guarantee 100 percent success against a multi-billion dollar industry. There is no black or white answer. 
What matters most is that U.S. assistance to Mexico to help fight the war on drugs serves U.S. interests. For as challenging as the situation is now, imagine how much worse it would be if there were no U.S. assistance to Mexico to combat drug trafficking at the source. We would be hurting our own interests as much as Mexico's if we were to decertify Mexico and dramatically reduce our counter-narcotics assistance. 
Finally, we need to bear in mind that the only reason there is such a massive effort by the drug lords to supply drugs is because the United States provides such a massive demand. By all means, we must fight the supply chain by working together with our neighbors against drug production and trafficking. But we must also continue to take our share of the responsibility in the United States and fight the demand for drugs here at home.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues, Senator Campbell and Senator Inouye, in strong opposition to the amendment sponsored by Senators Enzi, Reid and Bryan to S. 1768. I regret that I was not able to participate more fully in the debate on this amendment. However, I want to make it clear that I take strong exception to this amendment, as I did last September when a similar amendment was before the Senate. If I had been able to be on the floor, I would have fought against and voted against this amendment. 
The adoption of this amendment in any form disturbs the careful balance of State, Tribal and Federal interests which is embodied in the Indian Gaming law. The amendment was offered and debated without the benefit of any hearings or the consideration of the committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Indian Affairs. 
I recognize the Indian gaming law is not perfect. However, this is not the time nor the proper manner for consideration of amendments to the Act. The Committee on Indian Affairs has before it several proposals to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. As all of my colleagues know, I have proposed amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. My colleagues from Wyoming and Nevada should follow our established procedures and introduce legislation which can be referred to the Committee for hearings and proper consideration. Fairness and a respect for our laws and the views of all concerned parties requires such deliberation. 
Mr. President, I am disappointed that this body approved such an ill-advised policy which, in effect, interferes with and side-steps the on-going work of the authorizing Committee. I urge the conferees who will be appointed to finalize this supplemental appropriations bill to eliminate this provision from the final conference agreement.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I offer an amendment that is basically a technical correction to language that I had included in the Fiscal Year 1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. That language, and the amendment I offer today, are designed to make humanitarian exceptions for the unmarried adult children of former re-education camp detainees seeking to emigrate to the United States under the Orderly Departure Program. Despite what I considered to have been pretty unambiguous legislation in both word and intent, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and Department of State interpreted my amendment to the 1997 bill so as to exclude the very people to whom the provision was targeted. This amendment was accepted as part of the State Department Authorization bill for fiscal year 1998, which has not passed into law. It is, therefore, necessary to include this language in the Emergency Supplemental in order to permit the State Department to begin to process the backlog of cases that accumulated since the program's expiration last year. 
Prior to April 1995, the adult unmarried children of former Vietnamese re-education camp prisoners were granted derivative refugee status and were permitted to accompany their parents to the United States under a sub-program of the Orderly Departure Program (ODP). 
This policy changed in April 1995. My amendment to FY1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, which comprises part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, was intended to restore the status quo ante regarding the adult unmarried children of former prisoners. My comments in the Congressional Record from July 25, 1996, clearly spelled this out. 
Unfortunately, certain categories of children who, prior to April 1995 had received derivative refugee status and whom Congress intended to be covered by last year's amendment, are now considered ineligible to benefit from that legislation. 
First, prior to April 1995, the widows of prisoners who died in re-education camps were permitted to be resettled in the U.S. under this sub-program of the ODP, and their unmarried adult children were allowed to accompany them. These children are now considered ineligible to benefit from last year's legislation. 
To ask these widows to come to the United States without their children is equal to denying them entry under the program. Many of these women are elderly and in poor health, and the presence of their children is essential to providing the semblance of a family unit with the care that includes. 
The second problem stemming from INS and the State Department's interpretation of the 1997 language involves the roughly 20% of former Vietnamese re-education camp prisoners resettled in the United States who were processed as immigrants, at the convenience of the U.S. Government. 
Their unmarried adult children, prior to April 1995, were still given derivative refugee status, however, the position of INS and State is that these children are now ineligible because the language in the FY1997 bill included the phrase `processed as refugees for resettlement in the United States.' 
That phrase was intended to identify the children of former prisoners being brought to the United States under the sub-program of the ODP and eligible to be processed as a refugee--which all clearly were--as distinct from the children of former prisoners who were not being processed for resettlement in the United States. 
The fact that a former prisoner, eligible to be processed as a refugee under the ODP sub-program, was processed as an immigrant had no effect prior to April 1995, and their children were granted refugee status. The intention of the 1996 legislation was to restore the status quo ante, including for the unmarried adult children of former prisoners eligible for and included in this sub-program but resettled as migrants. This amendment will correct the problem once and for all, and I urge its support.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 2646, the Parent and Student Savings Account PLUS Act, which will create educational choices and academic opportunities for millions of young Americans. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this measure for which my colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell, has tirelessly fought on behalf of our Nation's students since it was stripped from the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. 
The legislation allows up to $2,000 each year to be placed in an educational savings account, or A-PLUS account, for an individual child. This money would earn tax-exempt interest and could be used for the child's elementary and secondary educational expenses, including tuition for private or religious schools, home computers, school uniforms and tutoring for special needs. 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, about 14 million families with children could take advantage of A-PLUS education savings accounts. About 75 percent of the families who would utilize these accounts would be public school parents. At least 70 percent of this tax benefit would accrue to families with annual incomes less than $75,000. 
The most exciting aspect of this bill is the creation of individually controlled accounts that can be used to address the unique needs of the child for whom they are created. Funds in these A-PLUS accounts can be used to hire a tutor for a child who is struggling with math, or foreign language lessons to help a child become bilingual or even multilingual. They are available to purchase a home computer or help a child with dyslexia obtain a special education teacher. In short, the A-PLUS accounts would enhance the educational experience of a child by meeting their unique needs, concerns, or abilities. 
It is important to note that A-PLUS accounts would not carry any restrictions regarding who can deposit funds. However, there is a limit on the total amount which can be deposited annually into an individual child's account. Thus, deposits into the account, up to a total of $2,000, could come from a variety of sources, including parents, grandparents, neighbors, community organizations and businesses. This provision enhances the prospect that more children could maximize this educational benefit. 
This bill also contains several important initiatives which would positively impact access to higher education and school construction. 
First, it would assist qualifying pre-paid college tuition plans. Currently, 21 states allow parents to pre-purchase their child's college tuition at today's prices. The A-PLUS bill would make these pre-paid plans tax free, thus encouraging additional States to create similar programs which make college more affordable for more families. 
Second, this legislation encourages employer-provided educational assistance by extending the tax exclusion of employer-provided undergraduate school courses to December 31, 2002. Currently, this tax exclusion is set to expire on May 31, 2000. In addition, it would allow graduate-level courses to be included in this tax exemption. 
Third, the bill would allow school districts and other local government entities to issue up to $15 million in tax-exempt bonds for full school construction. This is an increase of 50 percent from the current level of $10 million. 
Finally, this bill allows students who receive a National Health Corps scholarship to exclude it from their gross income for tax purposes. These individuals help provide vital medical and dental services to our nation's under-served areas. 
These components, combined with the A-PLUS created under this bill, will make significant strides toward improving the academic performance of our Nation's students. 
Mr. President, if a report card on our Nation's educational system were sent home today, it would be full of unsatisfactory and incomplete marks. In fact, it would be full of `D's' and `F's.' These abominable grades demonstrate our failure to meet the needs of our Nation's students in kindergarten through twelfth grade. 
Currently, the Federal Government spends more than $100 billion on education and about $30 billion of this is spent on educational programs managed by the Department of Education. Still, we are failing to provide many of our children with adequate training and academic preparation for the real world. 
Our failure is clearly seen in the results of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Over forty countries participated in the study which tested science and mathematical abilities of students in the fourth, eighth and twelfth grades. Our students scored tragically lower than students in other countries. According to this study, our twelfth graders scored near the bottom, far below almost 23 countries including Denmark, France and Lithuania in advanced math and at the absolute bottom in physics. 
Meanwhile, students in Russia, a country which is struggling economically, socially and politically, outscored U.S. children in math and scored far above them in advanced math and physics. Clearly, in order for the United States to remain a viable force in the world economy, our children must be better prepared academically. 
We can also see our failure when we look at the Federal Government's efforts to combat illiteracy. We spend over $8 billion a year on programs to eradicate illiteracy across the country. Yet, we have not seen any significant improvement in literacy in any segment of our population. Today, more than 40 million Americans can not read a menu, instructions, medicine labels or a newspaper. And, tragically, four out of ten children in third grade can not read. 
Mr. President, this is an outrage. But contrary to popular belief here in Washington, pouring more and more money into the existing educational system is not the magic solution for what ails our schools. 
The problem runs much deeper than a lack of funding. And the solution is more complicated. 
In fact, according to the most recent studies, there is very little, if any, correlation between the amount of money spent on education and the academic performance of students. A Brookings Institute study reported that, `The Nation is spending more and more to achieve results that are no better, and perhaps worse.' 
Over the past decade the U.S. Department of Education has spent about $200 billion on elementary and secondary education, yet achievement scores continue to stagnate or drop and an increasing proportion of America's students are dropping out of school. Most of our students are not meeting proficient levels in reading, and according to the 1994 `National Assessment of Education Progress,' 57 percent of our high school seniors lacked even a basic knowledge of U.S. history. 
I am also disturbed by the disproportionate amount of Federal education dollars which actually reach our students and schools. It is deplorable that the vast majority of Federal education funds do not reach our school districts, schools and children. In 1995, the Department of Education spent $33 billion for education and only 13.1 percent of that reached the local education agencies. It is unacceptable that less than 13 percent of the funds directly reached the individual schools and their students. 
The lack of a correlation between educational funding and performance can also be seen internationally. Countries which outrank the United States in student academic assessments often spend far less than we do and yet, their students perform much better than our students. The United States spends an average of $1,040 per student in elementary and secondary education costs. By comparison Hungary spends $166, New Zealand spends $415, Australia spends $663, Slovenia spends $300, the Netherlands spend $725, and each of these countries' students performed well above U.S. students in the mathematics portion of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS.) Obviously, these countries are succeeding in providing their children with a high-quality education, and spending less to do so. 
Mr. President, clearly, the Federal government has a role in the education of our citizens. I have supported many vitally important Federal programs which enhance the educational opportunities of young Americans, such as financial aid for college students, aid to impoverished school districts, and special education programs for disabled children. However, much of the Federal Government's involvement in education is highly bureaucratic and overly regulatory, and actually impedes our children's learning. 
Clearly, we need to be more innovative in our approach to educating our children. We need to focus on providing parents, teachers, and local communities with the flexibility, freedom, and, yes, the financial support to address the unique educational needs of their children and the children in their communities. 
For example, I see no reason why most Federal education programs should not be block-granted to States and local school boards. Such a step would provide new flexibility to parents and local school officials, and eliminate Federal intrusion in local and state education policies. Personally, I have the utmost faith and confidence in parents and educators to utilize federal education dollars productively and efficiently, and in the best interests of the children in their communities. 
Mr. President, it is absolutely crucial, as we debate this and other proposals to reform our educational system, that we not lose sight of the fact that our paramount goal must be to increase the academic knowledge and skills of our Nation's students. Our children are our future, and if we neglect their educational needs, we threaten that future. 
I am gravely concerned that goal is sometimes lost in the very spirited and often emotional debate on education policies and responsibilities. Instead, this should be a debate about how best to ensure that young Americans will be able to compete globally in the future. I believe the key to academic excellence is broadening educational opportunities and providing families and communities both the responsibility and the resources to choose the best course for their students. 
The A-PLUS bill is an important step toward returning to parents and communities the means and responsibility to provide for their children's education. This is why I support Senator Coverdell's legislation and will continue to support innovative, flexible programs which focus on the best interests of our children, our future.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my dear friend and a person who is responsible for the timely and important provision of this bill to the Senate. It is in the nature of the defense and disaster supplemental appropriations bill. 
There are some very vital needs that have to be met in this bill for the good of the American people and for our defense. And, as always, I am very appreciative of the outstanding leadership exercised by the chairman of the committee. 
As I have done for many years, Mr. President, however, I would like to point out that there are provisions of this bill which I find wasteful and unnecessary and should not be included in any appropriations bill, much less one which is a defense and disaster supplemental appropriations. 
This amendment that I have at the desk would eliminate $78 million for unrelated wasteful and unnecessary spending that was added in committee. 
I want to clarify that the amendment would not strike the $50 million added for disaster relief for Georgia. These funds were added to the bill well before the disastrous tornadoes struck last Friday in Georgia and North Carolina and Tennessee. And I believe that in light of the clear need for relief of those hit by the devastating tornadoes last week, these funds should remain in the bill. I trust that the conferees will ensure that these added funds are shared among those who suffered losses of family, friends, and property in all three affected States. 
Now, let us turn to the items that would be eliminated by this amendment: 
$4.48 million in unrequested emergency funds for maple producers, to replace taps and tubing damaged by ice storms in the Northeast; 
$33 million in emergency funds for unrequested levee and waterway repairs in Alabama and Mississippi; 
$4 million in unrequested funds for development and demonstration of dielectric wall accelerator technology for remote explosive detonation, radiography, and fusion applications. 
I want to repeat that one, Mr. President. 
$4 million in unrequested funds for development and demonstration of dielectric wall accelerator technology for remote explosive detonation, radiography, and fusion applications; 
Language providing a special exemption from the law to allow the Secretary of Energy to pay $80,000 in retraining costs for workers at the Pinellas Plant site; 
$2 million and language that requires payments to counties to replace funds counties expected to receive from timber road construction projects which will be canceled due to the proposed moratorium on such projects; 
$7.5 million as the first increment of a $26.5 million project to repair and rehabilitate the Capitol Dome, and $20 million for security upgrades around the Capitol complex; 
$6.9 million for transportation planning and research and an investment analysis in the area of transit planning and research. 
None of these items, Mr. President, is related to military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. None of these items were requested as emergency disaster relief requirements, and most bear no relation to disaster relief at all. The bottom 
line is that none of them belongs in this emergency appropriations bill. 
Let me briefly just talk about a few of the add-ons in greater detail. 
First, I do recognize that the ice storms in the Northeast have had a devastating effect on the maple syrup and sugar industry. But I question whether the urgency of ensuring the future of maple sugar production warrants an earmark of almost $4.5 million as an emergency expenditure. It would seem maple producers would have access to the same types of financial assistance made available to other businesses and individuals as a result of the disastrous storms in Vermont. 
For example, why should workers at the Department of Energy's Pinellas Plant in Florida be retrained at the Government's expense? What about all those other Government employees who are displaced because of downsizing? And are not there already enough worker retraining programs at both the Federal and State levels that these employees could utilize? 
I find it somewhat disturbing that we are providing $2 million in additional funding for the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study of the Amtrak system. Mr. President, at the end of the last session we went through a rather long and involved debate and discussion about restructuring Amtrak. We bailed them out to the tune of over $3 billion, if I remember correctly. And we have appointed a new board to try to restructure and save Amtrak. And now, as an emergency, we are pumping in $2 million extra. I don't get it. 
The Secretary of Transportation also gets $3 million to study transit system requirements in Hawaii. The Secretary of Transportation gets $3 million to study transit system requirements in Hawaii. Mr. President, I don't go to Hawaii a lot, but I have to admit, I have heard no reports here on the mainland of some emergency that requires $3 million to study the transit system. The people were getting back and forth to Waikiki easily the last time I checked. 
Of course, the Olympics have to get their share of the pork. This bill contains another $1.9 million for transportation requirements for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah. I have lost track of just how much money we have thrown at the Olympics over the years, and I have asked my friend, the junior Senator from Utah, to tell me just how much he thinks his State will need to host these games. I have yet to receive an answer from him. 
You know, Mr. President, the latest scam that goes on in America is the following: A city wants to have the Olympics, so they get together all their civic boosters and supporters and commitments for financial support, and they go and they bid, and they receive the Olympics, and everybody is happy. And they are so proud because they did it themselves. And then, guess what. The first place they turn--and they perfected this to a fine art in Atlanta--is where? The Congress, to get tens, hundreds, of millions of dollars to take care of, guess what? Their Olympic requirements. 
And, by the way, I do not blame them. I do not blame them for trying it. I blame them somewhat for getting away with it. So we have already spent numbers of millions of dollars. 
Remember, this is 2002. We still have some time to go. We have already spent many millions of dollars already for the Olympics in Utah. And I can guarantee you one thing: There 
will be tens of millions of dollars or more before the torch is lit. I guarantee you that. 
Finally, I would like to ask the managers of the bill if they could explain one of the add-ons in this bill. What is dielectric wall accelerator technology for remote explosive detonation, radiography, and fusion applications? And why is it essential that $4 million be included in this bill for this program? 
Mr. President, this amendment targets only those items that will cost taxpayers dollars, but there are several other provisions that do not appear to have a direct cost to the taxpayer, at least not yet. 
For example, the bill contains a section that requires the Federal Government to construct the Trappers Loop connector road in support of, guess what. The 2002 Winter Olympics. The funding has already been provided for this project, but apparently it has run into some difficulties. 
The report language acknowledges the potential for cost growth in the project, an ominous sign that more taxpayer dollars will be required to complete this nondiscretionary road project. Remember this one, Mr. President: Trappers Loop connector road. You will hear again about that. And we will pay several more millions of dollars so that the Trappers Loop connector road in support of the 2002 Winter Olympics will be paid for. 
The bill contains a provision that directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into negotiations with the City of Albuquerque, NM, for storm water runoff and drainage management in the Petroglyph National Monument. What concerns me is the potential of future costs to the road project that is facilitated by the directed boundary adjustment in the bill, the usual report language exhortations to various agencies to address myriad problems, but for which the solution is not, surprisingly, spending taxpayer dollars. Like another $250,000 to complete damage repair in North Dakota, which was funded at $600,000 as an add-on in the 1997 emergency disaster supplemental appropriations bill; adequate funds to repair and restock the Beckley, WV, Military Entrance Processing Station that was damaged. 
Mr. President, I hope that we can pass this amendment. And I hope we will appreciate that when it comes time to take care of emergency supplemental appropriations bills, we will take care of true emergencies. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code. This bill would modify the home ownership test for Sales of Primary Residence so that members of our Armed Forces, who are away on active duty, qualify for the existing tax relief on the profit generated when they sell their main residence. This amendment will not create a new tax benefit; it merely modifies current law to include the time military personnel are away from home on active duty when calculating the number of years the home owner has lived in their primary residence. In short, this amendment is narrowly tailored to remedy a specific dilemma. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 delivered sweeping tax relief to millions of Americans through a wide variety of important tax changes that affect individuals, families, investors and businesses. It is also one of the most complex tax laws enacted in recent memory. 
Mr. President, as with any complex legislation, there are winners and losers. But in this instance, there is an unintended loser: military personnel. The 1997 act gives taxpayers who sell their principal residence a much-needed tax break when they sell their primary residence. Under the old rule, taxpayers received a one-time exclusion on the profit they made when they sold their principal residence, but the taxpayer had to be at least 55 years old and live in the residence for 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale. This provision primarily benefited elderly taxpayers, while not providing any relief to younger taxpayers and their families. 
Fortunately, the 1997 act addressed this issue. Under the new law, all taxpayers who sell their personal residence on or after May 7, 1997, are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit from the sale. Joint filers are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit they made from selling their principal residence. 
Mr. President, I applaud the bi-partisan cooperation that resulted in this much-needed form of tax relief. The home sales provision sounds great, and it is. However, when we delve deeper into this law, we note that the taxpayer must meet two requirements to qualify for this tax relief. To qualify, the taxpayer must (1) own the home for at least 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale, and (2) live in the home as their MAIN home for at least 2 years of the last 5 years. 
The second part of this test unintentionally prohibits many of our women and men in the Armed Services from qualifying for this 
beneficial tax relief. Constant travel across the U.S. and abroad is inherent to military service. Nonetheless, some military personnel choose to purchase a home in a certain locale, even though they will not live there for much of the time. Under the new law, if you do not have a spouse, and are also forced to travel, you will not qualify for the full benefit of the new home sales provision, because no one `lives' in the home for the required period of time. The current law also hits dual-military couples that are often away on active duty. They, would not qualify for the home sales exclusion because neither spouse `lives' in the house for enough time to qualify for the exclusion. 
Today, the United States has approximately 37,000 men and women deployed to the Persian Gulf region, preparing to go into combat, if so ordered. There are another 8,000 American troops deployed in Bosnia, and another 70,000 U.S. military personnel deployed in support of other commitments worldwide. That is a total of 108,000 women and men deployed outside of the United States, away from their primary home. These women and men are abroad protecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so dear. 
It is fundamentally unfair to deny these men and women the same tax relief as their civilian counterparts. The newly enacted current home sale provision unintentionally discourages home ownership among military personnel. Many of our troops simply do not qualify for the homes sales tax relief because they are away from their home so much of the time. 
Discouraging home ownership among military personnel is unfair and bad fiscal policy. Home ownership has numerous benefits for communities and individual homeowners. Having a fixed home provides Americans with a sense of community, and adds stability to our nation's neighborhoods. Home ownership also generates valuable property taxes for our nation's communities. 
We are in a period of robust growth. Americans who are fortunate enough to do so, reap the benefits of our country's growth by investing in the stock market. Many of our nation's recent millionaires became millionaires through the stock market. However, many middle- and lower-income Americans don't hold vast amounts of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and the like. Therefore, how does the average American participate in our nation's robust growth? Through home ownership. 
Appreciation in the value of a home resulting from our country's overall economic growth allows everyday Americans to participate in our country's prosperity. Fortunately, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 recognized this, and provided this break to lessen the amount of tax most Americans will pay on the profit they make when they sell their main homes. 
This bill simply remedies an inequality in the new law. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code so that members of our Armed Forces will be considered to be using their house as their main residence for any period that they are away on extended active duty. In short, military personnel will be deemed to be using their house as their main home, even if they are stationed in Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, in the `no man's land,' commonly called the DMZ between North and South Korea, or anywhere else on active duty orders. 
We cannot afford to discourage Military service by penalizing military personnel with higher taxes merely because they are doing their job. Military service in itself entails sacrifice, such as long periods of time away from friends and family, and the constant threat of mobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the tax code to heap additional burdens upon our women and men in uniform. 
In my view, the way to decrease the likelihood of further inequities such as the current Home Sales provision is to adopt a fairer, flatter tax that is far less complicated than our current system. But, in the meantime, we must insure that the tax code is fair and equitable. 
The Taxpayers' relief Act of 1997 was designed to provide sweeping tax relief to all Americans, including our women and men in uniform. Yes, it is true that there are winners and losers in any tax code. However, this inequity is unintended. We should enact this narrowly tailored remedy to grant equal tax relief to the members of our Armed Services.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Surface Transportation Board (STB) Reauthorization Act of 1998. I am pleased to be joined in sponsoring this measure by several members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, including Senator Hollings, Ranking Member, Senators Hutchison and Inouye, Chair and Ranking Member of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee, as well as Senators Lott and Ford. 
Mr. President, the introduction of this bill today is intended to demonstrate our Committee's firm commitment to enact legislation extending the authorization for the Surface Transportation Board during this session of Congress. The bill we are introducing is simple. It proposes to reauthorize the STB for three years and provide sufficient resources to ensure the agency is able to continue to carry out its serious responsibilities. 
Mr. President, I want to stress to my colleagues that this is a working piece of legislation. The Senate Commerce Committee intends to fully explore the resource needs of the Board, along with proposals to provide for any statutory changes as may be necessary. The Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee has already scheduled a hearing on the STB reauthorization for March 31st and I want to commend Chairman Hutchison for her expeditious action on this important reauthorization hearing. 
During the reauthorization process, I further anticipate we will continue our examination of rail service and rail shipper problems in addition to the more general reauthorization issues. The Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee has held two fields hearings and a third hearing on rail service problems will be conducted next month. 
Rail service and rail shipper issues warrant serious consideration, but I believe specific rail service and rail shipper problems and cases are best resolved by the Board. The Congress established the STB as an independent non-political authority to deal with these very exact problems and I believe we must continue to assist the Board in fulfilling its statutory duties responsibly and independently. 
I look forward to working on this important transportation legislation and hope my colleagues will agree to join with me and the other sponsors in expeditiously moving this necessary transportation reauthorization through the legislative process.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank you, Mr. President. I say to my dear friend from Maryland, with whom I have had the pleasure and honor of working on a number of other foreign policy issues, the Senator from Maryland and I were heavily involved with the issue of Central America when there was a struggle for freedom and democracy going on there. Due to her efforts and those of so many of us who have been involved in these issues, we now have a brighter day in Central America. 
What the Senator from Maryland just articulated is a brighter day for the people of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. I thank her for her remarks about me personally, but I express my even greater gratitude for her continued leadership on issues of national security and foreign policy in this body, for which she has accumulated enormous respect and appreciation, as well as a fair amount of affection. I thank the Senator from Maryland. 
I rise today to discuss the issue of NATO enlargement about which this body must vote in the near future. I would like to stress three points: That NATO enlargement is demanded by our American values; that it is in the strategic interests of the United States; and that efforts to delay a decision or to mandate policy on other European security issues through amendments to the resolution of ratification are unnecessary and potentially dangerous. These points were made very eloquently by our former majority leader, Senator Bob Dole, in an op-ed published today.

Mr. McCAIN. First, Mr. President, the morals and values we share as Americans--protecting and promoting human freedom and democracy--strongly point toward bringing Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland into NATO. 
For centuries, these territories were fully integrated with the development of modern Europe--politically, economically, militarily, culturally, and psychologically. But these countries were unnaturally cut off from the West in 1945 by the Iron Curtain that was slammed down by the occupying Soviet Red Army. The close ties to the West of over a thousand years had been broken. 
The people of Central Europe suffered horribly under communism. Their political and economic development was shattered. Arbitrary rule under a police state undermined normal relations within society. Citizens were pressured to inform on one another. Political prisoners were held and tortured simply for demanding freedom. 
Let us be clear, these countries were forced into communism against their will by an occupying power. In each country--Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Poland in 1981--freedom-seeking citizens sought to break free from the grip of Soviet-imposed communism, and, as we know, they were ruthlessly put down. While the United States and NATO staunchly defended freedom in the West, we could do little in the East other than offer our moral support, because the risk of nuclear war was too great. 
After decades of oppression, when the Soviet Union itself began to decline, the people of these three countries again showed tremendous courage and determination by seizing the opportunity to throw off the yoke of communism. Hungary cut through the barbed wire on the Austrian border and allowed East German refugees to escape to freedom. Vaclav Havel's peaceful protests ushered out one of the most repressive Communist regimes in Central Europe through the `velvet revolution' of 1989. The Solidarity movement finally pushed the generals and commissars out of power. 
In all three countries, communism was peacefully dismantled and replaced with parliamentary democracy and free markets. All three countries are now thriving, both politically and economically. 
Individual rights and freedoms are protected in both theory and in practice. Institutions that guarantee the rule of law are firmly entrenched. 
These three countries now seek our help in securing their newfound freedom for membership in NATO--just as was done with Western Europe after World War II. While there is no immediate military threat, the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians know from bitter experience that they cannot afford to wait until a new threat emerges to protect their freedom. 
Protecting freedom was the beacon of our policy in Europe during the cold war. It would be an incomprehensible tragedy for us to abandon that stance now when the opportunities for freedom in Central Europe are greater than ever and the risks are far lower than at any time during the cold war. 
Second, beyond any moral arguments, NATO enlargement serves strategic interests of the United States. The national security of our country still depends on a stable and secure Europe where democracy and free markets can flourish. This was the lesson from two world wars and the reason we created NATO in the first place. 
Today, the U.S. economy is more tightly tied to the rest of the world than it was in 1949. Thus, America's well-being depends more than ever on an environment of stable market democracies. NATO remains the only organization capable of guaranteeing security and protecting democracy in Europe. 
Enlarging NATO will prevent the emergence of a security vacuum in Central Europe. Absent NATO, the states of this region would have no choice but to remain anxious about historical animosities and worry of a resurgent Russia. They would be forced to seek security through national means--creating the possibility of diverging military and security strategies and raising the risk of miscalculation. 
NATO enlargement guarantees that there is a single, constructive focus to security and stability in Europe--West, Central, and East. Taking prudent steps now--enlarging NATO gradually to include these new democracies--will reduce the likelihood of a conflict that might later involve the United States. 
More than just filling a vacuum, NATO enlargement will ensure that the security environment in Europe remains conducive to U.S. interests, and it will strengthen and expand our base of support in Europe. Ratification will enlarge the secure, democratic, prosperous space in Europe where countries share our values and can act as meaningful partners for the United States, helping promote democracy, free markets, and security beyond the bounds of NATO Europe itself. 
Europe has already changed, and NATO enlargement is necessary to adjust to these changes. Not ratifying enlargement at this stage would isolate NATO from the fundamental political and economic changes that are reshaping the continent. A stagnant NATO would be relegated to the `dustbin of history,' something the Soviet Union sought and failed to achieve during the cold war. 
Equally distressing, failure to ratify enlargement would undercut U.S. leadership in Europe, with consequences well beyond NATO itself. We would not only be demonstrating that we are no longer prepared to play the leading role in European security, a role that has served our common interests well for 50 years, but we would be undermining the only meaningful organization in Europe where the U.S. has a seat at the table. 
Moreover, voting against ratification would deliver to hardline Russian nationalists the victory they failed to achieve through threats and intimidation over the past several years. Reformers, who argue that cooperation with the West is the only way to serve the interests of modern Russia, would be proved wrong. Instead, our action would demonstrate that confrontation, not cooperation, is the most effective policy for Russia. 
Mr. President, an extraordinary array of the most senior foreign policy and military leaders of this Nation have spoken out in support of NATO enlargement, including former President Bush, two former Vice Presidents, eight former Secretaries of State, six former Secretaries of Defense, five former National Security Advisors, five former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, nine former Chiefs of the Military Services, and some 60 retired four-star generals.

Mr. McCAIN. Third, Mr. President, because of the moral and strategic interests we have in NATO enlargement, it would be a grave mistake to endanger ratification by delay or by using amendments to the resolution of ratification to mandate specific policies on other separate European security issues. 
Some of our colleagues have argued for making ratification contingent on certain other matters of European security policy. I believe the enlargement of NATO warrants our support without further condition. 
The protocols on enlarging NATO are short, simple documents that do nothing more than extend the existing NATO treaty, in effect for nearly 50 years, to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. The protocols say nothing about further enlargement, Russia, costs, the changing role of the alliance, the EU, or intra-alliance disputes. Past rounds of enlargement have gone forward with little or no conditions attached. 
There is something to be said for knowing this historical precedent as it demonstrates the nonpartisan U.S. commitment to NATO, the European security, and to being a reliable partner, setting the kind of example we want our allies to follow on this and many other matters. 
Imagine our reaction if the parliament of one of our allies were to attach conditions to NATO enlargement that we would find unacceptable--for example, restricting use of NATO designated forces in strikes against Iraq. 
To the extent conditions are attached, they must be of a nature so as not to impede or slow down the ratification of NATO enlargement, here or in other Allied capitals. There are many complicated issues at stake in European security that demand our attention, but these issues cannot and should not be solved through hurried words in the resolution of ratification. 
We risk doing more harm than good by mandating simplified solutions to problems where there is need for more thoughtful consideration and where there is no consensus within this body or among our country's foremost experts. This applies in particular to questions about NATO's `new missions' and the alliance's strategic concept. Clearly, we need to pay close attention to NATO's growing out-of-area role and its greater emphasis on peacekeeping and crisis management. 
In today's world, no longer dominated by an East-West divide in Europe, these new directions of NATO make sense. Rather than seeking to use a resolution of ratification to restrict development of these concepts in NATO, we simply need to continue to do our job in the Senate of exercising oversight to ensure that NATO's evolving strategic concept remains consistent with our treaty commitments and that the United States does not commit to foreign military engagements that do not have sufficient support in the Senate and among the American public. 
I do not see the logic in a mandated pause before future rounds of enlargement. It is scarcely necessary, given there will be a de facto pause as the alliance absorbs the first round of new members. The United States always maintains a veto at NATO, and the Senate always has the right of advice and consent. All a pause would do is needlessly tie our own hands and those of a future President in the event a qualified country that could make a real contribution to NATO wanted to join. Even worse, it would eliminate the incentive other Europeans have to spend now the resources necessary to prepare for NATO membership in the future. A mandated pause buys us nothing we do not already have, yet has real down sides. 
Burdensharing is an issue of constant concern and debate with our allies. It is a long-term struggle for this country to ensure that we bear only a reasonable and fair share of the costs of our common security through NATO. Enlargement itself already implies a small reduction in the U.S. share of NATO's common expenses, although the total dollar amount will go up as NATO takes on new costs associated with enlargement. But seeking to use the resolution of ratification to mandate further reductions in our share of NATO expenses that have not been consented to by our allies is simply another way to try to scuttle enlargement. 
I also fail to see the logic of tying NATO enlargement to decisions by the European Union about its enlargement. Security is an issue in its own right, independent of economics, and we need to fill the security vacuum in Central Europe, bind these countries to the West, and guarantee a stable environment in Europe regardless of the state of European Union enlargement. 
Moreover, the European Union is dragging its feet on enlargement. We should not allow this foot-dragging to delay our taking action to enhance security in Europe. The U.S. is not a member of the EU and has almost no influence over its membership decisions. There is no reason for the U.S. to abdicate to the EU the decisions about which countries we will end up defending through NATO and when. 
Finally, the EU is negotiating with six candidates for future EU expansion. Three of these countries are the same as the three NATO invitees, but the others include countries such as Cyprus and Estonia for whom near-term NATO membership would be problematic. 
In my view, the resolution of ratification, as currently drafted, addresses most of the concerns that Senators have raised in a responsible and thoughtful manner. It does not impose any unacceptable conditions. It calls for a reaffirmation from the administration on a few key points--the primacy of the North Atlantic Council vis-a-vis the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council; the maintenance of collective defense, not collective security and out-of-area missions, as the core mission of NATO; and the requirement to keep the costs of enlargement under control and shared equitably among the allies. These are sound policy positions soundly formulated. Neither the administration nor our allies should have any difficulty supporting them. 
Mr. President, there is no reason to delay bringing this issue to a vote. This issue has received more attention in the Senate and in public discussion than most other foreign policy issues in recent memory. The proliferation of op-eds, articles, studies, think-tank papers, and conference proceedings is astonishing. 
Over the past several years, the Senate has on 14 separate occasions, through unanimous consent resolutions, voice votes, rollcall votes, on things such as the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act, repeatedly given a strong endorsement to NATO enlargement. We even urged the administration to include one more country in the enlargement talks that was ultimately invited at Madrid. 
Several Senate committees have held hearings on NATO enlargement. The Foreign Relations Committee has held numerous hearings and published 552 pages of testimony about the issue. This level of attention has been the most extensive of any previous enlargement of NATO. Ratification of Spain's membership was done by a voice vote. To say that there has not been enough debate is to say that no amount of debate will ever be enough. 
The complaints that there has not been sufficient debate--often coupled with a request to postpone such debate--instead seem like an effort by opponents of enlargement to scuttle the issue because they know a majority in the Senate has considered the issue and is prepared to vote in favor. 
The issues before us are clear and well defined. For the moral, strategic, and practical reasons I have outlined, the most important thing the Senate can do now is to offer an overwhelming, positive `yes' vote on the enlargement of NATO-- without crippling amendments--to bring these countries back into the Western fold forever. I urge my colleagues to support the current resolution of ratification with no further amendments. 
Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. I thank his staff and others who have contributed enormously to this effort. I want to thank Senator Biden and I want to thank Senator Helms for their efforts. Without their work, we probably would not have gotten this issue to the floor. The majority leader has committed on this issue, and I appreciate his leadership. 
But I also cannot help but recall, Mr. President, our former majority leader, Bob Dole, whose op-ed piece appeared in the Washington Times today. I will not take the time in the Senate to read the whole thing, but Senator Dole sums up where he says--and I quote--  
This is no time to postpone or delay action. It is time to act so that other NATO member countries can move ahead with ratification knowing the United States is leading the way. 
Senator Dole, throughout his long and illustrious career here, always believed that the United States should lead the way. With our vote in favor of enlargement of NATO, the United States will again, in the words of Bob Dole, lead the way.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as my colleagues well know, I am not often at a loss for words. I certainly am at this time. 
I would like to, first of all, express my appreciation to Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, two honorable adversaries who continue to struggle on the ideological playing field, but do so in the most honorable and dignified fashion that reflects credit on the U.S. Senate and on them. 
I was very moved today at the luncheon when my colleagues applauded so warmly the commemoration of this date. I am also very deeply moved by this resolution. I accept with some humility the accolades and kind words that have been said about me and also that are in this resolution. 
I know that all of my colleagues recognize that I accept these words not on my own behalf but on behalf of two groups of people--one is those that I had the privilege of serving with in Vietnam, many of whom suffered far more than I did and displayed much higher degrees of courage. They are the ones I knew best and loved most and whose companionship I will treasure for as long as I live. But I also accept these very kind words on behalf of the real heroes of that very unhappy and tragic chapter in American history, and those are the heroes whose names appear on the wall at the memorial not very far from this building. They were called and they served with honor. The honor was in their service in what was a very unpopular enterprise and one for which the American people took a long time before we adequately thanked them for their service. They were brave young people, most of them 18 or 19 years of age, who felt that answering the country's call was the most honorable of all professions. So on their behalf and that of their families who still mourn their loss, I accept for them with humility and with pride, because as we all know it is very easy to embark on a popular enterprise; it is much more difficult to serve in one which is fraught with controversy. And sometimes the young people who did return were not given the appreciation nor the accolades that they deserved for their service. 
So on behalf of those who cannot speak here today, whose names appear on the wall, I say thank you, and we will renew our dedication to see that never again do we send our young people to fight and die in conflict unless the goal is victory and we are prepared to devote all the resources at our disposal to winning that victory as quickly as possible. Although that didn't happen in that case, we cherish their memory, and for as long as Americans celebrate the service and sacrifice of young men, we will honor their memory. I thank you.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to redesignate the position of the Director of the Indian Health Service (IHS) to an Assistant Secretarial position within the Department of Health and Human Services. I am pleased that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Campbell and Senator Inouye, as well as my colleague, Senator Conrad, are joining me as co-sponsors of this important legislation. The Senate previously approved this legislation in the 103rd session and again considered the bill in the 104th session, but we were unable to pass a bill before adjournment. We are again pursuing this legislation as the timing for enactment could not be more critical. 
Some of my colleagues might be led to believe the standard of living for Indian people is improving due to the relatively small economic success enjoyed by a few Indian tribes in this country. Nothing could be further from reality as the health conditions facing Indian people are an endemic crisis. 
Mr. President, Indian reservation areas are among the most impoverished areas in our nation, yet remain the least served and the most forgotten when it comes to improving health care delivery. American Indian and Alaska Native populations are affected by diabetes at a rate that overwhelmingly exceeds other national populations. Mortality rates for tuberculosis, alcoholism, accidents, homicide, pneumonia, influenza and suicides are far higher than all other segments of the national population. The number of HIV and AIDS cases affecting American Indian communities is increasing at an alarming rate. 
The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the lead agency charged with providing health care to the more than 550 Indian tribes in this country. The IHS currently falls under the authority of the Public Health Service within the overall Department of Health and Human Services. The Indian Health Service consists of 143 service units composed of over 500 direct health care delivery facilities, including 49 hospitals, 176 health centers, 8 school centers and 277 health stations and satellite clinics and Alaska village clinics. This health network provides services ranging from facility construction to pediatrics, and serves approximately 1.3 million American Indians and Alaska Native individuals each year. 
For the past couple of years, the Department has undergone reorganizational reforms and removed some of the administrative hurdles faced by the IHS Director. I applaud the Secretary and the Department for these efforts to prioritize Indian health issues. However, I am convinced that we must further institutionalize the future of the IHS by allowing the agency to operate at the highest levels and by its own authority. 
Mr. President, this bill is more than a symbolic gesture. There are several other critical reasons which lead me to believe that this legislation is necessary. First, designating the IHS Director as an Assistant Secretary of Indian Health would provide the various branches and programs of the IHS with a stronger advocacy role within the Department and better representation during the budget process. As evidenced in the Agency's budget request for FY'99, which represents a minimal one percent increase over last year's budget, the ability of 
the IHS to affect budgetary policy is limited. 
Second, I am a strong supporter of the success of tribal governments to contract and manage programs through Public Law 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Through separate legislation, Senator Campbell will propose to permanently extend this authority to the IHS. Our intent through the 638 law has been to devolve the paternalistic federal management of Indian programs and place responsibility at the local tribal level where tribes most benefit by direct services. This legislation we are introducing today is intended to compliment that effort. 
I believe that the IHS would operate more efficiently as an independent agency. The IHS is charged with an enormous responsibility for Indian country and, therefore, should be afforded direct line authority and the ability to operate within its own unique mandates and rules. This legislation provides for the appropriate authority for this transition, particularly to ensure that the service delivery provided to the IHS by other PHS entities, such as the Commissioned Corps, would be appropriately addressed. I look forward to working with Secretary Shalala on these important matters. 
I am convinced that if the current organizational structure of the IHS is maintained, the agency will not be positioned for the long term to address the day-to-day health care needs of American Indians. Therefore, I believe that the IHS is in dire need of a senior policy official who is knowledgeable about the programs administered by the IHS and who can provide the leadership for the health care needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
Mr. President, this legislation will ensure that health care issues facing Indian people are addressed on a par with the rest of this nation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Telecommunications Competition Act of 1998. This legislation is aimed at encouraging the development of competition in telecommunications and thus allowing consumers to enjoy the benefits of competition including lower prices, universal availability, increased variety of new services. 
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted two years ago with great promise that increased competition would rapidly emerge on both the local and long distance telecommunications markets. The last two years have instead brought forth rampant litigation challenging everything from the constitutionality of the Act itself to the legality of the Federal Communications Commission's implementation rules. Within that same time frame, consumers have seen prices rise instead of fall, carriers merging instead of competing, and more regulation rather than deregulation. 
Mr. President, it is time to consider whether the Telecommunications Act of 1996, particularly section 271 of the Act that keeps Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) from competing in the interLATA telecommunications market prior to their fulfilling a set of market opening requirements, has been a success or failure. 
Section 271 requires BOCs to satisfy a detailed fourteen point competitive checklist that claims to guarantee that competitors have access to a BOC's services and facilities at rates, terms, and conditions that are nondiscriminatory. Section 271 also requires that BOCs seek approval for their applications from the Department of Justice, the relevant state commission, and the Federal Communications Commission; each of which may have a different interpretation of the requirements. Finally, beyond all of the other requirements a BOC must satisfy to gain section 271 approval, the Act gives the FCC the ability to reject an application based on a vague and undefined public interest, convenience, or necessity requirement. 
It is time to reevaluate whether the regulatory intensive approach to deregulation that was followed in section 271 is the best method for encouraging the development of competition. I realize that in 1996 Congress passed the Telecommunications Act while reacting to pressure from all sides of the telecommunications industry. I understand that any modifications to the Act will require that we seek compromise from those same industry forces. I am thus currently working to find such compromises and hope to introduce a different bill that will further the goal of competition through a framework that will focus on the truly pertinent factors while minimizing current incentives to game the process for anticompetitive ends. 
The bill I introduce today is what I believe to be the most deregulatory approach to 
encouraging competition in telecommunications. This bill takes a straightforward approach to bringing the benefits of competition to consumers by permitting all carriers to enter each others' markets and compete to bring the best and lowest priced services to consumers. 
The bill requires that all providers of telecommunications and information services be subject to equivalent regulation. The bill also states that if all providers of telecommunications services do not have the opportunity to provide all telecommunications and information services, it would be in the public interest to remove barriers to entry to intrastate telecommunications services such as telephone exchange service, intrastate intraLATA telecommunications services, and telephone exchange access services. 
When barriers to entry to intrastate telecommunications services are removed, all lines of business restrictions should be eliminated for existing providers of these services. The elimination of such restrictions will result in the creation of substantial numbers of new jobs and the deployment of advanced telecommunications services. This will enhance the quality of life and promote economic development, job creation, and international competitiveness. 
Advancements in the nation's telecommunications infrastructure will enhance the public welfare by helping to speed the delivery of services such as telemedicine, distance learning, remote medical services, and distribution of health information. 
Rural and sparsely populated areas will not receive the benefits of advanced telecommunications services unless all providers of telecommunications services have eliminated the restrictions on the lines of business in which they may engage. 
Existing regulatory devices no longer work, and the regulatory asymmetries that exist today are inconsistent with competitive marketplaces. Oversight of the telecommunications industry should be conducted from the perspective of the antitrust laws by the Department of Justice and from the regulatory perspective by the Commission for interstate telecommunications services and the states for intrastate telecommunications services. 
Finally Mr. President, this bill removes the current perverse incentives that some parties have to use the regulatory process to delay BOC entry into long entrance. By permitting all competitors to compete one year from the date of enactment, all parties will have the incentive to bring the benefits of competition to consumers as soon as possible.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I express my strong support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 78, which would call on the President of the United States to work toward the establishment of the legal mechanisms, under the aegis of the United Nations, necessary for the prosecution of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for crimes against humanity, including the infliction upon the people of Kuwait and his own Kurdish population of genocidal policies. The resolution further encourages that the President seek the funding required to support this effort. 
Senator Specter is to be commended for taking the lead in this morally and legally essential exercise in holding Saddam Hussein accountable for a long history of brutality that places him squarely among the worst human rights offenders of the post-World War II era. While none of us are under any illusions about the nature of this individual, I nevertheless urge my colleagues to read the text of this resolution carefully. It is a concise, comprehensive list of human rights abuses and war crimes committed by the Iraqi leader against the neighboring country of Kuwait, which he invaded and upon which imposed a brutal occupation, and against the Kurdish occupation of northern Iraq. It reiterates the degree to which Saddam Hussein has willfully and repeatedly failed to comply with United Nations and other legal mandates pertaining to his treatment of those who have suffered the misfortune of falling under his grip and to the international inspection regimes to which he is subject. 
The text of the resolution is self-explanatory, but even that omits mention of the incalculable acts of wanton cruelty Saddam Hussein, and his sons, has committed against the Iraqi people, in addition to actions against the country's Kurdish population. Such a discussion is beyond the purview of a resolution oriented towards holding Saddam accountable for war crimes. I mention this only to ensure that the fate of the Iraqi people is not forgotten. The purpose of S. Con. Res. 78 is to establish the legal framework for further isolating Saddam Hussein diplomatically and for working toward his removal from power. This is a resolution that may seem obvious and elementary in some respects, yet which reflects my colleague from Pennsylvania's astute grasp of the legal imperatives involved in pursuing far-ranging policies designed to bring down a ruthless and belligerent dictator.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my sincere gratitude and commendations to Portable Practical Educational Preparation, Inc. (PPEP) for their tireless efforts to improve the lives of needy citizens in the Southwest. 
Last October, PPEP, which operates out of Tucson, Arizona, celebrated 30 years of service to this community. At that time, in recognition of the success of their small business loan program, PPEP and Pima County were selected to receive an `Award of Excellence for Economic Development' by the National Association for County Community and Economic Development. 
Thirty years ago, a man named John Arnold converted his 1957 Chevrolet schoolbus into a traveling classroom for rural Arizonans. He spent his time teaching migrant workers English as a second language and the value of learning vocational and technical skills. This was the beginning of what is now known as PPEP. 
Today, PPEP is a non-profit organization with an annual operating budget of $11 million. It employs more than 300 people and has developed numerous programs that have become national self-help models. 
PPEP provides a multitude of social services for disadvantaged Americans. Some examples of these vital services include: affordable housing for migrant workers, necessary sewer and street enhancements, day care sites, senior nutrition and recreation centers, and public charter schools. The list of good works accomplished by PPEP on a daily basis is lengthy and impressive. Most important, PPEP has made it possible for rural families to experience the dignity they deserve. 
As we continue to reform federal assistance programs to encourage self-sufficiency, we must recognize the importance of organizations such as PPEP in providing voluntary community support to needy Americans. The committed staff and volunteers of PPEP have encouraged and enabled many disadvantaged citizens to gain the technical skills and computer literacy which will allow them to move from welfare to more productive lives in the job market. PPEP's services are needed now more than ever, as they provide a bridge for farmworkers, rural poor, and other disadvantaged individuals. 
After 30 years of outstanding and enduring accomplishments, I anticipate an even more aggressive and productive effort by PPEP to assist our communities and our country as we enter the 21st century. I extend my best wishes to John Arnold and his colleagues at PPEP and my thanks for their continuing endeavors.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate will soon adopt an amendment offered by Senator Domenici to establish a new commercial zone in New Mexico. As a representative from a neighboring border state, I understand the importance of this commercial zone to New Mexico. However, I also know that this new zone is only a temporary solution to a much bigger issue, that is, the implementation of the NAFTA cross-border trucking provisions. 
I want my colleagues to recognize the critical importance of fulfilling our obligations under NAFTA. The NAFTA agreement authorized access for U.S. trucking companies to Mexico's northern provinces, with reciprocal rights for Mexican trucks to enter the four Southwest border states. Under the NAFTA agreement, the U.S.-Mexico border was to open December 18, 1995. Two years later, we have heard little from the Administration on its efforts to meet our nation's obligations.

I know the Senator from New Mexico shares my concerns that we do nothing to impede the on-going NAFTA harmonization negotiations. And, when the NAFTA provisions are implemented, the zones in our border states will essentially be irrelevant. In the meantime, I will continue to do all I can to encourage the President to move forward on implementation of this important agreement.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the very important role of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) and its immense contributions to promoting transportation safety throughout our nation. I would particularly like to commend Dr. Ricardo Martinez, Administrator of NHTSA, for his strong leadership in highway safety over these past several years. 
Since 1992, seat belts, child safety seats, motorcycle helmets, and the age 21 minimum drinking age laws have saved over 40,000 lives. Thanks in large part to NHTSA, the nation also has made great progress in reducing the motor vehicle fatality rate. In 1966, when the highway safety statute NHTSA administers was enacted, the nation's motor vehicle fatality rate stood at 5.5 deaths per hundred million vehicle miles traveled. Today it stands at 1.7, the lowest rate recorded. 
The keystone of NHTSA's efforts in highway safety, jointly administered with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), is the State and community highway safety grant program, commonly referred to by its US Code provision as the `Section 402' program. The major goal of the Section 402 Program is to provide Federal leadership, encouragement and technical assistance to States and communities in their effort to develop and implement the most effective highway safety programs to reduce traffic crashes and resulting deaths, injuries, and property damage. Section 402 funds are provided to all States, territories, the District of Columbia, and the Secretary of the Interior on behalf of Indian Reservations. At least 40 percent of these funds are used for local and community projects with the remainder going to the State. 
Last week, the Commerce Committee's safety amendment to S. 1173 was adopted by unanimous consent. That amendment acknowledges the important functions of NHTSA and authorizes funding for the agency's many programs for six years. Unfortunately, due to budget considerations, the authorization levels included in the Commerce Committee's amendments for NHTSA's highway safety programs, as well as programs under the Office of Motor Carriers, fall short of meeting agency needs forecast for the next six years. 
Mr. President, I want to ensure there is no question about the Committee's commitment to transportation safety. While many of us wish we could have authorized funding at the levels requested by the Administration, the Committee had to also acknowledge the budget agreement entered into last year. Accordingly, the levels authorized for NHTSA and all of the other safety programs authorized under our amendment reflect that budget agreement. 
I am well aware additional funds are needed to meet NHTSA's goals on such vital programs as safety belt use and drunk driving prevention. As Chairman of the authorizing committee, I stand ready to increase the funding levels should an agreement be reached with the Budget Committee and other pertinent Committees to enable a higher authorization level for NHTSA, as well as other agencies' safety programs. 
While we have not found a way to increase the funding at this time, I will continue working on this during conference consideration. I will do all I can during conference deliberations to seek higher authorizing levels for transportation safety.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with the disposition of hazardous materials. It has been agreed to by both sides. 
Mr. President, as I stated last week during debate on the Commerce Committee's safety amendment, negotiations were ongoing to alter several special interest provisions that had been conditionally approved by the Committee when we approved the comprehensive safety amendment last October. 
One of the more difficult areas the Committee faced concerned the many requests we received to provide statutory exemptions for one industry or another from certain motor carrier safety rules. Exemptions were sought from Hours-of-Service regulations, Commercial Drivers License (CDL) requirements, and hazardous materials transportation regulations. Of course, these type of requests are not new. In fact, we face them every time Congress considers legislation affecting federal motor carrier safety policy. 
The Commerce Committee has worked to avoid any statutory exemptions or regulation carve outs for single industries. At the same time, we want to ensure there is a fair process by which all requests can be considered appropriately. This compromise amendment developed by Senators Hollings, Burns, Bryan, Gorton, Lott, and myself achieves these goals. 
In addition to the new process provided under the safety amendment adopted last week, which would permit the Secretary to examine innovative approaches or alternatives to certain rules, this amendment clarifies the Secretary may carry out similar pilot programs dealing with certain regulations impacting the carriage of agricultural production materials. This provision includes, however, specific criteria clearly stating that only projects that are designed to achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the safety level provided through compliance with current regulatory standards are permitted. 
In addition, the amendment clarifies and improves the process for providing limited regulatory relief during times of emergencies for utility operators to better allow critical services to be carried out during times of emergencies. 
I want to thank Senators Hollings, Burns, Bryan, Gorton and Lott and their staffs for working in a bipartisan manner to achieve this compromise amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senators Mack, Graham of Florida, Thurmond, Coats, Brownback, Kyl, and others, this amendment would require that any future highway demonstration projects be included under the annual obligation limitation. 
Let there be no question. I remain strongly opposed to so-called demonstration, high priority, and any other termed descriptions for earmarked projects. As I have done on previous occasions, I will again offer an amendment during this debate a Sense of the Senate Resolution, in opposition to any future demonstration earmarks in this reauthorization legislation. 
At the same time, I recognize the real possibility that Congress could, in its collective wisdom, continue to follow the same path it has in prior highway funding bills--that is, to authorize pork barrel projects. Despite the efforts of myself and many other members, the final ISTEA reauthorization bill coming out of Conference may very well include earmarks--earmarks for projects that in many cases aren't even considered necessary among the States' transportation priorities. Therefore, this amendment is an attempt to bring some semblance of equity should Congress fall back to the same old earmarking status quo. 
My colleagues may better appreciate the importance of this amendment by reviewing the history of previously enacted highway bills. In 1982, 10 demos were authorized, costing a total of $362 million. In 1987, 152 demo projects were created, costing a total of $1.4 billion. Then in 1991, the mother lode of all demo project bills, ISTEA, was signed into law. 538 location-specific projects totaling $6.23 billion were created. Since 1982, that's a total of $8 billion in trust fund dollars that did not go out for general distribution to the states. 
For far too long, highway demonstration projects have received preferential funding treatment. These projects are essentially paid for separately, with states receiving demo project money on top of their annual highway program allocations. 
This treatment clearly distorts the allocation process because the earmarked projects are funded outside the overall federal aid to highways obligation ceiling. Again, this distorted demo allocation is outside the funding process established by the statutory formulas--formulas that some of us will argue are already unfair to a number of states. 
Our amendment would require that any future, and I stress the word future, demonstration projects funded out of the highway trust fund be subtracted directly from a state's highway funding allocation. 
Contrary to the opinion our friends in the House like to push, not all of us buy the idea that special projects benefit our states' and nation's transportation system. The GAO said that `if demonstration projects were brought under the obligation limitation, all states would benefit from an increase in their flexibility to target annual obligations to programs and projects that were ready to go.' 
GAO further reported that the majority of states would have benefitted if the money provided under the guise of demos had been allocated according to the ISTEA formula. In one year GAO analyzed, it found that `33 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, would have received more obligation authority if demonstration projects were made subject to the obligation limitation.' 
The GAO said that `if demonstration projects were brought under the obligation limitation, all states would benefit from an increase in their flexibility to target annual obligations to programs and projects that were ready to go.' 
Further, during DOT Secretary Slater's confirmation hearing last year, he forcefully expressed the Administration's opposition to demonstration projects. Secretary Slater said demonstration projects `take resources from the trust fund for general distribution.' He went on to say that avoiding 
creation of new projects would add more money to the trust fund for general distribution purposes. 
Now, I recognize S. 1173 does not include new demos, and I commend the Chairman and Ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee for holding firm to this position. However, I also realize that our House colleagues are not expected to adopt a similar course of action. 
Let's consider what is happening in the House and its efforts to reauthorize ISTEA. There are reports that more than 400 members in the House have placed requests for highway, bridge, or transit projects. Of course, they were also actively solicited to do so by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the committee of jurisdiction. And I've been told these requests include more than 1,000 projects--requests that could total hundreds of millions of dollars, dollars that will be siphoned away from formula-driven state allocations and funneled to individually-designated state or local projects. 
In one committee print there's even a new funding item called `legislative discretionary projects.' I wasn't aware we needed to set up a separate kitty for legislative, member-favored projects. How much would this new legislative discretionary account consume? My calculations indicate $9.07 billion. That is almost double the level earmarked in ISTEA, and the bill isn't even out of conference. 
This is offensive. And I'll do everything in my power to make sure that such outlandish action is not condoned by the Senate. However, in the event my efforts to entirely stop all new demo-type funding projects are not fully accepted by the conferees, we must ensure a safety valve is in place. The McCain/Mack/Graham/Thurmond/Coats/Brownback/Kyl amendment is one such safety valve. 
Under our amendment, a state would be provided the authority to choose to fund a congressionally-favored highway, bypass, bridge, or another road project named in ISTEA II out of the money it receives annually. Simply put, our amendment would allow states to be the final arbitrator with respect to spending its federal funding resources on demonstration projects. 
In addition, our amendment will restore modest spending equity for states that have relatively little demonstration project funding. Why should states that don't happen to have members who champion pork-barrel projects have their allocation reduced to pay for other states' earmarks? Simply put, they shouldn't. 
Earmarked demonstration projects subvert statewide and metropolitan planning processes to the extent that projects are advanced that might not have been chosen based on area needs, benefit-cost analysis, or other criteria. Our amendment will also guarantee a state's authority to control its highway spending authority. 
There are critical needs throughout our nation's transportation network. Clearly, states don't need Congress to micromanage and dictate their planning process. The traveling public certainly is not well served when Washington forces limited funding to be spent on unnecessary road projects. 
Three years ago, the Senate adopted my amendment to prohibit funding for `future' demo projects. The amendment passed by a vote of 75 to 21. Last year, the Senate unanimously approved my Sense of the Senate Resolution to the Budget Resolution again expressing opposition to future demonstration projects. The Senate is on record for opposing new earmarks and we must remain on record. 
I remind my colleagues that $8 billion already has been siphoned away from the states' highway allocations. And donor states like Arizona and Florida and Indiana don't need to have any more of our gasoline tax dollars taken away in order to finance demonstration projects in donee states. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the McCain/Mack/Graham/Thurmond/Coats/Brownback/Kyl amendment as a backstop to provide some needed sanity to the ISTEA II conference agreement. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the Brownback amendment adopted earlier today which proposes to alter the present rails-to-trails process. While I did not formally object to the unanimous consent approval of that amendment, I continue to hold serious reservations over it. Indeed, I believe the proposal warrants further analysis prior to enactment. 
I recognize the sponsor of the amendment has concerns over the current manner in which trails are established. However, I am concerned the amendment offers the potential to greatly impede the establishment of future trails. 
Let me be clear. I agree it is appropriate to consider the current railbanking structure. I further understand the sponsor's interest in ensuring involvement by the local-area governments during the process. That is an important consideration and, in fact, local governments as well as any interested persons already have the ability to participate in the process. However, they do not have the ability to veto an agreement reached at the end of the process. Similarly, no one has the ability to force a trail's establishment. There is a balance. 
The amendment adopted would prevent the establishment of a new trail if the majority of the local governments along the rail right-of-way pass a resolution opposing the proposed trail use. While that sounds reasonable at first glance, I believe the Congress needs to better understand how such a new requirement would be implemented efficiently. 
For example, I believe we must carefully consider any implementing difficulties likely to result with this amendment. How will it impact the work load of the Surface Transportation Board, the agency which holds jurisdiction over rail abandonment and rail banking matters? How is the STB to know what constitutes the majority of local governments? Further, how is this new process carried forward when only one community is along a proposed trail? Would that one local government have veto authority over a new trail? 
Mr. President, I strongly believe these and other considerations must be addressed as this legislation continues through conference. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over the STB, I am committed to further exploring this matter along with any and all anticipated effects of this amendment when we hold hearings later this month on the STB's reauthorization. I will work to ensure our findings are carefully considered during conference consideration. 
Mr. President, railbanking is a voluntary program requiring agreement between the railroad abandoning a line and a trail-managing agency--most, which I understand, are local. I want to ensure that in an effort to improve the current process, we are not unintentionally jeopardizing future trails. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important matter in the weeks ahead.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over most federal safety policies, I believe this amendment will be very beneficial to promoting the travel safety of our nation's youngsters. 
Last April, we held Car Safety Seat Check-Up Day in Arizona. Numerous safety officials--including Administrator Martinez, participated in this event. During this event, parents had the opportunity to have trained law enforcement officers show them how to properly install child safety seats in their automobiles to maximize the effectiveness of the life saving equipment. In addition to the child restraint instructions, literature was distributed on other vital highway safety issues, including seat belt use and airbags. 
I have continually urged NHTSA to take additional actions to improve the safety of children in motor vehicles. In that effort, public education is an important first step in addressing transportation safety concerns specific to young passengers. I am hopeful NHTSA's initiatives, coupled with the Abraham amendment, will greatly advance our efforts to promote child protection mechanisms. 
Mr. President, as this measure continues through the legislative process, I want to express my intentions to strongly champion this initiative during conference deliberations. In particular, I want to ensure the states that receive assistance under this new program are fully vested participants. Given the very limited funding resources we are authorizing for this important program, we need to do all we can to ensure these limited dollars go as far as possible. As such, I believe we should explore the merits of authorizing the Secretary to implement requirements for matching funds as a condition for eligibility.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Rhode Island, the distinguished managers, I will take about 5 minutes and then I will have no more debate. This issue is very well known. I do not like to impede the progress of the Senate. While I am speaking, perhaps the Senator from Iowa will agree to that time agreement. I want to let him know I am agreeable to any time agreement. 
Mr. President, the amendment prevents an extension of inequitable Government subsidies for the ethanol industry that would cost the American taxpayers $3.8 billion. 
The amendment is simple. It negates the effect of the Finance Committee amendment, which is No. 1759, to the ISTEA legislation, which would extend for an additional 7 years the tax credits for ethanol and methanol producers. The value of these ethanol subsidies is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at $3.8 billion in lost revenue. 
Enough is enough. The American taxpayers have subsidized the ethanol industry, with guaranteed loans and tax credits for more than 20 years. 
Since 1980, government subsidies for ethanol have totaled more than $10 billion. The Finance Committee amendment to ISTEA, if not stricken, would give another $3.8 billion in tax breaks to ethanol producers. 
Current law provides tax credits for ethanol producers which are estimated to cost the Treasury $770 million a year in lost revenue, and the Congressional Research Service estimates that loss may increase to $1 billion by the year 2000. These huge tax credits effectively increase the tax burden on other businesses and individual taxpayers. 
The current tax subsidies for ethanol are scheduled to expire at the end of 2000. This amendment does not change current law; it allows the existing generous subsidies do continue until the turn of the century. The amendment merely ensures that the subsidies do expire and are not extended for another 7 years. 
Mr. President, let me just take a moment and try to explain why we have such generous ethanol subsidies in law today. The rationale for ethanol subsidies has changed over the years, but unfortunately, ethanol has never lived up to the claims of any of its diverse proponents. 
In the late 1970s, during the energy crisis, ethanol was supposed to help the U.S. lessen its reliance on oil. But ethanol use never took off, even when gasoline prices were highest and lines were longest. 
Then, in the early 1980s, ethanol subsidies were used to prop up America's struggling corn farmers. Unfortunately, the usual `trickle down' effect of agricultural subsidies is clearly evident. Beef and dairy farmers, for example, have to pay a higher price for feed corn, which is then passed on in the form of higher prices for meat and milk. The average consumer ends up 
paying the cost of ethanol subsidies in the grocery store. 
By the late 1980s, ethanol became the environmentally correct alternative fuel. Unfortunately, the Department of Energy has provided statistics showing that it takes more energy to produce a gallon of ethanol than the amount of energy that gallon of ethanol contains. In addition, the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Department of Energy all acknowledge that the environmental benefits of ethanol use, at least in terms of smog reduction, are yet unproven. 
In addition, ethanol is an inefficient, expensive fuel. Just look at the 3- to 5-cent-per-gallon increase in gasoline prices during the winter months in the Washington, D.C. area when ethanol is required to be added to the fuel. 
Finally, let me quote Stephen Moore, of the CATO Institute, who puts it very succinctly in a recent paper: 
. . . [V]irtually every independent assessment--by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, NBC News and several academic journals--has concluded that ethanol subsidies have been a costly boondoggle with almost no public benefit. 
So why do we continue to subsidize the ethanol industry? I think James Bovard of the CATO Institute put it best in a 1995 policy paper: 
. . . [O]ne would be hard-pressed to find another industry as artificially sustained as the ethanol industry. The economics of ethanol are such that, for the industry to survive at all, massive trade protection, tax loopholes, contrived mandates for use, and production subsidies are vitally necessary. Only by spooking the public with bogeymen such as foreign oil sheiks, toxic air pollution, and the threatened disappearance of the American farmer can attention be deflected from the real costs of the ethanol house of cards that consumes over a billion dollars annually. 
Mr. President, last year, when the Congress was considering the Taxpayer Relief Act, the House Ways and Means Committee took a bold step and included in its version of the bill a phase-out of ethanol subsidies. In the report accompanying the bill, the House Committee stated:  
[Ethanol tax subsidies] were assumed to be temporary measures that would allow these fuels to become economical without permanent Federal subsidies. Nearly 20 years have passed since that enactment, and neither the projected prices of oil nor the ability of ethanol to be a viable fuel without Federal subsidies has been realized. The Committee determined, therefore, that enactment of an orderly termination of this Federal subsidy program is appropriate at this time. 
The Senate Finance Committee took the opposite view, but fortunately, reason prevailed and the conference agreement on the Taxpayer Relief Bill made no change to current law, allowing this needless subsidy program to expire at the turn of the century. 
Mr. President, we should end these subsidies. If ever there was a prime example of corporate pork, the unnecessary, inequitable ethanol subsidy program is it. 
Mr. President, with today's booming economy, it is hard to justify continued government subsidies for programs that have not lived up to expectations after more than two decades of government assistance. It is even harder when those subsidies are given to an industry that makes over $30 million a year producing ethanol. 
Current law terminates ethanol subsidies after the year 2000. This amendment would avoid the $3.8 billion cost of extending the ethanol subsidies through 2006. I urge my colleagues to oppose changing current law and adopt my amendment to prohibit extension of the ethanol subsidies. 
Again, Mr. President, I am not without sympathy for the corn producers. I have less sympathy for the large corporations that produce it. But the fact is that I would be willing to agree to an orderly phaseout of this program. But for us to just permanently extend a program that has no viable benefit to consumer or environment doesn't make any sense. 
Mr. President, how do we go to the American taxpayer and say, gee, we are cutting your taxes, trying to save you money, we are trying to have good Government here, when we have already spent some $10 billion in subsidies over the last 20 years? And now we are going to go through a $3.8 billion cost to the taxpayer as a result of the ISTEA bill. 
Mr. President, we should not do that. We really should not do it. Again, I urge my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, who I respect enormously--I would be glad to talk about a phaseout. But a phaseout must take place. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the Commerce Committee's Safety title that was adopted by the full Senate last week. That amendment reauthorizes the many surface transportation safety programs last reviewed in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991. 
Mr. President, the Commerce Committee spent considerable time and effort developing that safety amendment. The Committee held a number of hearings--both at the full Committee and Subcommittee levels--to consider ISTEA reauthorization matters under its jurisdiction. The Committee held hearings focusing on National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issues, including air bag deployment and seat belt usage; motor carrier safety issues, including the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) and truck size issues; hazardous materials transportation; and proposals to improve protection of underground energy, water, and communications systems from excavator damage. 
The comprehensive safety amendment is a bi-partisan Commerce Committee product. It incorporates many of the proposals requested in the Administration's reauthorization submission, which was entitled the National Economic Crossroads Transportation Efficiency Act (NEXTEA). This bi-partisan amendment also includes a number of new transportation safety proposals. It is designed to improve travel safety on our nation's roads and waterways, promote the safe shipment of hazardous materials, protect underground pipelines and telecommunications cables from excavation damage, and ensure that our nation's commercial motor vehicle fleet is well maintained and safely operated. 
Mr. President, transportation safety must be at the forefront of our deliberations during the debate on ISTEA reauthorization and I was pleased to offer one of the very first amendments. S. 1173 proposes funding and policy authorizations to improve our transportation infrastructure and facilitate the efficient and economical transportation of people and goods. The amendment offered on behalf of myself and Senator Hollings is a vital component of that effort. Our amendment will help ensure that people and goods not only move efficiently, but that they move safely too. 
The need for improvements in federal transportation safety policy is crystal clear. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report that deaths from transportation accidents in the United States totaled more than 44,000 for calendar year 1996. Highway-related deaths, which account for more than 90 percent of all transportation fatalities, rose by 109, reaching a total of 41,907. The Federal Transit Administration reported 120 fatalities from accidents associated with the operations of light and commuter rail companies, compared to 98 in 1995. And, pipeline-related deaths totaled 20, compared to 21 in 1995. 
Mr. President, I would like to provide a broad overview of the various transportation safety provisions contained in the amendment as adopted last week. First, this amendment would reauthorize a number of programs under the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to improve safety on America's roadways, including grant programs which would provide $1.1 billion to the states over the next six years. While many of us wish we could have authorized funding at the levels requested by the Administration, the Committee had to also acknowledge the budget agreement entered into last year. Accordingly, the levels authorized in the amendment reflect that agreement. However, I stand ready to increase the levels should an agreement be reached with the Budget Committee to enable a higher authorization level. 
Second, this amendment reauthorizes funding for programs to ensure the safe transportation of hazardous materials. It also includes a number of changes intended to strengthen and improve the hazardous materials transportation program. For example, according to DOT's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) statistics, there were hundreds of transportation related incidents involving undeclared or hidden hazardous materials. These incidents resulted in 110 deaths and 112 injuries from January 1990 through October 1996. This legislation would give DOT inspectors the authority to open and examine the contents of packages suspected of containing hazardous materials. 
This provision would help ensure that packages containing undeclared hazardous materials shipments can be removed from transportation before they harm individuals. In the event a package is opened under the amendment's authorities, DOT inspectors would be required to mark the package accordingly and notify the shipper before the parcel could continue in transport. 
The amendment also expands hazardous materials training access by allowing States and Indian tribes to use a portion of their grants to assist small businesses in complying with regulations. DOT has indicated that the majority of hazardous materials shipment and packaging mistakes occur at small businesses. 
The amendment also authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to issue emergency orders when it is determined that an unsafe condition poses an imminent hazard. In such a 
situation, the Secretary is granted the authority to issue recalls, restrictions, or out-of-service orders to lessen the dangerous condition. 
Third, at the request of the Majority Leader, this amendment incorporates S. 1115, the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act introduced by Senators Lott and Daschle on July 31, 1997. S. 1115 would facilitate a national effort encouraging states to strengthen their laws that protect underground pipelines, telecommunication cables, and other infrastructure from excavation damage. S. 1115 passed the Senate by unanimous consent on November 9, 1997. 
Fourth, this amendment reauthorizes the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) which provides funding for commercial driver and vehicle safety inspections, traffic enforcement, compliance reviews and safety data collection. 
It further authorizes a performance-based approach for the MCSAP, removing many of the prescriptive requirements of the program. Instead, States would be given greater flexibility to implement safety activities and goals they design to evaluate and improve truck safety programs. This new performance-based approach, to be implements by the year 2000, would enable States to spend their limited resources on those activities best able to address their unique motor carrier problem areas. 
This legislation also contains several other important truck and bus safety enhancement provisions. The amendment would help ensure greater safety oversight by permitting the Secretary to contract with private entities to conduct inspections and investigations to ensure compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. Similar contractual authority is already afforded to the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration. The bill further strengthens safety oversight by extending safety regulations such as Commercial Drivers Licensing and drug and alcohol testing requirements to for-hire passenger vans. It would also permit the Secretary to order any unsafe carrier to cease operations. Currently this authority applies only to prevent unsafe operations of commercial passenger carriers and hazardous materials carriers. 
We have also incorporated a number of provisions designed to promote the timely and accurate exchange of important carrier and driver safety records. Strategic and effective policies should always be based on timely and accurate information. Good data is crucial to good decision making. Therefore, the McCain/Hollings amendment gives the Office of Motor Carriers the capability to improve its existing data collection programs through the development of more technologically advanced systems. 
We have all too often heard of stories where even the most sophisticated information systems contains inaccurate data and data which frequently is difficult for the affected party to correct. Therefore, when implementing the information systems and strategic safety initiatives authorized in the McCain/Hollings amendment, the Secretary of Transportation should ensure that the motor carrier data collected is needed and accurate, and that the information collected is protected from disclosure that would unfairly injure the motor carrier or the commercial motor vehicle driver. 
Mr. President, every time Congress considers legislation affecting federal motor carrier safety regulations, various segments of the industry seek exemptions. Some are common sense, such as acknowledging the special transportation time constraints of farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons. But, I strongly believe we should not have to pass a bill every time an exemption is warranted. The consideration of regulatory exemptions is a proper function of the Executive Branch. 
This amendment seeks to address this issue. Today, the Secretary of Transportation has the authority to grant exemptions. However, the authority is relatively meaningless because prior to granting a waiver or exemption, it must first be proven the exemption would not diminish safety. That's an appropriate consideration, but how can DOT assess an exemption's safety risk if it can't first test the concept on a limited pilot basis? 
In an attempt to address this problem and recognize the Secretary should be permitted to examine innovative approaches or alternatives to certain rules, Senator Hollings and I have worked to define a process whereby the Secretary may grant waivers and exemptions. This legislation would also authorize the Secretary to carry out pilot programs to test the affects of limited regulatory exemptions. 
I am urging my colleagues to work with Senator Hollings and myself to help us enact a reasoned and safe waiver/exemption/ pilot project process. While this amendment also incorporates three amendments authored by Senator Burns to provide regulatory exemptions to three industry segments, I have committed to working with Senator Burns to find an alternative approach. We are not quite in agreement, but I think we are getting closer. I bring this to my colleagues attention in order to inform the members that I expect that some amendments will be offered very shortly to alter the Senator's exemptions. 
In another transportation area, the McCain/Hollings amendment addresses the serious security threats to our Nation's railroad and mass transportation systems. As my colleagues well know, our transportation system is vulnerable to security threats. Two years, Arizonans and citizens throughout the 
country were saddened to learn of an Amtrak derailment near Hyder, Arizona, which claimed the life of one individual and injured seventy-eight others. Shortly after the accident, the sadness turned to shock as we learned that the derailment could have been caused by someone who may have intentionally sabotaged the track. The Arizona accident is not unique. There have been other examples of acts against railroads. Therefore, as requested by the Administration, this legislation would create criminal sanctions for violent attacks against railroads, their employees, and passengers. The penalties are similar to those which currently cover vessels, airlines, motor carriers, and pipelines. 
Finally, this amendment addresses boating safety concerns. In conjunction with Finance Committee extensions of the motorboat fuel, fishing equipment excise, and other tax and trust fund authorities, this amendment would reauthorize the Wallop-Breaux boating safety and sportfish restoration programs which are funded directly from these revenues. It is designed to ensure state boating safety programs receive a higher level of funding, and a level that is more proportionate to the amount of motorboat fuel taxes paid by boaters. In the past, receipts into the Boating Safety Account have been diverted for other purposes. 
This amendment would also reauthorize the Clean Vessel Act, which is funded through the Wallop-Breaux program's trust fund. It provides funds to the states for vessel sanitation pump-out programs, a new state boating infrastructure improvement program, and boating safety programs. In addition, it would create a new national outreach and communications program to help increase safe and responsible boating and fishing and increases funding available to states for boating infrastructure and aquatic resources education projects. 
I am well aware that Senator Chafee and other members of the Senate Environment and Public Works have views on certain aspects of these boating safety provisions. We have been working and will continue to work with these members on this section of the McCain/Hollings amendment in an effort to reach an agreement on these provisions prior to final passage of the bill.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of two amendments as sponsored by Senator Campbell, numbered 1709 and 1710, which would improve the delivery of ISTEA funds for the Indian reservation roads system now administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). 
Amendment 1709 is an administrative efficiencies provision that will allow tribes to construct more roads and bridges with the funds they receive under ISTEA. Simply put, amendment 1709 allows Indians to get a bigger bang for their ISTEA buck. 
The amendment does not increase the overall ISTEA funding targeted to Indian roads and bridges under this bill. Instead, it allows tribes to assume all functions, programs, activities and services previously managed for tribes by an inefficient and wasteful BIA bureaucracy that has been paid for with ISTEA funds. 
Unless we enact this amendment, up to six percent of the Indian ISTEA funds will continue to be diverted to pay for a BIA bureaucracy that is often located far from the Indian communities to be served. Amendment 1709 would provide express authority for these funds to be made available to willing tribes to build roads and bridges in their local communities. 
Congress has been trying to curb the BIA bureaucracy and support tribal autonomy ever since 1975 when it first enacted the Indian Self-Determination Act, known as Public Law 93-638. In recent years, I have been pleased to be part of legislative efforts to expand Self-Determination and Tribal Self-Governance. 
Four years ago, the Congress enacted substantive amendments to Public Law 93-638 which by its terms makes all funds, at all levels of the BIA, available to tribes to do for themselves what BIA bureaucrats have previously claimed to do for Indians. Public Law 93-638 authorities now allow a tribe, at its option, to cut through levels and levels of bureaucratic red tape and efficiently build things and run programs. The law has well-developed minimum standards and reporting requirements which assure accountability without a wasteful and offensively paternalistic federal oversight bureaucracy. 
In many ways, Public Law 93-638 works like a consolidated block grant. It is designed to encourage tribal efficiency and accountability, and to maximize benefits by targeting local priority needs. 
In the 1994 amendments to Public Law 93-638, the Congress intended to apply these authorities to all funds administered by the BIA, including ISTEA funds transferred to BIA from the Department of Transportation for the benefit of Indian roads and bridges. 
Despite our clear references in Committee report and floor language that this was our intent, the BIA has refused tribal efforts to fully subject all ISTEA funds to Public Law 93-638. This issue has consumed hundreds of hours of federal-tribal negotiations since 1994. Great sums of time and money have been wasted in arguments between BIA and tribal officials about 
whether the Congress wanted to permit the BIA roads bureaucracy to continue to fund itself by diverting up to six percent of the ISTEA funds away from actual construction in Indian and Native communities. 
Last month, the BIA issued proposed regulations on Tribal Self-Governance which claim that the 1994 amendments do not prohibit the BIA from continuing to withhold from tribes up to six percent of the ISTEA funds in order to fund the BIA roads bureaucracy. ISTEA is the last major BIA account which the BIA continues to protect as immune from the reach of tribal requests under Public Law 93-638 to obtain a direct transfer of the full tribal share of these funds. 
When I learned of this debate and the proposed regulations, I looked back at our actions in 1994 and realized we in Congress intended the 1994 amendments to Public Law 93-638 to apply to ISTEA funds transferred to the BIA from the Department of Transportation. They were to be treated like all other funds administered by the BIA--if a tribe wanted to obtain its full share of funds directly, in a flexible and accountable contract or compact, it could do so. 
I believed then, and I believe now, that there is nothing unique about building a road that requires a federal bureaucracy. Many tribes are building safe buildings that adhere to prevailing codes; they can do the same on roads and bridges without a heavy handed and costly BIA supervision. 
There are two ways by which Amendment 1709 would squeeze more benefit out of the funding levels otherwise provided under ISTEA. First, the amendment would clearly and expressly allow any tribe, so choosing, to require the BIA to transfer that tribe's full share of ISTEA funding directly to the tribe rather than being siphoned off by a wasteful, federal bureaucracy. Second, the amendment would allow a tribe to administer ISTEA funds under the flexible authorities provided by Public Law 93-638, including greater local control and responsibility, field decision-making powers, sharply reduced paperwork and reporting requirements, audited accountability, consolidated local operations, and in general, the local, tribal power to respond to project challenges and local needs when and as they occur. 
Amendment 1710 would require that regulations implementing the Indian ISTEA program and refashioning its funding allocation formula be prepared under negotiated rulemaking procedures adapted to the unique government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States. This amendment simply borrows from the recent success that Indian tribes and the United States have forged in carrying out the government-to-government negotiated rulemaking on the Native American Housing and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA). 
In recent days, the Administration has finalized rules governing the implementation of NAHADSA. From what we have heard in Congress, nearly all Indian tribes are pleased with the outcome of this federal-tribal negotiated rulemaking process. That is remarkable, given that the final regulations put detail upon a major overhaul of the Indian housing program funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). NAHADSA reorganized how hundreds of millions of federal construction funds are spent each year. And the tribal satisfaction is even more noteworthy given that the federal-tribal negotiated rulemaking process also produced a 
revised funding allocation formula, guided by factors set out in the underlying statute. 
Given the NAHADSA successes in allowing tribes to negotiate a new funding allocation formula to determine how the funds are divided up among tribes, I am convinced that the same approach should be applied to ISTEA funds. It works, and should be replicated on ISTEA, where many of the same issues involving housing construction are raised in efforts to construct roads. 
Amendment 1710 reflects the language used in NAHADSA to provide a statutory framework of basic relative need assessment factors to be used by the tribal-federal negotiating team to develop a new funding allocation formula. The specific language of Amendment 1710 would ensure that the new funding formula fairly takes into account Indian communities who have not had their road needs met under previous formulas. 
Amendment 1710 should not be seen by the BIA as an opportunity to completely rewrite the regulations already promulgated under Public Law 93-638. Indeed, these should for the most part apply to the Indian ISTEA, except where they now preclude a tribe from using the full authorities of Public Law 93-638 in the ISTEA program due to a mis-reading of our intention in the 1994 Amendments to Public Law 93-638 to fully subject ISTEA funds administered by BIA to Public Law 93-638. 
Both amendments 1709 and 1710 will maximize the benefit of the ISTEA dollars in Indian communities. This kind of express statutory language in ISTEA is apparently needed to remove any room for doubt on the part of the BIA that all ISTEA funding for Indian roads and bridges must be brought within the parameters of Public Law 93-638. I urge my colleagues to support these two amendments as one way we can maximize the benefit, and better target the expenditure, of ISTEA funds otherwise directed toward Indian roads and bridges in this bill.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment to eliminate the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program and establish a new Emerging Business Enterprise Program. 
Mr. President, I'm not a supporter of race-based or gender-based set-aside programs. This amendment goes too far. It eliminates a program that, while seriously flawed in its current focus, was designed to provide opportunities for historically disadvantaged businesses to compete for Federal highway construction dollars. It establishes a new program that merely shifts the focus of Government intention and funding to businesses based on size and length of time in business. 
Ironically, Mr. President, if the Emerging Business Enterprise Program proposed in this amendment had existed in 1975, software industry giant Microsoft would have qualified. In its first 3 years of business, Microsoft took in only $420,000, putting it well under the $25.2 million limit of the new program. Clearly, this business did not need any Government help nor interference. 
I'm a member of the Renewal Alliance, and I listened with interest to comments made by my colleagues who are also working with this important project. As I stated earlier, I have serious concerns about the racial and gender bias of the DBE Program. However, to eliminate it without a suitable Government-wide replacement program focused on equal opportunity would be counterproductive and shortsighted. 
Mr. President, all Americans--regardless of who they are, where they live, or their gender or skin color--all Americans deserve the opportunity to provide for their families, to pursue their aspirations, and to share fully in the American dream. Our efforts to assist the truly needy in our Nation should be focused on providing that opportunity equally. The American dream is based upon equality. History teaches us that there is no panacea for artificial barriers to opportunity, but no matter how intractable the problem, it is the essence of the American character to constantly advance our society so that social and economic progress of each generation exceeds that of its predecessor. No American is unimportant, and as a Nation we have an obligation to help those in need to help themselves. 
Our success in that endeavor is bound only by the limits of our energy and our imagination. We must recognize that poverty and economic disadvantage do not confine themselves within a certain race, gender, or ethnic group. Economically disadvantaged people reside in practically every community. We have an obligation to help these Americans even if they do not happen to live within areas of the most severe poverty. 
I suggest we target the root of the problem--lack of economic opportunity, not race, gender, ethnicity, and the like. Current programs focus on providing Federal assistance in contract preferences to businesses based on race or ethnicity of a business owner. We should reorient these programs to provide preferences to economically disadvantaged Americans, regardless of their race, creed, or color. 
A needy American is a needy American, no matter their race, creed, color, or gender. Certainly the Supreme Court's decision in the Adarand case emphasizes the reality that, by and large, race-based set-asides do not comport with the fundamental tenets of equality and equal protection. 
Let me add a few thoughts of my own to the suggestions of other Members as to a possible focus for solving these problems. In the last Congress, I introduced a bill which included a section designed to retarget our efforts and redirect Federal spending goals to assist economically disadvantaged individuals and businesses regardless of race, ethnicity, skin color, or gender. There are a number of other areas where we can, as a Nation, assist our citizens who are less well-off, particularly providing high-quality educational opportunities and accessible and affordable health care. Together, these are the kinds of parameters and programs that I believe would help provide important economic opportunity. 
The fundamental question is, shall our Government as a matter of policy prefer certain Americans because of their race or ethnicity or gender over other Americans, regardless of merit or need? 
An answer in the affirmative seems to contradict our aspirations for a color-blind society dedicated to the rights of the individual. An answer in the negative appears indifferent to the gross injustices that have been inflicted on various racial and ethnic groups who make up the American tapestry. 
The debate over contracting set-asides has focused too narrowly on either maintaining the status quo, with its inherent unfairness, or simply abolishing economic opportunity programs despite their potential to justly assist needy Americans. Fortunately, our options are neither so stark nor so limited. Rather, we can find the answer in reform. 
Reforming federal programs so that they are color-blind and gender-neutral and focused on assisting needy Americans rather than wealthy business owners, will help us to address the economic needs of Americans without pitting one group against another, thereby violating the dictates of fairness and equality. 
Mr. President, we cannot write a bill that will solve the problem of joblessness and poverty in our nation today. But I believe we can make significant gains by employing the kinds of incentives I and others of the Renewal Alliance have described today. I look forward to a future debate on these ideas to ensure that we craft incentives that will be as appropriate and cost-effective as possible in ending the cycle of poverty and dependence. 
Mr. President, let me make one suggestion to my colleagues. I believe the relevant committees should hold field hearings and engage the Americans who live in the poorest communities in the debate over how best we can help them to meet the needs of their families and their neighborhoods. Perhaps it's time we more diligently consult and work with real people and address their realities as we endeavor to address the needs of our great nation. 
Mr. President, let me close by saying to my fellow Republicans that our party has much at stake in this debate. As the party of Lincoln, our heritage and destiny is to be a party of all Americans dedicated to the principles of democracy, limited but efficient government, individual freedom and opportunity. 
Unfortunately, in discussing the inherent contradictions and shortcomings of affirmative action programs, the danger exists that our aspirations and intentions will be misperceived, dividing our country and harming our party. We must not allow that to happen. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Chafee for all of his efforts on this ISTEA issue. He has done a remarkable job. He is a remarkable man. I had the privilege of working for him when he was Secretary of the Navy, and he sometimes felt he didn't provide me with enough leadership at that time. But I am grateful for everything that he has done, and I'm especially grateful for his leadership on this very, very important issue to our Governors, our mayors, our county supervisors, and our city councils. 
I say to my friend from Rhode Island, about 50 county supervisors from my State were in yesterday, and this issue dominated their conversation. I am grateful that he has been able to work through this. So the small amount that we are responsible for in the Commerce Committee, I hope, adds to this bill and helps us to move forward as rapidly as possible. 
This amendment contains the proposal of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation to reauthorize ISTEA programs through fiscal year 2003. 
The amendment seeks to reauthorize the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] State safety grant programs, the Motor Carrier State Assistance program, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Safety Enforcement programs. 
The amendment also authorizes new and innovative safety initiatives at the Department of Transportation, including programs focusing on performance-based safety standards and advanced information data analysis. 
The amendment is designed to improve travel safety on our Nation's roads and waterways, promote the safe shipment of hazardous materials, protect underground pipelines and telecommunications cables from excavation damage, and ensure that our Nation's commercial motor vehicle fleet is well maintained and safely operated. 
Mr. President, this is a bipartisan product. It incorporates many of the proposals requested in the administration's ISTEA reauthorization submission. The committee product also includes a number of new transportation safety proposals. 
Senator Hollings and I have worked to accommodate as many Members' requests and concerns as possible, but there are some outstanding questions. 
One of the more difficult areas we faced concerned the many requests we received to provide statutory exemptions for one industry or another from certain motor carrier safety rules. Exemptions were sought from hours-of-service regulations and commercial driver's license requirements. These requests are not new. We face them every time Congress considers legislation affecting Federal motor carrier safety regulations. 
Senator Hollings and I worked diligently to avoid any statutory exemptions or regulation carve outs for single industries but to ensure there is a fair process by which all requests can be considered appropriately. 
Let me be clear. I agree that under certain circumstances, exemptions from regulations may make sense. For example, I believe it's appropriate to acknowledge the special transportation time constraints of farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons, and that we should recognize the need to permit infrastructure maintenance and repair to operate during weather emergencies. 
But blanket exemptions and wholesale legislative carve outs for selected businesses and enterprises can weaken safety. The answer is a fair and credible administrative process. 
The Secretary of Transportation currently has the authority to grant exemptions. However, the authority is relatively meaningless because prior to granting a waiver or exemption, it must first be proven the exemption would not diminish safety. That's an appropriate consideration, but how can DOT assess an exemption's safety risk if it can't first test the concept on a limited pilot basis? 
In an attempt to address this problem and recognize the Secretary should be permitted to examine innovative approaches or alternatives to certain rules, Senator Hollings and I have worked to define a process whereby the Secretary may more appropriately grant waivers and exemptions. This legislation would also authorize the Secretary to carry out pilot programs to test the affects of limited regulatory exemptions. I believe this pilot approach is reasonable and could be carried out in a structured manner that does not impose a risk on public safety. 
The committee's amendment includes three amendments adopted by voice vote when the Committee considered the safety amendment. The three amendments incorporate exemptions for three industries. 
When these three amendments were debated in the Commerce Committee, I pledged that I would work with the sponsor to craft a safe alternative to the exemptions. These efforts have not succeeded yet, and I want to inform my colleagues that there will be some proposals in the next hours or days to alter those exemptions. 
Finally, I want to thank Senator Hollings and the other members of the Commerce Committee who worked so long and hard to get to the Senate Floor today with this amendment. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt this critical and comprehensive amendment. 
Mr. President, before yielding the floor I want to comment briefly on the issue of airbags. Last year a compromise was reached on language to be inserted in the ISTEA legislation. 
I want to thank Senator Kempthorne for his leadership on this issue. He has done the nation a great service by leading the effort to ensure that airbags will not pose a risk to infants. 
We are all aware of the tragic accident in Idaho last year where an infant was decapitated by an airbag and of the other infants and children whose lives have been taken. Senator Kempthorne feels this issue personally and deeply and this amendment will help us address this very serious problem. 
I would also like to thank Senator Hollings, and Senators Bryan, Gorton, Abraham, Ashcroft, and others without whose involvement and help this compromise would not be possible. 
I also thank the Secretary of Transportation and the head of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. 
I will submit a more detailed statement on this issue later, but I would like to quickly summarize what's happening. This amendment deletes the airbag provision in the pending measure and replaces it with an alternative that codifies the current rule suspending the unbelted crash barrier test and requires the Secretary to begin rulemaking on advanced airbags that are more protective of infants, children and other occupants no later than June 1, 1998. 
The Secretary would complete the rulemaking next year and the rule will include a phase-in of advanced airbags beginning with model year 2001 and completed by no later than model year 2005. 
The pace of the phase-in shall be determined by the Secretary and shall be as rapid as practicable, but does permit the Secretary to postpone benchmark dates by one year with cause. Any further delays would require an Act of Congress.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment to S. 1173 offered by me and Senator Hollings, on behalf of the Commerce Committee, includes a subtitle relating to the Sport Fish Restoration and Recreational Boat Safety programs authorized and funded by several laws comprising the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program. These laws include the Dingell-Johnson Act of 1950, the Wallop-Breaux Amendments of 1984, the Wetlands Restoration Act of 1990, and the Clean Vessel Act of 1992. These laws, and the provisions of subtitle F in the amendment that I am offering today, are admittedly under the jurisdiction not only of the Commerce Committee, but also the Committee on Environment and Public Works. However, for the sake of expediency in reauthorizing ISTEA, the provisions relating to the Dingell-Johnson/Wallop-Breaux program in the ISTEA bill are being considered through this amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Our Committees have worked together on legislation relating to this program in the past, and on this particular amendment that we are offering today. Both the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Committee on Commerce each maintain jurisdiction over different components of this program. Both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Coast Guard implement different components of the program. The Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which is the funding source for the Program, is divided into the Sport Fish Restoration Account and the Boat Safety Account, which are closely intertwined with each other. For example, funds for boat safety programs come not only from the Boat Safety Account but also from the Sport Fish Restoration Account. In addition, unexpended funds in the Boat Safety Account roll over into the Sport Fish Restoration Account. This complicated flow of funds makes the programs almost inseparable. It is my opinion that while each Committee maintains jurisdiction over different components of the program, both Committees should work closely and collaboratively on legislation relating to this program.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as one who fought for 10 years to pass the line-item veto, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2631, which would restore $287 million for 38 military construction projects which were eliminated by the use of the line-item veto from the fiscal year 1998 Military Construction Appropriations Act. I urge my colleagues, a significant majority of whom supported enactment of the line-item veto authority, to vote against this egregious waste of taxpayers' dollars. 
Mr. President, many arguments have been mentioned as a compelling reason to restore this funding. Sadly, most of these arguments seem to be thinly veiled attempts to provide a convenient rationale for Congress' self-serving pork barrel spending. Some of my colleagues have argued that the President's use of the line-item veto to eliminate those unrequested low-priority military construction projects was politically motivated. These arguments conveniently ignore the possible political motivations of the Members of Congress who added the projects. 
Others defend various and sundry projects saying they meet the criteria established by Congress to provide a rudimentary method to evaluate group requests by Members of Congress for military construction add-ons. Others simply say that it is the prerogative of the Congress to add projects to the budget request. While true, Congress should not abuse its power over the purse strings by wasting money on special-interest projects in our home States or districts. Finally, some of my colleagues simply object to the line-item veto authority. Although I do not share their opinion, I respect it. 
Today, I would like to point out that the exercise we are completing today was set up in the Line-Item Veto Act to ensure that Congress has the last word in determining how Federal funds are spent. 
While I disagree with the expected outcome of the Senate's action on this veto override bill, I believe it supports the constitutionality of the line-item veto by demonstrating that the prerogatives of Congress to control the Government's purse strings are protected in the law. 
Now, I understand that not long ago my friend from Arkansas spent time talking about how terrible the line-item veto is. I do not quite understand how, in this setting, that my colleague would be averse to the line-item veto since what we are seeing is exactly what the line-item veto was intended to do, and that is, if the President vetoes and the Congress does not believe that that veto is warranted or legitimate, Congress has the right to override the veto. 
My friend, the Senator from West Virginia, kept talking about how terrible it would be if we enacted the line-item veto because then there would be this arrogance of power and blackmail exerted on Members of Congress. 
Have we seen any manifestation of that, Mr. President? I have not. And if anyone has, I would like to hear about it. Maybe I have missed something. 
The reality is, what we are seeing today is an affirmation--even though I regret what is probably the outcome--we are seeing an affirmation of the line-item veto. Because there will be times, I say to my colleagues, that the line-item veto will be exercised, and the President's line-item veto will not be overridden for various strong and compelling reasons. 
This is a time where as much as I object to it--and I will elaborate shortly about my objections--the President's veto will be overridden. So the process works. So there has not been a huge transfer of power as so eloquently articulated by some of my colleagues, most of them on the other side of the aisle, when we passed the line-item veto. This has not destroyed the entire appropriations process as was predicted. In fact, the opposite has happened. 
In my view, the President of the United States has exercised the line-item veto all too little--all too little. There are billions of dollars in these appropriations bills that he should have--that he should have--vetoed and did not. So to those of my colleagues who somehow use this particular exercise where we are about to override the President's veto as an argument against that line-item veto, I respectfully disagree with your assertion. This is an affirmation--an affirmation--that the Congress has indeed not abrogated its power nor consigned it to the executive branch. In fact, the opposite is happening. 
I look forward, as I have for the last 10 years, to debating this particular aspect of the issue with my most respected and revered colleague, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. 
Most of the arguments in favor of this bill miss the point that wasting scarce defense dollars on pork barrel projects is a disservice to the men and women who serve our military and is potentially detrimental to our national security. 
Mr. President, I want to repeat that. Most of the arguments in favor of this bill miss the central point of my remarks and the central point of this issue: Wasting scarce defense resources on pork barrel projects is a disservice to the men and women who serve in our military and is potentially detrimental to our national security. 
The question is not whether these unrequested military construction projects can be defended as meeting the Senate's review criteria or as actions within the prerogatives of Congress. The question is whether we are directing scarce defense resources where they will do the greatest good for our country and for the men and women of our All Volunteer Force. I believe we are not. 
Today, the United States has approximately 30,000 men and women deployed to the southwest Asia theater of operation, preparing to go into harm's way in Iraq if so ordered. There are 8,000 American troops deployed in support of peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and another 70,000 U.S. personnel deployed in support of other commitments worldwide. That is a total of 108,000 personnel of a 1.4 million men and women force, a force that is nearly half the size of our force a decade ago, deployed overseas in support of our Nation's interests. 
Now, Mr. President, that is a lot of people gone for a long time under very difficult conditions. We have an All Volunteer Force. I promise you, I promise my colleagues, if we continue to waste scarce defense dollars on unwanted projects, unwanted weapons systems and unneeded programs that have nothing to do with defense, you will see a dramatic and continued erosion of the All Volunteer Force. 
I will give you one example--one example--although I could give many. An Air Force pilot is obligated for 8 years of service after completion of that pilot's training. At the end of 8 years is the first time a pilot has the option of leaving or remaining in the U.S. Air Force. The year before last, 30 percent of those Air Force pilots who had the option of leaving the U.S. Air Force left. Last year, 60 percent--60 percent--of the most highly trained young men and women who are young Air Force pilots left the Air Force. What was the reason? There was primarily one reason that dwarfed all other reasons--too much time away from their homes and families; too much time away from their homes and families. Almost all of them are married. Almost all of them have children. And yet we are going to spend--in this case we will override $287 million--$287 million. I will describe to this body what that $287 million would buy. 
Never before has the U.S. military been more heavily committed overseas in time of peace, and not since before World War II has our standing force been this small. The increasing demands placed on our shrinking Armed Forces coincide with more than a decade of national defense budget cuts. In the last 10 years, the defense budget has been cut in half as a percentage of the gross domestic product and, in real spending terms, by over $120 billion. Yet, America's military personnel have performed admirably, bridging the gap between decreased funding and increased commitments with sheer dedication to duty and professionalism. 
Mr. President, in 1998, the U.S. Air Force is one-half the size that it was in 1991--one-half. The U.S. Air Force is half the size and has four times the amount of commitments that they had during the cold war--four times. Some of these young people are meeting themselves coming and going as they go from one deployment to another. 
By the way, one of the reasons why I am so skeptical about this latest agreement with Saddam Hussein is: We are going to keep our forces out there for an indefinite period of time? All these aircraft carriers, all these aircraft and people deployed for an indefinite period of time? 
Mr. President, I will tell you, it is called the All Volunteer Force--the All Volunteer Force. We are having trouble right now recruiting them, and we are having a terrific problem retaining them. They are responsible for some multimillion dollar and sometimes even billion dollars worth of equipment. 
The Clinton administration has consistently underfunded our Nation's defense requirements. Although the Republican Congress has increased funding overall for national defense, we failed to allocate those funds to meet the highest priority needs of our Armed Forces. 
In fact, the tendency of Congress to waste billions of defense dollars on low-priority pork projects may be just as potentially harmful to our national security as the administration's neglect of those needs in its budget requests. 
Last month--last month--the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, sounded a warning about the state of readiness of our forces. He said:  
There is no question that more frequent deployments affect readiness. We are beginning to see anecdotal evidence of readiness issues in some units, particularly at the tactical level of operations. 
To many of us, these words sound a lot like the cautious criticisms of top military leaders in the late 1970s, when our Army had been hollowed out after years of inadequate funding and inattention to training and operational readiness. It took nearly a decade to restore force readiness and the morale of our troops. 
Let us look at the warning signs of declining readiness. 
Recruitment and retention shortfalls are beginning to significantly impact our Armed Forces. 
The Army is not meeting requirements for infantry units which are already undermanned; pilot shortages are affecting all of the services. 
Large force training exercises have been reduced due to funding shortfalls. 
Last year, the military had to come hat in hand to Congress to ask for an additional half a billion to fund flying hour accounts to provide pilots and aircrews with required training. By the way, I have been told by the administration that they will be coming over for a supplemental appropriations bill to pay for the latest exercise in the Persian Gulf. I hope that is the case. It has not always been the case in the past. 
Aircraft maintenance backlogs are up. At last count, nearly $900 million was required to clear those backlogs. The Navy alone had 172 aircraft awaiting critical depot level maintenance in 1997. 
It has been reported that, of 200 tactical aircraft on the front line in the Arabian Gulf region, only 160 aircraft are mission capable. Let me emphasize, this is the front line force, the very force sent to the Gulf to prepare for combat. 
The aircraft at home are in worse shape. In many of today's Navy squadrons, commanders are forced to remove hydraulic actuators, flight control surfaces and laser targeting pods from shore-based squadrons in order to keep their deployed aircraft mission capable. 
Over the past three years, Congress has added more than $20 billion to the defense budget requests submitted by the Clinton Administration. So why do we still have these serious and growing deficiencies in readiness? Because the practice of Congress has tragically been to misuse billions of these scarce defense dollars to add unrequested programs and building projects to the defense budget. 
Let's look at military construction, which is just a small part of the defense budget. 
Since 1990, in 1998 dollars, the Congress has spent $8.2 billion on unrequested military construction projects, including new National Guard armories and reserve centers in every state. Not a single one of these projects was requested. Many were not in the long-range military construction plan. Some projects added by Congress were actually at facilities that were to be closed. We paid to build facilities at bases that were scheduled to be closed. 
One need only look at the 129 unrequested military construction projects at a cost of nearly $1 billion in the FY 1998 Military Construction Appropriations bill to realize the pork habit has become an addition. 
I have no doubt that many of the projects may be needed, but I do question whether any one of these low priority projects are more necessary than the basic welfare and readiness of our armed forces. If this veto is over-ridden and we have to pay the $287 million price tag for this bill, we will be sending an embarrassing message to the American taxpayer, and more importantly, to the men and women of our armed forces. 
The message we will be sending to aircraft mechanics is that we know they can't keep their aircraft mission capable because there are not enough parts. But Congress thought it more important that Fort Irwin, California get a new $8.5 million car wash and Oakdale, Pennsylvania get a new $25 million replacement reserve center. 
The message we will send to our pilots who are ready to go into harm's way is that, even though they have lost significant training opportunities due to budget cuts, Congress thinks it more important that there's a new $9.5 million facility at the Asian-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. 
Picture a young enlisted member and his family that must use food stamps to pay the grocer. What's the message to his family as they struggle to make ends meet? We found a way to spend $12.7 million on the construction of the Olympic village in Utah, a project for which land has not yet been purchased and where environmental concerns have not even begun to be addressed. 
Each of these projects were included in the long-term military construction plan of the Department of Defense, but in the year 2003, the very last year of the six-year plan. Certainly, projects in the earlier years of the FYDP should logically be deemed higher priority than these projects. There are over $32 billion worth of programs that the Pentagon included in its plan as higher priorities than these projects. 
There are other examples of projects that are less than critical to the primary mission of the services. 
$7.7 million was earmarked for the expansion of an ammunition supply point at Fort Bliss, Texas, at a facility that 
was upgraded in 1991, just a few years ago. 
Eight million nine hundred thousand dollars was added to build a civil engineering complex at Grissom Air Reserve base in order to improve facilities that were admittedly serviceable but not optimum. It is interesting to note that the DoD project data sheet was blank regarding the planned year of the project. 
At a time when the rest of the Defense Department was shrinking, $14 million was set aside for an aircraft hangar at Johnstown, PA, for an activity that had not yet stood up into existence. 
So why did Congress deem these projects worthy of fiscal year 1998 funding? Because a Member of Congress asked that they be moved forward, and because that's the way these deals have always been made. 
Mr. President, the message will get through, loud and clear, to the men and women who volunteered to serve their country that Congress cares more about pork-barrel spending than their well-being. And a vote to over-ride the veto of $287 million in unrequested, low-priority military construction projects is an endorsement of each and every one of those messages. 
Our military is wearing out its machines and wearing out its people. Military health care remains under funded, and there are reports that as many as 11,787 service members and their families are on food stamps. These are the priority problems facing our armed forces, and we, the Congress, are not addressing them. 
What could we have done with the $8.2 billion we wasted on unnecessary military construction projects? 
According to recent estimates, the costs incurred in support of peacekeeping in Bosnia total $6.7 billion. The estimated costs of the force buildup in the Persian Gulf will be about $1 billion. We could have paid the bills of those commitments and still had nearly half-a-billion dollars left. 
That $500 million would be enough to fully fund the short-term modernization of the Navy and Marine Corps Hornet fleet. That modernization would put new radios, global positioning equipment, upgraded defensive countermeasures, improved mission computers and a datalink system that would make all 618 C and D model Hornets ready today to operate in the information centered warfare environment of the next millennium, not to mention be better equipped to face Iraqi defenses, if necessary. 
And that's just the military construction pork. In last year's Defense Appropriations bill, Congress added nearly $2 billion for programs that were clearly funded for special interests in their States or districts. Since we added only $2.6 billion overall to the defense budget last year, clearly, pork-barrel spending consumed the entire add-on and more, and took precedence over the real priorities for national security. 
Unfortunately, we cannot undo the damage done by past wasteful spending. Today, however, we are faced with the historic opportunity to halt the source of Congress' undisciplined spending and prevent the waste of defense dollars in the future. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity to send the right message to our servicemen and women by voting against the veto over-ride. It is the right thing to do. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the senior Senator from Maine for all her tireless work to craft and garner support for this amendment and one that deserves the Senate's support and one that improves the underlying language in the McCain-Feingold amendment. On that basis alone, the fact that this amendment improves the underlying language, I hope that all my colleagues will support it. 
The amendment has been summarized many times. I will summarize it very simply. It expands current law that bans direct participation by corporations and unions in elections. Specifically, it prohibits corporate and union funds from being used in broadcast electioneering that mentions a candidate's name or uses his or her likeness within 60 days of an election. 
And the second aspect of it, of course, as we know, is disclosure. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment places no--I repeat--no restrictions on independent groups spending money to advocate their cause. It does however mandate that they disclose their contributors. 
Mr. President, it is beyond my ability to reason why anyone would oppose disclosure. As mandated by law, I, and each and every one of my colleagues, discloses to the FEC the names and amounts of our contributors. Why should others who engage in electioneering not engage in such similar actions? 
I have no desire to hide who gives to my campaign. In fact, I am proud to make public such information. And I am equally proud to stand up and support, through my actions and in some cases contributions, the causes that I believe in. 
For example, Mr. President, I have a hundred percent pro-life voting record. Some of my colleagues feel strongly on the other side of this subject. But I am willing to stand here and defend my position because I believe it is the right thing to do. And I am happy to have pro-life groups identify me as a supporter of this cause. There is no reason to hide and to not disclose such support. Therefore, I cannot fathom why some interest groups would fight the disclosure amendment. What are they afraid of? 
Again, Mr. President, I strongly support the efforts of Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords. I hope that later today this amendment will not be tabled and we can move forward to adopt both this amendment and the majority leader's amendment on restricting the FCC from overstepping its authority by mandating free broadcast time and move forward on this bill. Both amendments are good and worthy of support. 
Yesterday, I asked if it would be possible to move both amendments independently. I have been engaged in talks on this matter and hope we can soon resolve the problem. I will continue to fight to see this bill move forward. As daunting as that battle may be, we will continue to fight to pass needed necessary campaign finance reform. 
Again, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Snowe, who has worked tirelessly to try to craft a proposal that will bridge some of the differences that we have. I am grateful for all of her 
efforts. 
Mr. President, I yield back to Senator Snowe the balance of my time.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to extend thanks, as is customary at the end of debates such as these, to the majority leader for agreeing to schedule this vote and to the minority leader for all of his help in this effort, Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader. I would like to thank Senator McConnell of Kentucky for again conducting the debate, which is distinguished by its lack of rancor and by its adherence to an honest and open difference of opinion, a fundamental difference but one that I believe is strongly held by both Senator McConnell and myself. 
As always, I want to thank my dear friend, Senator Feingold, who, in my view, represents the very best in public service. As he and I differ on a broad variety of issues, we have always agreed on the principle of the importance, the integrity, and the honor associated with public service. 
Mr. President, since last year, a number of things have been happening since we had votes last September. A very good manifestation of how this system is out of control was contained in the January 17 Congressional Quarterly about the California House race that is taking place. 
I will not go into all the details. This was January 17. On March 10 there is an election. It lists noncandidate spending in the California special: Campaign for Working Families, $100,000; Americans for Limited Terms, $90,000; Foundation for Responsible Government, $50,000; Planned Parenthood Action Fund, $40,000; Catholic Alliance, $40,000; California Republican Assembly, $16,000; and the list goes on and on and on. 
Millions of dollars are being spent in a House race in California. And you know what, Mr. President? Those funds and 
those campaigns are not being conducted by the candidates. They are being conducted by organizations that enter into these races that sometimes have no connection with the candidate themselves. And you know they all have one thing in common. They are all negative, Mr. President, they are all negative. 
One of the radio ads says, `Call Bordonaro and tell him you're not buying Planned Parenthood. Tom Bordonaro is the definition of a religious political extremist.' That came from Planned Parenthood. 
The same thing on both sides. You will never see one of these, Mr. President, in a so-called independent campaign that says, `Vote for our guy or woman. They're very decent and wonderful people.' Then we wonder why there is the cynicism and the lack of respect for those of us who engage in public service. 
Mr. President, since last year there have been several indictments that have come down. One thing I can predict to you with absolute certainty on this floor; there will be more indictments, Mr. President, and there will be more scandals and more indictments and more scandals and more indictments and more people going to prison until we clean up this system. There is too much money washing around. This money makes good people do bad things and bad people do worse things. 
I guarantee you, Mr. President, this system is so debasing as it is today that we will see lots of indictments, prison sentences and, frankly, these investigations reaching levels which many of us had never anticipated in the past. 
We have also, thanks to our tenacity, gotten a vote. For the first time, Members of the Senate will be on record on campaign finance reform. I have no doubt about what this vote is about. It is on campaign finance reform. 
Later, hopefully, we will have a vote on the Snowe amendment, which I think is a compromise which is carefully crafted and one that deserves the support of all of us. I believe that we are closer to the point that I have long espoused and advocated to my friends and colleagues from both sides of this issue. We are closer to the point where all 100 of us agree that the system is broken and needs to be fixed and we need to sit down together and work out the resolution to this terrible problem which is afflicting America, which we can work out in a bipartisan fashion that favors neither one party nor the other. 
The American people are demanding it, the American people deserve it, and the American people will get it. Mr. President, we will never give up on this issue because we know we are right in the pursuit of an issue that affects the very fiber of American life and American Government. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.

But my question to the majority leader is that, following disposition of his amendment, either through tabling or up-or-down vote, would the majority leader be amenable to a unanimous consent request that Senator Snowe's amendment be taken up without amendment, so that the Senate can vote on this issue?

Because, if it serves just to kill our ability to vote on the Snowe amendment, then obviously that may not be something that I would want to support.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud that today we begin what promises to be a thorough and responsible debate on the issue of campaign finance reform. I say responsible because I anticipate that in the course of this debate Senators will make unmistakenly clear whether they support or oppose meaningful reform. Senators will cast votes on at least one reform proposal, the revised McCain-Feingold legislation, and probably other proposals such as the one to be offered by Senator Snowe before we vote on whether or not to invoke cloture. 
Previous debates have ended, unsatisfactorily, in a series of cloture votes which, as we all know, tended to discourage good faith compromises among Senators who are genuinely committed to finding a fair and effective solution to the disreputable state of modern campaign financing. Moreover, cloture votes sometimes obscure from the public a Senator's true position on the issue in question. By the end of this debate, whichever argument prevails, Senators will be on the record in support or opposition to reform, and, thus, accountable to their constituents who may then register their approval or disapproval at the polls. 
Mr. President, I believe an open debate, which considers amendments representing various views on the subject of reform, will encourage Senators on both sides of the issue to pursue a majority consensus on what can be done to improve our obviously and appallingly dysfunctional campaign finance system. Should our debate result in honest progress toward an acceptable compromise we may not even need to hold cloture votes. Of course, this is an ideal result of the debate we commence today, and I recognize that we are a long way from achieving it. But I believe, with just a minimum of good faith on all sides, we can get there. 
But even if we fall short again, Mr. President, Senators will have shown ourselves willing to stand up for our beliefs and risk the people's judgment when next we stand for election. I am proud of my colleagues for having the courage of their convictions. 
Mr. President, I want to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, for agreeing to return to this subject, and allow Senators to express their views by means usually employed in Senate debates--by means of amendment. I wish also to thank my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, who has long shown he has the courage of his convictions, for agreeing to resume debate in this manner. 
I want also to thank the Minority Leader for his essential assistance in helping use to arrive at this important moment. I want to thank Senators Snowe, Jeffords and Chafee along with Senator Levin for their efforts to help the Senate achieve a meaningful consensus on a contentious issue involved in this debate, and all Senators, on both sides of the aisle and the issue, who have worked hard to ensure that this issue is fairly addressed by this Senate. 
I wish to thank all the co-sponsors of McCain-Feingold, both Republicans and Democrats, with a special thanks to a hardy band of determined Republicans, Senators Thompson, Collins and Specter who have labored long and hard to change what we believe to be a mistaken majority view among our fellow Republicans. 
Lastly, I want to especially thank my tireless, resourceful and passionately committed friend, Senator Feingold. I have been in Congress for many years now, and I have never worked with a more dedicated or able member of this institution to pass legislation of such importance to our political system. He has inspired my own determination, and I am grateful to him. 
Mr. President, we will hear from many Senators, representing several points of view, during the course of this debate. I look forward to debating various provisions of our legislation, as well as amendments offered by my colleagues on a range of issues related to campaign finance reform. As I have said, many times in the past, this is a necessary and important debate. The issue of campaign finance reform merits our most serious attention. Indeed, I believe it deserves to be a central focus of this Congress' work. I believe this so strongly because I think it is beyond doubt that the way we finance our elections in this country has caused the people we represent to doubt our personal integrity and the integrity of the institution we are privileged to serve. And that, my friends, is a concern that should call us all to action. 
The substitute that Senator Feingold and I offer today represents a substantial change from S. 25, the original McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill, but at the same time, maintains the core of the original bill. 
I strongly support all the provisions of the original bill. And as I have stated in the past, as the debate proceeds, Senator Feingold and I intend to offer amendments that would restore the component parts of our original bill. We intend to proceed to those amendments in good time. 
Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement that the Senate entered into last year, the Senate will now turn to the bill S. 25 as modified, as an amendment to an original underlying bill. Later I will discuss my thoughts on the underlying bill, but now I would like to outline for my colleagues the contents of our proposal. 
Before I elaborate on the provisions of the bill, I want to remind my colleagues of three points: 
One--For reform to become law, it must be bi-partisan. This is a bi-partisan bill. It is a bill that effects both parties in a fair and equal manner. 
Two--Reform must seek to lessen the role of money in politics. Spending on campaigns in current, inflation adjusted dollars continues to rise. In constant dollars, the amount spent on House and Senate races in 1976 was $318 million. By 1986, the total had risen to $645 million. And in 1996 to $765 million. Including the Presidential races, over a billion dollars was spent in the last race. And as the need for money escalates, the influence of those who have it rises exponentially. 
Three--Reform must seek to level the playing field between challengers and incumbents. Our bill achieves this goal by recognizing the fact that incumbents almost always raise more money than challengers and as a general rule, the candidate with the most money wins the race. If money is forced to play a lesser role, then challengers will have a better chance.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Secretaries of Defense and State have been pursuing political support, both in the Congress and among our allies, for the use of military force against Iraq. 
I come to the floor today to express my support for a military strike against Iraq and to urge our colleagues and our allies to join us in supporting our troops and our Commander-in-Chief. The unfortunate impasse which has precluded a full and conclusive Senate debate on a formal resolution of support should not be misconstrued. Clearly, when and if the time comes, an overwhelming majority in this body will support decisive action to end the threat to our security that Iraq continues to pose. Saddam Hussein should have no doubt about that. 
We in government are frequently accused of demonizing our enemies in order to garner popular support here at home for the kind of actions we are currently contemplating with regard to Iraq. President Bush was accused of doing precisely that during Operation Desert Shield. There is a considerable wealth of information pertaining to Saddam Hussein's years in power, though, that clearly indicates that we are dealing with as ruthless and brutal a dictator as exists anywhere in the world today. That is not demonizing an individual; it is accurately describing a man with the moral and ethical foundation required to employ chemical weapons against his own population; to assassinate any and all political rivals; to have his own sons-in-law executed; to massacre Kurdish populations in the north and Shiite communities in the south; to invade Kuwait and impose a barbaric occupation of that nation; and to continue to threaten neighboring countries despite the open revulsion with which much of the world has reacted to his years of rule. 
This is a regime that recognizes no restraint upon its conduct save that which is imposed by force of arms. As I have repeatedly stated here on the floor of the Senate, the actions for which Saddam Hussein must be held accountable represent nothing more than what is expected of any country that seeks to exist within a community of civilized nations. The Government of Iraq has imposed untold hardships on its people solely so that it can continue to develop and stockpile weapons of mass destruction--weapons that it has no moral compunction about using at the earliest opportunity and against any nation or segment of society. 
Linkages are repeatedly made between the U.S. posture toward Iraq and our role in the Middle East peace process. Mr. President, that argument cries out for denunciation at the highest levels of every government. We may not like the way every policy of or tactic by the democratically elected government in Israel, but the physical pain and psychological trauma that afflicted Israel as a result of completely unprovoked missile attacks by an Iraqi regime seeking to tear asunder the multinational coalition arrayed against it and Tel Aviv's refusal to retaliate despite ample justification for doing so stands in strong contrast to the Government of Iraq. There is no basis for comparison, and U.S. policy toward Iraq should not legitimize the perception of linkage by deferring to it. 
The United Nations must enforce its resolutions and do so with conviction. And this body must acknowledge that only the United States possesses the capability to conduct the kind of military operations most of us agree are warranted and essential. That means conveying to the President, to the American people, and to the world, the message that Congress stands firmly behind the Commander-in-Chief in carrying out his responsibility to ensure that the threat to regional stability posed by Iraq is not permitted to endure in perpetuity. 
Mr. President, we should make clear to the American people and to the world that the Congress agrees with the proposition that evil should not be permitted to triumph. The United States must respond forcefully, far more so than it has in the past, to Iraq's unceasing provocations and it must adopt whatever measures will ensure the removal from power of the ruling regime in Baghdad. 
We must prepare the groundwork for a process that may take years to bear fruit and that will certainly entail loss of life. Opposition forces friendly to and supported by the United States were badly decimated by Iraq's 1996 incursion into supposedly protected territory in northern Iraq. Survivors are understandably bitter and reluctant to cast their lot with us again. That is why the air and missile strikes we launch against Iraq must be decisive and not the kind of exceedingly limited response characterized by the 27 cruise missiles launched against targets unrelated to that violation of the northern exclusion zone. 
We must support a long-term operation involving opposition forces trained and equipped to conduct a successful revolution. This is not an easy course that I and others are recommending. But it is the only viable approach to removing a threat to the most volatile region in the world--a threat that could include the brandishing of chemical, biological, and some day, nuclear weapons. That is not a situation any of us want to see develop. But develop it will, if we do not act to prevent it. 
Mr. President, I am confident the Congress will soon have the opportunity to express formally its support for the use of force to respond to that threat. Were there another way, I would gladly accept it, but experience teaches that there is not. I would never want to see myself viewed as beating the drums of war, but I would rather live with that image than look into the mirror and see a Member of Congress who failed to do his duty of supporting our troops in harm's way and our Commander-in-Chief in taking the kind of measures I sincerely believe are necessary to resolve the Iraqi problem once and for all. 
Mr. President, I again express my appreciation for the courtesy of the Senator from North Dakota in allowing me to make this statement. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about the nomination of Dr. William Satcher to become the United States Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
I have been closely following the Senate debate regarding Dr. Satcher's nomination and his qualifications to serve as the next Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services. In particular, I found his views regarding partial birth abortion and his role in clinical AZT trials to treat patients infected with HIV in Africa and Southeast Asia disturbing. 
While Dr. Satcher initially expressed his opposition to partial birth abortions, he also stated that he shares President Clinton's view that a ban on this procedure should include an exception for cases in which the procedure might be needed to protect the health of a pregnant woman. This raises serious concerns for me, since I am adamantly opposed to partial birth abortions except to save the life of a woman. This is a procedure which is inhumane and offensive to anyone who values human life. No matter what a person believes regarding the legalization of abortion, we should all be appalled and outraged by the practice of partial birth abortions. 
Since these concerns were raised, however, Dr. Satcher has provided written assurances regarding his intentions if nominated. Dr. Satcher wrote, `I have no intention of using the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I share no one's political agenda and I want to use the power of these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans--not divide them.' Dr. Satcher also wrote that he would promote a message of abstinence from premarital sex and behavioral responsibility to our youth. This is a commendable objective that should be promoted among our nation's youth. 
The other major concern raised for me was Dr. Satcher's role in clinical trials of AZT conducted in Africa and Southeast Asia. In 1994, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that studies be conducted to test the safety and efficacy of short-term AZT therapy in developing countries in reducing the transmission of HIV from pregnant women to their babies. This study was needed because 1,000 babies are born every day infected with HIV in developing nations. This study was intended to determine an effective and affordable treatment for women in the nations that can not afford the expensive AZT and are unable to receive intravenous treatments. The developing nations, in conjunction with the WHO, determined that placebo controlled trials offered the best method for determining an alternative to the expensive and culturally incompatible AZT drug treatment. 
After reviewing the available materials on these studies and conferring with Senator Frist, who is a practicing medical physician and has extensive knowledge and experience with the complex issue of biomedical ethics, I am confidant that these AZT trials were conducted in a scientifically sound and ethical manner. It is my understanding that the appropriate protocols for these clinical trials were developed and extensively reviewed for scientific and ethical integrity by Institutional Review Boards in the United States and by equivalent committees in the counties conducting the clinical trials. According to these medical standards, it is clear that the CDC's decision, under the guidance of Dr. Satcher, regarding the AZT trials researching methods for providing functional, affordable and effective care to people worldwide was based on sound ethics and science. 
Mr. President, I believe that the individual who fills the position of Surgeon General must be a person who unites our nation and promotes healthy living. This individual must place the health and well-being of our nation's citizens far above any political agenda. They must provide leadership in disease prevention and health promotion throughout our country by developing innovative and worthwhile public health initiatives. In short, our nation's Surgeon General must be capable of serving as a national symbol of commitment to protecting and improving the public's health. 
After carefully reviewing all the facts surrounding Dr. Satcher's professional career and consulting with members of the medical community, including our colleague, Senator Frist, I am confident that Dr. Satcher is well-qualified to serve this nation in these important public health positions. It is my belief that the concerns raised about Dr. Satcher have been adequately and openly addressed. I believe that he has continually demonstrated his commitment to public health throughout his life and is ready and willing to continue these efforts as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services. Therefore, I am confident that when Dr. Satcher is confirmed as the next U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, he will serve the health needs of our nation and I will support his efforts.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998. This legislation is aimed at putting an end to an abusive and unscrupulous practice that affects thousands and thousands of consumers every year. Joining me as a co-sponsor of this legislation are Senator Fritz Hollings, the Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator Frist and Senator Snowe, also Members of the Committee. I am most grateful for their support in this important effort. 
`Slamming' is the unauthorized changing of a consumer's long-distance carrier. A consumer who is slammed often receives lower-quality service or is charged higher rates. Sometimes consumers are not even aware that they have been slammed until they get their bills. When they realize what has happened, they have to go through the aggravation of getting their service switched back to their original carrier and having their bills adjusted. And they often find it difficult to secure compensation for any additional damages they may have incurred. 
Mr. President, last year alone over 20,000 consumers filed slamming complaints with the FCC. This is by far the largest category of complaints the FCC received. When you stop to consider that only a small fraction of all consumers who are slammed actually file complaints about it with the Commission, the real dimensions of the problem become apparent. And those dimensions are growing: last year's 20,000 complaints represented a 25 percent increase in the number of complaints filed in 1996, despite the fact that the FCC adopted new rules to discourage slamming. 
The reality we face is that unless Congress supplements by law what the FCC can do by regulation, this already bad problem will only get worse. This legislation will attack slamming in two ways: it will establish stringent anti-slamming safeguards to deter slamming from happening in the first place, and it will enlarge the remedies available to punish slammers and make consumers whole if it does. The bill does this by prescribing definitive procedures for telephone companies to follow, providing alternative ways for consumers to obtain redress for having been slammed, and giving federal and nonfederal authorities the power to impose tough sanctions, including high fines and compensatory and punitive damages. 
The bill takes a straightforward approach. It prohibits a telephone company from changing a consumer's telephone service unless the company obtains a verbal, written, or electronic verification from the subscriber showing that the subscriber has consented to the change. The company making the change will be required to 
retain this verification. If a consumer charges a company with slamming, the company has 120 days in which to satisfy the consumer's complaint. If it does not do so, the company must promptly advise the consumer of that fact, and give the consumer a copy of the verification and information about how to pursue the complaint with the FCC and about all other available remedies. If a company ignores a consumer's slamming complaint, it will be subject to the penalty for slamming. 
The bill then provides for simple, streamlined complaint resolution procedures at the FCC, requiring the Commission to issue a decision on the carrier's liability within 150 days. It broadens the Commission's enforcement powers by authorizing it to award both compensatory and punitive damages, and requires that damages be awarded within 90 days of the liability determination. It directs the FCC not to levy a fine of less than $40,000 against first-time offenders and $150,000 for repeat offenders absent mitigating circumstances, and it empowers the FCC to prosecute slammers who refuse to pay their fines. The bill also enables consumers to go after slammers in court instead of at the FCC through a state class-action suit. These alternatives--consumer action at the FCC and state action in court, backed up by stiff monetary penalties--will provide both a sword against past slamming and a shield against future slamming. 
Finally, Mr. President, the bill assures that the FCC will detect and deter other problems that might result in slamming. It requires the Commission to report to Congress on telephone companies' telemarketing practices, to recommend whether it would be in the public interest to levy penalties directly on telemarketers or on other entities not currently subject to the bill's provisions, and to promptly adopt rules proscribing any deliberately deceptive or misleading telemarketing practices disclosed by the report. 
The bottom line here, Mr. President, is that slamming has to stop, once and for all, and this bill means to stop it.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Internet School Filtering Act, which is designed to protect children from exposure to sexually explicit and other harmful material when they access the Internet in school and in the library. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Hollings, Coats, and Murray as cosponsors of this legislation, and I thank them for their assistance in this important effort. 
This legislation comes to grips with a regrettable but unavoidable problem. Today, pornography is widely available on the Internet. According to Wired magazine, today there are approximately 28,000 adult Web sites promoting hard and soft-core pornography. Together, these sites register many millions of `hits' by websurfers per day. 
Mr. President, there is no question that some of the websurfers who are accessing these sites are children. Some, unfortunately, are actively searching for these sites. But many others literally and unintentionally stumble across them. Anyone who uses seemingly innocuous terms while searching the World Wide Web for educational or harmless recreational purposes can inadvertently run into adult sites. For example, when the word `teen' is typed into a search engine, a site titled `Teenagesex.com' is the first search result to appear. 
Mr. President, parents have a responsibility to monitor their children's Internet use. This is their proper role, and no amount of governmental assistance or industry self-regulation could ever be as effective in protecting children as parental supervision. 
Parental supervision, however, is not possible when children use the Internet while they are away from home, in schools and libraries. The billions of dollars per year the Federal government will be giving schools and libraries to enable them to bring advanced Internet learning technology to the classroom will bring in the Internet's explicit online content as well. These billions of dollars will ultimately be paid for by the American people. So it is only right that if schools and libraries accept these federally-provided subsidies for Internet access, they have an absolute responsibility to their communities to assure that children are protected from online content that can harm them. 
And this harm can be prevented. The prevention lies, not in censoring what goes onto the Internet, but rather in filtering what comes out of it onto the computers our children use outside the home. 
Mr. President, Internet filtering systems work, and they need not be blunt instruments that unduly constrain the availability of legitimately instructional material. Today they are adaptable, capable of being fine-tuned to accommodate changes in websites as well as the evolving needs of individual schools and even individual lesson-plans. Best of all, their use will channel explicit material away from children while they are not under parental supervision, while not in any way inhibiting the rights of adults who may wish to post indecent material on the Web or have access to it outside school environs. 
Mr. President, it boils down to this: The same Internet that can benefit our children is also capable of inflicting terrible damage on them. For this reason, school and library administrators who accept univeral service support to provide students with its intended benefits must also safeguard them against its unintended harm. I commend the efforts of those who have recognized this responsibility by providing filtering systems in the many educational facilities that already have Internet capability. This legislation assures that this responsibility is extended to all other institutions as they implement advanced technologies funded by federally-mandated universal service funds. 
Mr. President, this bill takes a sensible approach. It requires schools receiving universal service discounts to use a filtering system on their computers so that objectionable online materials will not be accessible to students. Libraries are required to use a filtering system on one or more of their computers so that at least one computer will be appropriate for minors' use. Filtering technology is itself eligible to be subsidized by the E-rate discount. Once a school or library certifies that it will use a filtering system, they will be eligible to receive universal service fund subsidies for Internet access. If schools and libraries do not so certify, they will not be eligible to receive universal service fund-subsidized discounts. 
Some have argued that the use of filtering technology in public schools and libraries would amount to censorship under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has found, however, that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment. And insofar as other sexually-explicit material is concerned, the bill will not affect an adult's ability to access this information on the Internet outside the school environment, and it will in no way impose any filtering requirement on Internet use in the home. Perhaps most important, the bill prohibits the federal government from prescribing any particular filtering system, or from imposing a different filtering system than the one selected by the certifying educational authority. It thus places the prerogative for determining which filtering system best reflects the community's standards precisely where it should be: on the community itself. 
Mr. President, more and more people are using the Internet each day. Currently, there may be as many as 50 million Americans online, and that number is expected to at least double by the millennium. As Internet use in our schools and libraries continues to grow, children's potential exposure to harmful online content will only increase. This bill simply assures that universal service subsidies will be used to defend them from the very dangers that these same subsidies are otherwise going to increase. This is a rational response to what could otherwise be a terrible and unintended problem.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a decision to send our military personnel into combat is the most serious policymakers can make. We do not or should not cavalierly discuss military options without losing sight of the human dimension that people, whether our own uniformed personnel or innocent civilians in the country against which we take action, will die. 
We were correct to strike Libya in 1986, although we mourned the loss of lives of innocent people whose sole crime was to live in a dictatorship that provoked us to action. We were correct to liberate Grenada and Panama, despite the loss of life that accompanied those conflicts. And we were correct to conduct overwhelming airstrikes against Iraq in order to evict it from Kuwait, but we regret the deaths of civilians cynically placed in harm's way by that country's regime. And we have been correct in the past to launch punitive missile strikes against Iraq in response to its violation of the U.N. resolutions. 
We now stand on the precipice of yet another military confrontation with Saddam Hussein and the military security forces that protect him. Iraq has repeatedly, over the span of 7 years, defied U.N. resolutions and agreements, negotiated in exchange for the termination of the Persian Gulf war. The demands made of Iraq are simple and reasonable and, if complied with in good faith, would not have unduly subjected it to violations of its sovereignty. Iraq was to destroy its existing stockpiles of banned weapons of mass destruction and its capability to reconstitute the scientific and industrial infrastructure for their development. It was to repatriate Kuwaiti prisoners after Iraq's brutal invasion and occupation of its smaller neighbor; and it was to compensate the victims of its aggression. 
Mr. President, it has not done any of these things. Instead, it has demonstrated for 7 straight years its contempt for the United Nations, for the agreements it has signed, and for the most simple norms of civilized behavior. 
Saddam Hussein has repeatedly pushed the international community to the brink and then pulled back just enough to head off military action. 
He has eluded the scale of punitive measures warranted by calculating the point at which his actions would result in serious retaliatory measures by the United States. He has gotten away with this because in those few instances when military action was taken against him, it was ineffectual. Nowhere was this more evident than the September 1996 cruise missile strikes against Iraqi targets following the most egregious violation to date: the large-scale military incursion into Kurdish territory and subsequent execution of anti-Saddam activists working with the United States. At that time, the forces involved in the incursion on what was supposed to be protected territory should have been directly and forcefully attacked. 
The United Nations Special Commission tasked with verifying Iraqi's compliance with U.N. resolutions has been systematically stymied at every point. Saddam Hussein has clearly placed a higher priority on continuing to develop the means to threaten his neighbors than on the welfare of children the fate of which Baghdad purports to decry. Iraq has received every conceivable opportunity to comply with legitimate and lawful demands and to join the community of nations as a member in good standing, and has spurned those opportunities. 
The nature of the regime of Saddam Hussein is impervious to any peaceful effort at resolution of the ongoing conflict. There is every reason to believe that Iraq continues to possess chemical and biological weapons and the means to deliver them. There is no indication that it aspires to live in peace with its neighbors; on the contrary, I have no doubt that if the opportunity arose, it would again attempt to retake Kuwait. It certainly aspires to participate in the destruction of Israel. 
The time for talk may be over. The chairman of the U.N. Special Commission has thrown up his hands in dismay. The approaching option is the large-scale and protracted use of military force. Diplomacy, certainly the optimal approach, has failed thus far. Withdrawing our forces and lifting the sanctions would enable Iraq to fully rearm and openly threaten to destabilize the region, brandishing the very banned weapons at issue. Not only should sanctions not be lifted, they should in fact be tightened. Existing no-fly zones should continue to be enforced and expanded, perhaps to include no-drive zones targeted against Republican Guard armored units. 
The only viable military option is to inflict serious damage on the Iraqi Republican Guard and destroy the compounds and `palaces' Saddam has sought to protect. Ineffectual cruise missile and air strikes such as characterized past punitive actions, particularly in 1996 when 27 cruise missiles were launched against largely insignificant targets, will once again prove counterproductive. Domestic communications links should be targeted as well as military ones, in order to sever Saddam's ability to communicate to the Iraqi people. The expansion of our own broadcasting into Iraq aimed at influencing public opinion there should have been a higher priority all along. 
And we should be prepared to act alone if necessary. While Britain has stood by us and prepared to act with us, for which we should be grateful, it is disconcerting to witness the paucity of public support for enforcing legitimate U.N. resolutions. While some of us were in Germany this past weekend, it was gratifying to hear the German government come out in support of our efforts, but European support is less important right now than attaining the open support of the Middle Eastern governments that will play a vital role in dealing with the political ramifications within that region of any military actions we take against Iraq. In that respect, Saudi Arabia's decision to permit only the use of 
support aircraft from its territory is deeply disturbing. I understand Saudi, and all Arab, concern for the welfare of the Iraqi populace. And I am aware of the domestic and regional implications for the Saudi government of openly supporting air strikes against Iraq. The threat posed by Saddam Hussein against Saudi Arabia, as well as every other country in the region, however, argues forcefully for the government in Riyadh to be more openly supportive of our measures and to communicate to their people the simple fact that measures against Iraq occur solely because of that country's belligerent and unlawful stance. 
The military option, should it be chosen, must be designed to accomplish meaningful military objectives. Restraints on targeting intended to minimize criticism from other nations, whether friends, allies or potential foes, will have the effect of reducing the likelihood that objectives will be accomplished. It is clear that the United States will be widely criticized by many parties should we launch an attack against Iraq. As stated, it is of little comfort that some of those governments that criticize us publicly applaud us privately, as their populations take their cue from the public posture. Iraq has provided every incentive for us to strike, and we must not squander the opportunity to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction from the region by tailoring military actions to minimize the political outcry that will follow. Leadership and responsibility often entail unpopular actions, and the prosecution of actions that lead to deaths of many is a horrible burden to bear. But bear it we must. 
The key to a long-term resolution of the Iraq problem lies largely in one man, or, to be more precise given what is known about his sons, one family. The United States should adopt stronger measures aimed at undermining the ruling regime through greater support of dissident elements both within and outside of Iraq. Saddam's internal security apparatus has proven enormously effective at defeating such elements in the past, and I am under no illusions about the scale of the effort required to get the job done. It is an effort, however, that must be made. Considerable opposition to Saddam and his family exists inside Iraq and, particularly, among exiled dissident groups. The Administration should organize a more concerted effort at unifying these dissident elements and providing the logistical support needed to bring about the collapse of Saddam's regime. Financial support toward this end is already at hand in the form of Iraqi assets frozen after its invasion of Kuwait. The current and future Administrations should budget appropriately for the costs of such an operation within the international operations discretionary portion of the federal budget--not out of a defense budget already suffering the effects of seeing resources diverted to various contingency operations. 
I do not adopt this stance lightly. On the contrary, I wish there were another way, but I know there is not. I regret very much that American personnel may lose their lives in any military operation we conduct against Iraq and I mourn the loss of those innocent Iraqis who want nothing more than to live in peace. But Saddam Hussein has left us no choice. 
Mr. President, it is imperative that this body convey to the President the support he needs in this time of domestic political crisis to employ the level of force necessary to bring closure to the situation with Iraq. For that to happen, though, the President should ask Congress for its support, not just welcome it if and when it comes. Politics stops at the water's edge, it is often said in discussions of foreign policy. We are at the water's edge, and the currents are threatening to sweep away U.S. credibility in the very region where we can least afford for that to happen. Vital U.S. interests are at stake, and it is time to act. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think we all ought to understand that if this amendment were accepted, it would kill our effort to rename Washington National Airport after President Ronald Reagan. So let's be very clear about the effect of this amendment. 
Second of all, again, I am intrigued by this continuous argument from the other side that Washington National Airport, which identifies the airport as servicing Washington, DC, is somehow George Washington. Obviously, we know that is not true. 
If we want to give local control to National Airport and the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, I strongly suggest to my friend, the distinguished Democratic leader, that we repeal the perimeter rule which is a Federal law which prevents aircraft from flying any further west than the far western end of the runway at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, a law that was passed by former Speaker of the House Jim Wright who happens, as we all know, to reside there. 
So, if we are going to give truly local control, I hope the distinguished Democratic leader would want to remove Federal laws that also affect Washington National Airport which, frankly, has affected the lives of millions of Americans for many years in preventing them from going from one end of this country to the other without stopping in between. 
So I say to my colleagues, have no doubt about the effect of this amendment. It would kill our ability to do an appropriate thing and, if I may add as an aside, I hope we get this done pretty soon, because I think everybody knows how we and the majority of the American people feel about this issue.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, many opponents of this legislation have expressed concerns about Congress stripping the local airport authority of its control. As many of my colleagues know, I have long advocated that the Federal Government get out of the business of running National and Dulles airports. The Federal Government, much to my chagrin, mandates the number of hourly operations at National Airport and the length of nonstop flights to and from National Airport, known to many of us as the so-called perimeter rule. My attempts to deregulate National Airport have been met with ardent local resistance. 
I just want to take this opportunity to say that National and those who represent it cannot just accept the Federal regulations that are convenient for them and that they like. 
If they oppose our activities with respect to an airport that's still federally owned, I urge them to step up and oppose all Federal statutes that specifically address Washington National, such as the perimeter rule. 
I say to those who are raising this concern about our involvement by acting congressionally in renaming the Washington National Airport the Ronald Reagan Airport, I hope that you will express at least a scintilla of that same zeal in trying to remove the Federal requirement that every flight that leaves National Airport can go no further than what, just by coincidence, turns out to be the western edge of the runway at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, which rule happened to have been put in by the former Speaker of the House, Jim Wright. I know that is purely coincidental. 
The reality is that there are very strict Federal regulations that govern National Airport and Dulles Airport, and those regulations should be removed. So I continue, of course, also to be amused at the fact that at Washington National Airport, hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue on an annual basis are lost, or perhaps millions, because of the reserved parking places for Members of the Congress, diplomats and judges. But that problem has been, to a large degree, solved, because the very clever and intelligent people that run Washington National Airport, when faced with occasional complaints by people who were struggling past empty parking lots with a sign on them that said `Reserved for diplomats, Members of Congress and Supreme Court Justices,' struggling people like women with children, elderly individuals who had to go much, much further away because these parking lots are reserved close in to the airport, they solved this problem for us, and it probably will not come up again, because they took down the signs that said, `Reserved for diplomats, Supreme Court Justices and Members of Congress,' and they put up signs that said, `Reserved.' So, for all intents and purposes, that problem is pretty well resolved. 
The fact is that it is outrageous and it is a disgrace. It is, again, an example of the Federal involvement in National Airport. 
I would like to be serious for just a moment, if I could. I want to thank Senator Coverdell. I thank Senator Coverdell for bringing this issue up and for his usual tenacity in seeing this thing through. But I also want to say it's not just tenacity that characterizes Senator Coverdell, it's a willingness to discuss and negotiate this issue with those on the other side of the aisle so we have reached what I think is a reasonable agreement that would resolve this issue. I thank my friends on the other side of the aisle who have been willing to enter into this agreement so we can have their legitimate concerns ventilated in the proper parliamentary fashion, the way we do business around here in the Senate. 
I was disturbed last Thursday when apparently we were going to go through some kind of filibustering over this issue, rather than resolve it in the way we are resolving it now. I didn't think it was a good way for us to start the year. So I thank my friends, especially the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for his characteristic willingness to resolve the differences we may have had. 
Each of these amendments which are germane will be voted on. I am sure many of them have merit. I remind my friends on the other side of the aisle, they feel very strongly and with great affection for their heroes. And their heroes are deserving of their respect and affection. And we on this side of the aisle share that respect and affection for their heroes. Perhaps not to the degree, but certainly we share the affection and respect. We also on this side of the aisle believe that Ronald Reagan did marvelous things, not only for all Americans but all citizens of the world in providing an opportunity for peace and freedom. He did keep the United States of America as a beacon of hope and freedom to all mankind and I believe that what we are going to do is exceedingly appropriate. I am pleased that we will be able to resolve this. I am sure that in the minds of many of us there is never any way we will be able to properly honor and commemorate his services to our Nation. What we are doing is done in a very small and insignificant fashion in the grand scheme of things. 
Again, I thank Senator Coverdell and I thank my friends on the other side of the aisle for their cooperation with us on this issue. I pledge, at least for myself and I think most people on this side of the aisle, that when an issue of this nature arises which is emotionally as well as intellectually important, that we will try to show and should show the same consideration to you as was displayed on this issue. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for bringing this issue forward in an expeditious fashion. I do believe President's Reagan's upcoming birthday is an important time for us to mark this occasion. I thank Senator Coverdell, whose original thought I believe this was, along with the encouragement of millions of Americans all across the country. I have a longer statement, I would say to the majority leader, that I would like to give after his remarks, but let me just say, briefly, I find this--I find this astounding, that we would block this. There have been many fallen leaders. There are many former Presidents we have had, and living Presidents, that--there has never been any problem with the naming of things. I have been told that there may be an effort to name the Justice Department after the late Robert F. Kennedy. I would strongly support such a thing and I believe most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would also. 
But for us to block this at this time, given President Reagan's condition--which we all are very well aware of--I think is unfortunate and, even worse, if this blocks this well-intentioned proposal to honor one of the most decent and nonpartisan and kindly people that I have ever had the privilege of knowing in politics, I think it would be a terrible mistake. 
I yield back to the majority leader. I will have further remarks later on. I thank the majority leader.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield in a couple minutes to the Senator from Georgia, but I first feel compelled to answer a couple of comments the distinguished Democratic leader and good friend of mine made. 
First of all, I don't think any American identifies Washington National Airport with George Washington. They identify it with Washington, DC. So let's really be clear about that. To take the word `Washington' out of it is not in any way demeaning or lessening the reputation of George Washington; it is because it was identified with Washington, DC. 
We named Idlewild Airport `Kennedy Airport.' I am sure 
whoever Idlewild was, or whatever location it was, didn't feel aggrieved when it wasn't called Kennedy-Idlewild Airport. 
Second of all, let's talk about the cost here one second. The bulk of the costs associated with the name change at National Airport are related to changing the signs and logos for the airport. 
I would like to enter into the Record a copy of a letter from a group, Americans for Tax Reform, which created and promoted the Reagan legacy project. The letter states: 
In order to ensure no expenses will be incurred by the Federal Government as a result of this bill, we are willing to coordinate fundraising efforts to fund the creation of appropriate signs and logos for the Ronald Reagan National Airport. 
The letter goes on to estimate these costs at $60,000. Let's put that in context. We just spent well over $1 billion in modernizing Washington National Airport. The cost of this would be $60,000. If there is a deep and abiding concern on the other side of the aisle about the costs associated with changing the name, I can assure you that Senator Coverdell, Senator Lott and I and everybody else will lead a fundraising effort and pay for this. I am deeply moved about their concern about the taxpayers' dollars. 
I don't like to start out the year this way, Mr. President. I really don't. We have enough problems. We have enough difficulties around here without our getting hung up on doing what is the right thing for one of the greatest men in the history of this Nation. 
The interesting thing is, he doesn't want to be honored in any way because he doesn't think he deserves it, which is the mark of the greatness and humility of the man. But for us to somehow get hung up on cost, on logos, on whether the name `Washington' is out of it, this is not an appropriate way to start out this year. 
I want to tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, we feel very strongly about this issue--very strongly--and if we get hung up on this thing and we are not able to go ahead and honor Ronald Reagan on his birthday, it is going to start things off on a very bad note. 
I also want to point out, yes, thanks to Senator Hollings and the bipartisan spirit in which we run the Commerce Committee, it was discharged from the Commerce Committee, but we also had a markup scheduled today, and we would have marked up that bill and reported it out of committee today as well. So I appreciate the cooperation of my friends on the Commerce Committee, but we would have reported it out of the Commerce Committee today, I have no doubt about that. 
Again, I don't want to be repetitive, but I am astounded--I am astounded--that when Americans from all over this country would like to have this opportunity to honor Ronald Reagan on his birthday as he goes through this very difficult period, that we should somehow raise a straw man about costs and logos and Washington, DC. 
Mr. President, I would like to conclude by saying I first came to know Ronald Reagan during my years in Vietnam when President Reagan was Governor of California. The North Vietnamese had orchestrated an effort to demoralize their American prisoners by convincing us that our country opposed the war and that we had been forgotten and left behind. 
As new American prisoners were brought to Hanoi, however, they took advantage of our primitive communications abilities. They made sure that we knew about this Governor in California who was helping lead efforts to secure our release and take care of our families in the meantime. This Governor, Ronald Reagan, served as a very welcome reminder that our country had not forgotten us. 
I and many others will forever be indebted to him for that and for the friendship we developed after the war. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wanted to update my colleagues on this issue of the cost of the renaming of Washington National Airport. C-SPAN viewership is up today because our phones have been ringing quite a bit, both in my office and Senator Coverdell's office and others. This is a fax that I received just an hour or so ago. It says: 
Dear Senator, I'm watching today's coverage of the Senate on C-SPAN. I note an objection to renaming Washington National Airport the Ronald Reagan National Airport was the $60,000 cost of new signs. In the way that I honor President Reagan and you, I humbly offer the $60,000 cost of these signs. 
I will repeat that, Mr. President. 
I honor President Reagan. . . . I humbly offer the $60,000 cost of these signs. Having lived in Alexandria for 5 years, I know that the Washington airport has always been considered the Washington, DC, National Airport, and any argument otherwise is simply partisan and specious. I support you and Senator Coverdell in your effort to honor President Reagan on his birthday, which sadly could be his last. 
Mr. President, I am not, obviously, going to give the name of the individual because of privacy considerations. But we are 
receiving call after call. 
Let's not, as we go through these arguments one by one concerning the airport, let's be sure that the cost of renaming the signs--I find it interesting. They just went through a $1-point-some billion remodeling without a single additional flight going in or out of the airport, yet the question is raised about a $60,000 renaming. 
Second, I want to point out again, it in no way affects the founder of our country, the father of our country, George Washington. I know Senator Coverdell and I--Senator Coverdell obviously speaks for himself, but I know of no objection if it was Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. I'm sure we could work out that difficulty. 
I yield to the Senator from Georgia.

Mr. McCAIN. Let me just finally say I am sorry this controversy has erupted. I hope we can work it out. I hope we can work it out within the next 24 hours amongst all of our colleagues in the Senate. I would like to move forward with it. As I said earlier, I regret we are starting out this year, the first real day of our session, in this kind of a difference of view. 
Let me just make one additional point. I cannot speak for the Members on this side of the aisle, but I understand the reverence that many Americans--not just Democrats but also Republicans--have for Robert Kennedy and Jack Kennedy and the entire Kennedy family. If there is some proposal to name the Justice Department building after Robert Kennedy, I would strongly support such an effort. And I would support such a thing in any way. Obviously, he was a former Attorney General of the United States. 
But let's not set up these straw men to kind of, certainly not poison the atmosphere here, but it's not a good way for us to begin. I know everyone knows how those of us who knew Ronald Reagan, and the vast majority of Americans, feel about him. So I hope we can get this thing resolved. Again, I thank Senator Coverdell, who served under President Reagan and knew him as well as anyone and whose idea this was for this very appropriate action. I just hope Senator Coverdell will be able to make a phone call out to California very soon, at the time of President Reagan's birthday, and inform both President Reagan and Mrs. Reagan that we are honoring him in this very small way. There really is no way we can ever fully honor him for what he has done for the Nation and the world. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill that will make Congressional Research Service Reports, Issue Briefs, and Authorization and Appropriations products available on a web site to the American people. Senator Coats, Senator Faircloth, and Senator Ashcroft are original co-sponsors to this bill. Additionally, Representative Shays will be introducing a companion bill over in the House. 
The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has a well-known reputation for producing high-quality reports and issue briefs that are unbiased, concise, and accurate. Many of us have used these CRS products to make decisions on a wide variety of legislative proposals and issues, including Amtrak, the Endangered Species Act, the Line Item Veto, and U.S. policy in Zambia. Also, we routinely issue these products to our constituents in order to help them understand the important issues of our time. 
This fiscal year, the American taxpayer will pay $64.6 million to fund the Congressional Research Service. Newspapers, such as the San Jose Mercury-News and the Austin American-Statesman, and watchdog groups, such as the Congressional Accountability Project, have recently asked the Congress to allow the public access to CRS resources. The American people have paid for these valuable resources and have a right to see that their money is being well spent. 
Congress can also serve two important functions by allowing public access to this information. First, public access to these CRS products will mark an important milestone in opening up the federal government. Our constituents will be able to see the research documents which influenced our decisions and understand the trade-offs and factors that we consider before a vote. This will give the public a more accurate view of the Congressional decision-making process to counter the prevailing cynical view of Members of Congress selling their votes to the highest campaign contributor. 
Also, these CRS reports will serve an important role in informing the public. Members of the public will be able to read 
these CRS products and receive a concise, accurate summary of the issues that concern them. As elected representatives, we should do what we can to promote an informed, educated public. The educated voter is best able to make decisions and petition us to do the right things here. 
The Internet provides an ideal way to inform the public while not distracting CRS from its primary mission to serve Congress. The Director of CRS can simply post CRS products on a web site, and then voters can look up information without any extra effort by CRS researchers. The public will not be allowed to write responses or research requests to CRS, so that valuable CRS time will not be diverted from helping us to do our jobs. Confidential requests by Members of Congress will not be released to the public. It is my intent that CRS establish a separate web site that will serve the public without otherwise causing CRS to do anything drastically different from its current operations when it posts CRS products on the web site accessible to Members of Congress. 
I recognize that there have been a few questions about this bill. There are concerns disseminating CRS material via the Internet will remove its protection under the Speech and Debate Clause. At present, no court case has directly addressed this issue. However, the Supreme Court acknowledged in its concurrence to Doe versus McMillan that a legislator's function in informing the public concerning matters before Congress should be protected by the Speech and Debate Clause, similar to communications which relate directly to the legislative process. Furthermore, my bill gives the CRS Director discretion to not release material that he determines is confidential. This aspect of my bill has been upheld in similar circumstances where the U.S. District Court maintained the confidentiality of the underlying research used to create reports by Congressional support agencies. I am including in the Record a letter by Mr. Stanley M. Brand, a former General Counsel to the House of Representatives, who agrees that my legislation will not threaten CRS' protection under the Speech and Debate Clause. 
I am also aware of potential copyright concerns if the CRS information is made accessible to the public. For example, CRS has informed me that it does not have a copyright agreement that will allow it to make the maps used in CRS products available electronically. I believe we can work out an equitable solution to resolve any copyright concerns that would prevent any CRS Report, Issue Brief, or Authorization or Appropriations product from being electronically disseminated to the public. 
Another concern has been raised about the 30 day delay between the release of CRS material to Members of Congress and their staff and its release to the public on the web site. This delay will make sure that CRS has carried out its primary statutory duty of informing Congress before releasing information the public. Also, it will allow CRS to verify that its products are accurate and prepare them for public release in order to protect CRS from liability problems and the American people from being misinformed. 
I would like to stress that opening up these select CRS products to the public will in no way compete with existing commercial information services. The public will have access to selected CRS products that are currently available only to Members of Congress and their staff. I firmly believe that the federal government should not be involved in competing with legitimate private industry. 
This bill has received popular support from across the country, and I am including in the Record a letter of support from many concerned industries and groups including America On-Line, IBM, Public Citizen, and the League of Women Voters of the United States. I hope that my colleagues will join them in supporting this legislation and opening up a useful source of information to the American people.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act.' This bill would fully repeal the erroneous Social Security earnings limit. 
Since coming to the Senate in 1987, I have been working to eliminate the discriminatory and unfair Earnings Test. 
I am pleased that in 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law my bill, the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act. This legislation took a step in the right direction by increasing the earning threshold for senior citizens from $11,520 to $30,000 by the year 2000. Now it is time to eliminate the unjust Earnings Test in its entirety. 
Most Americans are shocked and appalled when they discover that older Americans are penalized for working. Nobody should be penalized for working or discouraged from engaging in work. Yet, this is exactly what the Social Security Earnings Test does to our nation's senior citizens. The Social Security Earnings Test punishes Americans between the ages of 65 and 70 for their attempts to remain productive after retirement. 
The Social Security Earnings Test mandates that for every $3 earned by a retiree over the established limit, $19,999.92 in 1998, the retiree loses $1 in Social Security benefits. This is clearly age discrimination, and it is very wrong. Due to this cap on earnings, our senior citizens, many of whom exist on fixed, low-incomes, are burdened with a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. When this is combined with Federal, State, local and other Social Security taxes, it amounts to an outrageous 55 to 65 percent tax bite and even higher. This earnings limit is punitive and serves as a tremendous disincentive to work. An individual who is struggling to make ends meet on approximately $19,000 a year should not be faced with an effective marginal tax rate which exceeds 55 percent. 
The Social Security Earnings Test is a relic of the Great Depression, designed to move older people out of the workforce and create employment for younger individuals. This is an archaic policy and should no longer be our goal because our nation's labor pool is shrinking. Many senior citizens can make a significant contribution, and often their knowledge and experience compliments or exceeds that of younger employees. Tens of millions of Americans are over the age of 65, and together they have over a billion years of cumulative work experience. These individuals have valuable experience to offer our society, and we need them. 
In addition, experts predict a labor shortage when the `baby boom' generation ages, and it is evident that employers will have to develop new sources of income as our elderly population continues to grow much faster than the number of workers entering the workforce. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, `retaining older workers is a priority in labor intensive industries, and will become even more critical as we approach the year 2000.' To me it seems counterproductive and foolish to keep willing, diligent workers out of the American workforce. Our country must continue to support pro-work, not pro-welfare policies. 
More importantly, many of the older Americans penalized by the earnings test need to work in order to cover their basic expenses; health care, housing and food. Many seniors do not have significant savings or a private pension. For this reason, low-income workers are particularly hard-hit by the earnings test. 
It is important to note that wealthy seniors, who have lucrative investments, stocks, and substantial savings are not affected by the earnings limits. Their supplemental `unearned' income is not subject to the earnings threshold. The earnings limit only affects seniors who must work and depend on their earned income for survival. 
Finally, let me stress that repealing the burdensome and unfair earnings test would not jeopardize the solvency of the Social Security funds. Opponents who claim otherwise are engaging in cruel scare tactics. It is important to remember that the Social Security benefits which working seniors are losing due to the earnings test penalty are benefits they have rightfully earned by contributing to the system throughout their working years before retiring. These are benefits which they should not be losing because they are trying to survive by supplementing their Social Security income. Furthermore, certain studies indicate that repealing the earnings test would result in a net increase of $140 million in federal revenue. 
Mr. President, there is no compelling justification for denying economic opportunity to an individual on the basis of age. It is quite evident that the earnings test is outdated, unjust and discriminatory. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation which would eliminate this egregious law.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, during the course of the last several months, the number of broadcast radio station transactions has increased due to the liberalized station ownership provisions contained in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, with this increase in transactions has come an increased concern that, in authorizing these assignments, the FCC may try to impose terms and conditions on the assignors or assignees neither contained in, nor intended by, the 1996 act. 
Radio mergers must be permitted to go forward when they satisfy the requirements under the plain meaning of the statute. While the Senate is in adjournment, I expect the FCC to follow the law, not rewrite it, when they review radio station mergers. 
Given the number of broadcast media outlets available today, traditional concerns about how mergers affect viewpoint diversity are greatly mitigated. This is especially true because, in addition to traditional broadcast media outlets, various multichannel video programming services and online services over the Internet, as well as nonbroadcast media outlets like magazines and newspapers, are available in today's market. 
In light of these facts, Mr. President, the FCC should not block sensible radio mergers or approve them only with additional, unwarranted terms and conditions attached.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I share the concerns expressed by my colleagues about basic fairness. Last year during consideration of welfare reform, I advocated that we use that bill as a vehicle to fix the title IV-E law with regard to tribes and Indian children in tribal areas. Under the current law, states cannot even administer a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [TANF] program unless they have in place a foster care/adoption assistance program. I appreciate the efforts of Representatives Hayworth and McDermott in trying to fix this problem during the Ways and Means Committee consideration of its adoption bill, H.R. 867, and also of former Representative Bill Richardson who early this year introduced a freestanding bill on this issue. It seems that we keep running into the issue of funding. This is, however, a clear-cut case of fairness, and we must work together to provide equitable assistance to Indian children.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators Gorton, Hollings and Ford, in approving this amendment to authorize the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] Research, Engineering, and Development [RE&D] account for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. The FAA's RE&D account is used to finance projects to improve the safety, security, capacity, and efficiency of the U.S. aviation system. 
FAA research and development activities help to provide the advancements and innovations that are needed to keep the U.S. aviation system the best in the world. Our nation's ability to have a strong aviation-related research and development program directly impacts our success in the global market and our standard of living. 
This legislation authorizes the funding needed for ongoing or planned FAA RE&D projects that will provide important benefits for the U.S. aviation system and its users. The FAA RE&D program will fund projects to determine how limited airport and airspace capacity can meet ever increasing demands, how aviation security can be improved, and how flight safety concerns can be addressed. 
As my colleagues know, I have been particularly concerned about ensuring that the FAA has an adequate level of funding for security research and development. The threat of terrorism against the United States has increased and aviation is, and will remain, an attractive terrorist target. That is why this legislation provides $54 million for security technology research and development. This figure represents almost one-fourth of the total authorized funding level, and is $10 million above the appropriations level. 
Mr. President, Senator Hollings, Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Senator Gorton, Senator Ford, and I have worked hard with the FAA and our colleagues in the House to craft legislation that can provide the FAA with the funding it needs for critical research and development projects, while also being mindful of our tight federal budget. I urge my colleagues to approve this legislation by unanimous consent.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has turned to H.R. 2476, the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act. I urge its immediate adoption. H.R. 2476 is virtually identical to legislation that I introduced earlier in the year, and that the Commerce Committee approved in September. I commend my committee colleagues--especially Senators Gorton, Hollings, and Ford--for working with me on this issue. In particular, I want to recognize Representative Underwood, who spearheaded this effort in the House. 
It was the tragic crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in Guam that brought the need for this legislation into focus. The bill would require a foreign air carrier that wants permission to operate in the United States to develop a family assistance plan, in the event of an accident on U.S. soil. 
Specifically, the foreign air carrier would be required to provide the Secretary of Transportation and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] with a plan for addressing the needs of the families of passengers involved in an aircraft accident that involves an aircraft under the control of that foreign air carrier, and that involves a significant loss of life. The Secretary could not grant permission for the foreign air carrier to operate in the United States unless the Secretary had received a sufficient family assistance plan. 
The requisite family assistance plan would include a reliable, staffed toll-free number for the passengers' families, and a process for expedient family notification prior to public notice of the passengers' identities. An NTSB employee would serve as director of family support services, with the assistance of an independent nonprofit organization with experience in disasters and post-trauma communication with families. The foreign air carrier would provide these family liaisons with updated passenger lists following the crash. The legislation would require that the carrier consult and coordinate with the families on the disposition of remains and personal effects. 
The legislation would build on the family assistance provisions that Congress enacted last year as part of the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. Domestic air carriers are already operating under the same legislative requirements set out in the legislation before us. 
Again, it was the unfortunate confusion and heartache surrounding the tragic airline crash in Guam that demonstrated the need for this bill. I urge immediate adoption of the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss a very important bill that I first introduced on October 31, 1997. The bill, S. 1354, which is cosponsored by Senators Campbell, Stevens, Inouye, Daschle, and Dorgan, is an amendment to the Communications Act of 1934. The amendment enables the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] to designate common carriers not under the jurisdiction of a State commission as eligible recipients of universal service support. 
Universal Service provides intercarrier support for the provision of telecommunications services in rural and high-cost areas throughout the United States. However, section 254(e) of the Communications Act states that only an eligible carrier designated under section 214(e) of the Communications Act, shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal support after the FCC issues regulations implementing the new universal service provisions into the law. Section 214(e) does not account for the fact that State commissions in a few States have no jurisdiction over certain carriers. Typically, States also have no jurisdiction over tribally owned common carriers which may or may not be regulated by a tribal authority that is not a State commission per se. 
The failure to account for these situations means that carriers not subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission have no way of becoming an eligible carrier that can receive universal service support. This would be the case whether these carriers are traditional local exchange carriers that provide services otherwise included in the program, have previously obtained universal service support, or will likely be the carrier that continues to be the carrier of last resort for customers in the area. 
This simple amendment will address this oversight within the amendments made by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and prevent the unintentional consequences it will have on common carriers which Congress intended to be covered under the umbrella of universal service support.

Mr. McCAIN. No, this bill does nothing to alter the existing jurisdiction that State commissions already have over local exchange carriers or providers of commercial mobile radio services as set forth in section 332(c)(3) of the Communications Act. Nor will this bill have any effect on litigation that may be pending regarding jurisdictional issues between the States and federally recognized tribal governments. I thank the Democratic leader for his interest in this matter.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last week I submitted a statement for the record discussing my views on the situation in Iraq and the need for the United States to remain resolute in its dealings with the regime of Saddam Hussein. 
Today, I would like to submit a paper on the subject written by Tony Cordesman, currently at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and formerly a member of my staff. Tony's paper offers an excellent summation of Iraqi intentions and capabilities as well as providing expert analysis of what is at stake for the United States and its interests in the Middle East as a result of this most recent crisis involving Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation agreed to be discharged from further consideration of S. 1349. The bill would waive the U.S. build and prior U.S. ownership requirements of the coastwise trade laws and allow the ferry Prince Nova to be employed in the coastwise trade. 
Usually, Jones Act waiver bills such as S. 1349 are first considered by the Commerce Committee, and subsequently included in Coast Guard authorization legislation for final passage. In this case, the Commerce Committee did not have an opportunity to consider S. 1349 during the Committee's last executive session of this year. The Senator from Connecticut, however, requested the opportunity to have the Senate adopt the bill before the end of the first session. 
Mr. President, the bill meets the Commerce Committee's usual criteria for adopting such waivers. Senator Hollings, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, and I agreed to request the Commerce Committee be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that the Senator from Connecticut's request could be accommodated.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this legislation, on behalf of myself and Senator Bryan of Nevada, would add a small but important amendment to the Professional Boxing Safety Act (P.L. 104-272), that was signed into law last year. This proposal would add language to the act to prevent promoters from exploiting professional boxers with respect to a certain unethical contracting practice. It would prohibit promoters from forcing a boxer, as a pre-condition to signing a contract for a bout, to hire a relative or associate of the promoter as their manager. 
Testimony at the Commerce Committee's May 22nd 1997 hearing on the professional boxing industry detailed this practice, and prominent state commissioners have further advised Senator Bryan and I that the `forced hiring' of a promoter's relative does indeed occur. The most offensive result of this coercive practice is that boxers are forced to turn over at least one-third of their earnings to an individual with whom they have no business or personal relationship whatsoever. If the boxer refuses, they are effectively blacklisted from being able to compete in the lucrative bouts they have fairly earned. Their career may be over. 
This practice is simply indefensible, and it clearly takes advantage of the fact that most professional boxers have little leverage in an industry dominated by a handful of powerful promoters. This legislative would end it. This amendment would add a provision to the new federal boxing safety and ethics law (P.L. 104-272) which was enacted with bipartisan support in the Senate and House of Representatives last year. Senator Bryan played a tremendously vital role as cosponsor of the Professional Boxing Safety Act, and he recently joined me in developing this proposal. 
If enacted, this modest proposal will provide further assistance to a group of athletes who have had few advocates for too long. I know this legislation will be strongly welcomed by the courageous athletes who sustain the professional boxing industry, as well as the state commissioners who have the responsibility to regulate professional boxing events. 
For a promoter to force a boxer to turn over one-third or one-half of his earnings, by threatening to deny them the chance to compete in a major bout, is extremely offensive and unethical. This practice would never be tolerated in any other sport or profession in the U.S. Indeed, it would probably result in the promoter being kicked out of a professional sports league or be the subject of a law enforcement proceeding. The only reason that it has occurred in professional boxing is because the overwhelming majority of boxers in America are completely powerless when it comes to their own financial futures. They are often at the whim of the powerful business interests who dominate the sport. Furthermore, with no union or private industry association to help advocate their causes and interests, boxers are routinely ignored by business entities in the sport. 
I am sure that every Member of the Senate would join senator Bryan and I in ending this egregious practice if they were aware of it. This modest legislative proposal will achieve this goal, and stop one form of exploitation against a group of athletes who have been subject to fraudulent and coercive business practices for decades. I hope my colleagues will support the swift passage of this proposal.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the establishment of a national voluntary mutual reunion registry contained in section 205 of the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and Neglected Children [PASS] Act. This provision would permit the Secretary of Health and Human Services, at no net expense to the Federal Government, to facilitate the voluntary, mutually requested reunions of biological relatives who have been separated by adoption. 
This registry is intended to help reunite the hundreds of thousands of adult adoptees, birth parents and siblings who are searching for each other. Currently, the search can be very costly, cumbersome, and futile. The national registry would help many individuals who were separated by adoption and are now searching for each other. 
Some concerns have been raised that this provision would infringe an individual's privacy, and that a national voluntary registry could result in the inappropriate disclosure of private, sensitive information. This is completely inaccurate. I and the other sponsors of this provision, along with the Finance Committee have worked tirelessly to ensure that all the necessary safeguards have been included in this provision to ensure that an individual's personal privacy is not violated in any manner. 
Under the guidelines for the national voluntary registry established in this bill, one party could not search out another individual unless both parties were searching for one another. All parties involved would have to, on their own accord, voluntarily decide to search for each other and participate in the registry. This provision specifically requires that the registry only contain information necessary to facilitate a match, that the confidentiality of all consenting participants be protected and that no information be disclosed without prior, written consent from the individual. 
Section 205 specifically requires that any computerized system created to implement this registry must not intrude on any existing data systems at the Department of Health and Human Services and must utilize appropriate methods to protect the privacy of information contained in the registry. In addition, it establishes criminal and financial penalties for potential abusers of the national registry. 
Finally, the measure specifically states that this registry does not preempt any State laws relating to adoption and the confidentiality of adoption records. 
Mr. President, this provision is not a mandate, has absolutely no cost to the Federal Government or taxpayers, and is completely voluntarily. This important provision will help thousands of Americans who want to learn about themselves and their biological history.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. John E. Murphy of Tucson, AZ for serving as the 1997-98 president of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists [ASHP]. ASHP is the national professional association which represents pharmacists practicing in various areas of the health care system, including hospitals, health maintenance organizations, long-term care facilities, home health care, and many other vital components of our Nation's health care system. 
Dr. John Murphy resides in Tucson where he heads the department of pharmacy practice and science at the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy. He earned his B.S. and Pharm. D degrees at the University of Florida, and later served as a member of the faculty and as director of residencies at Mercer University School of Pharmacy in Georgia. He served as an ASHP board member and chair of its Legal and Public Affairs Council. He also served on many committees of the Arizona Society of Health-System Pharmacists. 
John is recognized by his colleagues as a leader in the field of pharmacy education as he prepares today's pharmacy students for delivering effective and efficient health care in our Nation's complex and ever changing system. As President of ASHP, Dr. Murphy will guide the Nation's pharmacists as they develop new and innovative patient care methods. 
It is my distinct honor to congratulate and honor John E. Murphy on his well-deserved achievement as the ASHP president. Dr. Murphy has made significant contributions to the University of Arizona, and I am confident that he will prove to be a successful leader for the American Pharmacy.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, during the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, I quoted President Thomas Jefferson who wrote, in 1785, to his fellow Virginian, James Monroe: `I would say to every nation on earth, by treaty, your people shall trade freely with us, and ours with you.' 
In that same spirit, the 103d Congress of the United States passed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the nations of Canada, the United States, and Mexico began to open their borders. The resulting rising tide has already begun to lift the economic well-being of all Americans. 
We now begin a similar debate over the President's request for fast-track trade negotiating authority. This gives me another opportunity to emphasize my commitment to free and open trade and pledge that I will work hard to enact the President's request. I am pleased that the proposal coming from the Finance Committee has attracted such broad bipartisan support. 
My colleagues need to understand how important fast track is. Fast track provides that Congress will consider trade agreements within mandatory deadlines, with limited debate and without amendment. Its power has been held by every President for over 20 years, both Republicans and Democrats. 
In his book, `American Trade Politics,' Professor I.M. Destler, noted that fast track rose from Congress' natural inclination to shift responsibility for negotiating liberal trade agreements to the President while still maintaining its constitutional authority over foreign commerce. 
By delegating responsibility to the executive and by helping fashion a system that protected legislators from one-sided restrictive pressures, Congress made it possible for successive presidents to maintain and expand the liberal trade order. 
In other words, the fast-track mechanism is the result of years of practical experience by our predecessors. And from it, the United States has been a leader in opening markets throughout the world. Implementation of the Uruguay round, establishment of the World Trade Organization, and unification of the markets of NAFTA countries are just a few of the success stories arising from the grant of fast-track authority to the President. 
Unfortunately, far too many Americans have been misled into believing that free trade agreements are bad for the working men and women of our country. A late July NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll which simply asked if you would support fast track to negotiate more free trade agreements, a full 61 percent said `No.' But these figures are beginning to change. 
For too long, those who would build walls around our borders have pointed to the isolated cases of job disruptions to argue that trade only means job loss. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky testified recently how in our booming economy more than 11 million Americans now work in jobs supported by exports and that these jobs pay 13 to 16 percent above the national average wage. Exports have increased dramatically across the country with 47 of 50 States registering significant export growth over the last 4 years. 
Exports from California are up 45 percent, Michigan--68 percent, Illinois--64 percent, Ohio--42 percent, Texas--40 percent, Nebraska--54 percent, North Dakota--76 percent, and Montana--52 percent. Exports from Florida, Rhode Island, Louisiana, and West Virginia have increased more than 30 percent. States from New York to Utah also have posted double digit increases. 
Instead of the giant sucking sound warned by many opponents of free trade, one of the first consequences of NAFTA was the swift relocation of some auto plants from Mexico to the United States. 
In my home State, increased trade has resulted in an enormous growth in exports and increased wealth for Arizona families. We exported goods totaling $10.5 billion in 1996, up 93 percent from 1992. Total exports from Arizona to NAFTA countries alone increased by 52 percent between 1993 and 1996. Even exports to the European Union, which is not a member of NAFTA, increased 54 percent during this period. 
These increases would be meaningless but for one important economic truth: exports mean jobs. Today, the unemployment rate is at one of the lowest points in the last 20 years. An article in the Wall Street Journal about job growth in the St. Louis area and around the Nation stated: 
. . . here . . ., it is evident that, with a buoyant economy slashing unemployment to a quarter-century low and U.S. exports booming, Mr. Clinton will surely win by the time the issue is resolved this fall . . . 
The article goes on:  
In the St. Louis area alone, more than 1,200 companies are now exporting, up from 600 five years ago . . . 
. . . as more companies flourish by exporting, a silent majority favoring more trade is forming in much of the country. One recent poll found 78% of respondents favoring expanded trade `on a reciprocal basis.' 
Without fast track legislation, we have missed a number of opportunities to be involved in trade agreements throughout the world. The Southern Cone Common Market, known as MERCOSUR, is expanding to set up a regional trade bloc that will not include the United States. The Government of Chile has already concluded trade agreements with Canada and Mexico. In Asia, ASEAN is setting up a free trade area without United States' participation. The EU has begun to set up agreements in the Western Hemisphere, and is currently negotiating trade agreements with Chile and Mexico. 
Despite these missed opportunities, the United States can still continue its pre-eminent leadership role on the world economic stage. We need to complete the negotiations on Chile's accession to NAFTA, to begin building the Free Trade Area for the Americas, and to pursue the long-term commitment to eliminate barriers to trade with other Asia Pacific nations in the Asia Pacific economic cooperation forum. Some Members of Congress have even proposed negotiating free trade agreements with other trading partners, such as the European Union or Sub-Saharan African countries. 
The Clinton administration has noted that future multilateral negotiations may also require congressional implementation. For example, negotiations to further liberalize trade in services and agriculture and to establish new rules for subsidies are likely to begin by the year 2000. Moreover, the United States and other governments have expressed interest in pursuing multilateral negotiations on issues related to labor and environmental standards, competition policy, and rules for foreign investment. The success of these negotiations will hinge on the President's fast track authority. 
Finally, I think that it is important to recognize the message being sent by the recent decline in the world's stock markets, Those who argue that we should only look inward and forgo opportunities to open markets around the world fail to recognize that we are now moving toward a single world economy. Dramatic market declines in Hong Kong are felt on Wall Street, in South America, and in Europe. It is important that we not listen to the siren song of protectionism at this moment in history. Instead, our Nation must signal its support of free trade by supporting fast-track legislation. Fast track will promote open trade and create wealth around our planet. The benefits are obvious. 
The editorial pages of American newspapers have almost uniformly called for swift enactment of fast track. These newspapers observed long ago that delicate negotiations with foreign leaders go nowhere when these negotiations must first be approved by 535 congressional Secretaries of State. 
The Christian, Science Monitor states: 
There should be no doubt that much of the growing U.S. and world prosperity in the past two decades--indeed in the past half century--is a result of global trade expansion . . . President Clinton should press ahead decisively now. Benefits outweigh drawbacks. History is on his side. 
The Washington Post says: 
Economies that are open to trade and foreign investment grow more quickly and lift their populations out of poverty more quickly than economies that are closed. 
The Journal of Commerce says: 
. . . the real issue is the unwieldy nature of negotiating with each member of Congress, a situation that would encourage foreign trading partners to hold back their best offers knowing Congress could second-guess the deal later, leading to delays and weaker trade policy. 
Mr. Clinton should directly and honestly address the fears of average Americans and use the bully pulpit to explain how global competition ultimately improves the U.S. competitive position. Only then will Americans better understand why their smart, innovative companies and hard-working people stand to benefit globally from open markets and fast-track authority. 
The Arizona Daily News-Sun correctly argues: 
. . . enterprise free of the bureaucratic costs of trade `quotas' and tariffs only raise the cost of doing business for American businesses selling to foreign markets and result in higher prices to consumers. Capitalism is not a zero-sum game. 
And, finally, USA Today states: 
Congressional dithering over trade agreements is the kiss of death. Let the president negotiate. 
I could not agree more. 
The commonsense perception of the negative consequences of high tariffs was well understood by Americans who engaged in the great tariff debates of the last century. It was understood by many of our Founding Fathers, by committed free traders in the 19th century, and by supporters of free trade today who argue persistently that tariffs are unfair taxes on an already overtaxed public and an impediment to prosperity. 
There are, of course, other arguments at stake that transcend partisan economic values. Under the benefits of NAFTA, Mexico has moved dramatically away from statism, protectionism, and the reflexively anti-American, anticapitalist left wing policies that have kept Mexico so firmly rooted in the Third World. Had we rejected NAFTA and denied Mexico the benefits of enlightened engagement with the world, we may very well have provoked a return to those policies which are so inimical to our own interests. 
I have long argued that free trade agreements help promote democratic freedoms in countries around the world. Support for free trade, as exemplified by vote for fast-track authority, is another way to help ensure that many, many people are able to live in a free and prospering environment. 
In conclusion, I urge my colleagues not to reject this golden opportunity to solidify the global free trade regime that we have created. Instead of heeding the cries of protectionism and throwing our country down a path of eventual economic ruin, we should vote to continue prosperity from Wall Street to Main Street America.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 100 years ago, Mark Twain wrote, `Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.' Although I cannot speak for the undertaker, I believe I accurately represent all of Carlisle Willis Buzzell's friends, family members, and fellow aviators in saying that this country, and the Navy which serves it proudly, lost an invaluable asset when Carl peacefully passed away last July. Mr. President, I rise today to humbly commemorate a man whom I am proud to have known, in a time and place far removed from the Senate floor from which I speak today. 
After a 3-month stint in the Army, Carl wisely joined the U.S. Navy in 1946, first as a petty officer, then as a midshipman at that boat school on the Severn River, better known as the Naval Academy to all who have not had the privilege of climbing Herndon at the end of plebe summer and celebrating June Week before graduation. Carl proceeded on to a distinguished career as a naval aviator, with tours of duty both stateside and in the Mediterranean, Pacific, and Atlantic theaters. 
I had the honor of flying with Carl when we were stationed together on the U.S.S. Forrestal (CVA-59), a carrier better known for the vicious fire which consumed its flight deck than for the raw heroism of the thousands on board who labored to save the vessel, and themselves, from the flames. As head of the Forrestal's Combat Information Center, Carl was likely better positioned to evaluate and respond to the crisis than I, who held the dubious distinction of being the lucky pilot whose A-4E was hit by a Zuni rocket on the flight deck, thereby igniting the inferno. 
Carl went on to serve on the staff of the Naval War College, where he helped pioneer the latest in interactive computer technologies at the Center for War Gaming. This capped the Commander's 28-year naval career, following which he managed General Electric's turbojet engine programs and was responsible for maintaining the operational readiness of its engines in support of Navy aircraft. 
As indicated by his private-sector work on turbojet engines for F/A-18 and F-14B/D fleet fighter aircraft, Carl's loyalties to the Navy were not diminished by his retirement from the service. Indeed, he reaffirmed his commitment to his aviation roots through active membership on the boards of the Boston chapters of the Naval Academy Alumni Association, the New England Advisory Committee of Business Executives for National Security, and the Patriots Squadron of the Association of Naval Aviation. 
Mr. President, as a Naval Academy graduate and former naval aviator myself, I must concede that my respect for the service and professionalism of my friend Carl may be partially accountable to the parallels between his naval career and my own, although his subsequent decision to enter the private sector perhaps demonstrated more foresight than my own choice to enter politics and make my living at public expense. 
But do not take my word as evidence of Carl's exemplary service to his country. The World War II Victory Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, the Navy Occupation Service Medal, the Korean Service Medal, the Korean Presidential Unit Citation, and the Vietnam Service Medal, all of which were awarded to Commander Buzzell during his naval career, stand as proof positive of his dedication to the core values that distinguish our servicemembers to the same degree today as when Carl enlisted in 1946, 1 year after victory in a most terrible war had confirmed the resilience of our ideals and the promise of the American Century. 
Mr. President, Carl Buzzell lived a life whose end deeply saddens all of us who know of his loyal service to this Nation. May his legacy long stand in testament to the virtues of a life dedicated to honor, country, and family.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. 
I thank the majority leader and the Democratic leader for their kind remarks. I especially wish to thank Senator Hutchison and Senator Kerry and Senator Breaux who spent literally hundreds of hours on this bill. I think it is important to point out for the Record that this effort was begun by the majority leader when he was chairman of the subcommittee which is now chaired by the Senator from Texas, and the groundwork was laid through his strong efforts. 
I might say that there were several occasions when we were gridlocked on this bill and we gathered in the majority leader's office and he helped us find ways to reach common ground. 
Mr. President, this compromise reauthorization legislation is the product of more than 3 years of bipartisan negotiations. Let there be no mistake. Amtrak is on the verge of bankruptcy. Fundamental reforms are needed immediately if there is to be any possibility of addressing Amtrak's financial crisis and turning it into a viable operation. This measure is long overdue. Some fear, as I do, that even with these reforms Amtrak may not make it. 
Again, I thank Senator Hutchison for all her hard work, along with Senator Breaux and Senator Kerry. Senator Breaux and Senator Kerry will be in the Chamber shortly, I am told, to add their comments. Senator Hutchison will describe the details of her amendment which have to do with labor, contracting out, liability, and the sunset trigger which is part of this legislation. 
I think everyone knows that I hold strong reservations about Amtrak. After subsidizing for 26 years what was to have been a 2-year experiment, I believe Congress must carefully evaluate whether this is the best use of our limited taxpayers dollars. 
Since 1971, Amtrak has received over $20 billion in Federal tax dollars. I know that Amtrak has strived to reduce its operating costs and increase its revenues. And, yes, a portion of Amtrak's financial challenges are due to statutory constraints that Congress imposed and has failed to lift, but the fact remains the Amtrak 12-year experiment was unsuccessful 26 years ago, it is unsuccessful today, and the prospects of its future are rather bleak. 
I realize that my pessimistic view of Amtrak's future, based on its track record, is not shared by the majority of the Congress. That is why I have worked with my colleagues to bring some semblance of legitimacy to this operation. The bill before us does not go as far as many of us would like. For some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they may say it goes too far. Regardless of the position held, the bill does provide for some comprehensive changes. 
According to a November 5, 1997, letter from Tom Downs, `enactment of the Amtrak Accountability and Reform Act of 1997 would be the single-most significant action the Congress can take to aid Amtrak in achieving operating self-sufficiency by 2002.' He goes on to say, `The legislative reforms contained in the bill will allow Amtrak to operate in a more businesslike, cost-effective manner, thus allowing greater productivity and increased savings.'

Mr. McCAIN. In closing, Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues that even if Congress approves the statutory reforms and the $2.3 billion for capital improvements is released, Amtrak's viability remains uncertain. Let's be clear. Amtrak is $1 billion in debt and that debt level is predicted by the General Accounting Office to double to $2 billion in the next 2 years. Tom Downs predicts that without this legislation Amtrak could be bankrupt by next spring. Others predict even sooner. 
I hope the dire predictions are wrong but prudence dictates that while we empower Amtrak to meet its financial goals and protect taxpayers, Congress and the administration prepare for and have a clear understanding of the long-range economic effects of a potential bankruptcy. 
I requested the General Accounting Office to conduct an analysis of this issue and submit a report to the committee providing an overview of the financial issues and implications associated with an Amtrak liquidation. The report will include an analysis of the financial implications for the Federal Government, Amtrak's creditor's and the railroad retirement system. 
I strongly support passage of this reform measure. However, I will continue to hold strong reservations over Amtrak's ability to ever turn Amtrak into a profitable, subsidy-free operation. One of the most important elements of this bill is that it provides the opportunity for us to shut off the spigot if and when it is clear the promise of financial viability will not or cannot be achieved. 
What is happening here is not just a piece of reform legislation, Mr. President. We are releasing $2.3 billion in what I have previously described as the great train robbery of 1997. Back in the old days some citizens of my State used to rob trains. But now the trains have decided to rob the taxpayers of $2.3 billion with the help of this body. 
The proviso, or the rationale that allowed the $2.3 billion to be fenced off was $2.3 billion in back taxes. The only problem with that scenario, Mr. President, is Amtrak has never paid any taxes. So we are providing another $2.3 billion giveaway to Amtrak. These reforms release that money. 
I will never forget when I first came to Congress in 1982, Mr. President. I was visited by a man whom I respect as much as any man, Graham Claytor, who was then the head of Amtrak. And he gave me in graphic detail a long and extensive briefing about how Amtrak was going to be viable financially by the year 1985. That's only 12 years ago. But every 2 or 3 years Amtrak has come over to Congress with another plan to become financially viable within 2 or 3 years, and we know the answer. The answer is that they have now received more than $20 billion of the taxpayers' money. 
I say enough is enough. And I commit now that if this reform and reauthorization plan does not make Amtrak financially viable, I will do everything in my power as a Senator and as chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee to see that it comes to an end. 
I wish Amtrak every success with the passage of this legislation by the House. I will hope and pray that Amtrak succeeds. But I must tell you I am not optimistic that they will succeed and I hope to God that this is the last trip to the taxpayers' pocket book that we make on behalf of Amtrak. 
Mr. President, again I thank Senator Hutchison who has done such a magnificent job on this legislation. She has worked countless numbers of hours. She has made compromises that clearly at the beginning she was not prepared to do. She made these compromises because she knew that that is the essence of legislation and the lessons of getting legislative results. She deserves enormous credit, along with my dear friend, Senator Kerry and Senator Breaux, from Massachusetts and Louisiana, who played a great role. Bipartisanship is what this place is supposed to be about on issues that don't lend themselves to partisanship, and I believe that this is truly a bipartisan effort of which I think all of us can be proud. Again, my thanks to Senator Hutchison. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Universal Tobacco Settlement Act. This bill is cosponsored by the Commerce Committee Ranking Member Senator Hollings, Senator Gorton, and Senator Breaux. 
Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today is the legislative version of the Universal Tobacco Settlement agreed upon by the attorneys general and the tobacco companies. We hope it will serve as the basis of discussion and amendment here in the Senate. 
I want briefly to discuss what this bill is and is not. It is the basis for hearings, discussion, and amendment. After this bill is introduced, I will ask consent to have it jointly referred to various committees of jurisdiction for consideration. As the chairman of the Commerce Committee, I intend to hold extensive hearings on this bill and use it as the vehicle for amendment. 
First, let me emphasize that this legislation was drafted by Senate legislative counsel who was requested to write a bill that would implement and mirror the universal tobacco agreement without any direction or input from Members and without any alteration from the agreement. 
The substance of the bill is not perfect, complete, comprehensive, or legislation that could ever be signed into law without considerable debate and amendments. None of the cosponsors endorse this bill as being the answer to our Nation's problem with tobacco-related death and illness. But it can and should serve as a basis to began negotiations between all concerned parties. 
The bipartisan group of attorneys general and the tobacco companies deserve praise for developing this language. I know it was not easy. But much more needs to be done. The Universal Tobacco Settlement Agreement presents more questions than it answers. That is why we must move the legislative process forward and begin debating substantive language. 
I had hoped that the administration would send the Congress legislation in this area. I would have liked for the Congress to begin considering the proposals developed and advocated by the White House. Unfortunately, the White House chose not to take such action. As a result, I have chosen to begin this discussion with attorneys general agreement. 
There has been one addition to the settlement developed by the attorneys general. The universal tobacco settlement did not address the issue of tobacco farmers and the communities whose existence and economy depends on the growing of tobacco. To address this concern, a new title IX has been added to the bill. The text of title IX is the language of S. 1310, legislation introduced by Senator Ford. It is my hope that with the addition of this language to the bill, we can begin the comprehensive debate necessary on this subject. 
Mr. President, let there be no mistake, the Senate takes its role in this matter very seriously. Millions of lives have been lost and millions more will follow. Every day 3,000 young adults and children begin smoking. We cannot and should not allow this to continue. With the introduction of this bill we will begin this debate and I am hopeful that by early next year we can move forward on the floor on this matter.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I am introducing the Federal Communications Commission Satellite Carrier Oversight Act. This bill will do a number of things to promote competition in the multichannel video marketplace. I wish to thank Senator Burns for his support on this bill. 
Congress has had a longstanding interest in promoting competition in the multichannel video marketplace so as to enable consumers to have a choice of video providers at competitive rates. However, a recent regulatory action threatens the ability of direct-to-home [DTH] satellite television operators to compete effectively with cable operators. 
On October 27, 1997, the Librarian of Congress adopted a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel's recommendation of a precipitous and wholly unjustified increase in the copyright fees satellite carriers pay for superstation and network affiliate signals delivered to satellite TV households. This action will result in a rate increase for satellite television subscribers and have a detrimental effect on the ability of DTH operators to compete with cable. 
This bill will ensure that this rate increase does not take effect as scheduled on January 1, 1998. It delays the effective date of the rate increase to January 1, 1999. The 7.5 million U.S. households who currently subscribe to satellite television deserve to have Congress examine the effect of this copyright fee increase on video competition and to consider changes to the law that would ensure a less arbitrary and more consumer friendly result. This delay will give the FCC an opportunity to determine what impact the increased copyright fees will have on satellite's ability to compete with cable, and it will give Congress an opportunity to evaluate the FCC's report and respond accordingly. 
The current satellite copyright rates are 14 cents per subscriber per month for each superstation signal and 6 cents per subscriber per month for each network signal. Cable operators currently pay an average of 9.7 cents for the exact same superstations and 2.7 cents for the exact same network signals. At the 27-cent rate adopted by the Librarian, satellite carriers will be paying almost 270 percent more than cable for the exact same superstations and 900 percent more for the exact same network signals. 
This creates an enormous disparity in the copyright fees paid for the same signals and will result in rate increases to satellite subscribers, which in turn will have a negative impact on competition between cable and satellite. Such a result is directly contrary to the intent of Congress to give consumers a choice of video providers at competitive rates. 
The bill also addresses an issue of continuing concern to the DTH industry. Signal theft represents a serious threat to DTH operators. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress confirmed the applicability of penalties for unauthorized decryption of DTH satellite services. The amendment we propose would confirm the judicial interpretation that civil suits may be brought by DTH operators for signal theft.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of passage of the conference report on H.R. 1119, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. Despite its many flaws, some of which I will expand upon momentarily, the report does represent a solid effort at advancing the defense budget process in accordance with the legislative branch of government's constitutional role in raising and supporting the Armed Forces of the United States. Important policy issues are addressed, needed reforms are implemented, and vital quality of life initiatives are authorized. 
Procedurally, there is ample room for improvement in how the budgetary responsibilities of Congress are executed. The exclusion from negotiations of Members with important interests in specific issues should not be accepted. Conversely, when invitations to participate in negotiations on such issues are proffered, the Members in question should not then decline those offers. Through such cooperativeness we can hopefully avoid the kind of problems that have delayed final passage of this bill. 
Lest anyone underestimate the importance of this bill, let me remind them that it is bad enough that $13 billion foreign aid appropriations bills are routinely passed without proper authorization. To permit $260 billion in defense spending to be enacted without appropriate authorization is simply dangerous. The authorizing and appropriations processes, as we all know, provide Congress with its own much needed internal system of checks and balances. As with the checks and balances that exist between branches of government, should our internal system break down, the results will be grave indeed, including drastically reduced accountability in how public funds are spent and an elimination of vital oversight of the structure, equipping and training of our Armed Forces. That is not a situation that should be permitted to develop, and I intend to do everything in my power to prevent it from happening. 
We maintain the system of authorizing and appropriating to help prevent an excessive consolidation of power in too few hands. I don't think I exaggerate when I suggest that such a consolidation would be seriously deleterious to the country's best interests. 
On the content of the bill itself, when the fiscal year 1998 defense budget process commenced early this calender year, it was widely anticipated that certain issues would delay and possibly derail our ability to pass an authorization act. Chief among these is the so-called depot maintenance issue, inarguably the single most contentious issue with which the Senate Armed Services and House National Security Committees were involved. Those of us who have been around a while are more conversant than we would like to be in the intricacies surrounding this arcane issue involving a handful of congressional districts. 
The conference report before us today includes a depot compromise that is much improved from previous depot language considered this year. For example, it changes the 60/40 workload definition to 50/50. It also removes the capacity factor requirement--that is 75 percent--which was synonymous to killing competition at Kelly and McClellan Air Logistics Centers. However, this remains an exceedingly deficient approach to the issue of depot-level maintenance, still grounded in protectionist sentiments devoid of serious regard for the principles of sound public policy. 
A key criticism is that the process was not inclusive of all the parties that would be affected by changing DOD policy on depots. I feel strongly that developing compromise legislation with the depot caucus and the Kelly and McClellan supporters could have been achievable in the late stages of the process. Having said that, however, this may be the best compromise that could be expected. 
I tried to reform depot policy in the past as chairman of the Senate Readiness Subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee and failed. So I commend Senator Inhofe and Chairman Thurmond for making at least some meaningful progress toward reforming the depot maintenance system. I continue to support fair and open competition between private and public depots, though. Current law, even with these modifications, precludes the full competition that would most benefit the American taxpayer and allow the Defense Department to allocate operations and maintenance dollars more optimally. 
I am also disappointed that this compromise does not include language that was in the Senate bill that changed section 2466--definition of 60/40--by relating workload to a facilities-based definition rather than a personnel-based definition. This provision would have allowed industry to go into public depots and compete for work alongside public employees and any core capability work done privately in a depot counted against the public workload. This language, more than any other provision in the compromise encouraged public-private partnerships. 
Another issue that was amicably resolved, but that should not have been brought up at all in light of the apparent resolution of the matter during preparation of the previous fiscal year's authorization act, involves personnel missing in action in Southeast Asia. Most of the onerous provisions, strenuously opposed by administrations of both parties as well as by theater and war-fighting commanders since its inception a decade ago, that establish burdensome bureaucratic requirements upon our troops in the field and that place unrealistic requirements upon the Defense Department personnel responsible 
for accounting for missing personnel, are included in the conference report. 
Those provisions that are included are not particularly necessary and won't contribute to resolution of the problem of accounting for all missing personnel, but they are not as egregious as the provisions that were not included in the final bill. Those of us active on this issue for many years who believed the issue to have been resolved last year will not endure another protracted debate over provisions of extremely dubious merit when the process begins again next year. It was clearly stated by the conferees that this matter is considered closed. I expect that to be the case. 
Not surprisingly, given the wealth of unnecessary and wasteful programs funded in the defense appropriations bill, the authorization act similarly includes numerous examples of items funded in the bill primarily, and, in some instances solely, for parochial reasons. I have already presented a list of such items from both the House and Senate authorization bills for publication in the Congressional Record. Consequently, I will not repeat them item by item today. Suffice to say that the unrequested $150 million for the B-2 bomber, the addition of a destroyer not requested by the Defense Department, the acquisition of additional C-130 airframes despite the surplus of such aircraft already in the fleet, the usual list of unrequested military construction projects, and a variety of location-specific earmarks for such highly questionable projects as those all-important Centers for Excellence, all combine to represent a business-as-usual approach to passing legislation that serves to further erode public confidence in elected officials while draining scarce financial resources from higher priority programs. To paraphrase Samuel Beckett, we've laughed at the idiocy so many times that the humor is gone and we are left with the unfortunate consequences of our actions. 
Thankfully, negotiations on the authorization act succeeded in diluting the potentially damaging effects of language on Bosnia, but the appropriations bill has already addressed that action in a manner apparently acceptable to the White House. The administration's protestations notwithstanding, a satisfactory compromise was worked out on the export of computers with dual use applications to countries with suspect records in how such technology is exploited. Whether the Commerce Department wants to admit it or not, a legitimate national security concern involving the export of such computers does exist, and I believe the language included in the conference report adequately addresses the concerns of both the national security apparatus and the industry affected by it. I am surprised, therefore, that the Office of Management and Budget included this issue in its letter to Majority Leader Lott as being particularly objectionable. 
Provisions involving the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization serve little or no constructive purpose, particularly those pertaining to cost. The cost of expanding the alliance is certainly worth debating, but at the end of the day we ought not predicate a decision on whether to bring in new members on cost data that is so qualified as to be rendered meaningless. Expanding NATO will cost as much or as little as we want to spend. We're not bringing in impoverished Third World countries with facilities barely able to accommodate a Cessna. We're talking to countries that belonged, involuntarily, to the Warsaw Pact and which possess military infrastructures that only need to be improved upon and that have command, control and communications networks that must be made compatible with the rest of the alliance. That will certainly cost money, but it is hardly a deal breaker. 
Thanks to the administration's decision to adopt a more reasonable approach toward missile defense issues, the conference report includes a more realistic funding profile for both theater and national missile defenses. The administration's admission that it was seriously underfunding even rudimentary national missile defenses has helped to move this issue forward in a constructive manner. Hopefully, this presages a trend toward a more mature and serious approach to missile defenses on the part of the White House. 
I am pleased that the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program is funded at the Defense Department's request while restricting the use of funds to exclude spending on programs or areas not directly involved in dismantling Russian weapon systems that would otherwise threaten the United States. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, the conference report to accompany H.R. 1119 is like its predecessors: flawed but acceptable. It deserves our support and I hope my colleagues will agree to vote for its passage.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with the senior Senator from South Carolina. 
I understand that the conference report on the Department of Defense reauthorization bill includes a provision--section 1088--that reauthorizes the Aviation Insurance Program for 5 years. The Senate will soon act on a freestanding bill to reauthorize this important program. The freestanding bill (S. 1193) was approved recently by the Commerce Committee, which is the committee with jurisdiction over this program.

Mr. McCAIN. I agree with my colleague from South Carolina that it is essential that we reauthorize this program as soon as possible. Our goals are the same in that respect. Nevertheless, the Commerce Committee specifically acted to reauthorize the Aviation Insurance Program through 1998. The committee did so out of concern that the balance in the revolving fund is insufficient to pay a major claim or simultaneous claims. Timely payments for hull losses are a significant issue. Many of the carriers lease aircraft under agreements that stipulate that they have to repair or replace damaged aircraft within 30 days of the damage. 
The bill would not grant the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] borrowing authority to cover claims against the program, as we had originally planned. Rather, a short term extension of the program gives the committee and the administration additional time to craft an alternative to FAA borrowing authority. S. 1193 also makes other important modifications to the program. 
I appreciate the efforts of the Armed Services Committee to ensure that the Aviation Insurance Program is in place. If, however, both of these bills are enacted into law, I want to clarify that the provisions of S. 1193 supersede the 5-year reauthorization bill. Is that agreeable to the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee?

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, every high school civics student is taught the importance of the system of checks and balances among the three branches of government that underlays our representative government. That system, as we all know, is an essential element of democracy. Without it, the consolidation of excessive power in one branch of government poses a very real risk to the survival of true democracy and, consequently, the welfare of the republic. 
I do not intend to sound melodramatic, but I believe strongly that the survival of the legislative branch's own system of internal checks and balances is similarly essential to the welfare of our country. The process of authorizing appropriations exists for a reason, and that reason has only increased over time. The balance of power within the branch of our Government that enjoys a constitutional prerogative over the raising and expenditure of revenues seriously needs to be respected and maintained. 
Important policy directives that are an integral part of the authorizing process are not particularly well suited to the appropriations process. Authorization acts are intended to set the tone for the appropriations process that, ideally, would follow. When this system begins to degrade for whatever reason, the entire budget review process falters, and essential legislative provisions and oversight activities go unaddressed. 
The two-step process of reviewing the President's budget request for defense--in both the authorization and appropriations committees--is especially crticial to our national security. The Senate Armed Services and House National Security Committees provide Congress its most important body of knowledge and experience in the vital realm of national security affairs. The defense authorization bill, which is the major legislative product of these committees, contains the recommendations of the Congress' defense experts on important policy matters as well as guidance on funding priorities. Many of the policy recommendations in this bill must be enacted before the dollars provided in the appropriations bill can be expended to implement them, such as the increases in pay and bonuses that are key to good morale in the force. 
With all due respect to the Appropriations Committees, no single committee should be granted sole authority over the expenditure of $260 billion in defense funds. The manning, structure, equipping, and training of the most powerful and important armed forces in the world is too important to set aside the long-standing process of authorization and appropriations review. 
Despite its flaws, and there are some, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Fiscal Year 1998 National Defense Authorization Act. To fail to pass this important legislation would be an abrogation of one of our most important responsibilities and would shift the balance of power within Congress from the many to the few, to the detriment of our future security.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is clear that a multiyear reauthorization of ISTEA will not be possible during this session. Due to the expiration of ISTEA authorizations, I am very concerned that vital safety programs under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation are at risk. Senator Hollings and I are introducing legislation that would provide funds to continue the operation of those important safety programs. 
According to the Department of Transportation [DOT], the highway safety grant programs do not have any unobligated balances available, from prior authorizations, to draw on if ISTEA is not extended to bridge the gap between now and when a long-term reauthorization bill is passed. The programs at risk include the State and Community Safety Grant Program under section 402, the section 410 grant program to encourage counter measures to impaired driving, and the National Driver Register [NDR]. 
The contract to run the National Driver Register is presently running on funds obligated in fiscal year 1997 but that contract and the funding expires in March. When that contract expires the program will have to be shut down and the staff dismissed. 
DOT indicates most States only have funding to operate safety programs for the next 2 or 3 months. I understand that some States have already started shutting down some of their highway safety programs. 
Funds are also needed to pay the salaries of the more than 3,000 State motor carrier enforcement personnel. With the expiration of ISTEA, there is no Federal funding currently available to pay the salaries of these individuals whose expenses are exclusively financed through the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program [MCSAP]. The Department of Transportation testified this week that the elimination of vital MCSAP funding could impede the ability of States to perform commercial vehicle and driver inspections. A short-term extension of MCSAP funding will help ensure that unsafe vehicles and drivers are prevented from traveling on our Nation's highways. 
I know that no one in this body wants to see a situation where highway safety is degraded in any way. I look forward to working with my colleagues to address these important issues of highway safety to ensure that we meet our obligations.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that is basically a technical correction to language that I had included in the fiscal year 1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. That language, and the legislation I offer today, are designed to make humanitarian exceptions for the unmarried adult children of former reeducation camp detainees seeking to emigrate to the United States under the Orderly Departure Program [ODP]. Despite what I considered to have been pretty unambiguous legislation in both word and intent, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and Department of State interpreted my amendment to the 1997 bill so as to exclude the very people to whom the provision was targeted. 
An amendment identical to the bill I am introducing today was included, without objection, to the State Department authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. Because that bill is hung-up over an unrelated issue, and because the State Department ceased accepting new applications for the ODP at the end of September, it was imperative that another avenue be sought for attaining passage of this important legislation. I wish to reiterate that this is an uncontroversial bill, supported earlier this year by the Senate, and which enjoys the backing of the Department of State. 
Prior to April 1995, the adult unmarried children of former Vietnamese re-education camp prisoners were granted derivative refugee status and were permitted to accompany their parents to the United States under a subprogram of the Orderly Departure Program. 
This policy changed in April 1995. My amendment to fiscal year 1997 foreign operations appropriations bill, which comprises part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, was intended to restore the status quo ante regarding the adult unmarried children of former prisoners. My comments in the Congressional Record from July 25, 1996, clearly spelled this out. 
Unfortunately, certain categories of children who, prior to April 1995, had received derivative refugee status and whom Congress intended to be covered by last year's amendment, are now considered ineligible to benefit from that legislation. 
First, prior to April 1995 the widows of prisoners who died in re-education camps were permitted to be resettled in the United States under this subprogram of the ODP, and their unmarried adult children were allowed to accompany them. These children are now considered ineligible to benefit from last year's legislation. 
To ask these widows to come to the United States without their children is equal to denying them entry under the program. Many of these women are elderly and in poor health, and the presence of their children is essential to providing the semblance of a family unit with the care that includes. 
The second problem stemming from INS and the State Department's interpretation of the 1997 language involves the roughly 20 percent of former Vietnamese re-education camp prisoners resettled in the United States who were processed as immigrants, at the convenience of the United States Government. 
Their unmarried adult children, prior to April 1995, were still given derivative refugee status; however, the position of INS and State is that these children are now ineligible because the language in the fiscal year 1997 bill included the phrase `processed as refugees for resettlement in the United States.' 
That phrase was intended to identify the children of former prisoners being brought to the United States under the subprogram of the ODP and eligible to be processed as a refugee--which all clearly were--as distinct from the children of former prisoners who were not being processed for resettlement in the United States. 
The fact that a former prisoner, eligible to be processed as a refugee under the ODP subprogram, was processed as an immigrant had no effect prior to April 1995, and their children were granted refugee status. The intention of last year s legislation was to restore the status quo ante, including for the unmarried adult children of former prisoners eligible for and included in this subprogram but resettled as migrants. 
Mr. President, I urge support for this legislation.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the United States is once again facing a decision about whether and how to respond to Iraqi intransigence over the issue of its continued development and concealment of weapons of mass destruction and their associated delivery systems. It is imperative that we not back down, as has already been the case to an alarming degree. 
All countries act out of their own economic self-interest. The United States is no exception. We should not, however, acquiesce in such conduct in the case of Iraq. Russia, which seeks compensation for weapons it sold to Baghdad during the Soviet era as well as the hard currency and access to oil that Iraq represents, and France, which similarly pursues contracts for the development of Iraqi oil, have led the way in arguing for a relaxation of the economic sanctions levied against Iraq as a result of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Countries like Egypt and Kenya have demonstrated growing sympathy for Iraq's economic situation. 
The reason why the United States should stand firm and not continue to adopt essentially meaningless positions on the question of sanctions is quite simple: Iraq has to a remarkable degree always held its destiny in its own hands. Little was asked of it other than to come clean on the extent of its efforts to develop weapon systems capable of threatening stability in the world's most volatile region. And, yet, it has consistently, for more than 6 years now, refused to do that, repeatedly challenging the international community and miscalculating the ramifications of its actions. 
With regard to its efforts at developing chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them, a particularly illuminating episode occurred back in August 1995. It was then that Saddam Hussein s sons-in-law, one of whom had been in charge of overseeing the development of those weapons, defected to Jordan. Anticipating the intelligence coup for the United Nations that was to come, the Iraqis decided to preempt the damage the defectors could cause by revealing a wealth of documents--over half-a-million pages--detailing their biological weapons program. Mr. President, 150 steel trunks and boxes stuffed with documentation that was to have been turned over in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, yet would likely have remained hidden indefinitely had the defections not occurred, suddenly and miraculously appeared. 
Iraq's refusal to abide by the rules of civilized society and to test the will of the international community has been manifested in other ways also. In October 1994, it moved thousands of troops toward the Kuwaiti border, precipitating a costly but essential deployment of United States military forces to the region to deter a repeat of the 1990 invasion. Whether Iraq intended to invade Kuwait at that time is highly unlikely; whether a failure to respond on the part of the United States would have emboldened Saddam is beyond dispute. 
Two years later, Iraq launched a large-scale concerted ground campaign against Kurdish enclaves in the country s north. Saddam was able to exploit longstanding, violent divisions within the Kurdish population to reestablish a measure of control over territory denied it since the Gulf war. In so doing, it sent a resounding message to the Kurdish population, including that part to which it allied itself during its military incursion, that it was willing and capable of asserting itself within its borders. Particularly disturbing, if totally in character for Saddam, his intelligence service utilized the opportunity to hunt down and execute Kurdish factions hostile to his brutal rule, including hundreds of individuals who had cast their lot with the United States. 
The Clinton administration's response to that incursion into territory supposedly under U.N. protection was to launch a small number of embarrassingly ineffectual cruise missile launches in an entirely different region and to expand the no-fly zone in the south. If our intent was to prevent a horizontal escalation of the conflict, we succeeded. The fact that there was not apparent intent on the part of Saddam at that time to conduct military operations in the south was purely academic. 
The most recent incident started out considerably more ambiguous, but is no less damaging to the U.N.'s ability to enforce its provisions over the protracted periods of time necessary to get results. Iraq clearly violated the no-fly zone, but only after Iranian attacks against bases of the People s Mojahedin of Iran situation on the Iraqi side of the border. There is a noticeable dearth of sympathetic parties here, but the bottom line is that the no-fly zone was violated, and the administration was correct to respond. Iraq s apparent retaliatory measures, in effect, the refusal to permit United States citizens to participate in the U.N. inspection teams enforcing Security Council resolutions, has been appropriately rejected by members of the Council. 
The problem lies in the political environment Council members France and Russia continue to create that encourages Saddam to believe he can act with impunity. It is absolutely imperative that the administration communicate to these countries, as well as to others sympathetic to the plight of the Iraqi people, that the sanctions must remain in place until Iraq finally does what it has resisted doing for 6 years: abide by the conditions of the cease fire. Saddam himself holds his country's welfare in his hands. All that is asked of him is to place that welfare above his drive to threaten his neighbors with chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. The fact that he has been unwilling to accept that very basic condition illustrates the need to maintain the sanctions in perpetuity if necessary. The international community was willing to isolate South Africa for an indefinite period of time until fundamental changes were implemented. It is entirely reasonable, and essential for the future of our friends and allies in the Middle East as well as for our own economic well-being, that the international community demonstrate the same steadfastness in the case of Iraq that it did with South Africa. Morally and practically, it is the only option available to us.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on October 24, I submitted for the Record, a list of objectionable provisions in the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill. Among the projects mentioned were three items which should not have been listed. They are as follows: $1.5 million for the home energy rating system; $1 million for the weatherization assistance program; and $25,000 for State energy program grants. 
Mr. President, these three line items do not violate the criteria I use for determining low-priority, unnecessary, or wasteful spending that was not reviewed in the appropriate merit-based prioritization process. Unfortunately, these three items were inadvertently included on the list. I regret this error, and withdraw my recommendation that these items be line-item vetoed.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce legislation that would eliminate approximately 150 unnecessary reports that have been mandated by the Congress. All of these reports have been judged as unnecessary, wasteful, or redundant by each of the Federal agencies which have been required to produce them. I am also pleased to have the considerable assistance of the coauthor of this legislation, Senator Levin. 
This proposal is intended to combat the growing problem of the thousands of mandatory reports that Congress has been imposing upon the executive branch over the last decade. Each year, Members of Congress continue to burden the executive branch agencies by mandating numerous reports. The price for the wasteful reports is extraordinarily high. Not only do they cost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars each year, but they exhaust the often limited resources of the Federal agencies which have to meet these reporting requirements. Furthermore, the thousands of Federal employees who must work for months on these unnecessary reports could focus their energies to work on far more worthy ventures on behalf of taxpayers. They are a dubious use of taxpayers dollars and Government productivity. 
Senator Levin and I began working on various aspects of eliminating and sunsetting unnecessary Federal reports in 1993. We have both been long concerned about the vast amounts of public funds and valuable government personnel resources that are being wasted. Let me state just one instructive example of how reporting mandates drain public funds and departmental resources. The Department of Agriculture alone spent over $40 million in taxpayers money in 1993 to produce the 280 reports it was required to submit to the Congress that year. While many of these reports may provide vital information to the Congress and the public, it is undeniable that many others can and should be repealed in order to save taxpayer dollars and staff time. This is true for virtually every agency of the Federal Government. 
In 1995, Senator Levin and I were able to successfully eliminate approximately 200 reports, and sunset several hundred others. However, since that time, the administration has highlighted 450 additional reports that they would like repealed. Here are a few examples of the type of reports I am talking about. Each year, the following are required to be sent to the Congress from Federal agencies: Report on the Elimination of Notice to Congress Regarding Waiver of Requirement for Use of Vegetable Ink in Lithographic Printing; Report on Canadian Acid Rain Control Program; and Report on Metal Casting Research and Development Activities. 
I have asked OMB to calculate the total amount of public funds we would save if the unnecessary or redundant reporting requirements contained in this legislation are repealed, and I will provide my colleagues with their response. Considering that we currently have over a $5 trillion dollar Federal deficit, Mr. President, I'm sure that you would agree that our citizens would not support this egregious expenditure of hundreds of useless reports each and every year. 
It is important to note that this reporting mandate problem continues to grow with each passing year. GAO determined several years ago that `Congress imposes about 300 new requirements on Federal agencies each year.' Prompt Senate action to authorize the elimination of wasteful reports in this proposal will be an important service to our constituents and these agencies. The staffing burdens and paper shuffling these outdated reporting mandates cause are of little real value to the important work of government. We should lighten the load of both overburdened taxpayers and the agencies involved by ending them now. 
I would again like to thank Senator Levin for his hard work and dedication on this issue over the past few years. Furthermore, I must acknowledge the administration for its earnest support of this effort. Additionally, the proposed terminations were carefully reviewed and then approved by each respective committee chairman and ranking member. These reports represent the flagrant waste of taxpayers dollars and Government productivity. 
It is clear that this bipartisan effort will put an end to a significant part of the unnecessary cycle of waste and misspent resources that these reports represent. The adoption of this legislation would be a strong contribution toward downsizing Government as the American people have repeatedly called upon us to do. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and remove the millstone of unnecessary and costly paperwork that Congress has hung around the neck of the Federal Government for too long.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress in support of efforts to foster friendship and cooperation between the United States and Mongolia. Passage of this resolution will signal American support of Mongolia's peaceful transition to a stable democracy and market economy. Senator Thomas is an original cosponsor to this resolution. 
There has been a stunning political transformation in Mongolia since it broke away from Communist rule in 1990. In the past 7 years, there have been two Presidential elections and three parliamentary elections. All of these have been open and democratic, and have not suffered from violence or fraud. 
The most important aspect of these elections is that they have showed the triumph of democracy and democratic forces. In 1996, the Mongolian Social Democratic Party [MSDP] and Mongolian National Democratic Party [MNDP] formed a coalition with two smaller parties to promote a unified democratic front. The fruits of this decision soon came to bear when the unified coalition campaigned on a `Contract with the Mongolian Voter' and won 50 of the 76 seats in the 1996 Parliamentary elections. I am happy to say that the International Republican Institute played a major role in this victory by showing these parties how to mobilize their supporters and work toward victory. The Mongolian Peoples Revolutionary Party, the former Mongolian Communist Party, won a Presidential election this year, and the President-elect has made assurances, including to me personally in August, that he supports democracy. 
This democratic transformation has established a firm human rights regime. The Mongolian Constitution allows freedom of speech, the press, and expression. Separation of church and state is recognized in this predominantly Buddhist nation as well as the right to worship or not worship. Full freedom of emigration is allowed, and Mongolia now is in full compliance with sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974, also known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment. An independent judiciary has been established to protect these rights from any future violation. 
Mongolia is also in the middle of an economic transformation. As part of the `Contract with the Mongolian Voter,' the democratic coalition of the MNDP and MSDP ran on 
promises to establish private property rights and encourage foreign investment. The Mongolian Government is now steadily creating a market economy. A program has been set up to allow residents of Government-owned high rise apartments to acquire ownership of their residences. Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization in January this year, and in May the Parliament eliminated all tariffs, except on personal automobiles, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco. In September 1996, the Government removed price controls and Mongolians were able to finally survive a winter without a major breakdown of heat or electricity. The Mongolian Government is now boldly moving to set the nation on a course to privatize large-scale enterprise and reform the state pension system. 
When I was in Mongolia, I saw the effects of this economic transformation firsthand. At a town hall meeting in Kharakhorum, the ancient capital of the Mongol Empire, I met a herdsman and asked him about the economic liberalization. First, I asked him how many sheep he had under communism. He said none, because the Communists didn't allow private property. Then I asked him how many sheep he owned after privatization. He answered that he had 3 sheep then, which is not much in a country with 25 million sheep. So I asked him how many sheep he has now. He answered that he now has 90 goats, 60 sheep, 20 cows, and 6 horses. I asked him if that was considered successful. He replied that he was successful as were many herdsmen in this new economy. He then told me that he would never want to change the system back to what it was, because `now Mongols have control over their own life and destiny.' That is the new culture of a market Mongolian economy. 
There are many benefits to supporting Mongolian democracy and economic liberalization. In 1991, Secretary of State James Baker promised Mongolia that the United States would be Mongolia's `third neighbor.' We remain committed to that course of action to encourage Mongolia in its endeavors and promote it as an example of how nations can successfully convert from a Communist totalitarian state to a market democracy. Finally, a democratic Mongolia will promote peace and stability in northern Asia. 
Finally, there are important economic benefits to the United States. Mongolia would like to make the United States a major trading partner. Total two-way trade between the United States and Mongolia has almost tripled in value from $13 million in 1991 to $35 million in 1996. Total U.S. exports have more than doubled from over $2 million in 1992 to $4.2 million in 1996. As Mongolia continues to liberalize its economy, the United States will be able to count on it to become an important market for American goods and services. 
I hope that my colleagues here in the Senate will join me in recognizing Mongolia as an example of successful democratic transformation and supporting the Mongol transition to a market economy.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 on behalf of Senators Dorgan, Daschle, Inouye, Campbell, and myself. This amendment enables the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] to designate common carriers not under the jurisdiction of a State commission as eligible recipients of universal service support. 
Universal Service provides intercarrier support for the provision of telecommunications services in rural and high-cost areas throughout the United States. However, section 254(e) of the 1996 act states that only an eligible carrier designated under section 214(e) of the Communications Act shall be eligible to receive specific federal universal support after the FCC issues regulations implementing the new universal service provisions into the law. Section 214(e) does not account for the fact that State commissions in a few states have no jurisdiction over certain carriers. Typically, States also have no jurisdiction over tribally owned companies which may or may not be regulated by a tribal authority that is not a State commission per se. 
The failure to account for these situations means that carriers not subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission have no way of becoming an eligible carrier that can receive universal service support. This would be the case whether these carriers are traditional local exchange carriers that provide services otherwise included in the program, have previously obtained universal service support, or will likely be the carrier that continues to be the carrier of last resort for customers in the area.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Gorton, Senator Hollings, and Senator Ford, in submitting an amendment to the bill (H.R. 1271) the Federal Aviation Administration Research, Engineering, and Development Authorization Act of 1997. This bill would authorize the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] Research, Engineering, and Development [RE&D] program. The program funds projects to improve facilities, equipment, techniques, and procedures so that our Nation's aviation system can operate safety and efficiently. 
The FAA's research and development activities help to provide the advancements and innovations that are needed to keep the U.S. aviation system the best in the world. Our Nation's ability to have a strong aviation-related research and development program directly impacts our success in the global market and our standard of living. Investment in the FAA RE&D program will fund projects to determine how limited airport and airspace capacity can meet ever increasing demands, aviation security can be improved, and flight safety concerns can be addressed. 
The FAA has divided its RE&D program into nine key areas. These include capacity and air traffic management technology; communications, navigation and surveillance systems; weather; airport technology; aircraft safety technology; system security technology; human factors and aviation medicine; environment and energy; and innovative/cooperative research. The FAA funds various projects in these nine areas. 
Ongoing or planned FAA RE&D projects will provide important benefits for the U.S. aviation system and its users. The aircraft safety technology area, for example, includes continued research on improving passenger evacuation in the event of an aircraft accident. The system security technology area will include efforts to develop more effective explosives detection technologies. In addition, several recommendations of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security will involve the FAA RE&D program, including modernizing the Nation's air traffic control system. 
I strongly support the FAA's efforts under the RE&D program to work in partnership with public and private entities. These partnerships enable the FAA to gain expertise in specialized areas of technology, and to leverage limited Federal funds. The FAA, for example, now has more than 250 agreements for research and development partnerships with research organizations, foreign governments, and industry consortia. In addition, the FAA has established several university-based research centers. 
This bill also asks the FAA to address problems that the Agency may face if the software in any of its various computer systems malfunctions when they hit the year 2000. In particular, we cannot afford to have air traffic control systems affected by this problem. I understand that the FAA is behind schedule in determining which of its systems are affected by the Year 2000 problem. The time to make this determination, and then make necessary software modifications, is growing short. That is why the bill includes a Sense of the Congress that the FAA should, among other things, develop contingency plans for those systems that the Agency is unable to correct in time. 
The FAA RE&D program is a key component of the Agency's total ongoing efforts to provide the most safe and efficient aviation system possible. I would strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to authorize the program.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to be brief. This issue has been well discussed and well debated, and will be again because this is the first step in a process that we will see for the first time in the Senate, and that is a motion of disapproval of a veto by the President and an attempt to override the President's veto. So we will have plenty of time. I mainly asked to speak, one, to congratulate Senator Stevens not only for his stewardship of the entire Appropriations Committee, but his staunch advocacy for a strong national defense and his sincere efforts to do what he feels is right. 
Senator Burns has done an outstanding job as the chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee. I believe that his recent depiction of the situation at Malmstrom Air Force Base is an ample indication of his concern for the living standards of the men and women in the military and his deep and abiding concern for their welfare. 
Having said that, Mr. President, I, as a supporter of the line-item veto, intend to vote against this resolution. I believe that we have to set up criteria that need to be met, because there is not an unlimited amount of Defense dollars or taxpayer dollars for that matter. Not only did these projects--or at least the overwhelming majority of them--not meet the criteria I have been using now for 10 years, but there were 129 low-priority items added to the Milcon appropriations bills that should have been--at least under the criteria I have been using for the last 10 years--vetoed. 
Mr. President, there is a process that we go through. It is authorization, it is hearings, it is budget requests, it is the kind of orderly process that gives a priority that is sufficiently compelling for the taxpayers' dollars to be used on that project, whether it be in military construction or defense appropriations, or any other appropriations bill. In order to understand that, in my view, in order to make a reasonable and fair and objective decision, you have to set up objective criteria. That is where the administration has failed in this exercise. 
The people in this body--the Senator from Washington, who just spoke about what happened in her State, the Senator from Montana, the Senator from Georgia, and all the other cosponsors of this bill--deserve the right to know under what criteria the President of the United States would act in vetoing these various projects; in this case, they are military construction projects. They have a right to know that, as do the people and the military installations in their districts. We have a future years defense plan that the Pentagon sets up, which lists the projects that are going to be funded, and which they plan to, after a careful screening process, request funding for from the Congress and the American people. There is a system that goes before the authorizing committees. We have a military construction authorization bill, and then it goes before the Appropriations Committee. That process should be adhered to. 
Why am I against so many of these projects? Simply, Mr. President, because there are 12,000 American military families that are on food stamps. I understand they don't have a decent facility to eat in at Malmstrom, but I also know they are kept away from home because of a lack of equipment. And we are having a hemorrhage of Air Force and Navy pilots because we are not paying them enough and we are keeping them away from their families, keeping them at sea, or in places like Iraq or Turkey, because we are not funding them adequately. 
Mr. President, I happen to know that we are not modernizing the force sufficiently in order to meet the challenge in the future. We are buying things such as the B-2 bombers, which we find out can't even fly in the rain. Then we have the Seawolf submarines, and there is no tangible challenge to American security that warrant paying for that. Frankly, we are funding projects not on the basis of merit, but for other reasons. 
I believe that the men and women in the military, especially those enlisted men and women, deserve more than they are getting. They are not getting it because we are funding projects and programs many times which are unnecessary. Also, in the Defense appropriations bills we are funding projects that have nothing to do with national defense. I am not sure what electric car research has to do with national defense. I am not sure what supercomputers to study the aurora borealis have to do with defense. They may be worthwhile projects, and I do not disagree that some of the projects that were vetoed by the President here were worthwhile; it is a matter of priority. 
I hope that the President of the United States and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, who obviously is making many of these recommendations to the President, will understand that we have to set up criteria for when the line-item veto is used or not used. Otherwise, you give the appearance of politicization of the process, which understandably angers and upsets Members of Congress who feel that they or their projects are being singled out, where other projects under the same criteria were not line item-vetoed. 
So I believe that if we want to avoid going through this exercise on a fairly frequent basis, the Members of Congress and the American people deserve the President of the United States to say: This is the criteria I will use--whether it is authorized or not, whether it is added in conference or not, whether it was earmarked or not, whether it was requested, or whatever. I am not saying the President should use my criteria, but I am saying he should use an objective criteria that is credible; so that when the Senator from Montana, Senator Burns, who has devoted so many hundreds of hours to this effort and takes his duties as chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee so seriously, decides whether or not to add or not add a project to his legislation, he will know whether it meets his criteria. He will have a certainty as to whether the President will veto it or not. 
I congratulate the Senator from Montana and his staff for their hard work. I hope we can provide a framework in which he can work so there would be certainty and objectivity, and not a taint or appearance of politicization of this process, which is the case today. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader especially in all of this. I consider myself a close and dear friend of the majority leader. The majority leader has seen a lot more of me than he wants to ever see me with such frequency ever again. I want to assure the majority leader that I am deeply appreciative of the time he has spent with me, and the time he has spent with the entire Republican conference. 
I don't think there has been a more difficult issue that the majority leader has had to handle, nor do I believe that he will face one as difficult as this in the future. 
I thank Senator Daschle, the Democrat leader, who I think has approached this issue in a fair fashion. 
I think it is also only a entirely appropriate that I thank Senator McConnell. The Senator has strongly held honest views on this issue. He has again shown a willingness to debate and discuss this issue. Our differences have been passionate but they have not been personal, and I know that he and I intend to maintain that relationship. I can assure my colleagues that Senator McConnell will make strong arguments for his position. And I certainly respect and in some ways admire his willingness to stand forth on an issue which is somewhat difficult to address. 
Mr. President, I also believe the following: That we can and should and will sit down together on both sides of the aisle, proponents and opponents, with the recognition that this system needs to be fixed. On how it needs to be fixed there are strong differences of opinion, but I think almost every American now understands that we need to fix this system because we need to restore the confidence of the American people in the way that we select our elected officials. 
I am convinced that the real answer, the real solution, will probably not come in the form of debate or any cloture motions and all of that on the floor of the Senate. I believe it is going to come when we all sit down as dedicated Americans and come up with a bipartisan solution to this problem. I still believe that is possible. I will do everything in my power working with both Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, Senator McConnell, and my dear friend, Senator Feingold, who has done a wonderful job here, as I have said many times, so that we can get this agreement. 
So I believe this is not an end. There isn't a midpoint. This is just a beginning of a dialog that has to begin in all seriousness, and discussion and compromise which may be called for on both sides of this issue so we can do the will of the American people. I believe the will of the American people has been expressed convincingly that we need to fix the system. 
I want to reiterate my openness to any suggestion or idea or proposal that would lead us to that. 
Again, thanks to the majority leader. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from North Dakota for his involvement as a very active member of the Commerce Committee and his participation now in this and a variety of other issues. The Senator from North Dakota and I occasionally disagree, but those disagreements are not disagreeable, and he is one of the most well-informed members of the committee. I note the presence of Senator Hollings, the distinguished ranking member on the floor, who I know has a statement to make, as well. 
First, Mr. President, I recommend that the Senate vote to confirm the nomination of William E. Kennard as a member of the Federal Communications Commission where he will serve as the Commission's new Chairman. The fact that the full Senate is debating and casting individual votes on Mr. Kennard's confirmation underscores the importance to the American people of the decisions the Senate is making about the FCC. 
For the first time since it was established in 1934, the Senate is filling four vacancies on this five-member Commission. 
Last night the Senate confirmed the nominations of three of these new members: Michael K. Powell, an antitrust lawyer; Harold Furchgott-Roth, an economist; and Gloria Tristani, a state commissioner. The combination of expertises they bring to the FCC will make an invaluable contribution to the quality of its decisions. 
If confirmed, Mr. Kennard, the FCC's current general counsel, would add the expertise of a seasoned communications lawyer. In addition, Mr. Kennard would be the FCC's first African-American Chairman, and for the first time in its history a majority of the Commission's members would be of African-American or Hispanic descent. This reflects both the inclusiveness we aspire to as a society, and the freshness we hope a reconstituted FCC will pursue in its regulatory approach. 
But this is not just an historic moment for the FCC; it is also a vitally important moment for consumers. The FCC's five Commissioners control the regulatory destiny of industries that account for fully one-sixth of our gross national product. For the consumer, this means that the Commission's decisions will affect the price of a local or a long-distance telephone call, how much we pay each month for cable service, how many choices we will have in paging and cellphone service, and even what we see on TV and hear on radio. 
These would be daunting enough responsibilities for the new Commissioners in and of themselves. But last year the Congress expanded the FCC's duties exponentially by enacting the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The act aims to introduce a heretofore-unattainable level of competition and deregulation into the provision of all kinds of voice, video, and data services. 
It would be nice to say that all this is working well. But the truth, Mr. President, is that it isn't. The lower rates, better service, and increased competition called for by the Act have translated, at least in the short run, into higher rates, increased concentration among big industry players, and reams of new regulations. In addition, recent court cases have all but gutted the FCC's plans for making local telephone service competitive. 
In my view, the act has been an abject failure in attaining any benefits whatsoever for the average consumer, and it's difficult to see any improvement in the offing. That is absolutely unacceptable. And that, Mr. President, is why we are casting individual votes on Mr. Kennard's nomination this morning. As the FCC's general counsel, he is unavoidably linked with FCC's failed and flawed implementation of the act to date. We are therefore anxious that Mr. Kennard understand the dissatisfaction with what is occurring and that he be responsive and flexible in addressing our concerns. The FCC is, after all, an agency created by the Congress. Its primary responsibility is to implement and enforce the will of Congress, pursuant to authority delegated to it by Congress. Some of our members are very concerned that Mr. Kennard may be so tied to the FCC's current policies that he will be not fully responsive to congressional concerns about them. 
These concerns have led to sequential questions by myself, Senator Burns, Senator Stevens, Senator Brownback, Senator Helms, and others about Mr. Kennard's ability and willingness to reexamine and change policies of the FCC that we believe misinterpret the law and harm consumers. These concerns are only heightened by the very public way in which the administration has sought to involve itself in the deliberations of this supposedly independent regulatory agency. 
Obviously, I do not agree with Mr. Kennard on many issues. For example, he believes that the FCC can and should tell broadcasters what kinds of programming they must present. I vehemently disagree. He believes that the FCC's current policies on telephone competition are working. I vehemently disagree. I am also troubled by the fact that, when asked, he was unable to specify any particular issue with which he might have disagreed with the FCC's current chairman--despite the fact that the FCC had disposed of thousands and thousands of issues during his tenure as its general counsel. That did not bode will for the independence of his approach to governing the FCC. 
Mr. President, I am going to vote in favor of his confirmation, and I will tell you why. Mr. Kennard has an unblemished reputation for intelligence and integrity, and I find him to be an individual with whom I believe we can work in an atmosphere of mutual candor and respect. 
In the final analysis, Mr. President, I believe it is neither reasonable nor necessary that all members of the Senate endorse the current policies of the FCC or Mr. Kennard's personal policy predilections. It is much more important that the Senate understand how difficult the issues are that Mr. Kennard is going to be called upon to decide, and that we undertake to work closely and collaboratively with him in resolving them. I give you my promise, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, to exercise the committee's oversight responsibility exactingly and continuously, and I know the members of the committee are as committed to this task as I am. 
On this basis, Mr. President, I am pleased to support the confirmation of William E. Kennard as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. 
Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret to come to the floor once again to talk about wasteful and unnecessary spending in an appropriations conference agreement. 
During Senate consideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill, I presented a nine-page list of add-ons, earmarks, and set-asides in the bill and report language. 
I had highlighted four provisions in the bill language of the Senate version of the Agriculture appropriations bill, and not surprisingly, every one of these provisions, with minor modifications, is included in the final conference bill. 
Interestingly, though, the conferees also made sure that most of the earmarks and set-asides in the report language of both Houses is included by reference in the final agreement. The report language of the conference agreement says: 
The House and Senate report language which is not changed by the conference are approved by the committee of conference. The statement of the managers, while repeating some report language for emphasis, does not intend to negate the language referred to above unless expressly provided herein. 
So the list I present to the Senate today does not represent all of the wasteful spending in the Agriculture appropriations bill, but only that which the conferees made the effort to specifically mention in the conference statement of managers. The rest of the earmarks are simply carried over from the Senate and House Appropriations Committee reports.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me take a moment to highlight some of the items that are specifically earmarked in the conference agreement. 
The conferees earmark $3.354 million of the research funds provided to the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service [CSREES] for shrimp aquaculture studies in Hawaii, Mississippi, Massachusetts, California, and my home State, Arizona. Funding for shrimp aquaculture is a perennial congressional add-on that has not, to my knowledge, ever been included in an administration budget request. And I have yet to fathom the logic of conducting shrimp research in the desert. 
The conferees earned another $150,000 from the same CSREES account for the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness. Again, this item was not included in the budget request but was added by the House with the expectation that the Department of Agriculture would `exploit every opportunity to collaborate with the Center'--according to the House report language. 
Two earmarks are included in the conference managers' statement for the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture in Leetown, WV. The conferees earned another $6 million to complete construction of a building at this site, which was funded at the same level in the fiscal year 1997 bill. And the conferees also provided $250,000 to initiate a program to be conducted at this new facility which, according to the Senate report language, will `ensure that risks associated with the long-term stability of the [cool and cold water aquaculture] industry are reduced.' 
Finally, the conferees earmarked $1.7 million for new personnel at various centers. The specific earmarks in the statement of managers language include: $500,000 for additional scientists to do research on parasitic mites and Africanized honeybees at the Agriculture Research Service Bee Laboratory in Weslaco, TX; $250,000 for an animal physiologist position at the Fort Keough Laboratory in Montana; $250,000 for additional scientific staffing at the Small Fruits Research Laboratory in Mississippi; $450,000 to hire two small grain pathologists, one at the Agriculture Research Laboratory in Raleigh, NC, and the other at the laboratory at Aberdeen, IA; and $250,000 for a hydrologist to work on south Florida Everglades restoration. The report language of both Houses and the conferees also includes numerous instances of language supporting or urging or encouraging various agencies to hire additional staff personnel, including a particular reference in the managers' statement, that was not included in either report, to express the conferees' `support [for] the addition of a new lettuce geneticist/plant breeder position at the U.S. Agricultural Research Station in Salinas, CA.' 
Mr. President, these are just a few examples of the egregiously wasteful spending practices of the Congress. I cannot condone wasting millions of taxpayer dollars at a time when we are finally making progress toward a balanced budget. Even when we have eliminated annual deficits, hopefully within just a few years, our Nation will still face a debt of over $5.4 trillion. Why not stop wasting money on unnecessary projects, and start repaying this huge debt? 
I plan to recommend that the President exercise his line item veto authority to eliminate these earmarks and set-asides. I hope he does so, because eliminating unnecessary spending is in the best interest of all Americans.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Aviation Competition Enhancement Act of 1997. This bill seeks, in a modest and rational fashion, to deregulate further our domestic aviation system, and to introduce additional competition in the airline industry for the benefit of travelers and communities. 
This legislation is intended to reduce barriers to airline competition, including those imposed by the government. Anticompetitive Federal restrictions in particular--restrictions such as slot controls and the perimeter rule at National Airport--are barriers to competition in a deregulated environment. 
The Department of Transportation [DOT], in a report released on October 22, 1997, reiterated its 1990 study on domestic competition, which demonstrated relatively high fares at network hubs dominated by one major carrier. In an April 1996 study, the DOT estimated that almost 40 percent of domestic passengers traveled in markets with low-fare competition, saving consumers an estimated $6.3 billion annually in airline fares. As the Department states in its most recent report, `[i]ndeed, we concluded that virtually all of the domestic traffic growth and declines in average fares in recent years could be attributed to this growing form of competition.' 
The General Accounting Office [GAO] reported in October 1996 that barriers to market entry persist in the airline industry, and that access to airports continue to be impeded by, first, Federal limits on takeoff and landing slots at the major airports in Chicago, New York, and Washington; second, long-term exclusive-use gate leases; and third, perimeter rules prohibiting flights at airports that exceed a certain distance. In addition, according to GAO, several factors have limited entry at airports serving small- and medium-sized communities in the East and upper Midwest, including the dominance of routes to and from those airports by one or two established airlines. The GAO concluded that operating barriers such as slot controls at nearby hub airports, and incumbent airlines marketing strategies' have fortified those dominant positions. 
The National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry in 1993 recommended that the artificial limits imposed by slots either be removed or raised to the highest level consistent with safety. The Department of Transportation 
subsequently conducted a study, in which it found that eliminating slots would not affect safety and would result in increased competition. This bill, however, does not suggest that we eliminate slots. 
Mr. President, I would like to outline what the Aviation Competition Enhancement Act of 1997 does: 
Slot auction: The legislation mandates a slot allocation among new entrant and limited incumbent air carriers--air carriers that hold no more than 12 slots. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to create new slots where possible, and allocate unused slots. 
If it is not possible to create slots because of capacity and noise limitations, which are not affected by this bill, the Secretary must withdraw a limited number of slots--up to 10 percent initially, 5 percent every 2 years following--that were grandfathered free-of-charge to the major air carriers in 1985 and that remain with those grandfathered carriers. The DOT cannot withdraw slots that are used to provide air service to under served markets. The withdrawn slots then will be auctioned among only the new entrant and limited incumbent air carriers. 
The process for obtaining slots would be as follows. A new entrant or limited incumbent air carrier would apply to the DOT for slots, proposing the markets to be served and the times requested. The DOT must approve the application if it determines that the carrier can operate the proposed service for at least 180 days, and that the service will improve the competitive environment. The DOT can return the request to the applicant for further information. 
While service to any city is eligible under this process, the DOT must prioritize applications that propose service between a high-density airport, a slot-controlled airport--National, Kennedy, LaGuardia, and O'Hare, and a relatively small city. 
All slot auction proceeds would be deposited in the aviation trust fund. The legislation directs the DOT to institute action to ensure maximum slot usage, to tighten up the 80 percent use-or-lose provisions, and to study the effect of the high-density rule on airline competition, and the impact of changes to the rule on safety. 
Complaints concerning predatory behavior: The legislation establishes a 90-day deadline for the DOT to respond to complaints of predatory behavior on the part of major air carriers. 
Exemptions to perimeter rule at National Airport: The bill mandates that the Secretary grant exemptions from the perimeter rule to an air carrier proposing to serve Washington National 
from points beyond the perimeter, if the carrier's proposal would, first, provide service with network benefits, and second, increase competition in multiple markets. The proposal stipulates that the Secretary should not approve applications that propose to trade under served markets within the perimeter for long-haul markets that are well served from the Washington region. 
The legislation would not affect the cap on the number of hourly operations at Washington National. The number of flights at National would not increase. Commercial aircraft operations at National Airport are limited to 37 takeoffs and landings per hour. This requirement stands independent of the perimeter rule. In addition, strict noise restrictions currently in place at National Airport would not be affected, nor would Federal Aviation Administration requirements ensuring that all aircraft flying into National, regardless of the time of day, meet the most stringent noise standards by the year 2000. 
All exemption operations would be limited to stage 3 aircraft. The legislation would require the DOT to certify periodically that noise, air traffic congestion, airport-related vehicular congestion, safety standards, and adequate air service to communities within the perimeter have not been degraded as a result of this exemption authority. 
The fact is that changes in the perimeter rule to allow some measure of flights outside the distance limit may very well reduce noise at National, as carriers replace older, short-hop aircraft with newer, longer range aircraft that are quieter. The next generation of long-haul Boeing 737 aircraft, for instance, will offer increased range along with significantly less noise. In addition, a number of flight deck improvements represent safety features not found in the older aircraft. 
As a means of derailing efforts to reform the perimeter rule, some have impugned my motives, suggesting that my secret purpose is to convenience my own travel between Washington and Arizona. I find this charge wearisome and offensive. Even so, to allay these concerns, I have pledged not to take a nonstop flight from Washington National to Arizona should such an opportunity ever result from this legislation. 
This bill would result in more competition, with more convenient options and competitive air fares for travelers. It would not result in either increased noise or diminished safety. I believe that a service diversity and safety will be enhanced, as they always are in a competitive regime. The incumbent carriers should not be afraid of competition, or fear that their passengers will be taken away. This legislation would result in more competition and economical flights, which will allow more people to fly. 
Most of my colleagues know that I would prefer to get rid of the perimeter rule, as well as slot restrictions, in a manner 
consistent with safety. My efforts to do so over the past decade, however, have encountered extreme resistance. As a result, I have scaled back my original proposals significantly in an effort to address the concerns of airlines and others who will not let legislation of that magnitude pass. In turn, I ask that the protectors of the status quo recognize my legitimate concerns about competition, and fair access for all travelers to airports that make up a national aviation system, paid for by all taxpayers. I must say that all I have heard thus far from my opponents is that there is no problem. 
I do not assert that this bill represents a magical, painless solution. I do assert emphatically, however, that it is modest in nature, and that it is open to debate as the Congress moves forward on this and similar proposals. In the House of Representatives, Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Jimmy Duncan intends to introduce an aviation competition bill. Representative Duncan and I have worked together on a number of provisions, and will continue to do so as we proceed. I commend him for his effort and foresight. I can say the same for Senate Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Gorton, who has demonstrated exceptional interest and leadership in this area. 
In addition, I understand that several of my Commerce Committee colleagues, including Senators Hollings and Ford, are working on their own competition proposals. I believe that all of this activity is a clear indication that there is a problem with respect to domestic aviation competition. I look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion on a solution.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we approach the end of this session, the Congress will be asked to consider the remaining 6 appropriations bills in relatively short order. Clearly, it is important to pass these annual spending bills in a timely fashion to preclude the inconvenience and expense of delaying unnecessarily essential government programs. However, in our haste to adjourn, it would be a disservice to the American taxpayer to ignore the wasteful spending contained in these bills. 
The Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998 is filled with numerous earmarks and set-asides for low-priority, unnecessary, and wasteful spending projects. 
For example, this bill contains three directed land transfers which, to the best of my knowledge, have not been screened through the normal process at the General Services Administration. Two of these provisions--dealing with the Bowden Fish Hatchery in West Virginia and certain BLM lands in Nevada--specifically state that Federal property will be given away without compensation. Certainly, one can legitimately question whether these are good deals for the American taxpayer, or just for those residing in the affected States. 
Another provision of the bill, section 136, directs the Army to build a bridge across the Bull River in Alaska. This bridge is to provide access to the Golden Zone Mine for students at the School of Mineral Engineering at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. In addition, the Army is directed to donate, free, two 6x6 vehicles for the use of the university. The provision does not specify how much the Army is supposed to pay for these large, all-terrain vehicles, nor does it provide a cost estimate for the bridge. This single provision could cost the Army tens of millions of dollars. 
The bill sets aside $800,000 for the World Forestry Center for continuing scientific research on land exchanges in the Umpqua River Basin region in Oregon. 
I am disappointed that the conferees decided to earmark almost half of the $699 million provided for priority land acquisitions and exchanges in title V of this bill. The Senate bill contained earmarks to which certain Members of this body objected very strenuously, and these earmarks are included in the conference agreement, together with two new earmarks. 
I am concerned that the conferees also chose to delete the Senate provision which outlined specific criteria for determining the highest priority acquisitions and exchanges that would be accomplished with these additional dollars. I plan to pursue the establishment of objective, consistent criteria so that the limited funds available for ensuring the preservation of our natural resources are spent wisely. 
Finally, the conferees have included the usual requirement that all contracts awarded using funds provided in this bill should be expended in full compliance with all of the protectionist Buy America provisions that Congress has enacted over the years. These laws and regulations are anti-free trade and cost American taxpayers millions of dollars every year due to lack of free and fair competition of these contracts. 
Now, let me turn to the report language. 
Once again, the conferees have made clear that they endorse the language contained in either the House or Senate report, unless they mention it in the conference report. This ensures that every earmark and set-aside that is not specifically addressed by the conferees remains in place. 
Let's look at some of the earmarks in the conference report itself. 
--$100,000 earmarked from land management funding for the Alaska Gold Rush Centennial. 
--$700,000 earmarked from wildland fire management funding for a type I hot-shot crew in Alaska, and $1.925 million for redevelopment of the obsolete fire center in Billings, MT. 
--$400,000 of Fish and Wildlife Service funding for Alabama sturgeons. 
--$400,000 for the Preble's Meadow jumping mouse. 
--$300,000 for research on whirling disease. 
--$450,000 in various accounts earmarked for the Lewis and Clark Trail, including technical assistance and office funding. 
--$2 million for an Alaska mineral and geological data base, and another $2 million for the Alaska minerals at risk project. 
--$500,000 for a project at Purdue University in Indiana to improve fine hardwood trees. 
I note with interest that, in order to fit all of the earmarks into this bill, the conferees had to agree to account totals that exceed the levels in either the Senate or House bills. In seven different accounts, the conferees agreed to funding which exceeded the amounts in either bill. Altogether, the conferees added $188 million more than the House had provided for these accounts, and $90.6 million more than the Senate had provided. Technically, these accounts are outside of the scope of the conference, a practice which I understand is not unheard of, but which is all the most disturbing when it is done merely to accommodate earmarks for these low-priority projects.

Mr. McCAIN. These are, I am sure, interesting projects, and important to the people who will be working on them. However, these earmarks--like the hundreds of other earmarks too numerous to mention today--were added to this conference agreement without benefit of the normal, merit-based review process that would ensure that these are the highest priority uses for the funding provided in this bill. Absent that process, it is difficult to believe that there are not other more pressing needs for Federal funds than these projects. 
Mr. President, I want to stress that I have highlighted only those projects that I find objectionable in this $13.8 billion measure. Certainly, the funding provided in this bill is essential for the essential operations of the Department of the Interior and the other Federal agencies charged with preservation and management of our lands and natural resources. It also contains funding that is vitally important to our native American tribes, particularly for Indian education. 
One provision that I am pleased to see included in this conference agreement is the $800 million environmental fund authorized in title IV of the bill. This provision establishes a National Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund financed from oil lease revenue awarded to the Federal Government by the U.S. Supreme Court this year. Interest from the fund, estimated to be $50 million annually, will be used to finance high-priority capital improvement projects for national parks, provide grants to States for park planning and acquisition, and fund marine environmental research. Providing for these unmet capital needs will ensure that our most coveted natural resources are preserved and protected for future generations. 
I must say, however, that I am sorry that the conferees included in the language authorizing the Parks Improvement Fund a special setaside for the State of Louisiana for oil and gas drainage in the West Delta field. This provision was not included in the original Senate language, nor was any other special location-specific set-aside. I am disappointed that even this provision was marred by special-interest language. 
Mr. President, I intend to support this bill because it provides new authorities and much-needed funding for many programs. However, I will urge the President to consider exercising his line-item veto to eliminate the low-priority, unnecessary, and wasteful spending that the Congress has added to this bill without benefit of a merit-based, prioritization review process.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the subject of the transfer of sensitive missile, weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons technology to Iran is far more complicated than most of us would like to admit. As neighbors in a volatile region, Russia and Iran have a long history of mutual antipathy alternating with periods of intense cooperation. The official atheism of the former Soviet Union was anathema to the Islamic tenets of revolutionary Iran. The former enjoyed the benefits of a sizable buffer between Russia proper and the Persian kingdom-turned-fundamentalist regime. 
With the disintegration of the U.S.S.R. and the emergence of independent Islamic governments along its southern frontier, Russia no longer enjoys the security it once maintained. Certainly, the absence of the kind of domestic and foreign security apparatus characteristic of its totalitarian past has exacerbated the problem of stemming Islamic influence, and Russia has sought to maintain an active military role in the region to prevent the spread of such influence, as well as of the kind of fighting that ravaged Tajikistan for years. The state of its economy, combined with its desire to maintain the best possible relations with Iran, have led Russia to pursue policies thoroughly inimical to vital United States interests in the Middle East. 
Herein lies the problem. It is in the interests of the United States for Russia to develop economically, obviously through free market mechanisms. It is in Russia's interest to have access to Iranian oil, to the revenue generated by sales to Teheran of whatever the latter will buy, and to be able to maintain cordial relations with a regime that possesses, albeit less so since its presidential election, the wherewithal to destabilize the region. Consequently, any decision to impose sanctions on Russia for its sale of missile and other advanced weapons technologies to Iran understandably should come only after an extraordinarily cautious appraisal of the potential ramifications of doing so. 
I stand before the Senate today to state as emphatically as I can that such sanctions must be imposed. While news reports of missile technology sales, in violation of both the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime and the 1992 Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act, have appeared in great numbers over the past several months, the problem clearly has history going back years that the administration continues to ignore at our and our allies peril. Were the problem not one of such duration, the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act, of which I was a principal sponsor along with then-Senator Al Gore, would not have been necessary 5 years ago. Were the problem a recent 
manifestation of Iranian ambitions and Russian inability or unwillingness to control the flow of militarily sensitive technologies, I would be willing to respect the administration's prerogative in the conduct of United States foreign policy. 
Such, however, is not the case. Developments involving Russia and Iran--and I am not intending to ignore China, simply focusing on a more immediate and larger scale problem of the moment--are indicative of a more systemic problem not conducive to quiet diplomacy and seemingly endless patience. The Teheran Times boasted in November 1995 of Russia's intransigence in the face of United States efforts at dissuading it from providing Iran with nuclear technology. Earlier that year, Russia's Minister for Atomic Energy, Viktor Mikhailov, spoke of his Government's intention to sell Iran a centrifuge for the enrichment of used nuclear fuel. More recently, reports of contracts being signed between Russian companies and research institutes--organizations with which the Government maintains an integral relationship--for the provision of missile components, including guidance systems, laser equipment, wind tunnels for the testing of warheads and missiles, and militarily sensitive materials like tungsten-coated graphite, all illuminate a problem of enormous magnitude that, Moscow's protestations notwithstanding, nevertheless reflect minimal effort on that government's part to impede the flow of such technology to Iran. 
Russia sees its economic interests as lying very much in closer relations with Iran. Pipelines transporting Caspian Sea oil and natural gas present Russia with potential revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars, should it prevail in dictating future pipeline routes. Iran's announcement last year of a joint shipping venture with Russia similarly illuminated the depth of the growing economic relationship between the two countries. The economic importance of Iran to Russia and Russia's lack of viable exports other than the very weapon systems that threaten United States interests in the Middle East have created a dilemma, but one with which we must come to grips. 
Moscow, similarly, must confront the implications of its actions or inactions with respect to the transfer of militarily sensitive technology. It clearly places enormous economic importance on its relationship with Iran, but it needs to be reminded that it fails within the range of the very missiles it is helping Iran to develop. Russia may, in the end, find itself selling Teheran the rope with which to hang itself. 
The administration must comply with existing United States laws. It must take Russia to task, in the form of economic sanctions, for the continuing problem of missile technology transfer to Iran. Russia must be made to see that its economic well-being does not lie with transactions that threaten United States interests. Russia desperately wants recognition as a major global player despite its inability to influence events militarily or economically far beyond its borders. When the United States, Germany, or Japan coughs, much of the industrialized world catches cold. When Russia coughs, Moscow catches cold. If Russia wants to see the Group of Seven be permanently enlarged by one, it must accept that its economic future lies with the democracies of North America, Europe, and Asia--not with rogue regimes that seek to threaten the interests of those nations. 
The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act mandates sanctions against both foreign companies and governments for the transfer of missile, chemical, biological and nuclear weapon technologies as well as advanced conventional systems. It further provides for discretionary sanctions. Russia has thoroughly violated the act, as well as the MTCR. Not only has it transferred to Iran missile and nuclear technology, it has sold to Teheran advanced surface-to-air missile systems, three Kilo-class attack submarines with which Iran fully intends to asserts its control over the vital Strait of Hormuz, modern T-72 main battle tanks, and MiG-29 fighter and Su-24 strike aircraft. If the cumulative effect of these weapon sales does not violate both the MTCR and the Iran-Iraq Act, then nothing does. And, Mr. President, as a principal sponsor of the latter legislation, I can personally attest that, irrespective of administration determinations constructed to suit its policy preferences, these transfers from Russia do violate both the letter and the intent of the law. 
The administration must act on this issue of utmost importance to United States national security interests. The Middle East lies at the center of our National Security Strategy and the force structure exercises that repeatedly postulate the likelihood of future conflict in that strife-torn region. The administration has not presented to Congress any reason, compelling or otherwise, for its refusal to abide by Public Law 102-484 and the MTCR. Congress must demand that it do so, or impose sanctions accordingly. Its failure to do so is inexcusable. The ramifications of that failure will be serious indeed, and the costs will inevitably be paid in American blood. 
That is why we are introducing legislation to toughen existing statutes by making the imposition of sanctions more certain and requiring that the administration report to Congress information on weapons sales that will better enable the legislative branch of Government to determine for itself whether past failures to impose sanctions have been warranted. Governments must be held accountable when entities within their borders act dangerously irresponsible. 
The administration must comply with the law, or sacrifice its role in the formulation of U.S. foreign policy in one of the most important regions of the world.

Mr. McCAIN. I have just one comment. I understand the position the majority leader is in and the majority on this side of the aisle. I think we would all agree that the way we are going to move forward on this issue is if we all sit down together and try to work out something that is agreeable and fair, not only in our minds but in the minds of objective observers. I would, again, urge--the Senator from Kentucky is here on the floor--if we could just agree that we will take up this legislation sometime next year, with a certain amount of amendments and a cloture vote, leaving on both sides the right to filibuster if it is not agreeable to either side. But to not allow a single amendment that addresses this issue is what is frustrating, I think, clearly to the Senator from Wisconsin and me. 
So, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of this issue, if we could just sit down and say, `OK, we will take up this issue at a date certain and we will give it a certain amount of consideration.' It doesn't have to be unlimited amendments. It doesn't have to be even a large number of amendments. But, then, if at the end of that debate and voting and having Senators on record on the issue, we could then either filibuster or, which I think is the most likely result, is we could agree on a campaign finance reform that would be agreeable to all sides, we could move forward to the benefit of the American people. I want to thank the Senator, the distinguished majority leader. I thank the Democrat leader. I think that good effort has been made. 
But all of us need to sit down and agree on this so we can address this issue, and the reality is, as the distinguished majority leader knows, we are going to address it sooner or later. I hate to see it hold up ISTEA. I don't like to see it hold up fast track. Clearly, it is in all of our interests not to have to impede the progress of the Senate. 
I thank the majority leader for yielding to me, and I thank him for his continued courtesy to me on this issue which, obviously, he just displayed he feels very, very strongly about.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, during Senate consideration of the Fiscal Year 1998 Treasury Postal Appropriations bill, I submitted for the Record a list of projects which I found to be low-priority, unnecessary or wasteful spending, that circumvented the normal, merit-based prioritization process. On October 15, 1997, I forwarded this list to President Clinton and recommended he use his line-item veto authority to eliminate these projects. Included in this list was language contained in the Conference Report which directed that the Bakersfield Federal Building in California be sold. 
It has been brought to my attention that this Federal building went through the proper screening process by GSA in order to ascertain if it was needed for any further Federal use. No Federal Government agency expressed an interest in utilizing this property. 
Furthermore, I am informed that the sale of this property, through a process of competitive bidding, will result in a profit to the American taxpayer. The Conference Committee directed the sale of this building only after the GSA screening was completed and it was determined that this was in fact surplus Federal property. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I applaud the actions of the Committee and Rep. Bill Thomas of California, and withdraw my objection to the sale of this property as well as my recommendation that the President veto this provision.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate will vote today to adopt the conference agreement on the fiscal year 1998 transportation appropriations bill. As chairman of the Commerce Committee, I intend to support the measure, because it contains the funding for vitally important transportation programs. 
However, once again, I am compelled to note the various earmarks and set-aside and low priority spending that is included in this package. 
This conference agreement contains legislation mandating specific actions and spending that the Administration either does not support or did not request. For instance: 
The bill directs the Secretary of the Navy to transfer the USNS EDENTON (ATS-1), which is currently in inactive status, to the Coast Guard. 
The legislation earmarks Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] Operations funds and mandates that the FAA provide personnel at Dutch Harbor, AK, to provide weather and runway observations. 
The conference report goes on to highlight millions of dollars that exceed the Administration's request, and that are targeted for specific projects. 
$8.4 million, for instance, is set aside for the relocation of Coast Guard Station New Orleans, with $3 million of that amount directed to improve the adjacent waterway. Incidentally, I understand that the adjacent waterway improvements are aimed primarily at benefitting private users of the waterway, not the Coast Guard. 
The conference report earmarks all intelligent transportation operational test funds--nearly $84 million--for 41 specific projects, even though the Administration requested zero funds for intelligent transportation operational tests. 
The report earmarks all but $3 million of the $400 million provided for the discretionary bus and bus-related facilities program. 
It earmarks all of the $800 million provided for the discretionary fixed guide way modernization program. 
Although the legislation does not mandate certain airport grants, the conference report and the Senate report, in particular, urge priority consideration for funding for several specific airport development projects. I urge the Administration to adhere to its own established safety and capacity-enhancement criteria in allocating discretionary airport grants and letters of intent. 
The FAA is bound to receive a great deal of guidance in this respect. However, if it becomes evident that discretionary grants are being used to satisfy political whims rather than the national interest, I pledge to review the FAA's discretionary authority in the context of the FAA reauthorization bill next year. 
As I have said many times before, my criticism of this earmarking process should not be interpreted as a criticism of each of these projects. I recognize that these projects may be beneficial, and that several would merit full funding in an objective, competitive allocation process. Nevertheless, Congress needs to give that process a chance.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a minority has prevailed for the moment in blocking campaign finance reform. They will not prevail forever. Sponsors of campaign finance reform knew from the outset that our legislation faced long odds. We knew that finding a supermajority of Senators to cut off debate would be very difficult. Not impossible, but difficult. 
What we had hoped might occur is that as the amending process on the bill proceeded, Senators from both sides of the aisle would begin to find common ground on this subject, and the basis for a fair bipartisan compromise would be discovered. That was not to be the case, however, because the rules of this debate were structured to prevent anyone from offering any amendment. No vote on any single aspect of campaign finance reform was allowed, and that's unfortunate. 
The chief opponent of our bill, the Senator from Kentucky, very forthrightly claimed that he would proudly cast a vote against any bill that sought to reduce the amount of money that currently soaks our Federal election system. I commend him for his candor and having the courage of his convictions. 
Mr. President, I wish all opponents of campaign finance reform were so forthright. I wish all Members of the Senate could have had the opportunity to unambiguously register their support for or opposition to campaign finance reform in all its forms so that the American people would have a clear public record of where we all stood on the subject. I can only assume that the public was denied a clear record because some of us are apprehensive about how the public would react to our votes. I cannot find any other explanation for the elaborate lengths opponents of the bill went to in order to prevent a single vote on any amendment to this legislation. 
I do not resent the use of the filibuster to obstruct reform. I regret it, but I do not resent it. It is a frequent roadblock to action in the Senate, and I and the other sponsors of the bill always understood that we must overcome it to prevail. Necessary to our efforts to overcome this institutional obstruction, however, is the amendment process. We believe that if Senators are obliged to vote yea or nay on various aspects of reform, the public's reaction to our votes might persuade 60 Senators to vote to limit debate. But as I have noted, we were precluded from offering and disposing of amendments. 
As I made clear to everyone before debate on this bill began, if the supporters of McCain-Feingold were denied an up-or-down vote on the bill or on amendments to the bill, we would exercise our rights as Members of the Senate to offer amendments related to reform on legislation subsequently considered by the Senate. Now we are confronting a parliamentary tactic that is intended to deny us the opportunity to offer amendments to the highway funding bill. I don't think that it is fair, even if it is sanctioned by Senate rules. Nor do I think the tactic will permanently preclude us from offering reform amendments to other legislation. 
Mr. President, no Member of this body can be permanently disenfranchised from the right to offer amendments. It is a practical impossibility. Unanimous consent is required for nearly all the work of the Senate, and Members who are denied their right to amend legislation are not likely to consent to moving that legislation forward. Every Senator knows that their colleagues who intend to offer campaign finance reform amendments will eventually succeed in doing so. At some point, the support or opposition of Senators will be a matter of public record. Therefore, I am at a loss to understand what purpose is served by attempting to temporarily prevent us from offering these amendments. 
We cannot be disenfranchised permanently, Mr. President, because to do so would disenfranchise the American people. The people have a right to know where their elected representatives stand on the issue of campaign finance reform so that they may render an informed judgment at election time about how fairly we represent their concerns. 
The supporters of reform intend to offer amendments related to various aspects of reform, and as I have stated previously, I 
intend to offer an amendment banning soft money, the unregulated ocean of money which is drowning the integrity of our political system and which occasioned so much scandal in the last election. I am looking forward to the great debate on the first amendment that supporters of soft money will offer in opposition to the ban. 
I know that the Senator from Kentucky will enthusiastically engage in that debate, and I again commend him for having the courage of his convictions, for his clear willingness to have his opposition to reform recorded unambiguously for the people to judge. Will the other Senators join him? I don't know. I don't think support for unlimited soft money is quite so clear as his opposition to other reform proposals. I think we would win a vote banning soft money. I am not certain, but I am fairly confident, and I intend to find out. 
We will keep trying until the Senate agrees to provide the people we serve with an honest, clear record of our support or opposition to campaign finance reform. They will then make a judgment as to whether they approve of our position or not. 
Finally, again, Mr. President, I am hopeful that at some point, there will be sufficient requests by the American people, including a million signatories, 1 million Americans signing a petition asking us to address this issue of campaign finance reform. I hope that sooner or later that and the better angels of our nature will persuade us that it is time to sit down and work out a campaign finance reform which is fair to everyone and gives and restores the American people control of their Government. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate will act shortly to approve the conference agreement on the Fiscal Year 1998 VA-HUD Appropriations Act, and I intend to vote for the bill. The bill contains many very worthwhile programs that are vital to our Nation's veterans, to the economic development and viability of our cities, to rural communities, to environmental preservation and remediation, and for other important Government functions. The conferees have done an excellent job of crafting a bill that is balanced and fair, while staying within the budgetary allocations for these programs. 
However, once again, I must highlight the myriad of programs that are included in this conference agreement that were not considered in the normal budgetary review process. These programs may very well have a great deal of merit, but unless one is a member of the Appropriations Committee, it is nearly impossible to determine what, if any, criteria were applied to determine the relative worthiness of each of the earmarks and set-asides in the agreement. 
For example: 
$5 million dollars is earmarked for a study on the cost-effectiveness of contracting with local hospitals in east central Florida for the provision of nonemergent inpatient health care needs of veterans. This earmark was contained in the House bill, but I find it difficult to determine from the conference agreement or the House report why such a study is so urgently needed in east Florida, rather than other areas of the country that may be considering this type of contracting. 
As I noted when the Senate considered the bill, $10 is earmarked for demolition and replacement of the Heritage House in Kansas City, Mo. I still do not understand the urgency of proceeding with this, rather than other similar projects. 
The bill earmarks $99.6 million for 120 specific Economic Development Initiative grants, as specified in the report language. While both bills contained these kinds of earmarks, my colleagues might be interested to know that the amount earmarked in the conference agreement is more than twice the amount earmarked in the Senate bill which was $40 million. I suspect that a scrupulous comparison of the lists of earmarked projects in the two bills would conclude that every project earmarked in either bill is included in this conference agreement, and then some. 
The bill contains an earmark of $15 million for the county of San Bernardino, Ca, for neighborhood initiatives. I have not been able to find this earmark in either the House or Senate bill, neither of which contain any explanatory language on this initiative. 
The bill contains a section which was also included in the Senate bill, transferring a previous $7.1 million earmark for a Kansas City industrial park at 18th Street and Indiana Avenue instead to the rehabilitation and infrastructure development associated with the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and jazz museum at 18th and Vine. 
The bill authorizes and appropriates $90 million additional funding for construction of a consolidated EPA research facility at Research Triangle Park, NC, and raises the total construction cap on the project, including a child care center and computer center, to $272.7 million. I recognize that this provision was included in the House bill, but I have not been able to find any justification in the bill or report for earmarking $90 million as part of a nearly $300 million expenditure for this project, versus other worthy projects. 
The bill retains the earmarks in the Senate bill for a $50 million in grants to Texas, requiring State matching of 20 percent, for improving water and wastewater treatment facilities for the colonias; and a $15 million grant to Alaska to address drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs. 
The bill also includes an earmark of $253.1 million for 39 specific wastewater and water treatment facilities and ground water protection infrastructure, earmarked as stated in the report. Again, this type of earmark was included in the Senate and House bills, but the conference earmarked almost three times the amount in the Senate bill. 
The bill also contains three earmarks which I believe were not included in either the Senate or House bill:  
$4 million dollars is earmarked for each of three areas--a native American area in Alaska, a rural area in Iowa, and a rural area in Missouri--for rural economic development grants, to test comprehensive approaches to developing a job base through economic development, developing affordable low- and moderate-income rental and homeownership housing, and increasing the investment of both private and nonprofit capital. While I understand the need to provide funding for rural communities to improve their living standards, housing availability, and the like, I question whether the three areas singled out in this language are the most deserving of 4 million dollars each. And I note that the earmarks for rural areas in Iowa and Missouri were not contained in either bill, but were added by the conferees. 
The bill includes a section, which I have not found in either the Senate or House bill, directing FEMA to make a grant of $1.5 million to resolve issues under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970 involving the city of Jackson, Ms. Again, the justification provided for this project is sketchy, to say the least. 
The bill contains a section which cancels the indebtedness of the village of Robbins, IL, for HUD-guaranteed water and sewer bonds, including principal, interest, and any fees and other charges. Again, I could find no mention of this proposal in either the Senate or House bills. 
As I have said many times, these types of earmarks added in conference are an egregious evasion of the normal budget review process, which this body should not condone. 
I will not elaborate on the many earmarks and set-aside in the report language of the conference agreement.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is not an exhaustive list of all the earmarks the conferees endorsed. As with previously submitted conference agreements, the conferees explicitly state in the report that they endorse all the provisions of the Senate and House reports on the bill, unless they are explicitly contradicted or addressed in the conference report. So there are a lot more earmarks that the conferees intend that the agencies will adhere to in allocating appropriated funds. 
Again, Mr. President, I hesitate to say that all of these earmarks and set-asides are wasteful, or unnecessary. I want to stress that these projects may very well have merit and may very well be worthy of inclusion in this bill. 
But the process the Congress established for itself, which involves both authorization and appropriation of spending items, is routinely ignored in the appropriations bills. These unauthorized and locality specific earmarks and add-ons have bypassed the normal agency review process and have bypassed the authorization process. They have simply been included in the appropriations bill because a small segment of the Senate or House, those who serve on Appropriations Committee, decided to include them. 
Mr. President, the American people deserve to know how their money is spent, and why. Millions of dollars will be spent for the projects on the attached list, and I doubt that most Senators know why these projects were chosen for earmarks or set-asides. The American people certainly don't have access to that information. 
I intend to send a letter to the President asking that he consider using his line-item veto authority to eliminate these spending items from this bill. That is why we gave him a line-item veto--to eliminate wasteful, unnecessary, and low-priority spending. He has already demonstrated his willingness to use the line-item veto, and I hope he continues to exercise that authority when clearly necessary. 
Mr. President, as I said, I support the majority of the provisions of this bill, and I intend to vote for it. I am thankful, however, that a mechanism now exists that could, if utilized, eliminate the earmarks and set-asides in this bill to which I must object.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. In my discussions with the majority leader over a period of discussions of the campaign finance reform bill, I told him that I would come back with an amendment that I wanted an up-or-down vote on. I want to repeat again my intentions to have that. I do not desire to tie up the Senate. I do not desire to cause problems with ISTEA or other pieces of legislation between now and when we go out, but I will have an amendment that I believe is important and one that I think should be considered by the Senate. This issue should be resolved, I hope, before we go to recess. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Intermodal Transportation Safety Act of 1997. I offer this measure as a starting point for reauthorizing the many surface transportation safety programs last considered in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA] of 1991. 
These programs, which are under the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, include provisions to improve travel safety on our Nation's roads, promote the safe shipment of hazardous materials, advance pipeline transportation safety, and ensure that our Nation's commercial motor vehicle fleet is well maintained and safely operated. 
Mr. President, transportation safety must be at the forefront of our deliberations during the consideration of legislation to reauthorize ISTEA. The ISTEA bill contains necessary funding and policy authorizations to improve our transportation infrastructure and facilitate the efficient and economical transportation of people and goods. The legislation I am introducing is a vital component of that effort which is intended to meet our obligation to help ensure that people and goods are transported safely. 
The need for improvements in Federal transportation safety policy is crystal clear. The National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] recently reported that deaths from transportation accidents in the United States totaled more than 44,000 for calendar year 1996. For example, highway-related deaths, which account for more than 90 percent of all transportation fatalities, rose by 109, reaching a total of 41,907. The Federal Transit Administration reported 120 fatalities from accidents associated with the operations of light and commuter rail companies, compared to 98 in 1995. And, pipeline-related deaths totaled 20, against 21 in 1995. 
Mr. President, the bill I am introducing addresses a wide range of issues and programs to promote and enhance surface transportation safety in our Nation. Using the administration's reauthorization submissions as a primary guidepost, my legislation extends key safety programs for 6 years. Many of the administration's safety proposals are included, but several new initiatives are added. 
The primary differences between the administration's proposals and the bill I am introducing are based on the budget agreement enacted in August. While I m sure a case can be made for additional funding in some areas, the budget agreement simply does not allow for it. Consequently, the funding authorized under this measure fully complies within the budget agreement. 
Mr. President, I would like to provide a broad overview of the various transportation safety provisions contained in this legislation. First, this bill addresses various programs under the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration [NHTSA]. The legislation reauthorizes various grant programs, administered by NHTSA, to improve safety on America's roadways. Those grant programs would provide over $1.1 billion to the States during the next 6 years. This portion of the bill is the administration's request which I'm introducing without modification as a starting point for discussion and debate. In regard to these grant programs, the legislation is identical to the administration's proposal, with the exception that the funds authorized have been scaled down to fit within the boundaries of the budget agreement. 
Second, this bill reauthorizes funding for programs to ensure the safe transportation of hazardous materials. It also includes a number of changes intended to strengthen and improve the hazardous materials transportation program. For example, according to DOT s Research and Special Programs Administration [RSPA] statistics, there were hundreds of transportation related incidents involving undeclared or hidden hazardous materials. These incidents resulted in 110 deaths and 112 injuries from January 1990 through October 1996. This legislation would give DOT inspectors the authority to open and examine the contents of packages suspected of containing hazardous materials. 
This provision would help ensure that packages containing undeclared hazardous materials shipments can be removed from transportation before they harm individuals. In the event a package is opened under the bill s authorities, DOT inspectors would be required to mark the package accordingly and notify the shipper before the parcel could continue in transport. 
The legislation also expands hazardous materials training access by allowing States and Indian tribes to use a portion of their grants to help train small businesses in complying with hazardous materials shipment procedures. DOT has indicated that the majority of hazardous materials shipment and packaging mistakes occur at small businesses. 
The legislation also authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to issue emergency orders when it is determined that an unsafe condition poses an imminent hazard. In such a situation, the Secretary is granted the authority to issue recalls, restrictions, or out-of-service orders to lessen the dangerous condition. 
Third, at the request of the majority leader, this bill incorporates S. 1115, the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act, introduced by Senators Lott and Daschle on July 31, 1997. S. 1115 would encourage a national effort to encourage States to strengthen their laws that protect underground pipelines, telecommunication cables, and other infrastructure from excavation damage. 
Discussions are ongoing concerning this and several of the administration's proposals and I m hopeful that we can reach agreement on some of the remaining technical issues. Quick and timely resolution on these outstanding matters will be necessary so we can address these issues as the Intermodal Transportation Safety Act of 1997 moves to the Senate Floor. 
Fourth, this bill reauthorizes the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program [MCSAP] which provides funding for commercial driver and vehicle safety inspections, traffic enforcement, compliance reviews, and safety data collection. It further authorizes a performance-based approach for the MCSAP, removing many of the prescriptive requirements of the program. Instead, States would be given greater flexibility to implement safety activities and goals they design to evaluate and improve truck safety programs. This new performance-based approach, to be implemented by 2000, would enable States to spend their limited resources on those activities best able to address their unique motor carrier problem areas. 
This legislation also contains several other important truck and bus safety enhancement provisions. It would strengthen safety enforcement by extending the Secretary s safety jurisdiction to intrastate trips made by interstate carriers. The bill would also help ensure greater safety oversight by permitting the Secretary to contract with private entities to conduct inspections and investigations to ensure compliance with Federal motor carrier safety regulations. Similar contractual authority is already afforded to the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration. The bill further strengthens safety oversight by extending safety regulations such as commercial drivers licensing and drug and alcohol testing requirements to for-hire passenger vans. It would also permit the Secretary to order any unsafe carrier to cease operations. Currently this authority applies only to prevent unsafe operations of commercial passenger carriers and hazardous materials carriers. 
I have also incorporated a number of provisions designed to promote the timely and accurate exchange of important carrier and driver safety records. This bill authorizes comprehensive information systems and strategic safety initiatives to support motor carrier regulatory and enforcement activities as requested by the administration. 
It also establishes a pilot program to help facilitate the exchange of accurate driver records data history in an attempt to prevent such unacceptable tragedies as the one that occurred this summer on the streets of Washington DC, when an unfit driver of a dump truck killed a young man. Further, this legislation would permit carriers to provide safety records of former drivers to prospective employers without the fear of a former employee taking legal action against the carrier, provided the data exchanged is accurate. 
Mr. President, like every time Congress considers legislation affecting Federal motor carrier safety regulations, various segments of the industry seek exemptions. Some are common sense, such as acknowledging the special transportation time constraints of farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons, or, for example, recognizing the need to permit road maintenance crews, such as for snow removal, to operate during weather emergencies. Legislation should not be needed to permit these and other exemptions. However, that is the process we go through today. 
While the Secretary already has authority to grant waivers from some or all of the regulations, the authority is almost meaningless because prior to granting an exemption, it must first be proven the exemption would not diminish safety. However, it is not possible to make such a finding unless an exemption can first be tested on a limited basis. In an attempt to address this problem and recognize the Secretary should be permitted to examine innovative approaches or alternatives to certain rules, and in turn reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens that do not produce a safety return. This legislation would authorize the Secretary to carry out pilot programs to test the affects of certain limited regulatory exemptions. 
However, safety must remain at the forefront of these pilot projects. The bill language clearly states that the Secretary can only approve pilot projects that are expected to meet or exceed the overall level of safety that would be achieved with existing regulatory requirements. 
Mr. President, there are other important provisions in the Intermodal Transportation Safety Act. While I will not list each and every provision, there is another initiative I want to highlight. 
Our transportation system is vulnerable to security threats. Almost 2 years ago today, Arizonans and citizens throughout the country were saddened to learn of an Amtrak derailment near Hyder, AZ, which claimed the life of 1 individual and injured 78 others. Shortly after the accident, the sadness turned to shock as we learned that the derailment could have been caused by someone who may have intentionally sabotaged the track. The Arizona accident is not unique. There have been other examples of acts against railroads. Therefore, as requested by the administration, this legislation would create criminal sanctions for violent attacks against railroads, their employees, and passengers. The penalties are similar to those which currently cover vessels, airlines, motor carriers, and pipelines. 
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I invite my colleagues to join me in determining whether any refinements to this safety bill are warranted. I welcome my colleagues input and plan to work with all members to incorporate this comprehensive safety legislation during our work on legislation to reauthorize ISTEA.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am sorry to say that I cannot support the legislation before the Senate today. While this bill contains many good provisions, I have never supported any legislation to raise the pay of Members of Congress, and I will not support this bill. 
Yes, the Republican Congress has accomplished much this year. We have passed legislation which puts us on track toward balancing the Federal budget and providing much-needed tax relief for Americans. We have reformed the welfare system, our nation's immigration policies, ensured our national security, and many other laudable accomplishments. 
But there are many tasks the American people expect us to complete that we have yet to accomplish. 
We still face a $5.4 trillion national debt, which will increase by hundreds of millions of dollars for several more years. In fact, current predictions are that we will not eliminate annual deficits until 2001 or 2002, and our national debt will have increased to nearly $6 trillion by that time. We have a long way to go before we can claim to have ended the fiscal irresponsibility that has saddled our children and grandchildren with this staggering debt. 
We still face the daunting tasks of ensuring the future viability of the Medicare and Social Security systems, improving access to and affordability of health care for all Americans, reducing the size and intrusiveness of our Federal Government in people's lives, and ensuring the continued economic health of our Nation. 
Members of Congress already rank in the top 1 percent of wage earners in this country. Public service in the Congress should not be a means to becoming wealthy, but an opportunity to serve our country. 
I intend to vote against this legislation. And if it passes, I will not accept a pay raise. I have donated to charity every pay raise Congress has approved for itself since I have been in office, and I will do the same with this raise. 
Mr. President, I find it quite ironic that, at the same time the Congress is proposing to raise pay for Members, we are also wasting more millions of taxpayer dollars on unnecessary, wasteful programs. 
Mr. President, this bill contains the usual earmarks and set-asides requested by Members of Congress for their home States or districts. 
I am particularly disappointed to note that the conferees retained all but one of the provisions to which I had objected in the Senate bill. And that one provision that was not retained in the conference bill--an earmark of $4 million each for repair work at the Truman and Johnson Presidential Libraries--has, instead, been clearly earmarked in the conference report language. 
I would like to list for my colleagues the Senate bill language, retained in this conference agreement, that are earmarks for unnecessary or low-priority spending or that are protectionist in nature. 
There is $1.25 million earmarked for the Global Trade and Research Program at the Montana World Trade Center, which the report indicates is a one-time set-aside to support research and dissemination of information on exploration, definition, and measurement of contributions to economic globalization. I should note that the Senate had allocated $2.5 million for this program, and the conferees very frugally cut this earmark in half. 
Section 107--Prohibition on reorganizing the Aberdeen, SD, office of the IRS until toll-free phone line assistance reaches an 80-percent service level. We all know the difficulties experienced by all taxpayers in getting accurate, timely information from the IRS. But why should the taxpayers in Aberdeen, SD, be guaranteed continued access to an area IRS office? What about taxpayers in North Dakota? Or rural Ohio? And what if it makes sense to save money by closing some IRS offices in order to devote more resources to achieving the 80 percent service level for IRS telephone assistance? 
Section 108--Prohibition on reorganizing the IRS Criminal Investigative Division if the result is a reduction of criminal investigators in Wisconsin and South Dakota from the 1996 level. Again, I question whether the Congress is the right body to decide whether the IRS' criminal investigative resources should be concentrated. 
Section 123--Requirement to establish the port of Kodiak, AK, as a port of entry requiring U.S. Customs Service personnel in Anchorage to serve that port. Neither the Senate report nor the conference report offer any particular rationale for this directive. 
Earmark of $3 million for the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, plus $1.5 million earmarked for methamphetamine reduction efforts at the facility. I ask my colleagues, do we know whether the Rocky Mountain area is most needful of this extra money? 
Sections 507 and 508--Provisions requiring compliance with Buy America trade restrictions. I have long sought to remove all protectionist restrictions on free trade, and having made some progress, I guess the conferees wanted to ensure that nothing would change in the global marketplace. 
Not surprisingly, the conferees also added several provisions from the House bill that are the same type of wasteful spending: 
Earmark of $10 million for three newly designated High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas--one in the three-State area of Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia; one in central Florida; and one in Milwaukee, WI that was not included in either bill. We all support heightened efforts to combat drug trafficking throughout the United States, but I wonder how the Appropriations Committee determined that these three locations were the highest priority areas for funding for antidrug efforts? 
Section 410--Earmark of `such sums as may be necessary' to repay debts to the U.S. Treasury incurred by the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation. How much is `necessary'? And what sense does it make to appropriate Federal tax dollars to repay the Federal Treasury? 
Section 412--Directed sale of the Bakersfield Federal Building at 800 Truxton Avenue in Bakersfield, CA, including all land and improvements. It is unclear from the conference agreement or the House report language whether the Federal Government wants to dispose of this property, or if the Congress has unilaterally decided to demand that it be sold. 
Mr. President, these are just the provisions that are included in the bill. The report language of this conference agreement contains numerous other earmarks and set-asides. Let me note just a few: 
Three Hundred thousand dollars to staff a dedicated commuter lane in El Paso, TX. This was an earmark in the Senate report that is repeated in the conference report, for emphasis, I guess. 
Language `encouraging' the Customs Service to provide extended hours at the Opa-locka Airport in Florida. 
Language `urging' GSA to consider the needs of the U.S. Olympic Committee and to give the USOC priority in acquiring a Federal building in Colorado Springs, just in case the current occupants--the U.S. Air Force Space Command--decide to move out.

Mr. McCAIN. I think it is important to note for my colleagues that this conference agreement, like each of the four other conference agreements the Senate has approved in the past few days, contains a clause in the statement of managers language that specifically endorses every single earmark and set-aside in the underlying reports of the House and Senate, unless specifically stated otherwise in the conference report. Mr. President, the bottom line is that Members of Congress can use the language in these reports, which `urges' or `encourages' or `strongly supports' some action, but which falls short of an earmark or directive, to pressure agencies to act accordingly. 
Mr. President, I will say once again that this practice of wasteful spending must stop.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the Senate will shortly vote to adopt the conference agreement on the fiscal year 1998 energy/water appropriations bill. And unfortunately, this bill is laden with pork-barrel spending, much of which was considered by neither the House nor the Senate as part of the normal appropriations process. 
I count seven projects for which funds are earmarked in the bill language that were not included in the bill that passed either the Senate or the House. Let me list these seven projects for the benefit of my colleagues who are not members of the Appropriations Committee. 
First, there are three projects earmarked in the legislative language agreed to by the conferees for reimbursements to non-Federal sponsors of work in Texas: 
There is $150,000 for the White Oak Bayou watershed in Texas. The House added a line item for this unrequested project in its report; the Senate never considered it. Yet it is now included in the conferees' legislative language. 
There is $500,000 for the Hunting Bayou element and another $2 million for the Brays Bayou portion of the flood control project in Buffalo Bayou, TX. In its report, the House cut the $1.8 million requested for this project, while the Senate included the line item in its report at the requested amount of $1.8 million. Neither body included an earmark in legislative language, but the conferees approved an earmark of $2.5 million which is almost $700,000 more than the amount requested. 
Another legislative earmark approved by the conferees is $4 million for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge Sardis Lake, MS, so that the city of Sardis may proceed with development of the lake. The conferees directed the corps to conduct or pay for environmental assessments and impact studies required under the Sardis lake recreation and tourism master plan, phase II. This provision was in neither bill. 
The conferees included bill language to earmark $6 million for the Corps of Engineers to extend navigation channels on the Allegheny River to provide passenger boat access to the Kittanning, PA, Riverfront Park. This project was mentioned in the House report, but was not included in either bill. 
Another earmark that migrated from the House report to the conference bill language is $2.5 million of corps' operations funds to intercept and dispose of solid waste upstream of Lake Cumberland, KY. 
Another earmark that moved from Senate report language to the conference bill language is $6.9 million from Tennessee Valley Authority funds for operation, maintenance, surveillance, and improvement of Land Between the Lakes. 
These seven provisions, earmarking over $32 million for these specific projects, were added to the bill language in conference. I don't know why the conferees chose to add emphasis to these provisions by including them as earmarks in the bill language, instead of including them, as is the normal process, in the report language if they were approved by the conferees. Only the conferees could explain that decision. 
However, Madam President, in at least one instance, it is clear that the conferees chose to add a wholly new provision to this bill. And they did this behind closed doors, without benefit of public or full congressional review. 
Madam President, the Congress has a process for considering legislation. That process relies on full and open consideration of the President's budget and policy requests, as well as fair and open consideration of Members' requests for added funding or new policies. That process, when followed, makes it possible for all Members of the Congress, not just those who serve on the Appropriations Committees, to have an opportunity to review the legislation on which we must vote. 
This bill, at least in part, bypassed that normal process. Unfortunately, the decision of the conferees to bypass the normal authorization and appropriations process is one of the reasons the American people do not trust the Congress to do what the people desire. 
Madam President, I do not mean to give the impression that this bill does not provide necessary and appropriate funding for important projects that will benefit our Nation. Funding is included for flood control and water projects, nuclear energy and weapons activities, environmental restoration of contaminated properties, and other important projects that are necessary and valid. The majority of the funding recommendations in this bill are ones that I fully support. 
But I am saddened by the blatant examples of pork-barrel spending in this bill. And because this bill is not amendable in its present form, there is, unfortunately, nothing that I or any other Member of this body can do to eliminate these spending items.

Mr. McCAIN. Of course, this conference agreement contains other objectionable provisions in the bill, as well as the usual earmarks in the report language. 
Madam President, I plan to write to the President recommending that he veto the line items in this bill that are unnecessary and wasteful, particularly those that were added without benefit of public or congressional review. 
Madam President, I want to tell the distinguished managers of the bill again of my deep disappointment that they would add seven projects in conference that totals $32 million and which were in neither bill, along with the usual unnecessary and wasteful projects. I think it is an abrogation of my ability as a U.S. Senator to vote for these projects, and I deeply resent it.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader. I think that clarifies a great deal. I also appreciate his sensitivity to those who have to be home at this holiday season. I know my colleague from Wisconsin and other Senators who need to be involved in this issue. I want to thank the majority leader for what seems to me to be a generous amount of time for debate and discussion of this issue. 
Mr. President, in just a few moments, I will lay before the Senate the modified version of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. After I do so, the leader will be recognized to offer an amendment to the bill. Therefore, I wanted to take a few minutes before that action occurs to speak briefly to the modification. 
First, I want to thank my cosponsors and allies in this fight. Senator Thompson and Senator Collins have played crucial roles as we moved forward on this matter. Their steadfast support, advice, and friendship is greatly appreciated. 
But more than anybody, I want to thank my friend from the other side of the aisle, the Senator from Wisconsin, Russ Feingold. I do not believe that when he and I first sat down and began a discussion on this matter that we would be where are today--engaged in a historic battle to reform the electoral system of this great Nation. My friend, as he is indeed my friend, has been steadfast in his commitment and his belief in this cause and I want to state for the Record that I am grateful he is my ally in this fight. 
Mr. President, I want to briefly highlight again what the modified bill does and does not do. This is not a big government solution. The modified test is just over 50 pages long. 
The defenders of the status quo are not defending an unbridled, unregulated bastion of free speech. The Federal Election Campaign Act, known as FECA, governs Federal elections today. 
Elections are regulated today. They need to be regulated. We do not want corporations, unions, or wealthy individuals to buy and sell elections. This is not a country where a royal class controls the Government. No one here wants corporations to give directly to campaigns. The fact is that at certain times and certain places, there is a role for some regulation and restraint in order to protect the greater public good. 
Title I of the modified bill seeks to reduce the influence of special interest money in campaigns by banning the use of soft money in Federal races. Soft money would be allowed to be contributed to State parties in accordance with State law. 
We do, however, seek to differentiate between State and Federal activities. Soft money contributed to State parties could be used for any and all State candidate activities. Let me 
repeat that statement. Soft money given to the State parties could be used for any State electioneering activities. 
If a State allows soft money to be used in a gubernatorial race, a State senate race, or the local sheriff's race, it would still be allowed under this bill. However, if a State party seeks to use soft money to indirectly influence a Federal race, such activity would be banned 120 days prior to the general election. Using such funds to finance voter registration activities would be allowed except during the 120 days prior to the election. 
Voter registration efforts are very important. I know my colleagues recognize that fact. We want individuals to register and then to vote. This bill recognizes that fact and allows parties to engage in voter registration activities. Additionally, State parties would be allowed, within limits, to engage in generic party advertising. These activities help build the party and encourage people to vote. 
To make up for the loss of soft money, the modified bill doubles the limit that individuals can give to State parties in hard money. Consequently, the aggregate contribution limit for hard money that individuals could donate to political races would rise to $30,000. 
Title II of the modified bill seeks to limit the role of independent expenditures in political campaigns. 
Mr. President, I think we ought to pay attention to this part of it because, over the weekend, it seems to be the attack point for various pundits and those throughout the Nation, most of whom by the way have not seen the bill. 
The bill in no way bans, curbs, or seeks to control real, independent, noncoordinated expenditures in any manner. Additionally, if hard money--money that is recorded and traceable--is used, then there are no restrictions of any kind on advertising. 
Let me repeat that fact. This bill in no way restricts any message or any use of the airwaves. It does however place limits and controls on expenditures if certain kinds of money are used to fund such activity. 
Any independent expenditure made to advocate any cause, with the exception of the express advocacy of a candidate's victory or defeat, is fully allowed. To do any thing else would violate the first amendment. 
However, the bill does expand the definition of express advocacy. The courts have routinely ruled that the Congress may define express advocacy. In fact, current standards of express advocacy have been derived from the Buckley case itself.

Mr. McCAIN. What the modified bill seeks to do is establish a so-called bright line test 60 days out from an election. Any independent expenditures that fall within that 60-day window could not use a candidate's name or his or her likeness. During this 60-day period, ads could run that advocate any number of issues. Pro-life ads, pro-choice ads, antilabor ads, prowilderness ads, pro-Republican party or Democratic party ads--all could be aired without restriction. However, ads mentioning candidates themselves could not be aired. 
This accomplishes much. First, if soft money is banned to the political parties, such money will inevitably flow to independent campaign organizations. These groups often run ads that the candidates themselves disapprove of. Further, these ads are almost always negative attack ads and do little to further beneficial debate and a healthy political dialog. To be honest, they simply drive up an individual candidate's negative polling numbers and increase public cynicism for public service in general. 
The modified bill explicitly protects voter guides. I believe this is a very important point. Some have unfairly criticized the original bill because they thought it banned or prohibited the publication and distribution of voter guides and voting records. While I disagree with those individual's conclusions, the sponsors of the modified bill sought to clarify this matter. 
Let me state that voter guides are completely protected in the modified bill. Any statements to the contrary are simply not true. 
Some of my colleagues have voiced concern about the 60-day bright line test as being arbitrary. They have noted that different standards would exist prior to 60 days out. They are right. But what is their point. Election law is riddled with deadlines and time frames. When a candidate runs for office, he or she must file papers by a certain date. In order to appear on the ballot, certain deadlines must be met, certain events must occur. What is their point. Would they advocate abolishing all time frames and just let elections occur as spontaneous events? I don't think so. 
I hope that we will not allow our attention to be distracted from the real issues at hand--how to raise the tenor of the debate in our elections and give people real choices. No one benefits from negative ads. They don't aid our Nation's political dialog. Again, if someone chooses to run negative ads, this bill will not restrict their right to do so. But we should not just throw up our hands and say, `Who cares?' We should seek, within the protections of the Constitution, to encourage a healthy political debate. 
I believe that in 1994 it was not better funding and more money that gave Republicans victory; it was better and more ideas. If money was the key to Republican victory, why then did it take so long? 
I am very serious about this point. Some have stated that money helps equalize the Republican Party's ability to win elections due to the liberal press. If that is true, then why didn't it work? Since 1974, when we last reformed the campaign finance system, throughout the 1970's and 1980's and 1990's, Republicans routinely have outraised and outspent Democrats. Yet, with the exception of 1980 to 1986 in the Senate, we did not control the Congress. I would argue that the 6 years in which we controlled the Senate during the 1980's was due to the strength and leadership of Ronald Reagan; not our ability to spend. 
When we took over the Congress in 1994--and I say this not to agitate my Democrat colleagues--it was not due to money. It was due to our superior ideas. It was due to the Contract With America. It was due to a fundamental change in the views of the American electorate. It was not due to a spate of negative campaign advertising. 
Title III of the modified bill mandates greater disclosure. Our bill mandates that all FEC filings documenting campaign receipts and expenditures be made electronically and that they then be made accessible to the public on the Internet not later than 24 hours after the information is received by the Federal Election Commission. 
Additionally, current law allows for campaigns to make a `best effort' to obtain the name, address, and occupation information of the donors, et cetera. The bill also mandates random audits of campaigns. Such audits would only occur after an affirmative vote of at least four of the six members of the FEC. This will prevent the use of audits as a purely partisan attack. 
Title IV seeks to encourage individuals to limit the amount of personal money they spend on their own campaigns. If an individual voluntarily elects to limit the amount of money he or she spends in his or her race to $50,000, then the national parties are able to use funds known as `coordinated expenditures' to aid such candidates. If candidates refuse to limit their own personal spending, the parties are prohibited from contributing coordinated funds to the candidate. 
This serves to limit the advantage that wealthy candidates enjoy and strengthens the party system by encouraging candidates to work more closely with the parties. 
Lastly, the bill codifies the Beck decision, which states that nonunion employees in a closed-shop union workplace who are required to contribute funds to the union can request and ensure that his or her money not be used for political purposes. 
I personally support stronger language. I believe no individual should be forced to contribute to political 
activities. However, I recognize stronger language would invite a filibuster of this bill and would doom its final passage. 
Mr. President, what I have outlined is a basic summary of our modification to the original bill. 
I have heard many colleagues say that they could not support S. 25, the original McCain-Feingold bill, for a wide variety of reasons. Some oppose spending limits. Others oppose free or reduced rate broadcast time. Yet others could not live with postal subsidies to candidates, and others complain that nothing was being done about labor. 
Again, as I stated in the opening debate on Friday, I hope all of my colleagues who made such statements will take a new and openminded look at this bill. Gone are spending limits. Gone is free broadcast time. Gone are reduced rate TV time and postal subsidies. We have sought to address the problem of undue influence being exercised by the labor unions. All of the excuses of the past are gone. 
Mr. President, let me close again by emphasizing that the sponsors of this legislation have but one purpose--to enact a fair, bipartisan campaign reform that seeks no advantage for one party or the other but only seeks to find common ground upon which we can all agree to pass the best, most balanced, and most important reform we have ever had. 
All we ask of our colleagues is that they approach this debate with the same purpose in mind. 
To those who accuse the opponents of this bill of being unyielding in their opposition to any reform, let me recite the words of my friend from Kentucky from an op-ed piece he wrote for the Washington Post in 1993. My friend, Senator McConnell from Kentucky, said: 
`The truth is that Republicans support a ban on all soft money,' Senator McConnell wrote, `regardless of whether it benefits Republicans or Democrats.' 
Let me repeat that. 
`The truth is that Republicans support a ban on all soft money,' Senator McConnell wrote, `regardless of whether it benefits Republicans or Democrats.' 
The Senator went on to identify himself and the Republican Party with the advocates of reform:  
Truly campaign finance reform is needed-- 
truly campaign finance reform is needed-- but it should not have to cost the taxpayers, and it does not have to include spending limits. If we are going to pass a meaningful bipartisan campaign finance bill, we must drop the roadblocks to reform: taxpayers financing and spending limits. 
Mr. President, I say to my friend from Kentucky that, as a sign of our good faith, the sponsors of this bill have listened to his objections, and we have dropped the provisions which he once criticized as roadblocks. Moreover, we share Senator McConnell's view that soft money must be banned. 
I would say that we are very close to the proposed reforms that Senator McConnell proposed in 1993. We pled with our colleagues not to use the amendment process only to kill the prospects for real reform by offering amendments intended to be, as Senator McConnell put it, `roadblocks' to reform. 
If Senator McConnell is as sincere in proposing reforms as he was a few years ago--which I do not doubt--work with us to resolve our very few remaining differences and help us reach our common goal of genuine campaign finance reform.

What we did was, as I mentioned in both my statement on Friday and again this morning, we did away with a number of the provisions in the bill which would have guaranteed its failure, not that we had in any way abandoned the fundamental belief in those provisions of the bill, but we were not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We are in contact with the Brennan Center, and they will update their views on this within a very short period of time. So if the Senator from Kentucky has some concerns about their being up to date with the latest changes, let me calm his fears at this time to tell him that we will be receiving very soon another letter that approves of the modified version.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think, with some research by some very excellent staff members, we may have a basis for an agreement here. I really believe we have a very strong chance, because I think we can use, to a large degree, as a basis for our negotiations, not so much the McCain-Feingold bill but the bill that was introduced as S. 7 by Senator Robert Dole and Senator McConnell on January 31, 1993. 
This was S. 7, remembering in those days on this side of the aisle the Republicans were in the minority, so the majority had the first five bills and the minority, the Republicans, had the next five. This is S. 7, so I don't know what 6 was, but this was the second one. 
I want to talk about this a little bit because I think it is important. This is a bill that Senator McConnell introduced and spoke on with Senator Dole. I think it is very important. The bill was introduced in the Senate on Thursday, January 21, 1993 by Senator Robert Dole. At the present time there are 24 cosponsors of the bill--24 Republicans. Let me tell you the cosponsors of this bill. They were Burns, Chafee, Coverdell, Craig, D'Amato, Domenici, Durenberger, Gorton, Grassley, Gregg, Hatch, Hatfield, Kempthorne, Lott, Lugar, McCain, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, Packwood, Roth, Simpson, Stevens, Thurmond. 
So, most of the present leadership of the Republican side was represented as cosponsors of this bill. Of course Senator Lott, Senator Coverdell, Senator Nickles, the whip, Senator Craig, and of course Senator McConnell. 
The bill says: Deal with campaign finance reform. Let me read very quickly from Senator McConnell's remarks. 
Mr. President, in 1992, voter turnout increased, electoral competition increased, campaign spending increased. Most objective observers of the political system . . .. 
Mr. President, Democratic campaign finance bills based on spending limits and taxpayer financing do, indeed, constitute change. They do not, however, reform. They do not improve the electoral process. 
Quoting from Senator McConnell: 
The Democratic bills we have seen in the past were good public relations . . .. Spending limits were totally discredited in the presented system . . .. Mandatory spending limits are unconstitutional . . .. Taxpayer funding of the Congressional campaign system to provide inducements or penalties is not palatable. 
Then he goes on and says: 
Republicans will not stand by while the first amendment is sacrificed for a facade of reform. Campaign finance reform need not be unconstitutional, partisan, bureaucratic or taxpayer funded. The minority leader and I, joined by Republican colleagues, have today introduced the Comprehensive Campaign Finance Reform Act, the most extensive and effective reform bill before this Congress bar none. It bans PAC's, the epitome of special interest influence and a major incumbent protection tool. Our bill bans soft money, all soft money, party, labor, and that spent by tax-exempt organizations. It cuts campaign costs, provides seed money to challengers paid for, not by taxpayers, but by the political parties. It constricts the millionaires' loophole, [which, by the way, happens to be a part of the revised package we have, I am sure by coincidence] restricts and regulates independent expenditures, fights election fraud, and restricts gerrymandering. 
Real reform: In stark contrast to the Democrats' bill, the Republican bill puts all the campaign money on top of the table where voters can see it. Nothing would have a more cleansing effect on the electoral process. 
Then: 
The text of the bill eliminates all special interest political action committees, corporate, union, and trade association, also bans all non-connected or ideological PAC's and all leadership PAC's. 
Note, if a ban on non-connected PAC's is determine to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, the legislation will subject nonconnected PAC's to a $1,000 per election contribution limit. 
I could not agree more with Senator McConnell's position on that. 
Soft money ban: Bans all soft money from being used to influence a Federal election. Soft money is defined as the `raising and spending of political money outside of the source restrictions, contribution limits and disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act and its regulations.' 
So we are in complete agreement with Senator McConnell on that. 
Establishes new rules for political party committees to ensure that soft money is not used to influence Federal elections, including the requirement that national, State, and local political parties establish a separate account for activities benefiting Federal candidates and a separate account for activities benefiting State candidates. 
Requirement of full disclosure of all accounts by any political party committee that maintains a Federal account, and the establishment of minimum percentages of Federal funds which must be used for any party building program, voter registration, get out the vote, absentee ballots, ballot security which benefits both Federal and State candidates. 
Exempts certain organizational activities, as ours does--research, get out the vote, voter registration--from coordinated or other limitations. 
Requires disclosures and allocation for these activities and retains the same coordinated expenditure limits for media expenditures. 
Maintains the limit on total contributions of Federal party accounts at $20,000; limits to $50,000 per calendar year the total amount of contributions an individual or other entity may make to national, State, or local party accounts combined. 
Labor and soft money employee protection: Codifies the Supreme Court decision in Beck versus Communications Workers of America and provides certain rights for employees who are union members. 
Soft money restrictions: Prohibits tax-exempt 501(c) organizations from engaging in any activity which attempts to influence a Federal election on behalf of a specific candidate for public office. 
Extends to all 501(c) organizations the current prohibition on campaign activity which applies to 501(c) charities. 
Restricts tax-exempt organizations from engaging in voter registration or get-out-the-vote activities which are not candidate-specific if a candidate or Member of Congress solicits money for the organization. 
Restricts Federal activities by State PAC's created by Members of Congress. 
Reduces from $1,000 to $500 the maximum allowable contributions by individuals residing outside a candidate's State, an interesting take on the influence of outside money. 
Indexes the individual contribution limit, $1,000 per election for in-State contributions or $500 per election to out of State. 
Congressional candidates using Consumer Price Index, something that I think could be very well discussed. 
Prohibits bundling, which I think is a very laudable goal, and then it talks about independent expenditures. 
Requires all independently financed political communications to disclose the person or organization financing it. That is very interesting. I wonder how the Christian Coalition and the right to life and other organizations would feel about requiring all independently financed political 
communications to disclose the person or organization financing it. When Senator Feingold and I floated that proposal, it met with a pretty strong opposition from both sides. This is a proposal that, obviously, as I have said many times, Senator McConnell made around 4 years ago; requires that that disclosure be complete and conspicuous. 
Requires timely notice to all candidates of the communications placement and content. 
Defines independent expenditure to prohibit consultation with a candidate or his agents. 
Requires the FCC to hold a hearing within 3 days of any formal complaint of collusion between an independent expenditure committee and a candidate. 
I must say, Mr. President, if, in the last election campaign, that provision requiring the FCC to hold a hearing within 3 days of any formal complaint of collusion between an independent expenditure committee and a candidate had been the law of the land, they would have been holding hearings 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
Creates an expedited cause of action in Federal courts for a candidate seeking relief from expenditures which are not independent. 
Allows for a broadcast discount in the last 45 days before a primary and the last 60 days before a general election. 
Permits challenger seed money, which I think is a laudable goal, and addresses a problem that we have had with giving a challenger a level playing field. 
Requires congressional candidates to declare upon filing for an election where they intend to spend alone over $250,000 in personal funds in a race and raises the individual contribution limit to $5,000 per election, from $1,000 for all opponents of a candidate who declare such an intention. 
No limits would apply to individual contributions by party, et cetera. 
Then there is a very interesting one, franked mail. Prohibits franked mass mailings during the election year of a Member of Congress and requires more disclosure of the use of franked mail for unsolicited mailings. 
Our proposal, as we know, is to cut off the name and face being mentioned in drawing a bright line. I have 60 days. Senator McConnell's 1993 proposal prohibited franked mass mailings during the entire election year. 
It goes into gerrymandering and goes into enhanced FEC enforcement. I heard my colleague from Utah complaining long and loud about any possibility of enhanced FEC enforcement. By the way, my colleague from Utah was not here in 1993, so I kind of doubt that he would have cosponsored this bill, as did 24 Republicans.

Mr. McCAIN. Thank you. I appreciate the correction from the Senator from Utah. 
That entire list of 24 Republican cosponsors of S. 7, as I mentioned, are Burns, Chafee, Coverdell, Craig, D'Amato, Domenici, Durenberger, Gorton, Grassley, Gregg, Hatch, Hatfield, Kempthorne, Lott, Lugar, McCain, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, Packwood, Roth, Simpson, Stevens, and Thurmond. 
Mr. President, I haven't had a chance to examine all the details of the proposal that Senator McConnell's and Senator Dole's S. 7 had, and I believe that there are probably some differences, but I will argue very strongly that we have the basis for negotiations and possible agreement based on S. 7. 
My understanding is that there is not the independent campaign bright line. That actually, as my colleagues know, was an idea that Mr. Norm Ornstein and Mr. Mann and Mr. Trevor Potter, Professor Potter, came up with as a way of trying to get about the issue of the independent campaigns which we all know are out of control and they are all negative campaigns. 
I was, frankly, encouraged to see that Senator McConnell had proposed such a comprehensive way of reforming the campaign system as far back as 1993, obviously displaying a degree of clairvoyance that I didn't have at the time. So I hope we can go back to that. 
Mr. President, I just want to end up--and I know Senator McConnell wants to respond to that--there is a book that Brooks Jackson wrote called `Honest Graft: Big Money in the American Political Process.' This book is somewhat dated. It was published in 1990. A lot of things have happened since then. Some things haven't happened. Some things haven't changed, they have just gotten worse. 
Let me quote from a chapter in his book, and I will be brief: 
Nearly everyone complains that something is wrong with the American political system. Liberals see a Congress bought by business interests, while PAC managers complain they are being shaken down by money-hungry legislators. Lawmakers detest the rising cost of campaigning, the inconvenience and indignity of asking for money, and the criticism they endure for accepting it. Democrats envy the Republican Party's financial strength and decry the sinister influence of big money and expensive political technology while trying to get as much of both for themselves as possible. Republicans, portrayed by the business PACs they nourished, seethe at their inability to dislodge Democratic incumbents. Critics of various leanings deplore lawmakers who use their office to help themselves or moneyed benefactors. Liberal and conservative commentators alike call the system `corrupt.' 
The problem isn't corruption; it is more serious than that. If unprincipled buying and selling of official favors was at fault then the solution would be simple. Honest legislators would refuse to participate, and prosecutors or voters would deal with the rest. To be sure, corruption does exist; it is hard to imagine any other community of 535 souls where felonies are so often proven. But those illegalities are only symptoms of the underlying sickness. 
The true predicament is that perverse incentives twist the behavior of ordinary legislators. The system of money-based elections and lobbying rewards those who cater to well-funded interests, both by keeping them in office and by allowing men like Ferdinand St. Germain to enrich themselves while they serve. It also punishes those who challenge the status quo, as D. G. Martin discovered. And it bends even the best of intentions, like Tony Coelho's priestly instincts, toward the courtship of moneyed cliques. As Coelho himself says, `the process buys you out.' The system doesn't require bad motives to produce bad Government. 
America is becoming a special-interest nation where money is displacing votes. Congress commands less and less support among the electorate as it panders increasingly to groups with money, yet its members cling to office like barnacles on a hull of a broken-down steamer. 
Mr. President, I would not use those words myself. I think they are strong words. I do respect Brooks Jackson a great deal. He is one of the foremost authorities on campaign finance reform. But if that was the case, if that was the view of one of the most respected commentators in 1990, can you imagine what the view of many of them are today? 
Again, I want to say that I hope we can sit down and have some serious negotiations. I would, to a large degree, move to S. 7 as a basis for a lot of those negotiations. Maybe we can get Senator Dole back, most respected by all of us, and see if Senator Dole--I believe he still supports many of those principles. We could all sit down together. 
If I can very seriously say, I hope that we can understand that what the American people want is not a filibuster and not a gridlock, not a filibuster by Republicans, not a filibuster by Democrats, but we have shown certainly this year what we are capable of doing when we sat down on both sides of the aisle and put the Nation on a path toward a balanced budget; when we sat down, Republicans and Democrats alike, trading off, as is necessary, to reach a goal of giving the American people their first tax cuts in 16 years. 
I believe we can do that if there is a willingness to do so, and I, for one, believe that the majority of my colleagues would agree that there are some things that are fundamentally wrong with this system. If the majority of my colleagues agree with that, then it seems to me we should be able to reach some kind of agreement on how we can reform that system. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Kentucky, we are changing the definition of `express advocacy' as well as the definition of `independent campaign.' And we feel compelled to do so because we see that on both sides the campaigns are no more independent than I am qualified to be on the next trip to Mir. 
We are, on page 13 of the bill, under where it says `Definitions * * * (17) Independent Expenditure--* * *. The term `independent expenditure' means an expenditure by a person--(i) for a communication that is express advocacy; and (ii) that is not provided in coordination with a candidate or a candidate's agent or a person who is coordinating with a candidate or a candidate's agent.' 
And then `(b) Definition of Express Advocacy--Section 301,' which the Senator from Kentucky just quoted from `* * * is amended by adding at the end the following: `(20) Express Advocacy--(A) In general: The term `express advocacy' means a communication that advocates the election or defeat of a candidate by--containing a phrase such as `vote for', `reelect', `support', `cast your ballot for', `(name a candidate) for Congress', `name of candidate in 1997', `vote against', `defeat', `reject', or a campaign slogan or words that in context can have no reasonable meaning * * *' 
This is the important part--`can have no reasonable meaning other than to advocate the election or defeat of 1 or more clearly identified candidates; * * *' 
That is, so we are changing both. I say to my friend, I am changing both the definition of `independent expenditure' and the definition of `express advocacy.' We are doing so because there is clearly a huge problem in American politics today, which I am sure the Senator from Kentucky appreciates. There are no longer independent campaigns. There is nowhere in any dictionary in the world the word `independent' that would fit these campaigns. They are part of campaigns. To my dismay, and I am sure to every Member of this body, they are negative. And they are negative to the degree where all of our approval ratings sink to an alltime low. 
So that is--I am sorry for the long response, but the Senator from Kentucky asked a very good question.

So I would be glad to discuss with the Senator from Kentucky exactly how we could define that in report language or other. 
But I want to return to the fundamental problem here with the Senator from Kentucky. I ask him, in return, does he believe that these so-called independent campaigns are truly independent?

Mr. McCAIN. I am talking about, are they really independent in what any of us would define as the word `independent,' or are they just additional methods to get around contribution limits in order to defeat another candidate? Which is it?

Mr. McCAIN. I am talking about independent campaigns. I am talking about a problem. What drives independent campaigns, as the Senator from Kentucky well knows, is the definition of `independent expenditure' and `express advocacy,' which we are changing. 
I am asking the Senator from Kentucky again, does he believe that in the last campaign the attacks by labor, for example, in congressional district 6, where over $2 million was spent by labor, with Congressman J.D. Hayworth's face distorted on the screen, sometimes morphing into that of Newt Gingrich, does the Senator from Kentucky believe that that was an independent campaign against Congressman J.D. Hayworth?

Mr. McCAIN. You really believe that was an issue advocacy ad when they said: Congressman J.D. Hayworth is an enemy of every man, woman and child in Arizona? Surely, the Senator from Kentucky does not believe that. Surely, the Senator from Kentucky does not believe that these independent ads, which are done by both sides, both Republican and Democrats, are no more than character attacks, destruction, but, more importantly, adjunct to political campaigns. Surely, the Senator from Kentucky cannot stand here on the floor of the Senate and say that those are independent campaigns by any reasonable 
definition.

Mr. McCAIN. I think it has a lot to do with what the Senator from Kentucky believes. I think it has a lot to do with it, because if the Senator from Kentucky thinks that this is just basically an evasion of the law by getting around the law, which has contribution limits, then certainly it matters what the Senator from Kentucky believes. 
If the Senator from Kentucky believes that these are truly independent campaigns, set up and run and funded by individuals who just want to see their particular issues, whether it be pro-life or pro-choice or workers' right to strike or any of the others, then fine. But it is beyond me to believe that the Senator from Kentucky could have, having seen these ads--he is very deeply involved in the political process--that they are independent. They are not. They are appendices of the political campaigns. The tragedy of it is, 98 percent of them are attack ads, as the Senator well knows.

Mr. McCAIN. First of all, the Senator well knows better than I, footnote 52 is where the magic words are, which is a footnote on the decision. The interpretation of many of us is that the language in the body of the opinion indicates that Congress does have a role to play and can be involved in it. 
But that is a difference of opinion that the Senator from Kentucky and I have. That is why I think I would be willing to try to make a case on the floor of the Senate here of the constitutionality of our view of changing the definitions of `independent expenditure' and `express advocacy' just as when we passed the line-item veto and there was significant constitutional question about the line-item veto by good and principled individuals of this body who said, `Look. What you're doing here is unconstitutional; so, therefore, I'm voting against it.' 
I am saying that I believe there is sufficient good opinions by good and principled individuals that differ as to what the interpretation is and what Congress has the right to not do. 
May I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to have stricken from the Record the name of a Member of the other body, because I misspoke, and it is against the rules of the Senate to say the name of a Member of the other body. I ask unanimous consent that that reference be removed from the Record.

Mr. McCAIN. So if I could finish my answer. It is not so much that it aggravates me as to whether it is negative or not. Of course, it pains all of us when the approval rating of elected officials is so low. There was a Fox poll that said, `I believe that my Member of Congress is:' 36 percent said, `someone I can trust,' 44 percent said, `a lying windbag.' That bothers all of us. But that is not the fundamental problem here, I say to my friend from Kentucky, because you can do that with hard money. You should be able to do that with hard money, any kind of attack, any kind of thing you want to do. 
What we are objecting to is it being used for soft money and the fact that it is not independent, does not meet, by any objective measure, at least in my view, the definition of the word `independent.' 
I thank the Senator from Kentucky.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Frist's authorization bill for the U.S. Fire Administration for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. I would also like to thank the additional cosponsors, Senator Hollings and Senator Rockefeller, for their support of this very important legislation. 
As chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, I am very pleased to see that the bill represents the bipartisan support that is so necessary to move this and other science and technology bills before the committee. It would be my hope that this bipartisan support would be continued for the many actions before this body, the U.S. Senate. 
The United States has one of the highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. Fires account for approximately 4,500 deaths and 30,000 injuries annually. The extent of this problem covers all sectors of society and costs American taxpayers approximately $50 billion per year. 
With these huge losses, the work of the U.S. Fire Administration plays a key role in reducing these numbers. Their work with the firefighters, those who are on the front lines in fighting these problems, should be commended. Their efforts in collecting data and other relevant information play a key role in the prevention of future fires.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate now begins a debate that will determine whether or not we will take an action that most Americans are convinced we are utterly incapable of doing--reforming the way we are elected to office. Most Americans believe that Members of Congress have no greater priority than our own reelection. Most Americans believe that every one of us--whether we publicly advocate or publicly oppose campaign finance reform--is working either openly or deceitfully to prevent even the slightest repair to a campaign finance system that they firmly believe is corrupt. Most Americans believe that all of us conspire to hold on to every single political advantage we have, lest we jeopardize our incumbency by a single lost vote. Most Americans believe we will let this Nation pay any price, bear any burden to ensure the success of our personal ambitions--no matter how dear the cost might be to the national interest. 
Mr. President, now is the moment when we can begin to persuade the people that they are wrong. Now is the moment when we can show the American people that we take courage from our convictions and not our campaign treasuries. Now is the moment when we can begin to prove that we are--in word and deed--the people's representatives; that we are accountable to all the people who pay our salaries, and not just to those Americans who finance our campaigns. Mr. President, now is the moment when we should take a risk for our country. 
I am a conservative, and I believe it is a very healthy thing for Americans to be skeptical about the purposes and practices of public officials and refrain from expecting too much from their Government. Self-reliance is the ethic that made America great, not consigning personal responsibilities to the State. 
I would like to think that we conservatives could practice the self-reliance which we so devoutly believe to be a noble public virtue, and rely on our ideals and our integrity to enlist a majority of Americans to our cause, rather than subordinate those ideals to the imperatives of fundraising. I would like to think the justice of our cause, the good sense of our ideas will appeal to a majority of Americans without the need to fund that appeal with obscene amounts of money. 
I am a conservative, and I believe in small government. But I do not believe that small government conservatives are chasing an idealized form of anarchy. Government is intended to support our constitutional purposes to `establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.' When the people come to believe that government is so dysfunctional, so corrupt that it no longer serves these ends, basic civil consensus will suffer grave harm and our culture will be fragmented beyond recognition. 
I am a conservative, and I believe that a conservative's primary purpose in public life is to give Americans a Government that is less removed in style and substance from the people, and to help restore the public's faith in an America that is greater than the sum of its special interests. That, I contend, is also the purpose of meaningful campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, opponents of campaign finance reform will argue that there is no public hue and cry for reform, despite the fact that more and more public polls show that the people support reform by ever-widening margins. A recent poll commissioned by my own party revealed that the public now considers campaign finance reform to be among the most important issues facing the country. 
But no matter, opponents will note that they have stood for reelection and won with their opposition to reform on full public display. Thus, they will argue, the people don't really care about reform. But that is because the people don't believe that either the incumbent opposing reform, or the challenger advocating it, will honestly work to repair this system once he or she has been elected under the rules that govern it. They distrust both of us. They believe that this system is so thoroughly riddled with financial temptations that it corrupts us all. 
The opponents will argue the people are content. I will argue that the people are alienated, and that this explains why fewer and fewer of them even bother to vote. 
This problem should motivate all public officials to repair both the appearance and the reality of government corruption. Whether great numbers of elected officials are, in fact, bribed by campaign contributors to cast votes contrary to the national interest is not the single standard for determining the need for reform. Although, it would be hard to find much legislation enacted by any Congress that did not contain one or more obscure provision that served no legitimate national or even local interest, but which was intended only as a reward for a generous campaign supporter. 
Mr. President, I do not concede that all politicians are corrupt. I entered politics with some of the same expectations that I had when I was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy. First among them was my belief that serving my country was an honor, indeed, the most honorable life an American could lead. 
I believe that still. Regrettably, many Americans do not. 
I am honored to serve in the company of many good men and women whose public and private virtue deserves to be above reproach. But we are reproached, Mr. President, because the system in which we are elected to this great institution is so awash in money that is taken so disproportionately from special interests that the people cannot help but suspect that our service is tainted by it. 
If most Americans feel they have sufficient cause to doubt our integrity, then we must seek all reasonable means to persuade them otherwise. Reform of our campaign finance laws is indispensable to that end. 
As long as the wealthiest of Americans or the richest organized interests can make six figure contributions to political parties and gain the special access to power such generosity confers on the donor, most Americans will dismiss even the most virtuous politician's claim of fairness and patriotism. 
And who can blame them when they are overwhelmed by appearance that political representation in America is measured on a sliding scale. The more you give, the more effectively you can petition your government. If a Native American tribe wants to recover their ancestral lands--pay up, the Government will hear you. If you want to build a pipeline across Central Asia--pay up, the President will discuss it with you. If you want to peddle your invention to the Government--pay up, you get an audience with Government purchasing agents. But if all you pay is your taxes, and you want your elected representatives to help you seek redress for some wrong, send us a letter. We'll send you one back. 
Mr. President, this a dark view of our profession, and I do not believe it fairly represents us. I believe such instances of influence peddling are, thankfully, an exception to the honest government that most public officials work hard to provide this Nation. But we cannot blame the people for thinking otherwise when they are treated to the spectacle of influence and access peddling which assaulted them in the last election; when they are told repeatedly that campaign contributions are the only means through which they can petition their Government; the politicians are selling subway tokens to the government gravy train. 
Mr. President, the opponents of reform will tell you that there isn't too much money in politics. They will argue there's not enough. They will observe that more money is spent to advertise toothpaste and yogurt than is spent on our elections. 
I don't care, Mr. President. We should not concern ourselves with the costs of toothpaste and yogurt marketing. We aren't selling those commodities to the people. 
We are offering our integrity and our principles, and the means we use to market them should not cause the consumer to doubt the value of the product. 
Mr. President, Senator Feingold, Senator Thompson, Senator Collins, and the other sponsors of this legislation have but one purpose--to enact fair, bipartisan campaign reform that seeks no special advantage for one party or another, but only seeks to find common ground upon which we can all begin to restore the people's faith in the integrity of their Government. 
Each of us may have differences as to what constitutes the best reform, but we have subordinated those differences to the common good, in the hope that we might enact those basic reforms which all Members of both parties could agree on. 
It is not perfect reform. There is no perfect reform. We have tried to exclude any provision which would be viewed as placing one party or another at a disadvantage. Our purpose is to pass the best, most balanced, most important reforms we can. All we ask of our colleagues is that they approach this debate with the same purpose in mind. 
Mr. President, on Monday, we will offer a substitute amendment to S. 25, which represents a substantial change to the original McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Act, but at the same time, maintains the core--the heart--of the original bill. 
I strongly believe in all the provisions of the original bill. In fact, as the debate proceeds, we intend to offer a series of amendments that would restore the component parts of our original bill. We intend to proceed to those amendments in good time. 
For now, I would like to outline for my colleagues the contents of our substitute. 
Before I do, I want to stress the purposes upon which this legislation is premised: 
First, for reform to become law, it must be bipartisan. This is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that affects both parties fairly and equally. 
Second, genuine reform must lessen the amount of money in politics. Spending on campaigns in current, inflation-adjusted dollars has risen dramatically. In constant dollars, the amount spent on House and Senate races in 1976 was $318 million. By 1986, the total had risen to $645 million, and in 1996, to $765 million. If you include the Presidential campaigns, over a billion dollars was spent in the last election. And as the need for money escalates, the influence of those who give it rises exponentially. 
Third, reform must level the playing field between challengers and incumbents. Our bill achieves this goal by recognizing the fact that incumbents almost always raise more money than challengers, and as a general rule, the candidate with the most money wins.

Mr. McCAIN. Our bill establishes a so-called bright line test 60 days out from an election. Any independent expenditure that falls within that 60-day window could not use a candidate's name or likeness. Ads could run which advocate any number of causes. Pro-life ads, pro-choice ads, anti-labor ads, pro-wilderness ads, pro-Republican Party ads, pro-Democrat Party ads--all could be aired in the last 60 days. However, ads mentioning the candidates could not. 
If soft money is banned to political parties, money will inevitably flow to independent campaign organizations. These groups run ads that even the candidates who benefit from them often disapprove of. Further, these ads are almost always negative attacks on a candidate and do little to further healthy political debate. As we all know, they are usually intended to defeat a candidate, and are often, in reality, coordinated with the campaign of that candidate's opponent. They are not genuinely independent, nor are they strictly concerned with issue advocacy. 
Our bill explicitly protects voter guides. I believe this is a very important point. Some groups have unfairly criticized our original bill when they argued that it prohibited the publication and distribution of voter guides and voting records. While I view those arguments as misinformation, the sponsors have, nevertheless, worked to make our legislation even more explicit in its protection of such activities. 
Let me stress--so no one can have any grounds to assume otherwise--this legislation completely protects voter guides. I will read the provision addressing this matter in the hope that it will allay any and all concerns about voter guides.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. 
I have the usual objections. One of them is particularly egregious: $250,000 to transfer commercial cruise ship shipbuilding technology to U.S. Navy shipyards and to establish a monopoly for a single cruise line in the Hawaiian Islands, for which there is a competitor already who wants to compete there. The people who tour the Hawaiian Islands and who live there are going to pay for that. I find it regrettable.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the effects of over 10 years of cuts in defense spending are being acutely felt by the men and women who serve in uniform. Enough has been said on this floor about issues like pilot retention, maintenance backlogs and modernization problems all caused by the confluence of declining resources and high operational temmpos that I will not dwell on them here today. Suffice to say, I applaud the decision by Congress to add $3.6 billion to the amount allocated for national defense reflected in the legislation before us today. The defense appropriations bill rightfully addresses some of these problems with funds added during congressional budget negotiations earlier this year. 
The examples of waste, as usual, are many. I'm not sure whether I should be nervous about an imminent threat to our national security from another solar system or galaxy. What or who is out there that warrants over $3.5 million in unrequested funds being added to the defense budget for the Sacramento Peak Observatory and the Southern Observatory for Astronomical Research? I am cognizant of the very real risk that Earth may someday be threatened by a comet or asteroid, but this is a problem already receiving ample attention from the scientific community using other federal and private dollars. I question whether we should be using defense dollars to fund these observatories. 
I have to confess to also being concerned about the increasing amount of defense dollars being earmarked for medical research programs despite the fact that the National Institutes for Health exists precisely to perform such research. Each area of research, whether diabetes, prostate cancer or HIV, carries with it an entirely sympathetic constituency for whom my heart goes out. That does not, however, justify the cynical use of defense dollars to conduct such research. To oppose this spending sets one up at as heartless. After all, who could oppose medical research. That, however, is precisely why Members of Congress like to use the defense budget: opponents of these earmarks risk antagonizing people suffering from serious illness or who have relatives with these afflictions. The point has to be made, however, that medical research not related to military service belongs with NIH--not DoD. 
Mr. President, the tortuous process through which Members of Congress contort themselves to conjure up national security rationalizations for parochial projects is absurd. It degrades this institution and further undermines public confidence in their elected officials. The $8 million in this bill for the Pacific Disaster Center is a case in point, as is the $9 million for the Monterey Institute for Counter-Proliferation Analysis. The latter is illustrative of the growing trend toward establishing endless numbers of research institutes irrespective of the existence of other centers and government agencies already performing such work. 
It is in this light that I find particularly disturbing the inclusion in this bill of $3 million for the establishment of a `21st Century National Security Study Group.' Neither House nor Senate bill included this item, but suddenly it finds itself in the Conference Report. Not only is this group wholly unnecessary--after all, how many more such studies do we really need, especially given the number produced without federal dollars--but it was never even brought before either chamber of Congress prior to now. 
This is ridiculous. What possible practical utility can this study group have? Is Congress so enamored of insinuating itself into the process of formulating our National Security and Military Strategies that it needs to mandate that some smart people get together and do what they're already doing in Department of Defense doctrinal and warfighting centers and research institutes all over America? Perhaps our counterparts in the House where I understand this program originated have lost sight of why they are here. 
I do not know why the defense appropriations conference report includes $5 million to expand the North Star Borough Landfill; $20 million not requested by the Defense Department for an integrated family of test equipment; $50 million--$50 million--for an Industrial Modernization program to assist in the commercial reutilization of government industrial complexes no longer used by the government. Local government and chambers of commerce have been performing this task just fine throughout the base closure process. Similarly, why do the communities surrounding Fort Ord and San Diego get a combined $15 million in defense conversion money earmarked in this bill? Was it necessary to double the amount requested for the Young Marines program? Should Congress really be in the business of legislating monopolies for individual cruise ship lines, as is done in this bill? 
This body has important business to which it must attend. I believe I have made my point. I won't even dwell on the $100,000 in the bill to preserve a Revolutionary War-era gunboat located at the bottom of Lake Champlain. There isn't time. Mr. President, the hemorrhaging of defense dollars for nondefense and highly questionable purposes is inexcusable during a period when we are struggling with vital questions of long-term military readiness. I hope to live to see the day Members of Congress see the light and cease this destructive practice of filling appropriations bills with garbage. It just has to stop.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to continue on this very important issue. The 19th century Danish philosopher Kierkegaard wrote that `purity of heart is to will one thing.' In Bosnia, the international community has willed many things, and the result has been a highly tenuous peace among the warring ethnic factions unlikely to long survive the departure of NATO military forces. As we all know, what was originally a 1-year mission has involved in a multiyear engagement of indeterminate duration. It is time to assess where we are and where we are going, with an eye toward ending deployment of U.S. forces to that war-torn region. 
When this body debated back in December 1995 the issue of whether to support the deployment of U.S. forces as part of the Implementation Force following the signing of the Dayton peace accords, I stated that, `I know that by supporting the deployment, but not the decision [to send the troops], I must accept the blame if something happens.' Events of the past several weeks have shown disturbing signs of a trend that may entail actions being taken that will result in the death of American servicemen. Mr. President, I am a realist. I recognize that the military exists to support national policy and that wearing the uniform involves a very real risk of being killed in action. Our failure to `will one thing,' however, is leading us down a perilous path on which such deaths will have been unnecessary. 
Congress, the press, scholars, and others have all considered the perennial question of mission creep. We can stop debating it, and accept that it has happened. Comparisons have been made with the ill-fated mission in Somalia to capture the late warlord and tribal leader Mohammed Farah Aideed. Such comparisons are often inappropriate for a number of reasons, but in this case it is valid. The multinational force, including the 9,400-strong contingent of U.S. troops, has seen its mission grow from that which is very specifically set forth in the annex accompanying the Dayton accords to one of extraordinarily confusing incongruity. The recent capture by British special forces of a Bosnian Serb indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague and the killing of another certainly sent a signal to Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, and the others on the long list of war criminals that at long last that provision of Dayton would be enforced. 
As with Farah Aideed in Somalia, however, the signal has raised the stakes greatly in terms of the cost we could pay to bring them to justice. Lest anyone think I exaggerate, remember the tragedy of watching an entire company of elite American soldiers killed or wounded while Farah Aideed continued to elude capture. The situation in Bosnia could be incomparably worse. 
The United States has overtly positioned itself in the middle of a power struggle between two Bosnian Serb leaders, President Biljana Plavsic and Radovan Karadzic. It is not what I would consider a great set of options. In the world of Serbian politics, though, everything is relative. The Clinton Administration has thrown its weight behind President Plavsic, the properly elected leader despite her abysmal record during the years following the splintering of the former Yugoslavia into ethnically derived divisions. Not a hard choice when the alternative is Karadzic, whose name should rightfully be placed alongside those of other 20th Century butchers. The point I am trying to raise, however, is that once we sided with one faction within the Bosnian-Serb community, we placed our military personnel in the kind of position that faced those in Lebanon in 1983 and Somalia 10 years later. 
The phenomenon of mission creep was accepted by most when it entailed benign nation-building measures. Indeed, the absence of a viable alternative to NATO in terms of competence, discipline, willingness to think innovatively, and absence of the kind of civilian political oversight that characterized the disastrous and tragic decision making apparatus under former U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his deputy Yasushi Akashi made it only logical that the military component of the operation to end the war and rebuild the country should fall on NATO's shoulders. Logical, but not necessarily right. That extension of the military's original mission of simply keeping the warring factions apart ensured that the deployment would last longer than originally intended. 
When the President announced that he would keep our forces in Bosnia beyond the original withdrawal date, he was met with widespread skepticism. How many of us actually believed that the June 1998 target date would be met? We knew that the deployment would continue indefinitely; that the costs would never be properly budgeted; that the diplomatic framework upon which we are operating would never stand on its own. But we also knew that a decision by Congress to terminate funding for troops in the field, for men and women sent in harms way at the behest of their Commander-in-Chief, stands as perhaps the most morally and politically difficult we can ever be called upon to make. 
The absence of an exit strategy has made it easier for the Administration to justify keeping troops there to execute an expanding list of missions with no logical completion date other than the fairly arbitrary one of June 1998. The appearance of conflict back in the late May-early June timeframe between the Secretaries of State and Defense and the more recent contradictory messages conveyed by the National Security Advisor and the Secretary of Defense regarding the June 1998 withdrawal date illuminates all too well the total lack on the part of the Administration of a clear concept of what we are doing in Bosnia and, consequently, how long we should be there. 
Mr. President, I supported the decision to deploy troops to end the war because President Clinton, in his capacity as Chief Executive and with his constitutional prerogative of conducting this Nation's foreign policy, had committed us to stop the fighting. And let no one doubt that the bitterness involved, the scale of atrocities inflicted, did not warrant some kind of forceful action. 
It is certainly likely that a peacekeeping force will be needed beyond June 1998. The parties to the conflict in Bosnia have shown little sign that they are prepared to accept in full the terms of the Dayton Accord, and key provisions like the return of refugees to their pre-war homes will require the presence of such a force. There is a legitimate question, though, whether that contingent needs to include U.S. ground forces. We should not continue to accept the protestations of our allies, such as those that were voiced prior to our deployment of ground forces, that the United States is not sharing the risk. This country has seen too many of its fallen soldiers laid to rest in European cemetaries for us to accept that kind of rhetoric. A peacekeeping force without United States ground forces can and should assume responsibility for Bosnia after June 1998. 
This does not imply an abandonment of our allies and friends in the effort at preventing a return of the fighting that forced the civilized world to once again reflect upon the fragility of global or regional peace. On the contrary, the conflagration that enveloped the former Yugoslavia earlier this decade was all the more shocking for its occurrence in Europe, where war was considered least likely to occur following the end of the East-West confrontation of the cold war era. The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a sad reminder that the so-called enlightened continent remains vulnerable to the kind of hatred and violence that culminated not long ago in the Holocaust. 
What is important, to this country, is that we not become the permanent caretaker of the region. Our troops must be out by the end of June 1998. We should maintain a rapid reaction force in Hungary, and our heavier forces in Germany should remain available if needed. The rapid reaction force should include air and ground components capable of responding in a timely manner to a resurgence in fighting with sufficient strength to quell any such fighting at minimal risk to our personnel. But make no mistake: The peacekeeping force that remains inside Bosnia and Herzegovina must be European in content. The governments of Europe must accept responsibility for maintaining peace in their own backyard. Two world wars demonstrated that the United States cannot disengage from Europe, and our own economic well-being demands that we not do so. But the American public should not be expected to see its military personnel kept in harm's way in perpetuity in a situation where the parties refuse to take the necessary steps for lasting peace. 
During the cold war, we prided ourselves on our role as leader of the free world. Those of us who know the horror of war first hand, however, know the price such leadership entails. It is not a price that should be paid in Bosnia. We should not send the wrong message to our personnel in the field by cutting off their funding; but we should send a message to the President that the United States has done all it can for that sad country and withdraw our soldiers from Bosnia. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. I yield the floor.

Let me also just point out I understand that there has to be vigorous debate on this issue. There also has to be votes. It is our intention to have votes on various amendments throughout this debate, and we need to have everyone on record on this issue. Also, I know I can count on the majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader in trying to bring closure to this debate, to this issue, after reasonable debate, in one fashion or another. 
Again, I want to thank the majority leader. It shows again the majority leader of this Senate, as was the case when the other side was the majority, when the leader gives his word, when the majority leader gives his word, it is good. And if it were otherwise, this body does not function. 
I thank the majority leader and I thank the Democratic leader for all of his cooperation.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as I said when this bill came before the Senate for consideration, this is, overall, a good bill. It contains very few of the types of earmarks and set-asides for pork-barrel spending that are included in most of the appropriations bills. 
Of course, I don't believe I have ever had the pleasure of reading an appropriations bill that is completedly devoid of earmarks, and this bill is no exception. 
When this bill came before the Senate, I applauded the Senate's decision to eliminate or reduce funding for several projects that did not appear to be high-priority projects. The Senate cut $50,000 for a study of electromagnetic fields in the Russell Senate Office Building, reduced funding for elevator modernization in the Hart Building by $200,000. Unfortunately, the Senate did include $100,000 for a new subway from the Russell Building to the Capitol. 
Because of these and other reductions, the overall budget for Senate buildings was reduced by about $2 million. This conference agreement restores the full $52 million originally proposed for the Senate. 
My staff was told by the Appropriations Subcommittee staff that this restored money will not be used for the projects noted above that the Senate explicitly cut. Instead, $2 million will be transferred and used for maintenance and repair projects and security improvements in the Capitol. Although I can find nothing in the conference agrement that would ensure this is the case, I trust that none of the restored funds will be used, for example, to study electromagnetic fields in the Russell Senate Office Building. 
Finally, I am disappointed that the conferees chose to specifically reverse the direction in the Senate report that would require the General Accounting Office to place higher priority on Members' requests for audits, studies, and investigations. This has been a particular matter of concern to me, and I was pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee chose to take the initiative to establish the proper priority for the GAO's work. 
I am sure most of my colleagues have, at one time or another, been advised that the GAO cannot complete work we have requested in a timely fashion. But I don't know if my colleagues are aware that GAO does a great deal of work that is either self-initiated or requested informally by staff members. And often this work is placed ahead of work that is requested by Members in the GAO's assignment of staff and resources to complete the work. I don't believe most of my colleagues would think that is the proper prioritization for an agency that works for the Congress. 
Frankly, I can see no good reason why the conferees took the unusual step of repudiating this very much-needed directive. Unfortunately, however, because this provision has been summarily reversed by the conferees, I will have to consider other appropriate means to ensure that GAO's prioritization of work reflects the needs of the Congress, not the GAO itself. 
Madam President, these are not major problems. The total of the pork-barrel provisions in this bill is only slightly more than $1 million. However, again, I remind my colleagues that every taxpayer dollar we waste reinforces the disdain of the American people for the Congress and our way of doing business.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I must applaud the actions of the chairman of the D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Faircloth, for his restraint in putting together this bill. 
The bill is the first step in implementing the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act that Congress passed this summer. This bill provides the funding necessary to carry out that act, and includes several provisions that will ensure fiscal responsibility and adherence to the act. 
In reviewing this bill, I have found only one section in the report language that causes some concern. On page 31 of the report, the following language appears: 
The Committee is aware of the need for an adult and pediatric heart transplant program at a not-for-profit academic medical center servicing this Nation's Capital. The D.C. metropolitan area is the only major metropolitan area that does not have an academic medical center with a heart transplant program. Since this not-for-profit medical center has recently enhanced its capabilities by the additional of a nationally and internationally renowned cardiovascular surgeon and a nationally known pediatric cardiologist, the Committee strongly recommends that the State health planning and development agency approve the certificate of need application for a nonprofit academic medical center in the District of Columbia that has an approved lung transplant program. 
I am sure my colleagues are aware of the likely result of this type of language in an Appropriations Committee report. Although not bound to do so, I would expect that the State health planning and development agency will feel pressured to approve the application of this academic facility. Although that may not be an inappropriate decision, I continue to believe it is inappropriate for Congress to direct these types of decisions on a case-by-case basis, rather than assessing the broader requirements for health facilities in the District of Columbia. I would hope the committee would see fit to withdraw this near-directive and allow the agency to make decisions based on the criteria it has developed for all such matters. 
Again, this bill is free of the types of earmarks that we have seen in virtually every other appropriations measure to come before the Senate this year. 
As the last appropriations measure to come before the Senate for debate, perhaps this is a welcome sign of things to come as we turn to the appropriations conference reports.

Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, first of all, I want to thank the majority leader for his willingness to take up this issue. 
As I said on Friday when he made it very clear to all that we would take up this issue in a timely fashion under the conditions of the unanimous-consent agreement, as he stated, I thought it was eminently fair. 
There are other issues that are before the Senate that need to be resolved. And over time I have great confidence that the majority leader will bring up this issue so that it can be adequately addressed. 
As far as the letter from the President is concerned, let me just say, Mr. President, we all know that the President can call Congress into session all he wants to. He cannot make them act. And I see from time to time, as we address this issue, the seeking of some kind of political advantage and leverage here in this debate. 
Let me make one thing perfectly clear, the only way we are going to achieve meaningful campaign finance reform is by sitting down together in a bipartisan fashion. We do not need letters from the President of the United States now. What we need is meaningful and serious negotiations between all parties committed to meaningful campaign finance reform. I intend to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve that. 
Again, I want to thank the majority leader because he told me a long time ago that this issue would receive the serious consideration that it deserves, and he has confirmed that confidence with the unanimous-consent agreement today. 
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as part of the Interior appropriations bill (H.R. 2107) the Senate adopted an amendment I offered with Senator Stevens to create a National Park and Environmental Improvement Fund. The fund is financed with $800 million in disputed oil revenue awarded to the Federal Government by the Supreme Court. Under the amendment, the annual interest from the fund would be available, subject to appropriation, for top priority capital improvements within the National Park System; to assist States with their own park planning and development; and to finance ocean research. 
As I stated, disbursements of the interest revenue would be subject to appropriation. I want to be clear that it is not our intent to create this fund in vain, by appropriating the interest and reducing other vital park or environmental accounts in order to remain below the applicable budget caps. Our goal and intent is to ensure these funds will supplement the appropriations parks and environmental accounts would otherwise receive. The distinguished chairmen of the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee have agreed to work to ensure that end and I thank them for their courtesy and leadership.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join with Senator Inouye in expressing strong opposition to the amendment. Just a few months ago, Senator Inouye and I introduced a bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1987. The Indian Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over matters involving native Americans, has scheduled the first hearing on this bill on October 8, 1997. This hearing has been on the schedule for over a month. This is the normal and proper procedure for making policy with respect to native American issues. 
If I had been able to be on the floor, I would have fought against and voted against this amendment. In its modified form, as it was finally adopted by voice vote, the amendment does not affect any process or procedure that currently exists into law or in regulation. However, it does represent an unwarranted interference into the development of reasonable and appropriate approaches to the authorization and regulation of Indian gaming that have not been considered or approved by the Indian Affairs Committee, the administration, or, more importantly, the tribes. 
The amendment, even as modified, represents an ill-advised action of the Congress to influence the future of Indian gaming. The mere fact of offering this type of amendment, which seeks to micromanage the regulation of Indian gaming, will have the effect of prejudicing the outcome of the Indian Affairs' Committee hearings on IGRA amendment. 
The proponents of this amendment are seeking to override a carefully balanced procedure in the Congress. They are seeking to throw up new obstacles to prevent tribes from engaging in gaming and to disrupt ongoing negotiations between States and tribes who are cooperating in developing Indian gaming compacts. 
The IGRA was carefully crafted to take into account the differences among the several States. IGRA is not perfect, and that is why Senator Inouye and I introduced amendments to the bill. The Enzi amendment is premature. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs hearing is the proper forum to discuss these issues and for opponents of Indian gaming to express their concerns. 
Mr. President, I join with my colleagues on the Indian Affairs Committee in urging the conferees on the Interior appropriations bill to eliminate this provision from the final conference agreement.

Mr. McCAIN. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator Gorton, Senator Hollings and Senator Ford, to introduce the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act. This bill would require foreign air carriers to implement disaster family assistance plans should an accident involving their carriers occur on American soil. I would like to recognize my colleagues in the House, especially Representative Underwood from Guam, who introduced the companion bill in the House of Representatives earlier this week. 
The legislation, if enacted, would build on the family assistance provisions that we enacted last year as part of the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. Let me be clear about one point. Domestic air carriers are already operating under the same legislative requirements set out in the legislation before us today. 
The need for extending the requirements to foreign air carriers came into a clear focus with the tragic crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in Guam. I do not intend to single out Korean Air for blame. An accident of this magnitude, involving the loss of more than 200 lives, in rough and isolated terrain, is bound to create mass confusion and hysteria. Even so, coverage of the accident made us all acutely aware of the criticisms made by the family members, and the pain they suffered in relation to the search and rescue efforts, as well as the media involvement following the accident.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Stevens and Senator Murkowski. 
The amendment would deposit $800 million into a newly created national park and environmental enhancement fund within the U.S. Treasury. 
The interest from the account would be dedicated to three purposes: 
First, to make critically needed capital improvements in America's national parks. 
Second, assist States in their park planning and development needs. 
Third, provide for research on the marine environment. This is strongly endorsed by the National Parks and the Conservation Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, National Trust for Historic Preservation, and Center for Marine Conservation. 
I thank Senators Stevens and Murkowski for their assistance and leadership, as well as Senator Gorton, on this amendment. 
The revenue which will finance this special account is oil lease revenue awarded to the Federal Government by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year. Both the United States and Alaska claimed ownership of the land from which the oil was extracted. 
Mr. President, we all know that the people of Alaska were bitterly disappointed in the Court's decision to find on behalf of the Federal Government and to award the money to the Federal Treasury. Nevertheless, the Court has rendered a final judgment. 
I am pleased to say that passage of this amendment will enable us to employ the money not only for the people of Alaska but for every other State. 
Under this amendment, 40 percent of the yearly interest of the new account--up to $20 million annually--will be dedicated to making high-priority capital improvements in our national parks. Now is the time to act. The integrity of the national historic treasures that comprise our National Park System is at stake. 
The GAO estimates that unmet capital needs throughout the system total more than $8 billion. Current funding levels are grossly insufficient to meet these requirements. 
Last year, out of the $1.6 billion that Congress appropriated to operate and maintain the 314 national parks, monuments, and historical sites, two-thirds were spent on park operations, leaving $400 million available to finance capital improvements. 
Let me remind you, Mr. President, that the GAO estimates that of the unmet capital needs throughout the system of more than $8 billion last year, there was $400 million available to finance capital improvements. Mr. President, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it takes a long time to catch up. 
Grand Canyon National Parks offers a historic and sobering example of the magnitude of the funding shortfalls that we face. The parks' general management plan calls for over $350 million in capital improvements. This fiscal year the parks received approximately $16 million, of which only $12 million was available for capital purposes. This scenario is repeated at parks throughout the country. 
Mr. President, no one knows this better than the Senator from Washington, and the Senator from Alaska. I think it is important to stress we are not talking about luxuries. We are talking about needs. The vast majority of the capital improvements we are talking about are necessary to preserve the natural and historical resources that makes our parks so special. 
Mr. President, earlier this summer, U.S. News & World Report featured a cover story, which I have here, entitled `Parks in Peril.'

If we abdicate our responsibilities to maintain the integrity of the National Park System we will have spoiled the most precious part of our national heritage, squandered the birthright of our children, and failed to meet one of our most basic responsibilities. Let's not allow that to happen. 
I want to again thank Senator Murkowski, especially Senator Thomas and Senator Bumpers, for the efforts they are making for an overall solution to the problems in our National Park System. That work is diligent, and needs to be rewarded. I look forward to their results. In the meantime, I think this is an important step forward. 
Mr. President, I thank the sponsors and the managers of the bill for their cooperation and assistance.

This amendment places primary responsibility for determining the priority of land acquisitions in the hands of the federal land management agencies charged with preserving, protecting, and managing our nation's natural resources. At the same time, the amendment preserves the prerogative of Congress to approve or disapprove the Administration's recommendations prior to making any of these additional funds available.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to explain to my colleagues an amendment I had intended to offer to the fiscal year 1998 Interior Appropriations bill. I was persuaded not to offer the amendment because of my concern that opening up the section of the bill which provides an additional $700 million for land acquisitions and exchanges would embolden those who would earmark these funds for particular projects, without consideration of the priorities of our Federal land management agencies. Therefore, I decided not to offer the amendment at this time. 
I do intend to pursue this proposal as separate legislation, and I solicit the comments of my colleagues concerning this proposal, described below.

Mr. McCAIN. Some of the earmarked projects funded in this bill have merit--I do not dispute that. What I do object to is the process by which these funds are appropriated. Earmarking Federal tax dollars is a process which can no longer be tolerated in these times of fiscal restraint. 
It is unfair to the American taxpayer that we allow this to continue. It is not right that we require the American taxpayer to foot the bill for landscape architects to `maintain a visually pleasing forest' in the Wayne National Forest in Ohio as this bill dictates. Why is it necessary to have hard working Americans pay nearly $2 million for the redevelopment of a fire operations center in Billings, MT? 
As I stated previously, Mr. President, these projects may have merit and may be very important--but how do we know that? Have they ever had a hearing? Have these projects ever been competitively bid? The answer, sadly, is no. 
Mr. President, I will not take any more of the Senate's time voicing my objections. I will close by saying that I truly hope we can bring an end to the practice of earmarking funds in the appropriations process. The American taxpayer deserves better than the wasteful spending that we have seen in these twelve appropriations bills.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday, I voted against the Bryan amendment regarding timber road construction subsidies. I would like to take this opportunity to explain my reasons for doing so. 
First, and most important, I believe the amendment goes too far. I have consistently opposed the current subsidy because I believe it is unfair to use the value of natural resources that belong to all taxpayers to offset the full cost of access roads needed by the timber industry to harvest those resources for their own profit. I agree with the proponents of the amendment that this is nothing more than a handout of federal assets at a loss to the taxpayers. 
However, because many of these roads serve dual or multiple purposes, I do not believe it is fair to shift the cost entirely to the timber industry, unless the industry is the only user of the road. This is a position I had clearly staked out in an amendment I offered in late 1995. In that amendment, I proposed to change the current system to require timber companies to pay a fair share of the costs of construction and maintenance of forest access roads. If, for example, the road would be used half of the time for recreation, maintenance or firefighting access, or some other legitimate purpose, then the timber industry would only have to pay for half of road construction. If, however, the road would only serve the timber company, the company would pay the entire cost of construction. 
I believe this is a fair means of allocating responsibility for construction and maintenance costs--based on actual use of the road. The Bryan amendment would have gone much too far and unfairly penalized the timber industry. 
Second, the amendment would have cut $10 million from the Forest Service budget for road construction and maintenance. Anyone familiar with some of the roads through our nation's forest lands recognizes the need for more funding, not less, for maintenance of existing roads. Even supporters of the amendment pointed out that the Forest Service has a $440 million backlog of road maintenance needs for existing roads. 
Many of these roads were built and paid for by the timber industry, and have since been turned over to the Forest Service. Many of them remain multi-purpose roads, providing ready access for the timber industry as well as the public and others to our forest areas. The Forest Service budget for maintenance of these roads is limited, and the Bryan amendment would have cut funding that could be used to maintain existing forest roads. 
Finally, the amendment does not adequately protect the counties from a cut in the funding they receive from timber sales. Because the timber industry would be required to fully fund access roads, companies would likely submit lower bids for the timber. County governments rely on revenues from timber sales to maintain their own roadways. Because the money counties receive is based on a fixed share of total timber revenues, a smaller pot would mean less money to the counties. The National League of Counties has written a very strong letter opposing the Bryan amendment. 
Let me address briefly the concerns of environmental organizations about the timber access road program. I believe we have to strike a balance in our forest management policy between preservation and production, focusing on healthy, well-maintained forests that will be preserved for future generations. 
However, I doubt seriously that eliminating the road construction subsidy for timber companies would result in less logging of our forests. The key to limiting logging and road-building in our forests is a rational, reasonable forest management policy. In fact, because the revenue from timber sales would decline with lower timber bids, our forests could actually be harmed. The Forest Service would have even less funding to carry out its important preservation and management activities, and those wishing to utilize these roads for recreational access to forest lands would be denied that opportunity. 
Mr. President, this amendment was cast as an anti-pork amendment. My commitment to eliminating pork-barrel spending is quite well known to my colleagues, whether it be earmarks in an annual appropriations bill or corporate subsidies. But it is important that we look at the details of this amendment, because it would have had serious consequences for local communities and others who use these roads that I do not believe the authors intended, and which have nothing to do with pork. 
Mr. President, for these reasons, I voted against the Bryan amendment. I will continue to pursue elimination of unfair and inequitable corporate subsidies, including the current timber access road subsidy. One mechanism which would help in the effort to eliminate such subsidies is an independent, non-partisan commission to study all corporate subsidies and prepare a package of recommendations for Congressional review and action, and I have authored a bill, S. 207, with several of my colleagues to set up such a commission. And I am prepared to work with Senator Bryan and my colleagues to craft an amendment to eliminate this inequitable corporate subsidy and put in place a fair and equitable program to share the costs of timber access roads among all users, and to ensure that rural counties already strapped by declines in the timber industry are held harmless.

Mr. McCAIN. For 5 straight years, President Clinton has submitted a defense budget to Congress that reflects the low priority given by this administration to our men and women serving in the Armed Forces. For the past 3 years the Republican Congress has added over $20 billion to the administration's requests in order to provide the resources necessary to ensure the readiness of our forces to protect our Nation's security. 
I fully supported the congressional add-ons for national defense because I have seen the dangerous effects of declining defense budgets on military modernization and readiness. 
However, I simply cannot support the diversion of nearly $1 billion of the $2.6 billion added this year for unrequested, low-priority military construction projects. 
This conference agreement on fiscal year 1998 military construction spending earmarks funding for 129 building projects totaling $941 million. This figure includes a plus-up of $268 million for National Guard and Reserve projects, including 12 Reserve centers.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, pork barrel spending in the defense budgets is not only unwise but potentially dangerous to our national security. 
Wasting scarce defense dollars on unnecessary construction projects takes away from the Pentagon's ability to fund the high-priority modernization and operational requirements identified by the military Services. 
I cannot disagree with those of my colleagues who believe that the active military has failed to allocate the resources necessary to ensure the readiness of the reserve forces. However, by diverting more than one-third of the congressional add to construction projects for the Reserves, Congress is ignoring the most urgent unfunded requirements that the Reserve components themselves have identified. 
Certainly, the Pentagon has not been responsive to congressional direction to redress the underfunding of the Reserve components. But I think this bill clearly demonstrates that Congress is over-zealous in adding money for the Guard. 
For example, last year, the Appropriations Committee directed the Army to budget $75 million for Army National Guard military construction in fiscal year 1998. Unfortunately, the Army failed to follow the committee's direction and budgeted only $45.1 million in the budget request for Army Guard construction projects. But I fail to see how that gap of $30 million should become an add of over $70 million. This conference report provides $118.3 million for Guard construction--$43 million more than the Congress said last year should be provided. 
Another example--The budget request for Air National Guard projects was $60.2 million. This conference report more than tripled that number, providing $190.4 million in fiscal year 1998 alone for Air Guard construction. 
Mr. President, I am sure there are many programs on the list of add-ons in this bill. These programs may well be high priorities for individual unit commanders of adjutants general. Undoubtedly, these projects are high priorities for the Members of Congress who requested that they be added to this bill. 
But, Mr. President, the simple fact is that military training exercises continue to be cut back, backlogs in aircraft and ship maintenance continue to grow, there is a shortage of funds for flying hours, military health care is underfunded by $600 million, and 11,787 servicemembers and their families are reportedly on food stamps. 
It is unconscionable for the Congress to ignore these urgent priorities that directly correlate to military readiness and personnel quality of life. I might add, we are now experiencing a hemorrhage of qualified pilots out of the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. 
It is wrong to divert much-needed funds from truly high-priority needs to instead fund these building projects. 
Mr. President, last year, Congress provided the executive branch with an important tool to prevent wasteful spending--the line-item veto. Today, I am sending a letter to President Clinton urging him, in the interest of national security and fiscal responsibility, to exercise his line-item veto authority and eliminate the $941 million set aside for the 129 unrequested military construction projects contained in this bill. 
I intend to vote against the bill, and I urge my colleagues to consider very carefully whether they wish to vote in favor of wasting nearly $1 billion on these low-priority construction projects.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, first of all, I want to express my appreciation and high regard for the leadership of my friend from Colorado, Senator Campbell, on this issue. In his role as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, he has taken an active and vigorous role on Native American affairs. I am proud of the job he is doing. I know I reflect the view on both sides of the aisle on the outstanding job that he is doing. We all recognize he is uniquely qualified--uniquely qualified, Madam President--to address the issues that affect Native Americans in our society today. 
Second, I thank the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton. He has strongly held views on these issues, as we know. Senator Gorton's issues have been made clear to those of us on the Indian Affairs Committee, of which he is a distinguished member. He has worked very hard on these issues. We have significant and profound philosophical differences, but our debate and discussions on these issues have been characterized by respect for each other's views. I have the utmost regard not only for his views, but Senator Gorton has long experience in these issues dating back to when he was attorney general of the State of Washington and tried cases before the U.S. Supreme Court regarding Native Americans. 
I understand his advocacy, and, frankly, sometimes his frustration. I am very pleased to see the path of the agreement is that the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee has agreed to hold hearings to consider Senator Gorton's legislation, which is the proper way to carry out our legislative work. 
I did point out to Senator Gorton--and he knows full well--that his proposal will probably not receive the majority approval of the Indian Affairs Committee. But the purpose of hearings and the purpose of the debate and discussion is to educate our colleagues. I am very pleased that Senator Gorton will withdraw that provision which would have provoked profound, intense, and emotional debate on the floor of the Senate and has decided, albeit with some reluctance because of his impatience over his view of our failure to address these issues, to agree to take it through the Indian Affairs Committee. 
I thank Senator Gorton. I really do, because without his agreement and his position as chairman of the subcommittee, he had every right--even though I disagreed from time to time about legislating on appropriations bills--to bring this issue to the floor as part of his bill. We proved in recent days that we do give the utmost respect to committee chairmen and subcommittee chairmen in their work. 
I thank Senator Stevens, chairman of the full committee. Senator Stevens, who is as knowledgeable on Native American issues as anyone in this body, played a key role in negotiating the agreement and settlement that we came to, along with my friend, Senator Dan Inouye, who is most respected, along with Senator Campbell, on these issues. 
Senator Domenici, I might point out, in his usual articulate, vigorous, and certainly nonconfrontational fashion played an important role in the spirit of the discussions that we had in Senator Stevens' office. 
The upshot of it all is that really, Madam President, there are six old guys here that know each other pretty well. We know that we have to act in what is the best interests of Native Americans, the interests of this body, and, very frankly, the continued bipartisan--indeed, nonpartisan--addressing of Native American issues. 
I think we have a very, very good resolution. It would not have been possible without all the figures that I mentioned, and I believe that we will continue. 
If I could, finally, caution my colleagues, there will continue to be issues before this body and the Nation concerning Native Americans. There is population growth, which brings Native American tribes and non-Native Americans into collision with one another. There is an increase in Indian gaming, which in the view of many Americans has made all Indians rich. And, by the way, that is far, far from the case. There is a total of about 10 tribes that have become wealthy. There is continued issues, such as taxation. There will be continued Supreme Court decisions, including the recent ones concerning and affecting the State of Alaska. 
I urge my colleagues to get involved in understanding these issues. But I have some comfort in the knowledge that we have experienced people such as Senator Campbell, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, Senator Gorton, and Senator Domenici who have many, many years of experience with these issues. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for resolving this very difficult issue in a more than amicable fashion. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today as co-chair of the Senate Republican Task Force on Hispanic Affairs about this month's festivities honoring Hispanic heritage. Although this special month has been celebrated every year at this time since 1968, Hispanics have been making tremendous contributions to our Nation and to my State of Arizona for many generations. 
American culture has been enriched by numerous Hispanic influences. Many Americans claim Hispanic culture as their own in everything from food to music, and even celebrate their holidays. This month, set aside by Presidential proclamation, marks several historical events including Independence Day for Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua and El Dia de la Raza. 
It is important to recognize the rich variety of backgrounds that make up this burgeoning segment of society. All too often the various groups that make up Hispanics are lumped together and non-Hispanics forget the dynamic differences between Mexicans and Puerto Ricans or Salvadorans and Cubans, for example. But when Hispanics come together--tied by social and cultural similarities--they form a powerful group that we need to listen to closely. 
With more than 22 million Hispanics living in the United States, their importance cannot be understated. The number of Hispanic children is only exceeded by the number of non-Hispanic white children. This generation of children will enter all sectors of public and private life and shape the course of the Nation. And our Nation will be a better place for it. 
Their contribution to the economy is significant, with studies indicating that Hispanic businesses remain the fastest growing segment of the small business community. In Arizona alone, the current Hispanic buying power is approximately $6.8 billion with an expected growth of 2.3 percent annually. 
While these statistics are compelling, surprisingly, there is much more to be done. The Hispanic dropout rate has hovered around 30 percent for the past 20 years, and Hispanics are the minority least likely to have health insurance. The negative reprecussions of these conditions are not acceptable and are detrimental to America's future. 
To further the social and economic well-being of Hispanics we must address their needs with conscientious policy and remember these in all our legislative efforts. That is why I am co-chair of the Senate Republican Task Force on Hispanic Affairs. The task force helps ensure that the needs of the Hispanic community are represented in Federal policy. Through meetings and forums, I speak with Hispanics both in Arizona and from all over the country. 
Some of the Hispanics we will be hearing from and recognizing this month include Sandy Ferniza, president of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce [AHCC], who recently received the Exemplary Leadership Award. She is credited with turning AHCC into an agency that provides technical assistance and training to small businesses across the State. Also there is Mr. William Y. Velez, a mathematics professor at the University of Arizona, who this month received the Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring Presidential Award. He recruits Hispanic and native American students to study mathematics. We thank them for their contributions to America's future. 
During Hispanic Heritage Month we will learn about the colorful and proud heritage of the Hispanic people who are dedicated to their families, communities, and country. And when this month's celebrations have come to a close, let us not forget that the success of Hispanic Americans is critical to the future of the United States.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I supported the amendment offered this week by my colleagues, Senators Durbin and Collins, to eliminate the tax credit for tobacco companies contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
I am amazed at the inventiveness of the process that resulted in this little known provision becoming law. The tax credit was not included in either the balanced budget or taxpayer relief bills that were first considered in the House and Senate. It was not included in the final, conference version of the 1,056-page Balanced Budget Act that the Senate approved on July 31. Instead, it was added to the Balanced Budget Act by means of an amendment quietly slipped into the final, conference version of the 809-page Taxpayer Relief Act, that the Senate passed just hours later on the same day. 
This $50 billion giveaway was never discussed or reviewed in an open, public forum, but was added at the eleventh hour, in a conference meeting behind closed doors. This is not the way the Congress should conduct the people's business. 
Not only did this unnecessary and undeserved multi-billion-dollar tax credit bypass the normal and appropriate procedures of both Houses of Congress, it also ignored the good intentions of both the Senate and House to provide health care to our Nation's children. This tax break would give the tobacco industry a share of the $50 billion raised from increased tobacco excise taxes, instead of protecting those funds to fund new children's health care initiatives. This tax break would benefit the tobacco industry by shortchanging an important and widely supported public health initiative. 
The overwhelming vote to repeal this unwarranted tax credit demonstrates clearly that the majority in the Senate did not intend to give a $50 billion tax break to tobacco companies, instead of providing funds to meet the health care needs of approximately 10 million uninsured children in our country. Congress intended to, and did, gradually raise the tax on tobacco products by 15 cents, to provide much-needed funds for health insurance for uninsured children. 
I am very concerned that the tobacco tax credit provision that was inserted into the Balanced Budget Act was an attempt by some to begin drafting tobacco liability settlement legislation before Congress has had an opportunity to carefully review the proposed settlement. The provision the Senate voted to repeal would have credited a portion of the increased tobacco excise taxes toward liability payments the tobacco companies could be required to make under legislation implementing the settlement. Clearly, this is inappropriate since Congress is still conducting a thorough examination of the settlement and has not reached a consensus on this matter. 
While Congress continues to examine the multibillion-dollar litigation settlement between the tobacco industry and several States, we need to remain mindful that the 
most important aspect of these discussion is public health, particularly the welfare of our children. By approving the Dubin-Collins amendment and repealing the tax break to tobacco companies, Congress sent a clear message to the American public that their health and well-being is the priority in the complex tobacco settlement discussions. Supporting the Durbin amendment returns $50 billion to the general Treasury while protecting the $24 billion necessary for funding the children's health care initiative. 
We need to carefully examine utilizing the funds returned to the treasury as financial support for various public health initiatives. Particularly, we need to discuss using these funds for developing initiatives which would provide our children with the appropriate guidance and information regarding the potential health dangers associated with tobacco products. It is imperative that we create educational campaigns which utilize a variety of tools including advertisement, special events, and public service campaigns. By disseminating the appropriate information to the public, specifically children, we could significantly raise awareness on the perils associated with smoking. 
History demonstrates that anti-smoking campaigns, particularly on television and the radio can serve as strong disincentives for smoking. During the late 1960's, the Federal Communications Commission mandated televised antismoking messages to counter the tobacco advertising which was filling the television airwaves. Anti-smoking advertisements and public service announcements caused a decline in the number of smokers in the country. However, in 1971, the FCC implemented a ban on radio and television advertisement. Since implementation of that ban, antismoking campaigns have also declined. 
As chairman of the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over many aspects of the tobacco settlement, I have already held one hearing on the settlement and fully intend on holding more hearings in the near future. Specifically, I intend to hold a hearing regarding the impact of television and radio messages in the antismoking campaign. I believe it is important to hold a hearing which examines the role of various media in the campaign to raise public awareness regarding the dangers associated with tobacco products, especially for the Nation's children. 
Mr. President, it is important that we continue to give all aspects of the proposed tobacco settlement careful and coordinated consideration. At the same time, we need to remain mindful that a very important goal of any settlement ought to be the protection of the health and welfare of our children and the general public.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I noted several of my colleagues, a number of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, signed a letter this morning concerning campaign finance reform and a number of them came and spoke about the urgency of the issue. Obviously, we welcome that activity. But I want to point out, and point out in the strongest possible terms, that this issue has to be brought up in a bipartisan fashion. It is not 51 votes that are necessary in order to pass any legislation through this body on an issue of this importance, it is going to be 60 votes. 
I have been working with the majority leader in a most cooperative fashion on this issue. I believe that we can reach an agreement which would be satisfactory to all parties. I do not believe it will be helpful, in any way, to divide up on party lines on this issue. 
I again thank the majority leader but I also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I am confident we can move forward on this issue.

Mr. McCAIN. Does that not mean then that the language of the amendment would be changed to say, on line 4, `of Health and Human Services may carry out activities' and then on line 9 would say, `The Secretary of Health and Human Services may carry out the following'? Would that not be the change that would provide this to be done at the discretion of the Secretary, because presently the copy of the amendment I have says `shall,' which does not provide discretion for the Secretary. It just says `shall.' 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-mccain-az-3-19970910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. McCAIN. OK. Then the fact is it is not at the discretion of the Secretary when it says `shall.' The reality is that when it says `shall' in the amendment, it means there is no discretion involved. 
In fact, $1 million goes to Atlanta, GA, is exactly what this amendment means. The Senator from Georgia knows very well that I have for 11 years opposed this kind of earmarking, and I intend to oppose it now. But let us not have the Senate be deceived by what the Senator from Georgia just said. The discretion of the Secretary is not the case. There is no discretion when the amendment says `shall.' 
If the Senator from Georgia would be willing to change that word to `may,' then I would be more than happy not only to agree with the amendment but support it. The fact is that now it means that $1 million to fund ongoing research to detect E. coli, or prevent E. coli in live cattle only goes to one place and that happens to be, by coincidence, in Atlanta, GA, which is something 
I strongly object to. If this kind of practice goes on and continues, we will see the unbridled earmarking of funds for specific projects in specific places, which the American people rejected in concept. There is an authorization process and there is an appropriations process. This meets neither one of those criteria. 
I understand that the Senator from Georgia will carry this amendment overwhelmingly. I also support the research for detection and prevention of E. coli and infections. It is a worthy cause. There is a system and procedure that we go through, which the Senator from Georgia is violating grossly with this amendment, and therefore I will ask for a rollcall on this amendment. I fully expect it to carry overwhelmingly in his favor, but I wanted the Senator to know that I am deeply disappointed that he will not change the language of this amendment to the proper form which is `may' rather than `shall.' 
So, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment eliminates the financial incentive payments created under the Balanced Budget Act for teaching hospitals to reduce their medical residency program. The Federal Government has created an incentive program which gives hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars to teaching hospitals for not training medical students. 
Mr. President, I strongly suggest if this amendment is defeated, which I guess in all likelihood it probably will be, that we now propose amendments that would restrict the number of graduates of law school. Most Americans believe there are too many lawyers, although probably the majority of my colleagues would not agree. Perhaps we should put a cap on the number of graduates of journalism school. Clearly there are way too many people in that business. And maybe we should also cap the number of graduates of photography school. That would cut down on the paparazzi and the problem we have there. 
Mr. President, this is not a Republican or Democrat difference. This is capitalism versus socialism. Vladimir Lenin would be proud of this proposal for government control, government planning, and, frankly, it is remarkable that we would have included it even in the way in which it was included in the Balanced Budget Act, which was over 1,000 pages, and we had less than 24 hours to review the final draft. 
It is just remarkable. It is a new subsidy program. I would like to read a couple of quotes. My friend from Texas wants to speak on it, so I will be fairly brief. The payment represents a rare attempt by the Federal Government to use subsidies as leverage to shrink a particular work force. `I know of no profession where there has been as much federal effort to regulate,' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. `You don't do it for economists, for architects, for engineers.' 
`It is voluntary, but it isn't voluntary for the taxpayers,' said the Heritage Foundation. 
The National Taxpayers Union supports Senator McCain's amendment to eliminate the graduate medical education. `We believe it is a wasteful use of taxpayers' dollars.' 
Others question whether it is necessary. The number of young doctors training to become anesthesiologists, for example, has declined from 1,500 three years ago to 450 this year following well-publicized warnings that the field was saturated. Starting a few years ago, `people weren't able to get the plum jobs in the cities they wanted. [They] would have to take jobs in Idaho, Oklahoma,' said James Kottrell, chairman of anesthesiology at the State University of New York Health Center in Brooklyn. 
Mr. President, 46 million Americans are underserved in health care today in America. That is a fact and everyone knows it. So now we are going to pay teaching universities hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' dollars not to train doctors that are needed.

Mr. McCAIN. Reading from the editorial: 
Don't expect anything but a hemorrhage at the Treasury from that new program to counter the doctor surplus by paying hospitals to reduce the number of residency slots for the final phase of medical training. 
Reminiscent of the agricultural-support schemes that paid farmers for not growing crops, the medical plan was inspired by an immutable law of American medical practice: More doctors mean more medical spending, despite the penny-pinching tactics of managed care. So, stop them before they can start hustling patients, the Washington strategists concluded. The medical-education industry, however, is too profitable, inventive and resilient to yield to that tactic. 
The major factor in the medical-production pipeline is medical-school enrollments. And data compiled by the American Medical Association show that these have remained virtually unchanged for more than 15 years, as have the number of medical schools. * * * * * 
The big change in medical education was a vast increase in revenues, much of it from so-called practice plans that pay medical faculty for attending to patients, usually in conjunction with teaching duties. Over the past decade, this income total for faculty at the 124 schools has risen from $5.2 billion to $10.6 billion. 
And, in accord with the Willie Sutton principle, the number of full-time faculty has soared, though the number of students remains almost unchanged. In 1983-84, the nationwide faculty totaled 56,564. In the current academic year, the number of faculty members is 95,568. 
Where are they coming from? To a large extent they were already there at the university on other payrolls, and were switched to the more bountiful cash flow of medical education, which draws on patient fees, federal research, and ample loans to finance runaway tuition fees--to be repaid by high medical income. 
A little-known fact of American higher education is that the highest paid people on many prestigious campuses are not university presidents. The big bucks go to the medical school professors. At Columbia University, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the president was paid $317,187 in 1994-95, while one professor of surgery received $1,526,397 and two others took in more than $1 million apiece. 
Mr. President, I will not complete the article. The medical education industry is too smart and well connected to be deprived from its golden goose. 
Mr. President, let me read from a quick letter that we got from the Taxpayers Foundation. This is directed to the Secretary of Agriculture. 
Dear Sir: My friends, Wayne and Janelle, over at Wichita Falls, Texas, received a check the other day for $1,000 from the government for not raising hogs. So, I want to go into the `not raising hogs' business myself next year. 
What I want to know is, in your opinion, what is the best type of farm not to raise hogs on, and what is the best breeding hogs not to raise? 
The story goes on and on. 
I want to be sure that I approach this endeavor in keeping with all government policies. I would prefer not to raise Razor hogs, but if that is not a good breed not to raise, then I can just as easily not raise Yorkshires or Durocs. 
As I see it, the hardest part of this program is keeping an accurate inventory of how many hogs I haven't raised. My friend Wayne is very excited about the future of this business. He has been raising hogs for 20 years and the most he ever made was $420 in 1978, until this year, when he got your check for $1,000 for not raising hogs. 
Mr. President, the letter goes on. 
If I can get $1,000 for not raising 50 hogs, will I get $2,000 for not raising 100 hogs? I plan to operate on a small scale at first, holding myself down to about 4,000 `not raised' hogs, which will give me $80,000 income the first year. Then I can buy an airplane. Now, another thing: these hogs I will not raise will not eat 100,000 bushels of corn. I understand that you also pay farmers for not raising corn and wheat. Will I qualify for payments for not raising wheat and corn not to feed the 4,000 hogs I am not going to raise? I want to get started not feeding as soon as possible, as this seems to be a good time of the year to not raise hogs and grain. I am also considering the `not milking cows' business, so please send me any information on that also. 
I hope that the Secretary of HHS will be ready to supply various teaching hospitals around America and people who want to go into the teaching hospital business how they can qualify for these hundreds of millions of dollars for not teaching doctors. I believe there will be a lot of entrepreneurs throughout the Nation that will want to qualify for a program that pays them hundreds of millions of dollars for not teaching doctors. 
Mr. President, we will have more debate on this. It is a serious issue. I think it is a defining issue as to what we feel is the role of Government in our society. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 5 minutes, and then I hope that the opponents of the amendment will use part of their time because I don't intend to use all of my time since I would like to save some time at the end. 
Mr. President, there is going to be a budget point of order. I will respond to that at the right time. I remind my colleagues that the provision contained in the Balanced Budget Act was not contained in the balanced budget bill passed by the full Senate. The full Senate never had the opportunity to review this provision. Not only did the Senate not have the opportunity to debate this provision when we considered the budget bill in June, we were not given sufficient time to clearly examine the budget bill after conference. 
The Balanced Budget Act is over a thousand pages, and we had less than 24 hours to review the final draft after receiving it from the conferees. Mr. President, it is also well known that a provision originally was going to be included that would affect only the State of New York, and then it was expanded to the entire country. 
Mr. President, I just read a very amusing--at least to me --letter from a fellow that wanted to not raise hogs or not grow grain. I have been amused somewhat by this proposal that we would pay teaching hospitals not to teach, or pay farmers not to grow, or to pay anybody not to do something. It is somewhat amusing, but at the same time, occasionally in this debate we should focus on the fact that there are 46 million Americans who still lack access to doctors and medical care in America. 
Here we have a situation where, according to the Health and Human Services Department, 46 million Americans don't have access to health, doctors, and medical care, yet, now we are going to restrict the supply of doctors in America. It flies in the face of every fundamental belief that I have, ranging from what capitalism and the free enterprise system is all about to what our obligations as a society are. 
If we are going to restrict the number of doctors, how in the world are we supposed to take care of these 46 million Americans who live in rural communities and inner-city neighborhoods and have shortages of physicians and health care professionals? The very poorest people in America, Mr. President, are the ones who don't have health care, and now we are going to deprive them of the possibility of treatment? 
There are programs that serve underserved areas, including the National Health Service Company, Area Health Education Centers, Interdisciplinary Training for Health Care in Rural Areas, Community Health Center, Migrant Health Centers, and the Health Professions Work Force Development Program. 
I hope that my colleagues will join me in rejecting this proposal that somehow we are helping Americans by restricting the number of doctors. Mr. President, in its own bizarre fashion, the CBO is claiming this will cost the American taxpayers money. I find it bizarre. I find it incredible. And the fact is that if we are now going to accept the assumption of the CBO that we save money by not having teaching hospitals teach, then clearly we can save money by not having other organizations in America that receive Federal subsidies do their job as well. 
It seems that it is only the medical profession that seems to be able to get away with this. 
By the way, Mr. President, this experiment `* * * will pay hospitals in the State'--the State of New York, not the entire country but just in the State of New York--`$400 million over the next several years, while they gradually decrease the number of young doctors they train.' 
My understanding is that there will be no change for the first 2 years of this. 
That experiment `* * * drew an outcry from teaching hospitals elsewhere that felt New York had wrangled a lucrative special deal. Their protests attracted the sympathy of congressional Republicans who decided that, instead of trying to block money for New York, they would expand the opportunity nationwide.' 
To quote further:  
The payments represent a rare attempt by the Federal Government to use subsidies as leverage to shrink a particular work force. `I know of no profession where there has been as much Federal effort to regulate,' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. `You don't do it for economists, for architects, for engineers.' 
The payments also are the government's first effort to constrict the pipeline of people entering the medical profession. Several influential groups have warned lately that the nation has too many doctors, particularly specialists, and have urged the federal government to impose limits on the number of recent medical school graduates, known as residents, who pursue several years of advanced training before beginning to work on their own. But until now that advice has met with legislative resistance. 
The New York experiment and the nationwide initiative hinge on changes in Medicare, the largest federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Since it began, Medicare has underwritten residency training programs heavily and has, in effect, made residents a prized, inexpensive kind of labor for their hospitals. Taxpayers spend $7 billion a year on such training. 
Until now, many teaching hospitals have been reluctant to cut back, because every resident translates into an average subsidy of $100,000 a year. `It has not been financially rewarding to downsize,' said Muncey Wheby, associate dean for graduate medical education at the University of Virginia. 
Under the budget agreement, hospitals that downsize will not get extra money outright. But if they volunteer to reduce their residency programs by 20 percent or 25 percent over five years, Medicare will cushion the financial blow. For the first two years, it will pay the whole subsidy for the missing residents. After that, the payments will taper off for three years. 
The agreement also for the first time essentially forbids hospitals to increase the sizes of their residency programs. 
Mr. President, the article goes on with other suggestions: 
But others suggest that hospitals will be rewarded needlessly for cutbacks that some have started to make without being paid to do it. Some say the initiative is the medical equivalent of discredited agricultural programs that have paid farmers not to grow certain crops. 
`I don't know where the hell as Republican Congress gets off doing labor force planning for the medical profession,' said Robert E. Moffit, deputy director for domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. `As an economic principle, it is absurd.' 
How many physicians the nation produces has important effects on the cost of the health care system. The greater the number of doctors, research has shown, the more medical tests and expensive specialty treatment patients tend to receive, because physicians find subtle ways to keep themselves employed. 
With more than 700,000 physicians, the United States has more doctors per capita than virtually any other country. In particular, it has a vast supply of specialists, who are starting to find themselves in less demand as more patients are insured through `managed care' plans that favor treatment by lower-cost medical generalists. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 1 minute, and I will then yield the Senator from Texas the remaining time. 
Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico asked where would we be if my amendment is adopted? We would not be in the business of paying people not to do things. We would not be, through central planning and pure socialism, deciding what the supply of doctors in this country is when there are 46 million Americans that do not receive health or medical care in America today. That is an outrage and an insult. 
We spend our time fighting on the floor of this Senate about appropriating more money to take care of health care for kids, more money to take care of health care for elderly Americans. How in the world are we going to do that if we don't have enough doctors? The fact is that the Senator from New Mexico asked where would we be? At least we would not be in the bizarre and incredible situation where we are paying schools not to do anything. 
We tried this with the agriculture program, Mr. President. We tried it before, paying people not to grow crops. It doesn't work. You don't adjust people's behavior by doing such things and, believe me, this amendment, this provision--I allow myself additional 30 seconds--I want to point out again the process that this went through. Never a word of debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate on the Balanced Budget Act. I don't know what in the world this has to do with balancing the budget, but what it had to do with was a provision that was stuck in on the House side and, in less than 24 hours, we had to examine a 1,000 page document which clearly nobody on this floor today, with the exception of the Senator from New Mexico, had a chance to examine or debate. This is not the right way to legislate. This is not the right way to conduct our business in America. 
I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Texas.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am astounded and very pleased to note that the FY 1998 Labor/HHS appropriations bill is nearly devoid of any pork-barrel language, at least in the bill itself. After careful scrutiny of the measure, I have found only one section of the bill which is clearly pork. That is section 506, which contains the language on Buy America set-asides that appears to be standard practice in this year's appropriations bills. 
Other than these Buy America provisions, which I continue to strenuously oppose, I can find no other egregious examples of pork-barrel spending in the bill language. For this restraint, I thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator Specter, and the members of the Appropriations Committee. 
Unfortunately, the report does contain a number of earmarks of funds for location-specific, unauthorized, or simply wasteful projects. And it contains, of course, language that is intended to have essentially the same effect as an earmark; by this, I mean the use of words like `encourage', `urge', and `carefully consider' in connection with references to particular institutions, projects, or proposals that the committee would obviously like the relevant agencies to fund. These are not earmarks, but I am sure the programs which the committee encourages or urges the agencies to support will receive special consideration.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation to establish a National Environmental Technology Achievement Award. 
The annual award would be presented jointly by the EPA and the Department of Commerce to recognize our Nation's premier environmental technology advancement. Specifically, the award would recognize the major technological improvements in the prevention and cleanup of threats to the Nation's air, land, and water resources. The yearly prize would include a financial award to be raised from the private sector. 
In order to achieve our Nation's environmental protection goals in the face of a growing population and expanding economy, we must develop more efficient and effective technologies to reduce and cleanup pollution, including advanced smokestack emission controls, improved water treatment systems, and manufacturing processes which reduce waste, just to name a few. 
While the financial rewards for developing such technology are presumably large, a national award would provide additional incentive to innovators and would highlight the importance of such advancements to our Nation. 
The bill would create a 14-member volunteer board to set the award criteria; design the award; establish a monetary prize; raise funds; develop a consideration and selection process; and select the annual recipient. 
The board would be comprised of the Administrator of EPA, Secretary of Commerce, National Science Advisor, Director of the National Science Foundation, Secretary of the Interior, or their designees. In addition, the panel would include three representatives from academia; three representatives of industry; and three representatives from environmental and conservation organizations. One in each category would be chosen by the President, one by the Speaker of the House and one by the majority leader of the Senate. 
The bill is supported by the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Parks, and Conservation Association; the World Wildlife Fund and other environmental groups. I urge my colleagues to support this simple, but I believe appropriate and helpful, initiative.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would like it known I also have one other amendment that I want to have considered by the Senate on this legislation. I will wait before proposing that amendment, but make it clear I do have another one. 
Madam President, I also intend to ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment. I understand there is still some uncertainty as to when a vote will be held on this particular amendment. 
Madam President, I rise, with my colleague, Senator Phil Gramm, to offer an amendment that would eliminate the financing incentives created in the Balanced Budget Act for teaching hospitals to reduce their medical residency programs. This new program will make teaching hospitals eligible for hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars for not training medical students. Let me repeat that, Madam President. Under the Balanced Budget Act, which we voted on before we went into the August recess, a program was created that would make teaching hospitals eligible for hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars for not training medical students--not for training medical students, but for not training medical students. In short, the Federal Government will pay hospitals for doing nothing. 
Unbeknownst to most of my colleagues when we considered and voted for the Balanced Budget Act, that legislation created yet another wasteful, unnecessary, and inappropriate Federal subsidy program. This newly created subsidy is no different from the wasteful agricultural subsidy programs which pay farmers millions of dollars not to grow certain crops or to reduce their production of a certain crop. This is wasteful and a blatant misuse of taxpayers' funds. 
Proponents of the new incentive program argue that there is an overabundance of medical doctors, particularly specialists, in this country. They believe that providing financial incentives to hospitals to reduce the number of medical students is a solution to the supposed glut of physicians in our country. Madam President, it springs to my mind that there is an argument that is being made by a lot of us today who are not members of the legal profession that the same problem exists in that the country has too many lawyers. I wonder if in the next Balanced Budget Act agreement, we are going to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to law schools, because we have an overabundance, not to teach lawyers. I might say, Madam President, as a personal preference I might lean toward that program more than the one that we have just enacted in the Balanced Budget Act. 
Let me also just point out here, the Berlin wall fell. Socialism, that is communism, is a failure. It is only in Communist countries where they pay people not to do things. This might have been a great idea in North Korea, Cuba, or perhaps some other countries in the world, but certainly not in the United States of America should we be paying hundreds of millions of dollars so that we will not train anybody, much less not train doctors. As I will point out later on in my remarks, Madam President, there are 46 million Americans who do not have access to medical care. Yet we are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in order that teaching hospitals will not teach--will not teach. 
It is not the role of the Federal Government to determine if we have an appropriate amount of physicians or any other professionals in this country. This subsidy is a misguided attempt by the Federal Government to restrict the career choices available to individual Americans. This program places the Federal Government in control of a specific labor segment in our country and allows the Government to directly restrict the freedom of choice of our citizens who may want to become physicians. 
I have children. Most of the Members of this body have children. If one of my children decides he or she wants to be a physician, should that child be restricted from doing so if otherwise eligible to train as a physician? In a democracy, the Government does not determine the makeup of the labor force or regulate the supply of workers in a specific field. That was done in the former Soviet Union. Demand, not the Government, in a market-driven economy, drives the number of practicing physicians. As the need for doctors increases or decreases, medical schools and teaching hospitals must determine how many applicants to accept and if there is a need for expanding or reduction. 
Government rationing of medical training and ultimately rationing of health care smacks of socialism not democracy. 
Second, Federal subsidies don't work. They cost money and usually don't achieve their stated goals. Every time we have ignored market-based solutions to our Nation's health care problems and called for Government intervention, we have had paradoxical results. In the 1960's, the Government predicted an undersupply of doctors and created incentives for individuals to pursue a medical career. The result was a perceived glut of medical doctors by the late 1970's. 
Third, this new subsidy program totally ignores the needs of 46 million Americans residing in rural communities and inner-city neighborhoods who are faced with a shortage of physicians and health care professionals. While proponents of this initiative argue that our country is producing more physicians than we need, many communities have no resident physicians and have only limited access to trained medical care. 
I am seriously concerned about the disproportionate number of physicians who elect to practice only in urban settings, leaving rural and inner-city neighborhoods underserved and without access to critical medical services. 
A better use of taxpayer dollars might be to strengthen existing programs already in place to increase access to health care providers and services in underserved areas. This includes the National Health Service Corps, Area Health Education Centers, Interdisciplinary Training for Health Care in Rural Areas, Community Health Centers, Migrant Health Centers, and the Health Professions Workforce Development Program. Those are all good programs. I have seen the community health centers in my own State serve people who otherwise would not receive health care. I repeat, 46 million Americans are underserved or not served at all in light of their medical needs. 
Finally, this subsidy will be financed using the Medicare part A trust fund. As we all know, without significant reform to the Medicare system, this trust fund is expected to become insolvent. Using scarce Medicare resources to finance another Government subsidy program is unwise in the near term and unnecessary in the long term if market forces are permitted to determine the need for doctors in this country. 
There is also going to be an argument raised that this would somehow upset the delicate agreement that was made in the Balanced Budget Agreement Act; that somehow this was an ironclad commitment that we would agree to every single aspect of the balanced budget agreement. I want to state right here, what a lot of us did was hold our nose and vote for it. A lot of people didn't vote for it, but a lot of us held our nose because we didn't like a lot of things associated with it. And to say that we should subsidize a program that is pure socialism in the name of preserving the balanced budget agreement, I think, borders on insanity. But yet, strangely enough, Madam President, you will see Senators come to this floor and say that if we vote not to subsidize through hundreds of millions of dollars teaching hospitals not to teach, then somehow it will upset the balanced budget agreement. I find that argument absurd, and we will hear it. 
I understand that there was a request by others to speak against this amendment. I also am not clear as to whether the votes will be held this afternoon or later. 
I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending McCain amendment so that I may present another amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is basically to correct a technical problem that exists. It is to pay the Vietnamese commandos that we authorized by legislation last year. They are a group of Vietnamese soldiers who were recruited and trained by the United States to promote our cause during the Vietnam war. Unfortunately, they were captured soon after their deployment and imprisoned for 20 years for fighting on our side. 
Last year, we passed legislation authorizing payment to the commandos for their sacrifice, $2,000 a year for the 20 years they were detained, for a total of $40,000 each. However, this payment, if interpreted as 1 year's income will disqualify the commandos from Medicaid and other benefits they currently receive, because it ostensibly raises their income beyond the cutoff point for benefits. 
This is a payment accrued to the commandos over the 20-year period during which they were detained. As such, it represents not 1 year's income but an annual payment of $2,000 over 20 years and should not, therefore, disqualify them from Medicaid and SSI. 
Mr. President, we have now placed the commandos in the awkward position of being forced into accepting the funds we rightly owe them or maintaining their eligibility for needed benefits. This amendment, by myself and Senator Kerry, simply states the $40,000 payment to each commando will not disqualify him from the various welfare benefits he currently receives. This measure has no cost and merely ensures the commandos don't lose the benefits they already receive. 
We are in debt to these men for their wartime sacrifices, and we cannot compensate them with one hand while we take away their benefits with the other. 
I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this measure to make sure the commandos are not unjustly penalized for accepting the accumulated payment our country rightly owes them. I hope this will be a routine amendment. I yield the floor.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, with the help of a telesensory screenpower Braille display and a Braille tape on the phone, Marie Blum takes hundreds of customer reservations for Ramada Hotels each day. Blind since birth, Marie's perseverance has brought her to a successful career as a reservations agent for Hospitality Franchise Systems in Phoenix, Arizona. 
`If people would just apply themselves,' says Marie, `they might surprise themselves at what they can really accomplish.' This philosophy and Blum's exemplary work performance brought her recognition from National Industries for the Blind (NIB) as the 1997 Private-sector Employee of the Year. 
Blum, 46, sought to reenter the work force in 1994 upon the death of her husband. Previously a homemaker, Blum needed a way to support both herself and her teenage daughter. She sought training at the work adjustment program at Arizona Industries for the Blind in Phoenix, where she assembled, collated, and packed various products. Just three months later, armed with confidence and new skills, Blum was hired by Laboratory Environmental Support, Inc. where she did production and packaging work. 
A year later, Blum decided to change careers and attended a 10-week unpaid customer service training program offered by Discover Card in conjunction with the group Business Organization Office Services Training (B.O.O.S.T). Again armed with new skills, Blum used her training to land her current job at Hospitality Franchise Systems. 
The Private-sector Employee of the Year award is given annually by NIB. The award recognizes outstanding individuals who receive training and work experience in an NIB associated agency and then enter careers in the private sector. 
National Industries for the Blind is a not-for-profit corporation whose mission is to enhance the economic and personal indepen-dence of persons who are blind, primarily through creating, sustaining, and improving employment. There are 119 independent industries throughout the United States, including Arizona Industries for the Blind, that are associated with NIB. Industries associated with National Industries for the Blind employ people who are blind in manufacturing, office, super-visory, telecommunications, executive positions and other careers. Products and services are provided by NIB-associated agencies to the federal government under the guidelines of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c). These industries also provide vocational training to people who are blind that provides them with the necessary skills to obtain gainful employment within the private sector.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota. He is a man of great spirit, a man of great commitment. When the Senator from Minnesota gets involved in an issue, he is heard from. I believe his involvement in this issue is important and, indeed, critical. I don't think it is inappropriate to mention that the life of the Senator from Minnesota has been touched in the most graphic and dramatic fashion by this disease we are discussing today. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. 
Mr. President, I support Senator Wellstone's amendment. Scientists have made tremendous new discoveries and progress in regard to Parkinson's disease, which clearly illustrates how close we are to finding a cure and treatment for this deadly disease. According to a wide array of experts, we are on the verge of substantial, groundbreaking scientific discoveries in the next few years regarding the cause and potential cure of Parkinson's disease. 
The most recent scientific discovery of a gene abnormality that causes some cases of Parkinson's disease has provided researchers with a powerful new tool for understanding Parkinson's disease. This is the kind of breakthrough that makes a strong case for ensuring adequate funding for Parkinson's research. 
I don't come to the floor very often on a situation like this, but there is a gross inequity here and one that needs rectification. I find it gravely disturbing that despite the significant progress scientists are making in the field of Parkinson's, the National Institutes of Health continuously fail to provide an appropriate amount of funding for Parkinson's research, which is why the Senator from Minnesota and I are here. 
During fiscal year 1996, the National Institutes of Health spent $32 million for direct Parkinson's research. That is about $32 for each of the approximately 1 million Parkinson's patients--$32 for each of the approximately 1 million Parkinson's patients. Compare this to the $2,143 per AIDS victim; $338 per cancer victim; or $200 per breast cancer victim; or $81 per Alzheimer's victim; $74 per heart disease victim, not including the additional funding just adopted as an amendment to this bill. 
Obviously, funding for Parkinson's research is grossly inadequate compared to support which other diseases receive at NIH. By failing to provide scientists with adequate funding, we are potentially letting a cure for this dreadful disease slip further and further into the future. This amendment will ensure that our scientific researchers have available the necessary funding and support to proceed as quickly as possible to combat Parkinson's. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has described what this legislation would do, including the establishment of 10 Morris K. Udall Centers for Research on Parkinson's Disease throughout the Nation, create a national Parkinson's disease clearinghouse and other things. 
Approximately 1 million Americans are afflicted with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's is a debilitating, degenerative disease which is caused when nerve centers in an individual's brain lose their ability to regulate body movements. People afflicted by this disease experience tremors, loss of balance and repeated falls, loss of memory, confusion and depression. Ultimately, this disease results in total incapacity of an individual, including the inability to speak. This disease knows no boundaries, does not discriminate and strikes without warning. 
This amendment is supported by the National Parkinson's Foundation, the American Parkinson's Disease Association and Parkinson's Action Network. These organizations, as well as many other individuals involved in grassroots support activities, have worked long and hard to achieve widespread support for this authorization bill in both the House and Senate. 
The Mo Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act, which is the basis for this amendment, has 64 cosponsors in the Senate and approximately 240 cosponsors in the House. Mr. President, we cannot afford to lose this opportunity to continue the momentous progress in finding the cause for a cure for this terrible illness. On behalf of the millions of Americans afflicted with Parkinson's and their families and friends, I urge my colleagues to support this measure. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hatch be added as an original cosponsor of the amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, finally, I would like to thank the people that I mentioned earlier--the National Parkinson's Foundation, the American Parkinson's Disease Association, and Parkinson's Action Network. Without the help of these organizations, we would not be here today. 
Finally, I know sometimes amendments have a tendency to be dropped in conference. The Senator from Minnesota and I feel very strongly about this amendment, and that is why we feel it is necessary that we have a rollcall vote on this issue. I hope that the managers of the bill will see the way clear to preserve this amendment in conference, as it is supported by, as I mentioned, now 65 of our colleagues in the Senate and over 240 Members of the House. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the conference agreement to H.R. 2014 includes a provision to provide Amtrak up to $2.3 billion during the next 2 years. This funding provision would be provided in the form of tax credits. While I have already made my concerns known regarding this provision, I note that it would require enactment of reform legislation prior to the Treasury providing these credits to Amtrak. 
As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over Amtrak, I would like to ascertain for the record what the authors of this tax credit provision envision would constitute reforms. Since I was not a conferee, I would appreciate the majority leader clarifying this matter and explaining the conferees intent.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader for his comments. From your description, the reforms you envision to release this new funding for Amtrak are the type of reforms included for in S. 738, the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997. That bill, sponsored by the Chairwoman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee, Senator Hutchison, was approved by the Commerce Committee on June 26, 1997. I note that the sponsor of S. 738 is on the floor. I would like to ask what her intentions are for moving that bill.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader and Senator Hutchison for clarifying this issue. The reform language in this tax bill linked to the release of tax credits clearly means comprehensive, substantive, meaningful reforms to ensure Amtrak operates more efficiently and to set up a process that will protect taxpayers if Amtrak does not meet its financial goals. Let there be no misunderstanding. There will be no new funding provided to Amtrak until we first enact legislation providing operational, labor and liability reforms. The hard working men and women whose tax dollars are subsidizing Amtrak deserve to have their contributions invested as responsibly as possible. I stand ready to work with the majority leader and the subcommittee chairman to bring this reform measure before the full Senate.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Roth, Senator Domenici, Senator Moynihan, and especially our leader for this landmark agreement. 
However, I wish to remark on the conference agreement provision that gives $2.3 billion to Amtrak under the guise of so-called tax relief. Mr. President, this has got to be called the great train robbery. It used to be in the Old West that the outlaws took money from the trains. Now the trains are taking money from the taxpayers--$2.3 billion. The James boys, Jesse and Frank, did not have the imagination that this incredible scheme does. It is not to be believed. 
Do you know how they are going to get that $2.3 billion, Mr. President? They are going to get it with a $2.3 billion tax break in taxes they never paid. Amtrak has never paid any taxes. In fact, they have lost $20 billion since they came into being. They have lost $20 billion. Now we are going to take tax relief from the freight trains that used to run prior to Amtrak ever coming into existence. 
Mr. President, this is most bizarre. I have only been here 10 years, and I am sure some bizarre and Orwellian things have happened, but this is the most bizarre thing I have ever seen. The only thing, the only thing I think that saves this is that Congress, the leader and others have demanded that reform be part of the package. And our friends on the other side of the aisle, rather than grabbing ahold of this greatest sweetheart deal in history, won't even agree to reforms. Right now, if you are laid off from Amtrak, you stay for 6 years on the payroll, and our friends will not even agree to doing away with that incredible, incredible, unbelievable break. 
Now, I guess this provision that unless reform is agreed to this bailout--bailout is not the word. My vocabulary does not encompass the ability to describe what we are doing here with this $2.3 billion to Amtrak--$2.3 billion. Not a single reform. And I thank Senator Hutchison of Texas who has worked hard on this issue and many others, but I well tell you, Mr. President, I am going to vote for this bill, but I hope and pray we never see anything like this great train robbery ever again. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to honor the passing of one of the world's most renowned scientists. Eugene Shoemaker and his wife Carolyn, both residents of Flagstaff, AZ, were involved in a tragic car accident in Central Australia on July 18, 1997. Gene was fatally injured; Carolyn survived the accident sustaining broken ribs, a broken wrist and a dislocated shoulder. They were in the field pursuing their lifelong passion of geologic studies to help understand impact craters. 
`Gene' is credited with having almost single-handedly created planetary science as a discipline distinct from astronomy. He brought together and applied geologic principles to the mapping of planets, which resulted in more than three decades of discoveries about the planets and asteroids of our Solar System. He was the recipient of the 1992 National Medal of Science, the most prestigious scientific honor bestowed by the President of the United States, then George Bush. 
As a resident of Flagstaff, AZ, Gene invented the Branch of Astrogeology within the U.S. Geological Survey and established the Field Center in Flagstaff in 1965. After retiring from the USGS in 1993, he joined Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff. The culmination of his work came in 1993 when Gene was recognized worldwide for discovering, with his wife Carolyn and colleague David Levy, a comet near Jupiter. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was broken up by tidal forces from Jupiter, and fragments collided with the planet in July 1994. 
Gene and his wife, Carolyn, a planetary astronomer, were a close devout couple. Their work together was recently captured in a 1997 National Geographic documentary `Asteroids: Deadly Impact.' As a unique team, they initiated the Palomar Planet-crossing Asteroid Survey in 1973, and the Palomar Asteroid and Comet Survey in 1983. They were the leading discovers of comets in this century. 
Dr. Edward Bowell, an astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ, said: `Gene practically single-handedly `invented' our knowledge of the impacts of comets and asteroids on Earth and in the solar system in general. He was a renaissance man, having one of the broadest grasps of any scientist I know, working as a geologist, training to be an astronaut, dating the surfaces of the Moon and other satellites, and helping, with his wife Carolyn, discover more interesting comets and asteroids than any other person. I am stunned to think of the store of unique knowledge that has perished with him. As a scientific colleague and friend, his guidance was unerring and will be irreplaceable.' 
As Senator from the State of Arizona and chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I would like to express my sorrow on the loss of this great man and scientist. His contributions to the field of science are duly noted by myself and others in the science community.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with the sad mission of reporting the loss of a truly outstanding naval officer, Capt. Carlton A. Simmons, Jr. He passed away on July 14 after a long illness and was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery on July 22. 
A native of North Dighton, MA, and a 1974 graduate of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Captain Simmons was commissioned an ensign in 1975. Following designation as a naval aviator in 1977 and qualification in the A-7E Corsair, he served with Attack Squadron 22, completing two deployments to the western Pacific. 
Followon tours of duty included an exchange assignment with the Air Force, flying F-16 Falcons with the 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron; and duty as flag secretary to the commander, Middle East Force in Manama, Bahrain. Later, after training in the F/A-18 Hornet, he served with Strike Fighter Squadron 113. 
A superb leader, the Navy entrusted Captain Simmons with three command assignments--the Strike Fighter Weapons School, Pacific Fleet; Strike Fighter Squadron 25; and the F/A-18 Fleet Readiness Squadron, Strike Fighter Squadron 125. While commanding officer of VFA-125, the squadron earned the Chief of Naval Operations Aviation Safety Award for surpassing 70,000 accident-free flight hours; and Personal Excellence Partnership Program awards from the Chief of Naval Operations and the State of California. 
Captain Simmons also served a 22-month tenure in Washington as the Strike Warfare and Naval Aviation Programs Congressional liaison officer in the Navy Office of Legislative Affairs. In this capacity, Captain Simmons provided members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the professional and personal staffs, and many of you, with timely support regarding Navy plans and programs. His contributions enabled Congress and the Navy to work closely in ensuring the Nation possessed a modern and capable naval force. 
During his illustrious career, Captain Simmons was the recipient of many awards and commendations including the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal with Gold Star, and the Navy Commendation Medal with Gold Star. 
Mr. President, Captain Simmons, his wife Carol, and their daughters Erin and Stacey, made many sacrifices during his long career. It is indeed tragic that he has been taken from his family, the Navy, and the Nation he so selflessly served. His courage and fortitude marked him as a great patriot. He will be sorely missed.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate our leader, Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, our colleagues in the House, our colleagues in the other party, and all those who worked so diligently to hammer out the details of these agreements. I admit that I was somewhat skeptical that the Congress and the Clinton administration could come to an agreement on these two very important bills. While I have some concerns about certain aspects of these measures, I am pleased to be able to support the legislation. 
These two bills will put our Nation back on the road to Federal responsibility. The Balanced Budget Act will reduce Federal spending by $270 billion over the next 5 years, eliminating our annual deficits and resulting in a balanced budget by the year 2002. At the same time, we are providing $96 billion in much-needed tax relief over the next 5 years. 
Mr. President, our Founding Fathers recognized the basic principle that the Federal Government must not spend beyond its means. Thomas Jefferson said, `We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.' Unfortunately, we have strayed far from Mr. Jefferson's wise advice. 
Today, our Nation is burdened with a national debt in excess of $5.3 trillion--or about $20,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. Our debt is still growing by about $4,500 per second--about the same amount it would cost to send three people to a community college. 
Although Congress has talked endlessly about balancing the budget, the budget has not been balanced since 1969. We--the Congress and the President--have ignored our responsibility to put our fiscal house in order, choosing instead to leave future generations of Americans with an overwhelming legacy of debt. 
Because Federal spending has been out of control, the American people have been saddled with an unconscionable tax burden. In 1960, Americans paid approximately one dollar in taxes for every $50 they earned. Today, one out of every three dollars goes to the tax man. These confiscatory tax policies are blatantly unfair to those who work hard to provide for their families. 
The Balanced Budget Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid spending without reducing benefits, provides $24 billion for children's health initiatives, and mandates savings in other Federal programs. It also provides for effective enforcement of the discretionary spending limitations necessary to balance the budget by 2002. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act will ease the unconscionable burden on American taxpayers by reducing estate and capital gains taxes, providing a $500 tax credit for children, and providing more flexibility in Individual Retirement Accounts. Small businesses will gain tax relief by restoring the deductibility of home office expenses and self-employed health insurance costs. These and other provisions will allow Americans to keep more of the their hard-earned dollars, rather than turning them over to pay for a bloated Federal bureaucracy. 
The American people have waited a long time for deficit reduction and tax relief. With this legislation, we are showing the American people that we take our duties seriously, and I am pleased to support these bills. 
Mr. President, there are several matters contained in these bills that I would like to discuss at greater length, some good and some not so good.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Jane Garvey's confirmation as Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA]. It is our responsibility to move forward with this nominee now. The Administration waited at least 7 months to name a successor to former FAA Administrator David Hinson. We cannot afford to let this critical safety post remain vacant any longer. 
Ms. Garvey will be the first FAA Administrator to serve in the five-year term we established in last year's FAA reauthorization bill. The responsibilities and the challenges she faces are daunting. Ms. Garvey needs our full support in meeting these challenges head-on. Both she and the traveling public deserve no less. 
My reservations about Ms. Garvey's abilities are no secret. Her only real aviation experience is a 2-year stint as director of the Boston Logan airport. It is almost unfair for the Administration to have thrust Ms. Garvey into such a highly accountable safety position without requisite aviation expertise. Ms. Garvey's principal area of expertise is surface transportation. Representatives from the highway sector praise her several years of public service, both at the Massachusetts Department of Public Works and as Assistant Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. 
In both of these positions, Ms. Garvey had responsibilities associated with the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project in Boston. This may be a project that is now proceeding according to schedule, and within revised budget estimates. Let us not forget, though, that the cost estimates for the project have been revised from an estimated $2 billion to a cost that exceeds $10 billion. Federal taxpayers, of course, are picking up most of the tab. I do not hold Ms. Garvey entirely responsible for this boondoggle. Neither do I think she can distance herself entirely from this monument to pork-barrel politics. 
Ms. Garvey's involvement in this project holds particular significance in light of the history of mismanagement of large acquisition projects at the FAA. 
I, obviously cannot, nor do I intend to, credit Ms. Garvey with any of these problems at the FAA. I simply make the point that her association with the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project is not a ringing endorsement of her ability to manage large FAA acquisition programs within budget. 
Much of the FAA's misfortune has been attributed to the culture of its bureaucracy. Ms. Garvey receives high marks for her superior management abilities. Perhaps she is just the breath of fresh air we need at the FAA, to make sure that the Agency remains the premier aviation safety Agency in the world. 
Again, I wish Ms. Garvey every success, and I pledge to do whatever I can to support her in her new role. I urge that we move forward expeditiously in confirming Ms. Garvey as the next FAA Administrator. 
I want to assure Ms. Garvey that the Commerce Committee and the Aviation Subcommittee will be watching very carefully and closely, because she does not come to this job highly qualified, and that was made clear during her hearings. I believe the President of the United States has the ability to nominate people he wants for important positions. I believe, therefore, that we should move forward expeditiously with Ms. Garvey's nomination. At the same time, I have grave and severe reservations. And, also, at the same time, I will do everything I can to see that she succeeds in her new and most daunting task. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand and appreciate Senator Dorgan's concerns. I would disagree with the action of challenging it. The Senator from North Dakota is quite correct in one sense; Federal finagling with the universal service fund ought to raise concerns over any potential impact on the provision of essential phone service to rural and high-cost areas and low-income consumers. 
Mr. President, I think it is important to put its genesis and its likely real life effect into perspective. 
I reluctantly concurred with the last-minute--I emphasize reluctantly--inclusion of this provision in the bill. I am sure I am telling the worst-kept secret in town when I tell you this provision was dreamed up by the Clinton administration and essentially imposed on the Commerce Committee conferees by OMB. It is not a provision we liked and not a provision we wanted, but it was made very clear to us that our failure to include it would likely result in our losing control of the bill. And if this were to occur, the probability was that not only this provision but numerous others that would be worse, such as spectrum fees, would get added to the bill if that happened. 
So including this provision was by far the lesser of two evils. This is particularly so because it is hard to see how this provision is likely to have any real life effect on maintaining essential telephone service. Basically, what this provision does is shift $3 billion in funds between the Treasury and the universal service fund in alternating fiscal years in an attempt to cover a residual $3 billion savings shortfall in the outyears. 
Because industry universal service fund subsidies today total over $6 billion and are projected to soar as high as $12 billion to $20 billion, there can be no doubt that the telephone industry will be financially able to sustain a $3 billion loan for the limited time period prescribed. Similarly, if we really think that the Treasury will not be in a position to repay a $3 billion loan, we have far worse deficit problems than this bill can ever hope to cure. And because the bill explicitly provides that telephone companies may not raise their rates to recover this $3 billion, it attempts to assure that telephone rates will not increase, at least for this reason. 
So, I believe it extremely unlikely that essential telephone service is likely to be hurt in any way by the enactment of this provision. In saying this, however, I do not wish to trivialize the validity of concerns over the Federal Government reaching into private, nongovernmental pockets to help plug a budget hole. That's a terrible precedent to set, regardless of whether it is the universal service fund or the airline safety funds, and I have consistently voted against such schemes in the past. 
I suggest the better remedy is to pass this bill today, then enact new legislation that will prevent this kind of action in the future. We should not risk bringing down this historic agreement because of one such scheme that, however objectionable in concept, will have no practical impact on the public. 
Let me emphasize again, this administration provision is designed to have no adverse effect on the consumer. For the information of my colleagues, I have already stated I will hold conference committee hearings early next year to make sure that we need do nothing more legislatively or in terms of FCC oversight to further assure that the universal service provision before us will not, in fact, cause any loss in essential service or raise telephone rates. 
I want to tell my colleague from North Dakota, we will have hearings. We will take action to make sure that this provision does not raise phone rates nor impair the ability of people to have universal service. I want to point out that the Presiding Officer in the chair, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, also a member of the Commerce Committee, has pledged to do exactly the same. I don't like it. You don't like it. He doesn't like it. In fact, in a rather unusual move, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee was more vociferous in his opposition to this provision than I was. 
So I want to point out I think it is important the Senator from North Dakota raised this concern. I know the Senator from West Virginia has the same concern and will articulate it. But I want to say that we will have hearings. We will do whatever is necessary to make sure this does not impair--either raise phone rates or impair the ability of people to obtain universal service. I also want to reiterate, as did the Senator from North Dakota, it's a lousy way to do business, Mr. President. It's not a good way to do business. But I also, with some sympathy to my dear friend from New Mexico, realize that he was in a position where they were $3 billion short and they had to make it in order to make this budget work. 
So I want to thank my colleague from North Dakota. I want to thank the Senator from Alaska as well, for his commitment to fix this situation. There is, quite simply, no reason to endorse this provision or the kind of tactic it employs. But neither is there any reason to vote against this balanced budget bill because of it. I urge my colleagues to take that into consideration. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my colleagues and I have come to the floor this morning to briefly discuss the issue of campaign finance reform. It is our hope that during the August recess, discussions will progress and a plan developed to bring campaign finance reform before the Senate no later than the end of September. 
Almost daily I have approached the majority leader and told him that we must move forward on campaign finance reform. The leader has been exceedingly gracious and shown much patience in listening to my missives. I want to thank the majority leader for his time and hope that soon, we can come to an agreement for floor time to debate campaign finance reform. 
But I also understand that the leader is under great pressure to move many bills, and may feel constrained to commit at this time. I understand that situation. The leader has to deal with the wishes of 99 other Senators. However, my colleagues and I feel compelled to put the Senate on notice that the time to act on this matter is rapidly expiring. 
We believe that we must begin the debate on campaign finance reform no later than the end of September, and therefore, if we cannot come to some agreement to bring the bill up freestanding, with an up or down vote on the bill itself, we will feel compelled to bring the bill to the floor by offering it as an amendment to some unrelated measure. 
This is not an approach we relish. But we realize that we may have no other choice. 
Delay no longer serves any purpose. Since before the last election, talk of campaign finance reform has dominated the American conversation. The public has a right to have this issue debated. Members have recognized this fact, and as proof of that recognition, have introduced over 70 campaign finance bills. 
I recognize that many of those bills have laudable features. I want to sit down and work with the sponsors of those bills. 
And I further recognize that McCain-Feingold is far from perfect. As I have stated on numerous occasions, we have only two fundamental principles that are nonnegotiable: 
First, we must seek to level the playing field between challengers and incumbents; and 
Second, we must seek to lessen the influence of money in elections. 
All else is negotiable. 
Some of our colleagues in the House have begun discussing a scaled-down version of McCain-Feingold. I welcome those talks and want to state that if that is what is necessary to change our electoral system, then let's move in that direction. 
Fundamentally changing the electoral system in order to restore the faith of the American people in our Democratic Government is our goal. We are open to compromise and negotiation. But we must act soon. It is our duty. 
Last week the Economist published an editorial entitled `The Fear of Foreign Cash.' Although the title is slightly misleading, I would like to quote from this editorial. 
The answer, at least on the strength of the hearings so far, is straightforward: foreign money is worse only because it is not American. And two meanings can be read into that. One is xenophobia: that century-old American fear of little yellow mercenary men, scurrying round now at the behest of a newly menacing power on the world stage. And the second meaning is that foreign money provides a convenient distraction. While it is being comprehensively investigated, with CIA men parked behind screens and giant blow-up charts of the destinations of Mr. Huang's telephone calls, politicians can be left free to attend their dinners, go to their fund-raisers, and continue in all the ways they know best to let their consciences and their legislative proposals be shaped, like warm wax, by the promise of a cheque. 
While Mr. Thompson's hearings have been getting into gear, in other parts of Congress some 57 separate bills to reform campaign finance have been dying for lack of interest. Should anyone really care how good clean American money flows through the machine of American democracy? Well, yes, gentlemen: someone should.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Economist is exactly right. `Should anyone really care how good clean American money flows through the machine of American democracy? Well, yes, gentlemen, someone should.' 
Yes, we should and must. And we will have the opportunity to demonstrate our understanding of this issue when we return from recess. 
Finally, I would like to thank my friend, Russ Feingold, my friend Senator Collins, Senator Cleland, and so many others who have been involved in this issue and have made this a bipartisan issue, and one that I think deserves the attention of the Senate, and I think clearly deserves an answer for the American people. 
Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator Feingold. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have an agreement to move forward on the tuna-dolphin legislation, S. 39, the Snowe-Breaux-Stevens-Kerry, et al., legislation. 
This legislation would implement the International Dolphin Conservation Program. Senator Snowe, who is responsible for this legislation, will soon offer a managers' amendment that will make several changes to the bill. As I stated last week, my consent to modifications was with the stipulation that any changes would not undermine the International Dolphin Conservation Program by causing the signatory nations to dissolve the agreement. 
With the assurances we have received from the President's National Security Adviser that these changes meet that stipulation, I support strongly the managers' amendment. 
Again, Mr. President, this legislation is supported by Greenpeace, the National Wildlife Federation, the World Wild Life Fund, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Center for Marine Conservation.

Mr. McCAIN. The bill, which was approved in the House last year and again last May by overwhelming majorities, would implement the International Dolphin Conservation Program by making basically two changes to U.S. law. First, when the IDCP agreement is officially concluded, it permits the importation of tuna from the Eastern Tropical Pacific as long as dolphin-safe fishing practices are adhered to. Second, it will permit the labeling of tuna from this area as dolphin safe as long as no dolphin were killed or seriously injured during the catch and that science shows no significant adverse impact on dolphins. 
Failure to enact this bill would be a devastating blow to our efforts to protect the marine environment. Without this implementing legislation, current fishing practices will continue, practices which scientists have learned have an adverse impact not only on dolphin but a host of other marine life including sea turtles and bill fish. Foreign fishing companies no longer bound by the international treaty may well resume even more harmful fishing practices which would spell disaster for dolphin. The impact of tuna fishing on dolphin is an international problem which demands an international response. Passage of this legislation will ensure the cooperation of the need to provide meaningful and sustainable protection for dolphin and other marine life. 
Mr. President, I want to again thank Senator Snowe, the chairman of the Ocean and Fisheries Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, Senator Breaux, and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts. They have been working on this legislation for 2 years. Senator Snowe has held numerous hearings, has agreed to a number of compromises, and a number of amendments, and I would like to again congratulate her for her success in reaching agreement on this very difficult and controversial legislation. The enactment of this legislation is a great victory for the environment and the environmental communities and they deserve enormous credit and gratitude. 
I thank the other Senators without whose cooperation passage of this bill would not be possible. I would like to yield to Senator Snowe for her comments including a description of the managers' amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is an error in the statement that I submitted for the Record in introducing S. 1077, a bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The portion of the statement alluding to a new process for the negotiation of gaming compacts was inadvertently included. There is no section concerning compacting in the bill I introduced.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate has now completed action on 9 of the 13 annual appropriations bills that fund the Government and we are now nearing the close of debate on the Transportation appropriations bill. We have completed action on those bills in record time, for which I congratulate the managers of those measures. 
These bills contain many good provisions and generally provide appropriate levels of funding to continue the necessary functions of the Federal Government. 
But, Mr. President, by my reckoning, in the process of acting on these 10 measures, the Senate will have wasted almost $10 billion on wasteful, unnecessary, low priority, pork-barrel projects. This is an appalling waste of taxpayers dollars--almost a billion dollars for every appropriations bill we have considered so far, and we still have three more appropriations bills to go. 
This bill is typical of the types of earmarks and set-asides that members add to the multi-billion-dollars bills. 
This bill and report earmark billions of dollars for specific highways, railroads, bridges, boats, hangers, and even a covered bridge. Yes, a covered bridge. The report earmarks $2 million of Federal highway funds to restore a covered bridge in Vermont. 
The report directs the Coast Guard to buy twice as many coastal patrol boats from the Bollinger Machine Shop and Shipyard in Louisiana as were requested by the Coast Guard--at a cost of $68.1 million for 15 boats. 
Another $4 million is earmarked to renovate a hanger at the Kodiak, AK Coast Guard facility, a project which was not included in the budget request. 
The bill earmarks $26 million to repair three bridges in Hawaii, Louisiana, and Georgia. 
But these are ordinary earmarks of relatively small amounts of money. Let me take a moment to highlight some of the larger set-asides in this bill. 
All of the $76.65 million provided for testing of intelligent transportation systems, none of which was requested, is earmarked; 24 projects in 18 States are listed in the report to receive a share of this $76 million. 
A total of $300 million is earmarked for Appalachian development highway systems--$100 million more than requested by the administration. 
All but $2 million of the $440 million for bus and bus facility discretionary grants is earmarked for specific projects in specific States; 35 States will receive these grants, with Alabama, Missouri, New York, and West Virginia getting more than $25 million each. 
All but $5.8 million of the $780 million for new mass transit facilities is earmarked; 26 of the 40 projects for which funds are specifically set-aside were not even requested by the administration. Of these unrequested projects, Washington State will receive $24 million for a commuter light-rail system; Orlando, FL, will receive another $31.8 million for its light-rail system, in addition to the $2 million provided last year; and New York City will get $50 million for an East Side access project. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the $23.45 million earmarked in this bill for the Pennsylvania Station redevelopment project in New York City will complete the Federal funding share of this project. I would certainly hope that $100 million would be enough to ask the Federal taxpayers to contribute to this $300-plus million project. I strongly suspect, however, that there will be unexpected costs and final details to be completed, and we will see another several million earmarked for this project in next year's bill. 
Finally, the report contains language earmarking just $450,000 for a `transportation emergency preparedness and response demonstration project on the threat of tornadoes in the Southern and Midwestern States.' The report also establishes a requirement that $400,000 of this money is to be used to assist in the `construction and establishment of an underground emergency transportation management center utilizing satellite communications.' 
This sounds to me like a good idea in general, but I am concerned about two things. First, how can this center be established for just $450,000? And second, why did the Committee find it necessary to add a specification that the center `shall be located in a region that is susceptible to tornadoes and at an elevation of over 1,300 feet above sea level * * * and be within reasonably close proximity to military, space and/or nuclear facilities to provide rapid response time (but far enough away to be safe from disaster impacts).' I wonder why the Committee felt it was necessary to be so specific about the location for the center. Why not just put in motion the process to establish a tornado emergency preparedness center, and allow it to be built at the best site to carry out its mission? 
These are only a few of the earmarks and special projects contained in this measure, but I will not waste the time of the Senate going over each and every earmark. 
Mr. President, it is difficult for me to see the logic of wasting $9.9 billion in these 10 appropriations bills, and then hastening to pass a Balanced Budget reconciliation bill to reduce Federal spending. If we could just avoid pork-barrel spending in the first place, we would not have to go through the painful process of eliminating it in later years. 
I hope my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee will not bring appropriations bills back from conference with all of the earmarks and add-ons of both Houses, or we may well find ourselves negating any progress we have made in the reconciliation process toward a balanced Federal budget.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator Inouye, is sponsoring the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act Amendments Act of 1997. I want to associate myself with Senator Inouye's, remarks regarding this legislation and the issue of Indian gaming. I commend Senator Inouye for his outstanding leadership over the years on this complex issue. This legislation is intended to stimulate discussion in the Congress and among the tribes on this important issue. 
The bill I am introducing today would provide for a major overhaul of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. It will provide for minimum Federal standards in the regulation and licensing of class II and class III gaming as well as all of the contractors, suppliers, and industries associated with such gaming. This will be accomplished through the Federal Indian Gaming Regulator Commission which will be funded through assessments on Indian gaming revenues and fees imposed on license applicants. The bill also provides a new process for the negotiation of class III compacts which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate compacts with Indian tribes in those instances where a State chooses not to participate in compact negotiations or where an Indian tribe and a State cannot reach an agreement on a compact. This process is consistent with recent Federal court decisions. 
In addition, the bill is consistent with the 1987 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of California versus Cabazon Band of Mission Indians in that it neither expands nor further restricts the scope of Indian gaming. The laws of each State would continue to be the basis for determining what gaming activities may be available to an Indian tribe located in that State. 
Since the enactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of gaming activity among the Indian tribes. Indian gaming is now estimated to yield gross revenues of about $6 billion per year and net revenues are estimated at $750 million. There are about 160 class II bingo and card games in operation and over 145 tribal/State compacts governing class III gaming in 2 States. Indian gaming comprises about 3 percent of all gaming in the United States. Gaming activities operated by State governments comprises about 36 percent of all gaming, and the private sector accounts for the balance of the gaming activity in the Nation. 
Indian gaming has become the largest source of economic activity for some Indian tribes. Annual revenues derived from Indian agricultural resources have been estimated at $550 million and have historically been the leading source of income for Indian tribes and individuals. Annual revenues from oil, gas, and minerals are about $230 million and Indian forestry revenue are estimated at $61 million. Gaming revenues now equal or exceed all of the revenues derived from Indian natural resources. In addition, Indian gaming has generated tens of thousands of new jobs for Indians and non-Indians. On many reservations, gaming has meant the end of 
unemployment rates of 90 to 100 percent and the beginning of an era of full employment. 
Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, Indian tribes are required to expend the profits from gaming activities to fund tribal government operations or programs and to promote tribal economic development. Profits may only be distributed directly to the members of an Indian tribe under a plan which has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Only a few such plans have been approved. Virtually all of the proceeds from Indian gaming activities are used to fund the social services, education, and health needs of the Indian tribes. Schools, health facilities, roads and other vital infrastructure are being built by the Indian tribes with the proceeds from Indian gaming. 
In the years before enactment of the 1988 act, and even since its enactment, we have heard concerns about the possibility of organized criminal elements penetrating Indian gaming. Both the Department of Justice and the FBI have repeatedly testified before the Committee on Indian Affairs and have indicated that there is not any substantial criminal activity of any kind associated with Indian gaming. Some of our colleagues have suggested that no one would know if there is criminal activity because not enough people are looking for it. I believe that this point of view overlooks the fact the act provides for a very substantial regulatory and law enforcement role by the States and Indian tribes in class III gaming and by the Federal Government in class II gaming. The record clearly shows that in the few instances of known criminal activity in class III gaming, the Indian tribes have discovered the activity and have sought Federal assistance in law enforcement. 
Nevertheless, the record before the Committee on Indian Affairs also shows that the absence of minimum Federal standards for the regulation and licensing of Indian gaming has allowed a void to develop which will become more and more attractive to criminal elements as Indian gaming continues to generate increased revenues. The legislation I am introducing today provides for the development of strict minimum Federal standards based on the recommendations of Federal, State and tribal officials. While Indian tribes or States, or both, will continue to exercise primary regulatory authority, their regulatory standards must meet or exceed the minimum Federal standards. In the event that the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory determines that the minimum Federal standards are not being met, then the Commission may directly regulate the gaming activity until such time as Federal standards are met. In addition, the Commission is vested with authority to issue and revoke licenses as well as to impose civil fines, close Indian gaming facilities or seek enforcement of the act through the Federal courts. 
One of the areas which has caused the greatest controversy under the current law relates to what has come to be known as the scope of gaming. A related issue is the refusal of some States to enter into negotiations for a class III compact and their assertion of sovereign immunity under the 11th amendment to the Constitution when an Indian tribe seeks judicial relief as provided by the act. The bill I am introducing incorporates the explicit standards of the Cabazon decision to guide all parties in determining the permissible gaming activities under the laws of any State. State laws will continue to govern this issue. I have not proposed the preemption of the gaming laws of any State. In most States, the issue of scope of gaming has now been settled through negotiation or litigation. In a few States this issue remains unresolved, but appears headed toward resolution by the courts. 
In the course of our work on the gaming issue in the two previous Congresses, Senators Campbell, Inouye and I advanced various formal and informal proposals for Federal legislation to resolve the scope of gaming issue. In addition, proposals were developed by State and Tribal officials. However, we were never able to develop a consensus on any one proposal. While the Committee on Indian Affairs remains open to suggestions on this issue, it is apparent that obtaining a consensus may not be possible. This may be an area of the law best left to resolution through the courts.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this letter indicates that negotiations we have entered into making changes to the legislation will keep the International Dolphin Conservation Program intact. That has been our sole objective. With the administration's assurance, I believe we are prepared to enter into a time agreement for final passage of the bill. 
Again, President Clinton has asked us to pass this legislation. Greenpeace, the Center for Marine Conservation, the Environmental Defense Fund, the World Wildlife Fund, and the National Wildlife Federation have asked us to pass this bill. My only test for accepting changes to the bill is that the conservation agreement remains intact. 
The agreement, which still must be put into legislative language, lifts the embargo on tuna from the eastern tropical Pacific, and would require the label change after the Secretary of Commerce makes a finding on implementation of the international agreement does not adversely affect dolphin in any substantial way, by a time certain. We have had months of negotiations on this issue. 
Mr. President, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. This agreement would not be where it is today without the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, the subcommittee chairperson, who conducted weeks and months of negotiations on this issue. The Senator from Maine is the one that made this happen. Whenever there is a victory, there are all kinds of people that like to take credit for it. The Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, entered into a months-long series of negotiations, and has accepted amendments and reservations that she would not otherwise want to. I am sorry that the thing that held up this agreement was extreme partisanship, which motivated people to vote for cloture on a bill that the administration and the environmental community supported, and the characterization of this bill as some kind of cave-in is wrong. We demanded that the international signatories would agree to any compromise that was made. That was done so in this bill. There will be, at a time certain, a labeling which will allow this Nation--and the other nations who are signatories--to have the importation of tuna into this country. I am sorry that these issues, which are really in the best interests of the Nation, somehow get politicized so much, as this issue has been. The Senator from Maine has refrained from that all along. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Indiana have made I think a strong and compelling case for this amendment. I am grateful for what they have said and their active involvement in the pursuit of democracy throughout the world. 
The Senator from Kentucky just recently completed action on an appropriations bill here that I think embodies frankly what the National Endowment for Democracy is all about. And of course the Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, is acknowledged throughout the world, not only in this body, but throughout the world as one of the foremost experts on national security issues and foreign affairs. 
Mr. President, I do not want to repeat a lot of the things that have already been said about this issue, except to try to define really what this debate is all about. 
The Senator from North Dakota just talked about the fact that there was no use for this kind of activity by our Government. I understand that. I less understand the Senator from New Hampshire who I have always known to be a person who supported efforts for freedom and democracy throughout the world. 
We have people, Mr. President, like Martin Lee, who everyone recognizes as the voice of human rights and freedom in Hong Kong. He says: 
In Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia and around the world, the struggle to preserve democracy, political freedom and the rule of law is far from being won [is far from being won]. But by supporting key human rights organizations which work for the development of democracy and the preservation of the rule of law and human rights in Hong Kong, the Endowment's work in Hong Kong has had a profound effect at a critical time. 
I do not know if the Senator from Arkansas, who I have debated this issue for several years with, takes the time or the effort or the trouble to hear from people like Martin Lee and Harry Wu, and people who have suffered--who have suffered--on behalf of fighting for human rights and freedom in their countries. 
I wish the Senator from Arkansas would take some time and listen to these individuals, not me, not the Senator from Kentucky, not the Senator from Indiana, but why don't you, I would ask the Senator from Arkansas, listen to people like Martin Lee and Harry Wu, the Dali Lama, the Prime Minister of the National Coalition Government of Burma, the former chief of staff of the President of Chile, the President of Lithuania, the list goes on and on, names that are not known to some in America but are known throughout the world in their struggle for freedom in virtually every part of the world. That is why I am a bit puzzled and confused by the length of this debate and, frankly, the emotion associated with it. 
As has already been noted by the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Kentucky, there is an editorial in the Wall Street Journal this morning. I quote: 
Hong Kong democratic leader Martin Lee, who faces tough battles ahead in coping with Hong Kong's new Beijing landlords, penned a letter to Senator Connie Mack begging him--begging him--to help save the NED. Senator Bob Graham has heard from Sergio Aguayo of the Civic Alliance, which has a strong hand in promoting the multiparty democracy now taking root in Mexico. 
The list goes on and on. 
One achievement of this Ronald Reagan brainchild was to help Poland's Solidarity break the grip of the Soviet Union in the Cold War days. 
It goes on and on. 
Mr. President, as I said, I am not going to take a lot of time. I just want to say as strongly as I can, in the end I think it is fair to say that the opponents of the National Endowment for Democracy are those who define this country only by what we are against and not by what we are for. It is enough for them that the United States opposed communism, and once the threat communism posed to our own security was defeated, they viewed America's role as the champion of liberal democracy to have become an expensive vanity which deserved to disappear with the Berlin wall. 
But such a cramped view of American purpose ignores the service and sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Americans who were ordered into innumerable battles, not just in defense of American security, but of American values. 
It ignores the aspirations of our Founding Fathers who conceived of this Nation as an inspiration for and friend to all peoples who sought their natural right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
It ignores the wisdom of Abraham Lincoln who knew that the outcome of our Civil War would affect the world as profoundly as it affected our own society. And it ignores the generous spirit of Ronald Reagan who believed that supporting the forces of democracy overseas was our abiding moral obligation, just as it was a practical necessity during the cold war. 
I am proud of America's long and successful opposition to communism, but being an anticommunist is not enough. It was never an end in itself. We are all small `d' democrats in our efforts to help secure the blessings of liberty of what truly distinguishes American history from all other nations on Earth. It was necessary to defeat communism to protect the well-being of Americans, but it was also necessary to defeat communism because it threatened America's best sense of itself and our sublime legacy to the world. 
Mr. President, $30 million is a small investment in preserving that legacy. And I ask all my colleagues to keep faith with the many revered Americans who paid a much higher price than that to keep America a beacon light of liberty. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am happy to say that, after reviewing the bill before the Senate, I find relatively few examples of pork-barrel spending. I stress, relatively few, since I can still find a few objectionable provisions in the bill and many in the report. But there are far fewer problems with this bill than the last few appropriations bills we have passed in the Senate. 
This bill contains the usual earmarks for centers of excellence. In particular, bill earmarks $22 million for the East-West Center in Hawaii and $3 million for the North/South Center in Florida. 
These amounts represent a combined increase of $16.5 million above the administration's request. 
Last week, I spoke about the problem of Congress establishing, at taxpayer expense, centers for the study of virtually every subject, irrespective of the availability of research and analysis on those issues already available from existing universities and private research institutions. 
This enormous increase in funding for the East-West and North/South Centers is incomprehensible given the dire state of U.S. diplomatic representation in many of the newly independent countries of the post-cold-war world. They are particularly inexplicable in light of the committee's decision to zero out the funding for the National Endowment for Democracy, a decision which the Senate fortunately reversed earlier today. 
Mr. President, I would not be at all surprised to see in next year's bill funding for a North-by-Northwest Center, perhaps to include a banquet room honoring the last Alfred Hitchcock. 
The bill also contains language that directs the U.S. Marshals Service to provide a magnetometer and not less than one qualified guard at each entrance to the Federal facility located at 625 Silver, S.W., in Albuquerque, NM. I must say that this is perhaps the most specific earmark I have ever seen, even providing an address to ensure the assets are delivered to the proper beneficiaries. 
Once again, though, the Appropriations Committee has contributed a few new and innovative ways to earmark port-barrel spending. 
The most interesting is language that I will call a reverse earmark. The report earmarks $8 million to begin 
addressing the backlog in repair and maintenance of FBI-owned facilities, other than those located in and around Washington, DC and Quantico, VA. I wonder whether my colleagues from this area were aware that they had been singled out for exclusion from an earmark. 
Other report language earmarks are more typical, such as: Various earmarks for southwest border activities, although I note that my colleagues singled out the New Mexico and Texas borders for special attention to combat illegal border crossing and drug smuggling problems. I was of the impression that these problems were prevalent across the entire border with Mexico, including Arizona and California. 
Similarly, the report requires that two-thirds of the additional 1,000 border patrol agents are to be deployed in Texas sectors, with the remaining 300-plus agencies to be scattered across New Mexico, Arizona, or California. The report earmarks $1 million for Nova Southeastern University in Florida for the establishment of a National Coral Reef Institute to conduct research on, what else, coral reefs. And it also earmarks $1 million to the University of Hawaii to conduct similar coral reef studies. I suppose this might be considered a good idea to fund competitive research projects, except these institutions did not have to compete to get these funds, nor will they likely have to compete to continue to receive hand-outs to continue their coral reef research. 
The report contains $410,000 for the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, and $200,000 for the Beluga Whale Commission. It contains $2.3 million to reduce tsunami risks to residents and visitors in Oregon, Washington, California, Hawaii, and Alaska. And it earmarks $88 million in NOAA construction funds for specific locations in Alaska, Hawaii, South Carolina, Mississippi, and other States. 
And finally, this bill contains earmarks for assistance to the U.S. Olympic Committee to prepare for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah. I found $3 million for communications and security infrastructure upgrades, $2 million to formulate a public safety master plan, and language directing that NTIA provide telecommunications support to the Utah Olympics similar to that provided in Atlanta last summer. As my colleagues know, this is just a small portion of the funding we will see channeled to the Utah Olympics. It is in addition to the money included in the supplemental passed earlier this year and in other appropriations bills that have already passed this body. 
While the wasteful spending in this bill is less onerous than in other bills I have seen in the past 2 weeks, I still have to object strenuously to the inclusion of these earmarks and add-ons in the bill. We cannot afford pork-barrel spending, even the amount contained in this bill.

Mr. McCain. Mr. President, This is intended to resolve a potentially serious problem involving foreign children emigrating to the United States for the purpose of being united with their adoptive parents. Quite simply, the amendment urges the Attorney General to exercise that authority to waive vaccination requirements for certain categories of emigres that is part of current law. 
Last year, my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, succeeded in getting passed legislation authorizing the Attorney General to waive the immunization requirements for legal aliens entering the country if medical, moral or religious considerations so warrant. Unfortunately, that authority has not been exercised, despite extenuating circumstances that clearly argue for such a waiver from the immunization requirement. No where is this failure to exercise that authority more damaging than in the area of foreign-borne orphans being adopted by U.S. citizens. 
Neither Senator Kyl nor I would argue that immigrants with serious communicable diseases should be allowed into the United States. What we are saying is that children whose medical conditions cannot be accurately determined without a more thorough examination than can be administered in their home country should not be subjected to vaccinations that may trigger unforeseen reactions, for instance, from allergies to a specific serum. Additionally, other medical conditions may exist that make immunization at a specific time unadvisable, as would be the case with a child suffering from influenza. All this amendment does is tell the Attorney General to do what common sense dictates should be done anyway: not subject children to vaccinations to which their systems may not be immediately adaptable. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It would do nothing that could pose a health risk to the American public; it only eliminates the risk to children, often from countries with far more primitive health care than is available here, of immunizations if their individual medical conditions indicate such treatment would pose a serious risk to the health of the child.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while the leaders are discussing this issue, I will make my brief statement at this time so that we can proceed with the business of the Senate. 
Mr. President, once again, the hard work of Chairman Cochran and Senator Bumpers is readily apparent in this bill and report. I congratulate them for their efforts. 
This is the eighth appropriations bill to come before the Senate in these 2 weeks. And I must say that this bill and report, so far, take the cake for earmarks and set-asides for Members' special interests. 
Most of these earmarks are in the report language and do not, therefore, have the full force of law. But I have no doubt that the Department of Agriculture will feel compelled to spend the funds appropriated to them in accordance with these earmarks. 
These earmarks are the usual collection of add-ons for universities and laboratories, prohibitions on closing facilities or cutting personnel levels, special exemptions for certain areas, and the like. There is little on this list that would surprise any of my colleagues. 
There is, however, a new type of earmark that I do not recall seeing in other appropriations bills. I am referring to the practice of earmarking funds to provide additional personnel at specific locations. For example, in the report: 
$250,000 is earmarked for a hydrologist to work for the Agricultural Research Service on south Florida Everglades restoration; 
$500,000 is earmarked for additional scientists to do research on parasitic mites and Africanized honeybees at the Bee Laboratory in Texas; 
Language specifies funding at fiscal year 1997 levels for the peanut research unit of the Agricultural Research Service in Oklahoma to retain two scientists at the facility; 
Language specifies funding at fiscal year 1997 levels to maintain the potato breeder and small grains geneticist positions at the Agricultural Research Service facility in Aberdeen, ID--the report notes that the current potato breeder is getting ready to retire; 
An additional $250,000 is earmarked for an animal physiologist position at the Fort Keough Laboratory in Montana; 
$1.05 million is added for additional staffing at the Rice Germplasm Laboratory in Arkansas; 
$250,000 is added for additional scientific staffing at the Small Fruits Research Laboratory in Mississippi; 
$250,000 is added to establish a small grains pathologist research position for the Agricultural Research Service in Raleigh, NC; 
Language acknowledges the importance of the horticulturist position specializing in grape production at the Agricultural Research Service station in Prosser, WA; 
$200,000 is added for 21 additional full-time inspectors at agriculture quarantine inspection facilities at Hawaii's airports; 
$200,000 is added for the cattle tick inspection program to ensure current staffing levels are maintained along the border with Mexico; and 
Language recommends continued staffing and operations at the cooperative services office in Hilo, HI.  
Mr. President, I am amazed again. We have found a new way of earmarking. I congratulate the appropriators for doing so. I have never before seen earmarking funds for the hiring of a specialist at a particular job. So I want to again say we have broken a new frontier here and one that I am sure will be emulated by others in the appropriations bills to come.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, H.R. 1119, the House-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act, includes several maritime provisions which are within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Of particular interest are section 1021(b) and title XXXVI of that bill. The House National Security Committee, which has jurisdiction over certain maritime matters in that body, has chosen to attach these maritime authorizations to H.R. 1119 rather than include them in a separate bill. If the Senate amends and passes H.R. 1119, the Commerce Committee will not have the opportunity to consider those maritime provisions which are within its jurisdiction. 
As both the chairman of the Commerce Committee and a member of the Armed Services Committee, I do not wish to either slow the progress we are making on the National Defense Authorization Act or relinquish the Commerce Committee's right to consider maritime authorizations under its jurisdiction. Therefore, I'd like to take this opportunity to discuss these provisions, and the process for addressing similar jurisdictional issues in the future, with Senator Hollings, ranking member of the Commerce Committee; Senator Hutchison, chairman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee; and Senator Inouye, ranking member of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee. 
First, I would like to summarize the maritime authorization provisions of H.R. 1119. Section 1021(b) of the bill would amend title 46, United States Code, to facilitate the scrapping of excess National Defense Reserve Fleet [NDRF] vessels that contain hazardous materials and would amend the National Maritime Heritage Act to extend the authorization for this program an additional 2 years to 2001 to account for the delay in scrapping the NDRF vessels. Section 3601 of the bill would authorize appropriations for the Maritime Administration's expenses for operations and training and under the loan guarantee program authorized by title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, at the levels requested by the President for fiscal year 1998. Section 3602 would repeal the requirement for a now obsolete annual report by the Maritime Administration on regional shipbuilding costs. Section 3603 would amend the Maritime Security Act of 1996 by clarifying that the noncontiguous domestic trade restrictions of that act do not apply to self-propelled tanker operations of Maritime Security Program [MSP] contractors. Also, section 3603 would relieve foreign-built MSP vessels from the 3-year delay in eligibility for certain cargo preference programs. Section 3604 would amend the Maritime Security Act to allow vessel operators that participate in military sealift readiness agreements with the Department of Defense, but that are not MSP contractors, to temporarily use foreign-flag vessels as replacements for any vessel activated under those agreements. Section 3605 would convey an NDRF vessel to the Artship Foundation in Oakland, CA. Section 3606 would enforce the single-hull tank vessel phase-out schedule of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 by eliminating a loophole that would otherwise allow single hull tank vessel lives to be extended by reducing their cargo capacity. 
These provisions are clearly within the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee. I ask that the Armed Services Committee not accept them for inclusion in the final National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 so that the Commerce Committee may consider these provisions as separate legislation this year. I ask Senators Hollings, Hutchison, and Inouye if they agree with this position.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate is making unprecedented progress in considering the appropriations bills for fiscal year 1998. We have completed action on five spending bills, with the expectation that we will finish at least five more prior to the August recess. I must congratulate Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye, as well as the subcommittee managers of the bills, on their efficient management of these measures on the floor. On this bill, I want to congratulate my colleagues from Missouri and Maryland, Senators Bond and Mikulski, for the outstanding job they have done on this legislation. 
I don't intend to unduly delay the Senate in completing consideration of the pending appropriations measures. But I want to ensure that, in our haste to act on these important spending bills, my colleagues are fully aware of the funding recommendations that are contained in this bill. 
I don't enjoy returning to the Senate floor for the sixth time in a little over a week to talk about the wasteful spending in these bills. 
Mr. President, this is a very important measure. It provides $40 billion to fund programs for our Nation's veterans, who have served their country and need and deserve our respect and attention. It contains $25 billion for our Nation's housing needs, including low-income housing programs, housing assistance for native Americans, low-cost mortgage assistance, housing for the elderly, and much more. It provides funding for our space program, programs to protect and restore the health of the environment, disaster assistance, and the activities of many other agencies. This bill totals over $90 billion. 
Yet, at the same time we are struggling to balance the budget and adequately fund necessary Federal programs, I find it somewhat disheartening that the committee spent so much time and effort to identify and protect Members' special interest items. 
Mr. President, I have here a nine-page list of earmarks in this bill and the accompanying report--nine pages of set-asides for specific institutes, centers, projects, and even museums. These projects have not been considered in the normal process of prioritizing among competing requirements. They have simply been earmarked to receive funds because a Member of this body wanted to bring it home.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what concerns me most is the growing practice of earmarking funds for a myriad of projects in the report language but then incorporating that report language by reference in the bill itself. For example, on pages 32 and 33, the bill language states: 
Of the amounts made available under this heading, $40 million for the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) to finance a variety of efforts, including those identified in the Senate committee report, that promote economic revitalization that links people to jobs and supportive services. 
The report identifies 17 separate projects, in specific amounts and at specific locations, totaling nearly $30 million. The effect of this bill language is to require HUD to spend three-fourths of this economic development money for these particular projects without any assessment of the relative needs of the communities which would benefit from these projects compared with many other American communities. This is a very bad practice, Mr. President. It is one of the worst that I have seen in a long time. 
Another section of the bill incorporates a similar list of earmarks into the bill language. On page 62, the bill reads: 
. . . $82 million for making grants for the construction of wastewater and water treatment facilities and groundwater protection infrastructure in accordance with the terms and conditions specified for such grants in the report accompanying this Act. . . . 
It just so happens that the only terms and conditions contained in the report are earmarks for particular projects for the entire $82 million set aside in the bill. Again, this is back-door earmarking and it's the worst form of pork barrel spending that I have seen in a long time. 
As I have said, this bill also contains earmarks for museums, particularly, $7.1 million for the Jazz Museum and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, MO. 
The bill also earmarks $150 million for water and waterwaste facilities along the United States-Mexico border. While this earmark could conceivably benefit my own State of Arizona, I cannot understand why we cannot, instead, provide funding based on need and established criteria, rather than setting aside millions of dollars for certain States or areas of the country.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for 3 straight years now, the Clinton administration has inadequately funded the national security interests of this Nation. In response, Congress added slightly more than $20 billion to the defense budget for fiscal years 1996 to 1998, arguing that future readiness would be put at risk if we did not increase funding for military modernization. 
We did add significant funds to the procurement and R&D accounts to ensure that our forces would maintain their current technological edge over potential adversaries well into the future. At the same time, however, we managed to set aside more than 10 percent of the total defense budget add-on over these 3 years, about $2.3 billion for unrequested low-priority military construction projects. 
This year, we added only $2.6 billion to the defense budget, much less than in each of the previous years, but then the Appropriations Committee earmarked $800 million of that increase for military construction add-ons. Almost one-third of the total defense budget increase this year is unrequested and unnecessary. 
This military construction bill before the Senate today contains funding for unrequested low-priority projects totaling more than $799 million. These projects were added because Members of this body asked for them. The services did not ask for them. The Department of Defense did not ask for them. But Members wanted funding for these projects in their States, and the Appropriations Committee gave it to them. 
I note that the bill sets aside almost $400 million of the overall increase for construction projects for the National Guard and Reserves. The bill includes over $111 million for the construction of 13 readiness and Reserve centers for the Guard and Reserve, at a time when Guard and Reserve end strength is being cut by over 54,000 personnel. 
I wonder what decisionmaking process was used to determine that the priorities of the Guard and Reserve for military construction so greatly outweigh the priorities of the active duty military. This bill gives the Army National Guard a 500-percent increase in project funding, or $189.5 million in unrequested projects. This decision was made by the committee despite the fact that the Army and the Army Guard agreed that the Guard's military construction requirements needed about $50 million. I wonder what criteria were used to determine that $50 million was not enough for the Guard and Reserve and how the add-on of $189.5 million was determined. 
I understand that last year the Appropriations Committee directed the Army to budget $75 million from Army Guard military construction in fiscal year 1998. I also understand that the Army failed to follow the committee's direction and request only $45 million for the Army Guard military construction budget. Does this then justify a 500-percent increase in Army Guard construction funding? 
In addition to the excessive amount of add-ons in this bill, the report contains earmarks for the following projects: $1.4 million to provide refrigeration equipment and improvements at the Fort Wainwright, AK, skating facility; $300,000 for the design of a centralized vehicle wash facility at Fort Wainwright, AK; $2 million for the design of the Saddle Road improvement in Hawaii; $550,000 for a library and adult education center at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, NC; $3.1 million for planning and design of an intelligence center in Charlottesville, VA; $470,000 for design of a warfighting center at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. 
I find it startling that Members are no longer content with earmarking actual construction projects. We now have begun the unfortunate process of earmarking portions of the planning and design money which has traditionally been provided in a lump sum to be used at the discretion and prioritization of the services. 
Where will this earmarking stop? I note, without further comment, the five States receiving the largest share of these construction add-ons: Mississippi, $58.4 million; Virginia, $48.1 million; Alabama, $37 million; Kentucky, $33.1 million; and New Mexico, $32.3 million. This bill even includes an add-on for Arizona. 
Finally, I point out that this bill, like many others that have come before the Senate in the past week, contains restrictive Buy America provisions which limit awards of contracts to U.S. companies only. These two sections, 111 and 112, of the bill are anticompetitive and will ensure that U.S. taxpayers do not get the best price, in many instances, because foreign firms will not be able to compete with U.S. companies.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in closing, let me say I am sure there are many good projects on this list. Many projects will serve to improve the quality of life of our military personnel and will provide facilities improvements that will enhance mission readiness, but the real reason these projects are funded in this bill is that they provide economic benefit to certain States. Even with the congressionally mandated increases in the defense budget, military training exercises continue to be cut, backlogs in aircraft and ship maintenance are growing, flying-hours shortfalls still exists, military health care is underfunded by $600 million and 11,787 service members are reportedly on food stamps and many more are eligible for food stamps, Mr. President. We simply have higher priorities for defense spending and pork-barrel construction projects. 
There are many stories that are illustrative of our need for spending on priority items, and this kind of earmarking is really harming the men and women in the military. Over the weekend, there was a story in the Washington Post about enlisted sailors who are stationed in San Diego who now live in Mexico. They have to drive to Mexico because there is not affordable housing or base housing for them in San Diego, yet, we will fund these projects that are on this list. At the same time, there are 11,787 service members who are on food stamps and thousands more eligible, and we will instead fund these kinds of projects. 
Mr. President, it is not an admirable practice that we are seeing continued and even increase over the years. I intend very strongly to urge the President of the United States to exercise the line-item veto on some of these projects because there is no more compelling reason for the line-item veto than some of the projects that I have talked about today. I will be engaged in urging him to do so. 
I yield the floor, but before I yield the floor, I would like to take a look at the amendment and any other amendments that will be proposed at this time on the bill. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Bumper amendment to place a cap on the space station. I oppose the idea of a price cap at this time given the recent changes to the space station program surrounding the prime contractor's performance and the instability of Russian participation. 
I have asked the General Accounting Office [GAO] to update their previous life-cycle cost estimate on the space station. Once this cost estimate is completed, I intend to introduce a price cap on the station. It is my hope that a price cap at that time will reflect a more accurate assessment of the space station total life-cycle costs. 
I am pleased that my colleague from Arkansas has withdrawn his amendment. 
I look forward to investigating these issues further after the GAO study I requested is completed and after the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee holds hearings and further consultation with interested parties including NASA.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, overall, this is a good bill. It shows that the Congress is concerned about finding savings in its own operations to contribute to deficit reduction. 
The bill does reduce slightly the total number of employees in the Senate offices from last year's levels. It contains numerous reductions in unnecessary spending requested by various offices and affiliated organizations. Some of the more interesting examples of items requested by offices but which were very wisely not included in this bill are: 
A seismic study of the Capitol Building for $75,000; $30,000 for maintenance of outdoor sculpture in the Peace and Garfield parks; and a study of electromagnetic fields in the Russell Building which would have cost $50,000. 
The report also directs the General Accounting Office to place higher priority on Members' requests for audits. This has been a particular matter of concern to me, since the time the GAO sent auditors to middle of the gulf war to inspect Apache helicopters. I appreciate the committee's understanding and assistance in refocusing the efforts of the GAO on the work required by Congress, rather than self-initiated agendas. 
Unfortunately, though, the bill increases funding for the Senate and joint Congressional operations by $51.6 million over last year's levels, for a total of $1.538 billion. For the Congress to approve an increase in spending for its own operations seems to me ill-advised, particularly as we continue to struggle to reach agreement on legislation to provide tax relief and reduce Federal spending. 
In addition, there are several provisions in the bill language that I would ask the managers to clarify further. 
For example, $100,000 is earmarked from the Library of Congress budget for an International Copyright Institute. Another $2,250 from the Library of Congress budget is set aside for official representational and reception expenses of the International Copyright Institute. My question is, what is this International Copyright Institute, and why is it singled out for an earmark of this sort? 
The bill also provides $354.2 million for the General Accounting Office--an increase of $15.7 million over last year's level. This 4.6 percent increase is an unfortunate reversal of the trend to reduce the size and cost of the GAO. 
The report states that this $345 million will pay for 3,500 full-time equivalent personnel. It is curious to me that the GAO can, in effect, hire 3,500 staffers, while all 100 Senators make do with just slightly more than 3,900 staffers, including our State offices. 
The bill also earmarks an unlimited amount of GAO's funds to finance `an appropriate share' of the expenses of several different programs: 
The Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, including the salary of the Executive Director and secretarial support; the National Intergovernmental Audit Forum or a Regional Intergovernmental Audit Forum, as determined by the respective forum, including necessary travel expenses of non-Federal participants; and the American Consortium on International Public Administration, including any expenses attributable to its membership in the International Institute of Administrative Sciences. 
Again, I wonder why these particular institutions are deserving of an earmark for unlimited amounts of the GAO's budget. 
In addition, the report language contains several funding and language provisions that cause me some concern. For example: 
A provision for $118,000 increase in travel, consultant, and representational funding for the Secretary of the Senate. 
A provision for $25,000 for training and travel expenses related to training for employees of the Senate Child Care Center. Shouldn't these employees already be well-trained in child care when they are hired? 
A provision for $500,000 for improved lighting in the Senate Chamber. I hadn't noticed a particular problem with lighting in the Chamber. 
A provision for $100,000 to design a new subway from the Russell Building to the Capitol Building. Mr. President, we have already spent huge amounts of money to install a new subway from the Dirksen and Hart buildings. Why do we need to spend more money on subways, and why does it cost a half-million dollars to design a subway when I assume it will be very similar to the one already built from Dirksen and Hart? 
A provision for $550,000 to modernize elevators in the Hart Building. This building is relatively new and I wonder why a half-million dollars is needed at this time to upgrade the elevators. 
Again, I congratulate the managers of the bill for their hard work and scrupulous attention to detail. This is, overall, a very good bill, but I hope that, in conference with the House, unnecessary spending can be dropped to bring the total back in line with current levels of spending.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I recognize and appreciate the hard work of the Appropriations Committee staff in putting together this detailed legislation. Members' attention to detail is easily apparent in the thoroughness with which they have presented the committee's recommendations. 
There are many good provisions in this bill, particularly the language which would continue the limitations on courthouse construction that are designed to ensure lower costs and standard designs. However, there are many aspects of this bill which cause me serious concern. 
First, this bill increases the funding for these agencies by $1.1 billion over last year's level. Frankly, I believe it is ill-advised for the Senate to increase spending for these Federal agencies at a time when we are struggling to reach agreement on tax relief and spending bills and balancing the budget. 
I am sorry to say that this bill and report contain numerous earmarks of new funds for particular States, as well as language designed to ensure the continued flow of Federal funds into certain States. 
Let me just mention a few of those projects. 
The earmark of an additional $3 million for Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Assessment Center. 
The earmark of $2.5 million for Globe Trade and Research Program at the Montana World Trade Center, which is described in the report as a one-time appropriation to support the center's research and information dissemination activities on `issues designed to explore, define, and measure contributions to economic globalization.' 
Mr. President, let me run that by you again. That is $2.5 million--2.5 million taxpayer dollars--to support the Montana World Trade Center's research and information dissemination activities on issues designed to explore, define, and measure contributions to economic globalization. 
A prohibition on IRS field support reorganization in Aberdeen, SD, until the IRS toll-free help line reaches an 80 percent service level. 
A prohibition on reducing the number of IRS criminal investigators in Wisconsin below the 1996 level. 
A requirement to establish the port of Kodiak, AK, as a port of entry and requiring U.S. Customs Service personnel in Anchorage to serve the Kodiak port of entry. 
The earmark of $4 million for repairs and restoration of the Truman Library in Independence, MO, and $3 million earmarked for repairs to the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, TX, and, very disturbing, various protectionist Buy-America provisions, which are in sections 509, 510 and 511. 
In the report language, Mr. President, there is $750,000 earmarked for additional part-time and temporary positions in the Honolulu, HI, Customs District. 
There is language stating that the committee expects Customs to work with other agencies to successfully implement a dedicated commuter lane at the Stanton Street Bridge in El Paso, TX. 
There is language directing the Office of National Drug Control Policy to conduct pilot programs in Colorado and Wisconsin--Colorado and Wisconsin--to control methamphetamine trafficking. 
I note with interest that that directs the National Drug Control Policy to conduct those programs in Colorado and Wisconsin. It might be of some interest that it is a huge problem in the State of Arizona, larger than it is certainly in Wisconsin and I believe larger than Colorado. That is the view of the experts. 
There is language recommending that the National Archives consider providing $50,000 to their Alaska Region to prepare an interpretive exhibition on their Alaska Gold Rush collections for the 1998 centennial celebration and a similar recommendation that the National Historical Publications and Records Commission consider a grant of $100,000 for the Alaska Gold Rush Centennial projects.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in just a few bills we have now managed to put in 5 billion dollars worth of earmarks and add-ons to the five appropriations bills that have come before the Senate. We have eight more appropriations still to be considered. 
The $5 billion is quite a bit of money, even here in Washington. And I urge my colleagues to recognize that the American people do not approve of these practices. Every time I ask any of them about it, they resoundingly reject these practices. 
I hope we can stop them. I do not know if we will or not, but I really am concerned about the continued practice of earmarking funds without any meritorious screening, without any requirements or any authorization process in many cases. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The fact is, the majority of the environmental community in the United States of America and throughout the world, including Green Peace, want this bill. That is why I asked the majority leader, and, because of its importance, we were willing to debate this issue through until it is done. 
I believe that it is also important to point out that the majority leader had planned on having a cloture vote and debate today. It was at the request of the ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, that he delay this for an another entire week after many weeks of negotiations--fruitless, I might add. And if the Senator from California feels that the way to pursue any issue is through filibuster and debate rather than bringing up her amendments and having them voted on and the issue disposed of, that is fine with me. But I strongly support the majority leader in saying that we will debate this issue until it is resolved. It is too important, Mr. President.

Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from Connecticut will yield for a further question, isn't there an enormous inconsistency, and, in fact, a lack of credibility in this decertification process when we are faced with a situation where the President of the United States in the one case of Colombia decertifies Colombia as not being cooperative in the war on drugs--which is a country, as we all know, with incredible chaos and an anarchy that exists in that country--and at the same time certificates Mexico largely on the grounds not that you could make the argument that Mexico has been cooperative in the case of drugs, but there are certain economic interests and other interests that we have in Mexico which almost compel the President of the United States to not decertify Mexico under the same criteria that basically the President used to decertify Colombia, thereby revealing a significant flaw in this entire process and revealing a lack of credibility as far as adherence to the criteria that was supposed to be set up under the conditions for certification or decertification?

Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question which his response led to, isn't it true that there was a question that the administration had asked itself in this process: What would be the effect in Mexico of a decertification of Mexico, a country that is uncertain if not fragile and in transition to democracy? There is always a certain latent anti-Americanism in Mexico. I will not waste the time of the Senate or my knowledgeable friend's time in depicting the causes for that. And one of the greatest challenges that we face, I ask my friend from Connecticut, is getting the cooperation of the Mexicans. And, yet, isn't it also true that General McCaffrey would testify that despite all of the problems that are there, despite the corruption, there has been an attempt on the part of the Mexicans to arrest their drug czar, General McCaffrey's counterpart in Mexico, and other actions that have been taken by the Mexicans because of their recognition of the threat that drugs pose to their very national existence; and, that, if we had decertified Mexico in the last decisionmaking process that the President took, there is the opinion in the view of many that would have harmed relations and the cooperation that we are receiving would have been lessened rather than increased thereby inhibiting our ability to win the war on drugs and a demotivated factor in helping getting them to cooperate with us?

Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, isn't it also true that we will hear objections to this amendment? And some of those objections will be based on the lack of cooperation that we have received from Mexico in fighting the war on drugs, something I believe the Senator from Connecticut and I would be the first to acknowledge--along with the fact that the resolution of the Senator from Connecticut a few days ago put the Senate on record in praising the Mexican Government, by a unanimous recorded vote here in the Senate, for their efforts of transition to a free and democratic form of government for the first time since the revolution. 
I ask the Senator from Connecticut if he would not believe at this time whether it would not be most inappropriate for the United States to be on record as condemning Mexico, at a time when we are seeing the progress that we have been urging for, in fact, all of our adult lives, the Senator from Connecticut and I. 
And I also want to ask, in addition, is the Senator from Connecticut aware of the White House letter dated July 16, signed by Samuel Berger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs: 
I am writing to express the support of the administration for the amendment that you and Senator Dodd are proposing. We believe your amendment would allow the administration to develop and implement a new multilateral strategy to stem the flow of illegal narcotics. We believe the passage of this amendment will lead to a more effective multilateral effort in the war against drugs. 
And also, is the Senator from Connecticut, who I know shares my profound respect and appreciation for General McCaffrey and the job he is doing and the responsibilities, enormous responsibilities, we have placed on General McCaffrey and the universal respect and admiration in which he is held, aware of a letter he wrote also on July 16, in which he says: 
Wanted to confirm that the Administration supports the Dodd-McCain legislation on international drug cooperation. Believe your thinking supports U.S. drug policy by recommending a mechanism that would allow us to make fundamental improvements in the way we cooperate with major drug producing and transit countries. At a minimum, your bill promises to remove a major cause of foreign policy friction especially with Latin American and Caribbean countries. Timing for consideration of new ideas is fortunate because of the upcoming Summit of the Americas and heightened interest in multilateral counter-drug cooperation following the President's travel to Mexico and Central America. 
ONDCP is prepared to lead an interagency task force to develop a new strategy. 
By the way, I ask my friend, is it not true that we need a new strategy? That is the whole point here of this legislation. I do not know how anyone could argue that the present strategy has succeeded. 
Although we would want to explore a number of options, elements of a new strategy might involve increased use of multilateral mechanisms and international organizations such as the OAS. We might also consider expansion of ad hoc arrangements for in-depth bilateral counter-drug cooperation with countries of particular interest such as Mexico. The Department of State and ONDCP are already formulating plans for a fall conference to develop new thinking along the lines of your proposal. 
Respectfully, Barry R. McCaffrey. 
I ask the Senator from Connecticut, would it not be appropriate that we should view the opinions of the President's national security adviser and the drug czar very seriously when we take into consideration this legislation?

Mr. McCAIN. I will be brief. I know that the managers of the bill and everyone else wants to get votes and final passage on this issue. I think the issue has been pretty well ventilated. 
I will just make a couple comments. One is that a comment was made earlier about General McCaffrey. I think it is important to point out that no matter where we are on this issue --which side--that General McCaffrey deserves our respect and our admiration and appreciation. There was some allegation about his judgment of the Mexican general, and I think we all make mistakes from time to time. But the fact is that General McCaffrey has, in the view of all objective observers, done an outstanding job. 
The Senator from Massachusetts just made a reference to our tax dollars. The Senator from Massachusetts knows full well that no foreign aid goes to Mexico. The only money that goes to Mexico is strictly for the purposes of drug interdiction. That is the only money. In fact, the Mexicans pride themselves on not taking foreign aid from the United States of America. So I think it ought to be viewed in that context. 
But finally, Mr. President, when we vote on this I think the fundamental questions are as follows: Has the present policy succeeded in helping us win the war on drugs? Has the present process of certification or decertification raised the price of drugs in Phoenix, AZ, and Detroit, MI, and New London, CT, and Boston, MA? Has the present policy been instrumental in getting the kind of cooperation and assistance that we need from the Mexican Government and their officials? Has the present policy of certification, decertification, had any beneficial impact on stopping the drug trafficking which goes across our border in large quantities as we speak? 
Those are the questions that have to be asked. And if you believe that the present policy and certification has worked, and has proved a benefit and has been helpful or has been an ingredient in raising the price of drugs, winning the war on drugs, closing our border to the flow of drugs, increasing cooperation assistance on the part of the Mexicans, then I say vote against this pending amendment. 
But I say that the President's national security adviser, the drug czar, and many other experts throughout the country have said, look, let us try something different. Let us come up with some new ways which can address this terrible scourge that is destroying the youth of America. Let us try a new way. 
That is all this says. Let us try to be more effective. Let us try a way of suspending, simply suspending for 2 years, not abolishing, but suspending for 2 years the certification process in hopes that all of us together, the executive and legislative branch, working with the American people, can come up with a way of winning a war that it is sad to say, Mr. President, we are losing. 
If those who oppose this amendment think that what we are doing now works, fine. They are entitled to that opinion. But I do not believe that those we place in positions of responsibility in the executive branch of Government share that view, nor do most experts. The Senator from Connecticut read off the editorial comment from literally every major newspaper in America in favor of this amendment. And I do not blindly follow the advice and recommendations of all of the experts, nor the leaders of our administration and those we entrust to conduct of our national security policy and our drug policy. But I say, we ignore that advice and recommendation at some risk. 
So, Mr. President, I hope we can quickly dispense of further debate and vote on this. 
I thank the chairman and floor manager for his indulgence as we have discussed this very important issue. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am working and my staff is working with the Senator from Alaska right now so that I can cosponsor this important amendment regarding Korea. We have some details we would like to iron out as to the language of the amendment that I am confident we can agree on. 
Mr. President, we all know that there has been another North Korean-initiated altercation in the demilitarized zone that separates it from the South. 
According to preliminary reports, a small number of North Korean soldiers entered South Korea and refused an order from the South to withdraw. When the North Korean soldiers ignored the verbal warning, the South Korean soldiers fired warning shots, to which the North responded with a mortar and artillery barrage. 
My reason for bringing this up is to ensure this latest event involving North Korea is placed squarely in its proper context. On Monday, the Clinton administration announced that it is doubling the amount of food assistance it intends to supply to Pyongyang to alleviate some of the suffering from the famine resulting primarily from 50 years of totalitarian rule and exacerbated by intense flooding. I am not here to argue against providing food to starving people; I am here to reiterate the futility of expecting humanitarian gestures to the most belligerent regime in the world to beneficially affect its behavior. 
Nobody knows what is going on inside the minds of North Korea's leaders, especially the presumed head of government, Kim Jong Il. So thoroughly closed off to the outside world as the North Korean Government has been since its post-World War II inception, that details on its inner workings have been more elusive than for the Soviet Union during its most closed and totalitarian period. One incontrovertible fact remains, however: North Korea has an extraordinarily consistent pattern of alternating minor and manipulative gestures of goodwill with acts of terror and provocation toward its South Korean neighbor unseen anywhere else in the world.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is a list worthy of Stalin, the butcher of millions of his own people and the Soviet leader who installed Kim Jong-Il's father, Kim Il Sung, in power following the end of the Second World War. This list includes numerous instances of North Korean agents infiltrating the South to conduct assassinations, with the most recent occurring last February; causes of agents kidnapping ordinary Japanese citizens off of the beaches of their own country as well as South Koreans, who are smuggled to North Korea for imprisonment and interrogation; armed soldiers crossing the border between the two countries to provoke fire fights, such as apparently occurred this morning; special forces infiltrating the South through tunnels dug beneath the DMZ; and the naval incursions, most recently the September 1996 submarine that was grounded off the South Korean coast with the ensuing loss of considerable life due to the will of the North Korean commandoes who debarked from the sub not to be taken alive. 
I highly recommend my colleagues take a few minutes to review this list. It is the ultimate commentary on the nature of the North Korean regime. It is a window into the soul of that country's rulers. It is a warning against misjudging the North's periodic gestures of goodwill that are inevitably, at most, tactical responses to their own self-induced social calamities or continued efforts at undermining the relationship between South Korea and the United States. 
Mr. President, I now want to discuss the bill very briefly itself. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address the Senate on the subject of the fiscal year 1988 foreign operations appropriations bill. As has been noted numerous times by Members of this body, the end of the cold war had the unwelcome effect of creating a vacuum into which all manner of ethnic, religious, and territorial conflict has been permitted to emerge. In addition, the continuous problems of combating famine, disease, and other problems afflicting many nations of the world ensures that the global responsibilities of the executive and legislative branches of the Government remain substantial, particularly relative to the resources available with which to address them. 
It is for these reasons that we owe it to the American public and to those less fortunate than ourselves around the world that we act as responsibly as possible when allocating these scarce resources. That is why I continue to oppose the practices of adding to the bill funds for programs of questionable merit and of earmarking for specific institutions without regard for broader U.S. national security interests. 
As an elected representative from a State with considerable agricultural interests, I am fully aware of the importance of properly administered agricultural programs. Do we honestly expect, however, the American public to adopt a less confrontational posture vis-a-vis their elected representatives when we continue to earmark funds for the International Fertilizer Development Center in Alabama. Not only does the bill before us earmark $3 million for the center, this amount represents a 50-percent increase over fiscal year 1996. Is the chemical makeup or molecular structure of fertilizer changing so much that we need to actually increase appropriations for the Fertilizer Development Center? 
As usual, although admittedly to a lesser extent than in years past, the bill recommends or directs funding for specific universities, including the University of Hawaii for the training of health and human service professionals; the University of Northern Iowa for teacher education in Slovakia; and George Mason University, also for health care. Montana State University continues to fare well in foreign operations appropriations bills. In the past, it has received funding for pest control. This year, it is supposed to receive funds for crop eradication, specifically opium poppy, coca, and marijuana. Laudable goals, but why the earmark? I do not question the value of some of these programs; I do question whether they require or deserve funding from the U.S. Treasury or cannot be competed among contending institutions and organizations. 
Other recommendations and earmarks of questionable merit included in this bill are $15 million for the Office of Women in Development, which is hardly necessary with simple instructions to our own Agency for International Development; $500,000 for the U.S. Telecommunications Training Institute for communications and broadcast training; and $15 million over 5 years for the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help, which trains teachers and bankers. I was also interested to see in the report accompanying this bill a recommendation to AID that it work with Science and Technology International to further development of the advanced airborne hyperspectral imaging system, which is intended to facilitate the monitoring of environmental degradation and disaster mitigation and aid in the protection of wetlands and management of littoral regions. Does any of this overlap with the $60 million the bill earmarked for the Global Environment Facility. 
Once again, I applaud the goal, but question whether we should be specifying programs, directly or indirectly, without the benefit of a competitive process or adequate knowledge of whether similar capabilities are already or imminently available in the private sector. I further note that this is the second bill this week to include funding for this program: The Defense appropriations bill included $2 million for the advanced airborne hyperspectral imaging system. 
I have already referred to funding for agricultural programs in the bill that warrants skepticism. With funding also directed toward the Farmer-to-Farmer Program and the Soils Management Collaborative Research Support Program, I wonder whether it isn't time to take a closer look at the proliferation of programs to determine whether they are all necessary or overlap in function. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would like to briefly address the Buy-America provisions of the bill. The American public understandably abhors active participation by its Government in encouraging U.S. companies to relocate to foreign countries where labor and materials are cheaper. Section 538 of the bill addresses this concern. Paragraph (b) of this provision may go too far, however, with the ultimate impact of impeding economic growth where it is seriously needed while degrading the benefits that accrue to the American economy through free trade. Specifically, the paragraph in question prohibits the use of funds for the purpose of, 
 . . . establishing or developing in a foreign country any export processing zone or designated area in which the tax, tariff, labor, environment, and safety law of that country do not apply, in part or in whole, to activities carried out with that zone or area, unless the President determines and certifies that such assistance is not likely to cause a loss of jobs within the United States. 
The Presidential certification process established by this provision will create, I suspect, the same problems as do other certifications processes. As countries evolve over decades and centuries and economies reflect that evolution through industrialization and service-oriented dominance, and as free trade policies account for substantial proportions of economic growth, inevitably jobs are lost in certain areas. It has never been any different. We have also seen the benefits to the very people we purport to help of free market economic zones in countries with otherwise centrally controlled economies. It is such zones that facilitate the greatest economic growth and that are more prone to exhibit liberal social and political transformations consistent with our own national values. To adopt a provision designed to impede such progress is not in our national interest. 
There is room for improvement in this bill that I hope will occur when the Appropriations Committees of the respective Houses of Congress meet in conference. It is discouraging to see the practice of earmarking continue. At least, though, the long-term trend has been in the right direction.

Mr. McCAIN. Let me first of all start out by expressing my admiration and respect for the Senator from Colorado, Senator Campbell. If there is any voice that is needed on behalf of native Americans in this body, it is that of Senator Campbell. Senator Campbell has the understanding, the compassion, and, frankly, the credibility that no one else in this body has concerning native American issues, along with others. His 
advocacy for native Americans is something that has earned, not only the respect of his colleagues here, but the respect and appreciation of millions of Americans both Indian and non-Indian alike. 
I believe this amendment satisfies the concerns of native Americans on this issue and at the same time reduces the costs rather dramatically. I believe it is a workable compromise that, hopefully, will prevent us from revisiting this issue year after year. I remind my colleagues, the original proposal by the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, was to do away with all funding for this project. This is a significant step backward from that position and one that I hope we can support. 
This amendment retains the $6 million currently in the bill for continuing negotiations and environmental assessments required for the Animas-La Plata project. It requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress on a reduced, scaled-down plan for the project which would have reduced costs for the Federal Government. Finally, the amendment prohibits the use of any funds for construction of the project until authorization is provided for a new project. 
This is necessary because there are many legitimate concerns for the plan for the Animas-La Plata project. It's very expensive: $750 million. It includes some issues that raise serious environmental concerns which need to be addressed. Yet, we need to resolve this legitimate water rights claim for the Ute Tribes in Colorado and New Mexico. They need to be resolved, I have no doubt. I point out, without those water rights being resolved, then we will be, as the Senator from Colorado so graphically described, abrogating our responsibilities by solemn treaty to the Ute Tribes. This amendment will preserve the funding necessary to go forward with environmental assessments and negotiations necessary to conclude a revised, scaled-down project plan. Without such an agreement and without a much more fiscally responsible plan, the United States could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars to settle these water rights claims. 
I want to point out that the Indians are part of this proposal that is embodied in this amendment. The parties principally concerned, including the Indians, with resolving this plan announced on July 8, 1997, a new plan that would save the taxpayers over $400 million and reduce the environmental impact of the project while maintaining our treaty commitments with the Ute Tribes. I want to point out that the Ute Tribes' opinion on this issue is that we would maintain our treaty commitments to those tribes. 
This plan would save a great deal of money. The previous plan would have cost almost $750 million while the new plan is estimated to cost about $290 million--a savings of $460 million. The new plan reduces the Federal share of the project's cost, $257 million, and requires $33 million in State and local cost sharing. The plan will resolve legitimate water rights claims without costly litigation. It complies with the spirit of the 1988 Colorado Indian Water Rights Settlement Act and will honor a 130-year-old treaty commitment to the Ute Tribes. The two Ute Tribes have accepted this plan as a final settlement of their water rights claims. The new, scaled-down plan significantly reduces the environmental impact of Animas-La Plata. Water flow diverted from the Animas River will be limited to 14.5 percent of the river's average annual flow, which is slightly more than half the diversion under the original plan. The new plan includes a proposal to protect endangered fish in the Animas River system, which has been approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A dam on the Animas River will not be necessary because the new plan does not include diversion of water for irrigation facilities. The new plan redirects the project to provide maximum benefit to the Ute Tribes. 
The plan ensures that tribes will receive two-thirds of the water diverted from the Animas River. The previous plans guaranteed large amounts of water to local agricultural interests rather than Indians. The new plan is fully supported by the tribal, State and local governments most directly affected by the Animas-La Plata project. 
Mr. President, I am pleased when diverse groups, including tribes, State governments and local communities, get together to solve common problems. I think the revised plan recently announced by the interested parties should be seriously considered by everyone concerned. 
In the meantime, I believe we should proceed with the environmental assessments and necessary discussions to ensure the most fiscally responsible plan will be developed to meet the U.S. treaty obligations and finalize a cost-effective plan for this project. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which will ensure that we move forward in a timely fashion with a cost-effective, fair, and supportable Animas-La Plata project.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this amendment is based on a proposal brought forward, not only by the tribes, but also the local authorities who are affected by the project. I certainly do not dispute the word of the Senator from Colorado. If he has that information, I hope he will supply the letter for the Record. I am sure he will be able to do that. 
I think this proposal was brought forward in recognition that the entire Animas-La Plata project, because of the incredibly high-cost associated with it, was in significant danger. The project almost was defunded last year, in a very close vote here in the Senate. It was my belief, and remains my belief, that the Feingold amendment is a compromise that seeks to continue the funding and at the same time scale down the project and take into consideration the environmental concerns and also comply with our treaty commitments to the Ute Tribes.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is the third time in 2 days that I have come to the floor of the Senate to address the flawed practice of earmarking funding for local projects in appropriations bills. 
I recognize the hard work that the managers of the bill have put into expeditiously moving this measure through the Senate. I thank them for their tireless efforts and appreciate that their jobs have not been easy. 
But I must repeat a criticism I have made many times during consideration of appropriations bills and will continue to make as long as the practice of earmarking continues: This bill inappropriately and inequitably singles out projects for funding based on criteria other than national priority and necessity. 
I recognize that the custom has long been to earmark all of the Army Corps of Engineers projects in the energy and water appropriations bills. I continue to find this practice, frankly, unnecessary if the projects are truly worthy of support and are of sufficient priority on a nationwide comparison. I hope we can work together to find a better system of ensuring full and fair consideration of all proposed projects. 
I believe that the States and the Army Corps of Engineers should develop a priority list based on national need. The projects on the priority list would then be funded in a lump sum appropriation. By employing such a priority list, we could end the practice of earmarking projects for funding based on political clout and focus our limited resources, instead, on those areas with the greatest need nationwide. 
It is clear, however, that for many projects, earmarking is the only way to ensure the money is spent. Earmarking is particularly useful in ensuring that funds are spent for lower priority, unrequested projects for which Members of this body have sought appropriations. 
This year, the energy and water appropriations bills and report contain more than $300 million in earmarks for projects not included in the budget request. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-mccain-az-12-19970715</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have no way of knowing whether all or part of this $300 million should have been spent on different projects with greater national need and higher national priority. Earmarking funds for special interest projects is the most obvious form of pork barrel spending, and it is a waste of taxpayer dollars at a time when our national debt exceeds $5.3 trillion. I believe that we should stop earmarking projects just because they serve the interests of Members of Congress. 
I am also concerned that certain projects in the bill are funded `at full Federal expense,' while others are not. 
No explanation is given. So I can only be left to wonder why. 
For example, at page 6 of the bill, the Secretary of the Army is directed to `design and implement at full Federal expense' a project for the Tug Fork and Levisa basins in West Virginia and Kentucky. I might add that this funding `at full Federal expense' is for a project that receives a total of $55.7 million in earmarked appropriations, which is $47.7 million over the budget request. 
What makes this project worthy of such a large add-on of $47.7 million? Why should this project be funded solely by the Federal Government, or rather all the Federal taxpayers, while other projects require cost-sharing by the States and local governments and communities that stand to benefit from their construction? None of these answers are apparent to this Senator. 
Finally, Mr. President, I am again, as I am on an annual basis, very disappointed to see that the Appalachian Regional Commission will be funded again this year. This commission was established as a temporary commission in 1965--1965, 32 years ago. This program singles out one region for special economic development grants when the rest of the Nation has to rely on their share of community development block grants and loans. 
Certainly the Appalachian Regional has no monopoly on poor, depressed communities in need of assistance. I know that in my own State, despite the high standard of living enjoyed in many areas, some communities are extremely poor and have long been without running water or sanitation. We need to reconsider the utility of the Appalachian Regional Commission in light of pressing needs in other areas of the country. 
Mr. President, our current system of earmarking to fund unrequested, lower priority, and unnecessary projects is fundamentally flawed. I hope that someday we will develop a better system, one which allows the projects with the greatest national need to be funded first. 
Mr. President, I noted recently a poll, as I have seen many of them, on the approval rate of Congress, which is about 40 percent. That is one of the highest numbers that I have seen recently. 
Mr. President, there are a lot of reasons the Congress of the United States is held in low esteem, and it would take a long time to go through them. I did notice in that same poll that the approval rating of the President of the United States is 64 percent. I would argue, Mr. President, that one of the reasons we are held in low esteem by the American people--because they believe that we do not wisely and efficiently and on a basis of need and priority spend their tax dollars. And every time we pass an appropriations bill that has this kind of unnecessary and wasteful spending in it, which is no one's priority that I know of, nor go through any scrutiny or any process that would give them that priority, the esteem with which the American people hold us continues to be less. And I know that this practice has been going on for many years, and unfortunately and tragically paying on for many years in the future. 
But I will continue to come to the floor, and where it is the most outrageous and egregious I will propose amendments to strike. Otherwise, I will point out those areas where I think that the spending practices of the appropriations process is not in the best interests of the entire Nation as a whole. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come back to the floor because, although I left the floor, I made the mistake of doing so. 
The Senator from Nevada read a list of projects for which money is being appropriated for the State of Arizona. What the Senator from Nevada failed to note was that funding is exactly--and I look at it on page 11 of the bill--exactly that requested by the administration having gone through a merit-based system which then had the administration request funding on projects that had already been authorized. 
That is a far different--a far, far different procedure, Mr. President, than that of the long list of earmarks that I submitted for the Record which have nothing to do with anything except or--let me put it this way in the most charitable fashion, Mr. President--that has no methodology nor any merit-based system that I know of that will call for the funding of these projects. 
I also point out just for the Record that Arizona, with the agreement of the rest of the delegation, gave up $4 million that the administration was going to spend on the Central Arizona project, gave up an additional $4 million. So perhaps the Senator from Nevada did not understand what my point is. My point is that we certainly fund projects that are requested, that make a case for them, for which there is a merit-based system--not by computers but by judging them with other projects. I do not think the Senator from Nevada understood my point. I have no complaint about projects which the administration requests and they are funded. My complaint is about earmarking for projects including the Appalachian Regional Commission and other projects which I submitted a list of. They are two different things. 
If the Senator from Nevada would agree that we will go through the same system that we went through in order to arrive at the funding for those projects he pointed out, there would be no Member as happy as this one--none in this body. 
So I hope the Senator from Nevada would commit to the same process we went through that achieved that funding for these projects he read off for the State of Arizona. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. May I say I appreciate the words of the Senator from Nebraska--Nevada. I appreciate any from Nebraska, too. But I appreciate the words of the Senator from Nevada. He and I have been friends now since 1982 when we came to the House together. We have worked together on a variety of issues, including native American and many others. Our difference, as he states, is a philosophical one. I don't believe there is an orderly process that judges these projects on merit, and that is just a difference that we have had for many, many years. 
I admire his adherence to what he believes is best not only for Nevada but for the country. I respect that, and I know that my words in criticism of this procedure have nothing to do with the enormous respect and affection that I have for him and the chairman of the subcommittee and the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, during the debate on S. 1005, the defense appropriations bill this morning, I expressed several concerns about section 8097 of that bill. While I appreciate Senator Inouye amending section 8097 to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the construction of the new cruise ships that would result from this pilot project. I still have serious concerns about the provision that would grant a 25-year monopoly in the Hawaii cruise ship market for the only cruise ship operator in Hawaii. 
This legislative restriction on commerce is unprecedented and must not be granted. The existing U.S.-flag cruise ship operator in Hawaii is already protected from foreign competition by U.S. coastwise trade laws. That company has operated without statutory protection from domestic competition for more than a decade. There is no compelling reason to provide such protection now. I'm sure that many businesses would like to reduce their cost of capital to replace their infrastructure by convincing their lenders that their company is protected from any competition in its market. However, the Congress has not provided such protection in the past and we should not do so now. 
I would also note that the provision provides a special waiver to the coastwise trade laws, which is somewhat extraordinary and should be examined for its fairness and appropriateness. While I am not a member of the Appropriations Committee I intend to vigorously pursue the modification of section 8097 to eliminate this egregious provision during the conference on S. 1005.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment strikes section 8097 from the Defense appropriations bill in its entirety. 
This provision has nothing to do with national security issues. It is purely and simply an example of pork-barrel spending that has nothing to do with defense. 
The provision earmarks $250,000 for the maritime technology program. Do not be deceived by the amount of money. The $250,000 is the beginning of what could turn into a multimillion-dollar bailout for a cruise ship line and ships to be constructed in a certain shipyard. 
The money would be used to establish a pilot project to transfer commercial cruise shipbuilding technology to U.S. shipyards--on its face it is an innocuous idea, even though it doesn't have a lot to do with national defense or anything--utilizing the experience of U.S. flag cruise ship operators, and protecting the operation of a foreign-built U.S. flag cruise ship and two newly constructed U.S. flag cruise ships around the Hawaiian Islands. 
The last goal of the pilot project is, I suspect, the most important and most disturbing aspect of the program. 
As I mentioned, this provision only earmarks $250,000. I also mentioned that money has nothing to do with defense. 
The Maritech Program is a very limited program, and this $250,000 earmarked represents a large portion of available Maritech funds. 
I suspect very strongly that this is not the end of the drain on defense dollars for this cruise ship program. I fully expect to see millions of dollars set aside to build these cruise ships and subsequent bills, whether it is the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill this year or in next year's defense appropriations bill. 
If the past is any indicator, this is just the beginning of a multimillion-dollar waste of defense dollars. 
Was the Commerce Committee asked to review this proposal? No. 
Should the Commerce Committee have been asked to review this program? Yes. 
This provision waives three established laws: 
One, it bypasses the established process for reviewing the Jones Act, Passenger Service Vessel Act, and coast-wise endorsement waivers. 
Ordinarily, the Commerce Committee considers action on each requested waiver. This legislation did not come before the Commerce Committee and effectively waives these laws for an unidentified foreign-built cruise ship. 
In my view, should the Commerce Committee approve this proposal as written? No. 
Frankly, that is the precise reason this provision is in this bill and not in the Commerce Committee bill. 
I wonder if anyone can tell me exactly how many cruise ship operators can meet the exact criteria spelled out in the provision of the bill. 
I quote:  
$250,000 should be made available to assist with a pilot project that will facilitate the transfer of commercial cruise shipbuilding technology and expertise, and enable the operation of a U.S. flag foreign-built cruise ship and two newly constructed U.S. flagships. 
That a person (including a related person with respect to that person) within the meaning of 46 U.S.C. Section 801, may not operate a U.S. flag foreign-built cruise ship, or any other cruise ship, in coastwise trade between or among the islands of Hawaii, upon execution of the contract referred to in this section and continuing throughout the life expectancy . . . of a newly constructed U.S. flag cruise ship referred to in this section, unless the cruise ship is operated by a person that is . . . operating a cruise ship in coastwise trade between or among the islands of Hawaii on the date of enactment, except if any cruise ship constructed pursuant to this section operates in regular service other than between or among the islands of Hawaii. 
Provided further, That for purposes of this section, the term `cruise ship' means a vessel that is at least 10,000 gross tons . . . and the berth or stateroom accommodations for at least 275 passengers. 
Mr. President, the list goes on and on. 
This is really unacceptable. This is really unacceptable. 
In my view, I understand there is only one cruise ship operator in Hawaii that can meet this criteria. Only one. And that operator is being handed a 30-year to 40-year monopoly for his existing business. 
How many times has the U.S. Senate so blatantly set up a monopoly set aside for any individual or business? Why would we want to start now? On the very rare occasions that Congress has permitted a monopoly operation, such as Conrail, it was to ensure availability of adequate domestic transportation in the absence of any other possible viable alternative. 
I personally know of no other monopoly operation other than the Conrail example. 
Many of my colleagues in this Chamber profess to be concerned about the growing consolidation in the defense industry, expressing worry that overconsolidation will lead to monopolies in the defense industry. 
I have long been a free trade advocate, and I believe in our existing review. Why wouldn't that same concern about unfair anticompetitive restrictions apply in this case? Why is this legislative monopoly necessary? 
The current operator of this cruise ship operation in Hawaii has operated for many years without this legislative protection. He is protected from foreign competition under existing laws and does not need the protection of Congress to replace his existing ship with new ships. 
What is the urgency of including this language in this defense appropriations bill, or, for that matter, in any other bill? 
Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that this provision was inserted in this bill. But it is not necessary. It wastes defense dollars, and it sets up an ill-considered monopoly for one single entity. 
Mr. President, if this amendment is not stricken from the bill and it survives conference with the House, I would strongly recommend that the President of the United States, in the exercise of his line-item veto authority, eliminate this egregious example of pork-barrel spending. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is a simple and straightforward amendment that simply levels the playing field between U.S. and foreign manufacturers. This amendment promotes U.S. products, not by enforcing restrictive barriers on open competition and free trade, but by promoting sound and beneficial economic principles. 
This amendment waives restrictions on the procurement of certain defense items with respect to a foreign country if the Secretary of Defense determines they would impede cooperative programs entered into between a foreign country and the Department of Defense. Additionally, it would waive protectionist practices if it is determined it would impede the reciprocal procurement of defense items in that foreign country and that foreign country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items in that country. This amendment would apply to all contracts and subcontracts entered into on or after the date of enactment, including any option for the procurement of items that are entered into before the date of enactment if those option prices are adjusted for any other reason. 
I have spoken of this issue before in this Chamber and the potential impact on our bilateral trade relations with our allies because of our policy toward Buy America. From a philosophical point of view, I oppose these type of protectionist trade policies because I believe free trade is an important component of improved relations among all nations and a key to major U.S. economic growth. 
From a practical standpoint, adherence to Buy America restrictions seriously impairs our ability to compete freely in international markets for the best price on needed military equipment and could also result in a loss of existing business from longstanding international trading partners. While I fully understand the arguments by some to maintain certain critical industrial base capabilities, I find no reason to support domestic source restrictions for products which are widely available from many U.S. companies, that is, pumps produced by no less than 25 U.S. companies. I believe that competition and open markets among our allies on a reciprocal basis provide the best equipment at the best price for U.S. and allied militaries alike. 
There are many examples of trade imbalances resulting from unnecessary Buy America restrictions. Let me cite one case in point. Between 1991 and 1994, the Netherlands purchased $508 million in defense equipment from United States companies, including air-refueling planes, Chinook helicopters, Apache helicopters, F-16 fighter equipment, missiles, combat radios, and training equipment. During the same period, the United States purchased only $40 million of Dutch-made military equipment. In recent meetings, the Defense Ministers of the United Kingdom and Sweden have apprised me of similar situations. In every meeting, they tell me how difficult it is becoming to persuade their governments to buy American defense products, because of our protectionist policies and the growing Buy European sentiment. 
Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that this amendment will end once and for all the anticompetitive, antifree trade practices that encumber our Government. I only look forward to the day when my trips to the floor to highlight Buy America provisions are no longer necessary.

This amendment gives the Secretary of Defense the kind of latitude that is necessary in order to make sure that our national security and warfighting capability is protected.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again, I find myself in the unpleasant position of speaking before my colleagues about unacceptable levels of unnecessary spending in the defense appropriations bill. I fully understand the pressure facing the chairman and ranking member of the committee, but I would be remiss in my responsibilities were I not to go on record for those items in the bill of truly questionable merit that appear to represent the usual practice of inserting programs primarily for parochial reasons. 
The total value of these programs is about $5 billion, about twice as much as the Congress increased the President's overall defense budget request and, incidentally, about the same amount of wasteful spending added in the defense authorization bill. This amount does not include the $300 million transferred from the Defense Department to the Transportation Department for Coast Guard activities, a perennial provision in defense appropriations bills. 
Let me review some examples of items included in the bill and report that are, in my view, wasteful, unnecessary and designed simply to serve personal interests. 
The bill not only funds an oceanographic research ship not requested by the Defense Department, it throws in an extra $19.5 million for oceanographic and meteorological research. Are we to honestly believe the $209 million in the budget request for that function is inadequate for the next fiscal year? Of course, the over $200 million for C-130J aircraft--once again not requested and certainly not needed, as emphasized by the Air Force Chief of Staff--represents a particularly egregious waste of taxpayer money. 
I wonder, Mr. President, if some day, some year we will stop buying C-130 aircraft. Many years ago, the Air Force said they didn't need any more C-130 aircraft. It is time--well, I say it every year. It gets a little ridiculous. 
An especially troublesome expense, neither budgeted for nor estimated in any accompanying documentation provided by the Appropriations Committee, is the amount associated with the various `Buy America' provisions included in the bill. Such expenses include restricting to U.S. manufacturers procurement of shipboard anchor and mooring chain, carbon, alloy and armor steel plate, and ball and roller bearings. Consequently, there is an automatic and generally substantial unknown cost tied to this bill that will only become known as contracts are signed with American manufacturers despite the availability of less expensive products from our trading partners. 
Lest anyone feel that I am unsympathetic to American manufacturers, I need only point out the protectionist measures our European allies and customers are considering in retaliation for the `Buy America' statutes included in the appropriations bills that are routinely passed by Congress. Britain, a major purchaser of American platforms and systems, is understandably tired of the one-way street we pursue in defense acquisitions. I am fully cognizant of the need to protect certain vital industries for national security reasons, but the items protected in this and other bills hardly qualify. 
The costly and unnecessary practice of earmarking 
appropriations continues: $35 million for the Kaho'olawe Island Conveyance, Remediation and Environmental Restoration Fund; $250,000 for a pilot project to `facilitate the transfer of commercial cruise ship shipbuilding technology and expertise to U.S. yards,' provided the Jones Act restrictions are rigorously applied to the Hawaiian Islands; $5.4 million for establishment of a small business development center, which is to focus on agricultural programs in Pacific islands; $2.7 million to investigate new technologies in such areas as hyperspectral fluorescence imaging, work to be conducted at the Akamai project at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, with another $10 million earmarked that the Department will be expected to spend for these programs; $2.7 million of the oceanographic spending to which I referred earlier at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in south Florida; $6.9 million for upgrading air traffic control simulators at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi; and $8 million for continued activities at the Pacific Disaster Center. 
Mr. President, that barely scratches the surface of what is in this bill: $3 million is earmarked for the Caribbean radiation early warning system, which is to be spent at the Center for Monitoring Research, which brings me to the issue of Congress' tendency to create new centers for the study of every conceivable subject, research virtually all of which is already performed elsewhere. The defense authorization bill passed last week included $5 million to establish a center for the study of the Chinese military. I can go to my office or the library and find numerous examples of competent studies on the Chinese military already available, whether from the Rand Corp., the American Enterprise Institute, or various studies published by scholars at various universities. The authorization bill also establishes a Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies for no apparent reason. 
The practice of earmarking funds for centers knows no bounds. S. 1005 includes $7 million for the Center of Excellence for Research in Ocean Sciences, just in case there was any risk of funds being spent for a center of mediocrity for research in ocean sciences; $4 million for the Southern Observatory for Astronomical Research; $4 million for the Center of Advanced Microstructure Devices; and on and on it goes. I do not doubt for one second that the sponsors of these programs can come before the Senate and offer an articulate and thoughtful defense of their pet projects. I do doubt very seriously whether any of these items properly belongs in the defense appropriations bill, especially during a period when vital accounts are regularly taxed to pay for ongoing and unforeseen contingencies, like Bosnia and Iraq. 
Any time military equipment is prepared for shipment to and from deployment, it is inspected for damage and, in the case of equipment being returned to its home base, for foreign substances like dust that could contain bacteria alien to our country. Do we really need to earmark another $1 million to expand that research specifically for brown tree snakes, which, to the best of my knowledge, are located only in Guam? Yes, it is true that we base a large number of forces on that island. It is also true that the brown snake is a dangerous snake. 
I simply find it hard to believe that we need to spend any defense dollars on an issue for which plenty of information already exists and is readily available. 
Mr. President, I have touched on the tip of the iceberg. There is plenty more I could point to were time available. I only look forward to the day when my trips to the floor to highlight wasteful and unnecessary spending are no longer necessary.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1998 Defense budget request sent over by the administration continues to reflect the low priority given to our men and women serving in the armed services. For the third straight year, the administration has inadequately funded the national security interest of this Nation, particularly in the modernization accounts. Congress added $2.6 billion in funding to the administration's request in order to provide the resources necessary to execute required national tasking. Additionally, the committee refocused the administration's budget request, adding over $5.2 billion to the procurement and research and development modernization accounts. 
Service Chiefs requested that any potential additional funding be devoted toward key modernization accounts, as reflected in the respective services unfunded priority lists. Unfortunately, the bills proposed by the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House National Security Committee include a plethora of programs not requested by the Defense Department, virtually ignoring the request of the Pentagon and impeding the military's ability to channel resources where they are most needed. In my opinion, this bill contains in excess of $4.9 billion in questionable add-ons and expenditures that do little to contribute to our national security. Similarly, the House defense bill contains over $5.5 billion in objectionable defense adds. 
Mr. President, the following highlight some of the more egregious projects: 
The military construction and family housing accounts received unrequested plus-ups for low-priority U.S. based projects totaling over $772.0 million, including over $262.5 million for the National Guard and Reserves. This MILCON plus-up represents over $100 million more than was added to the 1997 Defense budget request. However, unlike last year, the committee has not had the luxury of adding nearly $13 billion to the overall budget request. The MILCON plus-up includes over $85 million for the construction of nine readiness and reserve centers for the Guard and Reserve at the same time that National Guard and Reserve end-strength is being cut by over 54,000 personnel. 
The procurement account includes the unrequested funding of $343.3 million for six C-130 aircraft. General Fogleman testified before the committee that the Air Force had too many C-130 aircraft, in fact, he called it `An embarrassment of riches.' The House bill includes $331 million to keep the B-2 line open. The Chief of Naval Operations, No. 1 priority on his unfunded priority list was the addition of four F/A-18E/F aircraft. This request, his No. 1 priority, was overlooked by both committees. 
The Senate bill includes $2.6 billion for procurement of four new attack submarines and proposes a teaming arrangement which effectively eliminates competition among shipyards. The American taxpayer will soon find itself funding submarines less capable by design than the Seawolf, and without the benefit of economic common sense which competition and free market principles would provide the cost will approach that of the Seawolf. 
The bill includes unrequested plus-ups in excess of $42 million for automotive and combat vehicle technology research, including research on vehicle composites, electric drives, and battery recharging. 
Included are plus-ups to medical research and development projects totaling over $26.5 million for retinal display research, freeze dried blood, and human factors engineering, among others. 
Funding of approximately $17 million for unrequested research into the next generation Internet. I believe Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are capable of continuing the computer revolution without additional funding from DOD. 
Mr. President, in summary, I am sure there are many programs on my list which may be good programs. I am sure that they benefit certain States, however, with military training exercises continuing to be cut, backlogs in aircraft and ship maintenance, flying hour shortfalls, military health care underfunded by $600 million, and 11,787 servicemembers reportedly on food stamps, I believe we need to forgo, in General Fogleman's terms, the `Embarrassment of riches'. 
Overall, I believe the committee has produced a fine defense bill, and I voted in favor of reporting it out of committee. It is imperative that we maintain the additional $2.6 billion added to the administration's request and I support the redirection of funds to the modernization accounts. However, the allocation of some of those funds to unnecessary spending still warrants concern, and I urge my colleagues to look carefully at these add-ons.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment to delete section 1040 from the bill and replace it with an annual reporting requirement. 
Let me take just a moment to express my concerns with some activities of the General Accounting Office over the years. Starting with the Persian Gulf war, when the GAO sent auditors to the battlefield to inspect Apache helicopters, I have been concerned about the GAO's self-initiated activities, particularly in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. In the past several years, the GAO has undertaken increasing numbers of self-initiated audits while relegating congressionally mandated activities to a lower priority. 
Because of this inappropriate prioritization, the committee included a provision in the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill that would require the Comptroller General of the United States to certify to Congress that all audits, evaluations, other reviews, and reports requested by Congress or required by law are complete prior to the initiation of any audits, evaluations, other reviews, and reports that are not required by Congress. I sponsored this provision because I believe it would make the GAO, a legislative branch agency, far more responsive to the needs of the Congress. 
I understand there are a number of concerns regarding this provision. One concern is that this provision would effectively prevent the GAO from performing any valuable, self-initiated jobs that could save billions of dollars. I find this extremely hard to believe. With 535 Members of Congress, from different backgrounds and with varied interests, it is hard to imagine a situation where the GAO could not find a congressional sponsor for an audit which would save billions of dollars. 
Another concern is that this provision is not in the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. President, it is because the GAO continues to perform a number of self-initiated jobs relating to issues under the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, while the requests of committee members are either canceled or remain unfinished, that the committee decided to take action. 
A third concern questions the necessity of such a provision. We have been told that only 20 percent of the GAO's work is self-initiated. First of all, I have concerns regarding the GAO's definition of what is self-initiated and what is requested by Congress. I understand that if a staff member expresses some interest in an issue, an audit may be initiated as a request of the Senator for whom that staff member works. I personally believe a signed request letter from a Member of Congress should be required before an audit can be considered a congressional request. Furthermore, I have concerns that these numbers do not provide a complete picture. Although only 20 percent of GAO's total workload may be self-initiated, a far larger percentage of the work within a particular division may be self-initiated. For example, I understand that as of June 16, 1997, 50 percent of the work being performed by the National Security and International Affairs Division was self-initiated. 
I am also troubled by what appears to be the pursuit of personal agendas by GAO personnel that permeates much of their work. Many of GAO's reports provide only one side of a story rather than the whole picture. Just as we require witnesses in a court of law to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, we should require no less from the GAO. If we in Congress take the work of the GAO seriously, and use it in our efforts to make well-informed decisions that serve the best interests of the American taxpayer, than GAO should be expected to provide the entire picture rather than one side that serves the interests of a specific group. 
Mr. President, despite my concerns and the GAO's demonstrated lack of responsiveness, I have decided to amend my original language at the personal request of Senators Thompson and Glenn. As the chair and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I am sure that they will do all they can to ensure that the work of the GAO is more responsive and complete. However, if for some reason the GAO continues to demonstrate a disregard for the needs of the Congress, I intend to reintroduce the original language and rein in the rogue activities of the GAO.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment because of the Department of the Navy's narrow interpretation of the Department of Defense's April 1997 `Determination and Waiver' which was a first step for the Department in breaking down unproductive and egregious barriers for free trade. 
This is a simple and straight-forward amendment which waives certain defense items with respect to a foreign country if the Secretary of Defense determines that country would impede cooperative programs entered into the foreign country and the Department of Defense. Additionally, it would waive protectionist practices if it is determined it would impede the reciprocal procurement of defense items in that foreign country and that foreign country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items in that country.

From a practical standpoint, adherence to `Buy America' restrictions seriously impairs our ability to compete freely in international markets for the best price on needed military equipment and could also result in a loss of existing business from long-standing international trading partners.

Between 1991 and 1994, the Netherlands purchased $508 million in defense equipment from U.S. companies, including air-refueling planes, Chinook helicopters, Apache helicopters, F-16 fighter equipment, missiles, combat radios, and training equipment. During the same period, the United States purchased only $40 million of Dutch-made military equipment. In recent meetings, the Defense Ministers of the United Kingdom and Sweden have apprised me of similar situations. In every meeting, they tell me how difficult it is becoming to persuade their Governments to buy American defense products, because of our protectionist policies and the growing `Buy European' sentiment. 
Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that this amendment will end once and for all the anticompetitive, antifree trade practices that encumber our Government.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, `Patriot' is a word best grasped through example: a life lived or service rendered in defense of our country's interests and values. I rise today to recognize an Air Force officer whose service to this nation offers us a splendid example of patriotism. 
Brigadier General David `Bull' E. Baker will soon retire from the U.S. Air Force. Duty and sacrifice have been the standards of an exemplary career that has bridged our Nation's most recent conflicts. Bull Baker flew for his country in the skies over Southeast Asia, northern Europe and Iraq. Over Cambodia his OV-2A was shot down and he was held a prisoner of war by the Viet Cong. In February 1973, General Baker became the only United States Air Force prisoner repatriated from Cambodia. 
By all accounts, Bull Baker is an exceptional pilot. He was one of the first F-15 Eagle pilots as well as the flight commander for the Air Force's first female jet pilots. During Operation Desert Storm, General Baker flew 21 combat missions in the F-15E Strike Eagle. 
This experience as a pilot and a commander has helped him excel in his current position. As the National Reconnaissance Office's Deputy Director for Military Support, General Baker ensures that our intelligence satellites are there to support military commanders. Some 4,000 flying hours and the force of his personality have proven far more formidable than any bureaucratic obstacle, and he has been able to provide our warfighters a unilateral advantage through timely, critical intelligence. Our military forces' ability to successfully execute complex, simultaneous operations from Bosnia, to the Middle East, and to the west coast of Africa is a testament to General Baker's ability and dedication. 
In Bull Baker's career and accomplishments, a word overshadows a thousand pictures. He has placed integrity first, offered service before self, and excelled in all he was called to do. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing a patriot.

Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Massachusetts will shortly be introducing a amendment. That amendment very briefly, condemns what has happened in Cambodia. It calls for the United States to take action, including cutting off any assistance that is being provided to Cambodia. It calls on ASEAN nations in the region to cooperate in taking every step that is possible to restore democracy and a rule of law in Cambodia. 
Mr. President, as I said, the Senator from Massachusetts will be shortly sending that sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the desk. For the sake of time, I would like to comment on it at this time because, as the Senator from Massachusetts mentioned, there are four others besides the Senator from Massachusetts and I who want to speak on this issue. I will be relatively brief. 
A terrible thing has happened in a country that deserves far, far better; a country that has been put through, in the opinion of many, the worst genocide in this century; a country that had a large percentage, some estimate as high as 20 to 30 percent of its population executed by the infamous Khmer Rouge led by Pol Pot. I need not remind my colleagues that at great expense, some $3 billion, the United Nations, with the full cooperation and efforts of the United States, was able to conduct what was judged to be a free and fair election in 
Cambodia. The result of that election was a democratically elected government which had two co-prime ministers: Mr. Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh, the son of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. 
Mr. President, I give this background because those of us who were involved in that effort had high hopes, high hopes 4 years ago after that election, which was conducted by and supervised by many nations throughout the world. Now a terrible tragedy has again befallen Cambodia. Hun Sen, using the philosophy that unfortunately he has adhered to for some time that power is the flower that blossoms from the barrel of a gun, has begun killing people, imprisoning people, and has taken over the government of the country. 
I grieve for the people of Cambodia. I grieve for those very gentle Khmer people who deserve far, far better than they are getting today. 
Should the United States send the military into Cambodia? Obviously not. Should the United States advocate some military action? I don't think that's possible. But I believe that the United States of America must bring every possible pressure to bear on Cambodia to restore, as soon as possible, democracy and the rule of law. We have every right to expect our neighbors and friends in the region to lead as well as follow the United States in this effort. 
Mr. President, if we allow this to happen, it is a tremendous setback for democracy and freedom, not only in that tragic little country but for the entire region. If Hun Sen is able to get away with this unpunished and if this situation goes unrectified, then I fear for other areas of the world, including Burma, including others where democracy has a very tenuous hold. 
Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Hagel, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, as well as Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Cleland, and Senator Robb, in decrying this situation and urging that all steps be taken to rectify it, because all of us have the commonality of service in Vietnam, its neighbor. I believe if there is any potency to our remarks, I hope that it is because of our collective view, on both sides of the aisle, that urges us and impels us to come forward and speak in this emotional and strong fashion. 
Mr. President, yesterday I addressed the situation in Cambodia. I focused my remarks on the tragedy befallen a strife-torn country that saw the flickering light of democracy suddenly and violently extinguished. Today, I join with a number of my colleagues to introduce a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the violence must stop, that the United States should call an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to consider all options to restore the peace, to work with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to restore the rule of law, to suspend financial assistance to the Government of Cambodia, and to urge other donor nations to do likewise. 
Congress and the administration must not minimize the gravity of the situation in Cambodia. One of the century's most horrific chapters took place less than 20 years ago in a nation once known for tranquility. The end of Cambodia's holocaust did not bring peace; it brought 12 years of civil war. The culmination of an exhaustive diplomatic effort was the 1991 Paris Accord and the 1993 election that installed the coalition that governed until 2 days ago. 
The coup d'etat instigated by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen has seriously set back the cause of peace and freedom in Cambodia. The deliberate and brutal campaign to locate and imprison or execute members of FUNCINPEC loyal to ousted First Prime Minister Prince Ranarridh illuminates all too well the nature of a regime dominated by Hun Sen. A forceful and feared individual, Hun Sen will respond only if the message is conveyed in the strongest terms that the international community, led, if necessary, by the United States, will accept nothing less than the cessation of violence and the initiation of serious negotiations aimed at restoring a democratic form of government. 
The Cambodian people demonstrated by their overwhelming response to the 1993 elections that they truly desire to live under the rule of law. They left no doubt that they understand and appreciate democracy. They deserve better than to see an elected government removed by force and replaced by the very regime that harshly ruled for years until the 1991 peace accord. We introduce this amendment because the time to act is now. The administration must respond in the strongest terms to the coup d'etat and resulting violence. Congress as an institution must go on record as strenuously opposing the recent developments in Cambodia. We must let the world know that we stand as one in our conviction to see democracy restored in Cambodia. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for those of us who follow events in Southeast Asia closely, recent developments in Cambodia are a cause for great concern. 
The coup d'etat--and, yes, I employ that term even if the Department of State, for broader foreign policy reasons, does not--staged this week by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen is a terrible setback for that strife-torn country. Tragically, the expression by Mao Tse-Tung that `power grows out of the barrel of a gun' applies nowhere more so than Cambodia. A peace process initiated in 1991, culminating in the Paris peace accords, and manifested most significantly in the 1993 elections is dying. 
The investment in that country since the signing of the 1991 accord by the international community of more than $3 billion, including $160 million from the United States, has clearly failed to eliminate from Cambodia the intertwining of politics and violence. The removal from power of the Khmer Rouge, one of the most vicious guerrilla movements in history--the very people for whom Cambodia has become synonymous with the image of bloodshed on a monumental scale--has not eliminated from the minds of Cambodia's leaders the notion of `power from the barrel of a gun.' 
Mr. President, I am a strong supporter in Congress of facilitating the development of normal political and economic relationships with former adversaries in the Far East. I supported the opening of diplomatic relations with Vietnam and the extension of most-favored-nation trade status to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. With many other Members of Congress, I have invested considerable time and effort to helping secure a peaceful and prosperous future for a region that has known decades of warfare unimaginable to most Americans. I can only now fear for the future. The coup by Hun Sen represents a reversal of fortune that will prove, I fear, extremely difficult to resolve. The culture of violence that dominates major factions in Cambodia is alive and well and once again in power. 
The response to the coup by the Clinton administration is understandably tempered by the knowledge that we will have to deal with the new regime as a simple fact of life, as well as within a broader regional context. It is that regional context that worries me as much as the developments inside Cambodia. The visit by Hun Sen to Hanoi immediately prior to his takeover of Phnom Penh sends a chilling message to those of us concerned about the region's future. Whether Vietnam is culpable in the events in Cambodia is an issue that demands, and presumably will receive, serious attention. 
The American public remains extraordinarily wary of any involvement by this country in Southeast Asia. That is understandable given the history of United States involvement there as 
well as memories of the years of terror in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. That concern cannot and should not be ignored. That is why I was never under any doubt about the popularity of some of my positions with regard to Southeast Asia. The United States, however, must remain engaged there. It cannot turn its back on a region of great importance to the entire Far East. Conflict in Indochina, during a period when countries circle each other warily over specks in the South China Sea that may or may not be rich in oil and natural gas, can easily have wider implications. We must work to bring peace and stability to Southeast Asia. Both morally and practically, we must stay engaged. 
I have met a number of times in the past with Hun Sen. He is a tough individual not vulnerable to intimidation. He is capable of acting as ruthlessly as he deems necessary. His troops have actively sought out Members of Cambodia's elected Parliament with the clear intent of imprisoning those who oppose him and incorporating into his movement those who do not. Cambodia's interior minister was captured and executed. Sam Rainsy, president of the Khmer National Party and a friend of some of ours, expressed the situation appropriately when he asked, only partly rhetorically, 
On what ground, following what rule, what law, what article of the Constitution, what legal procedure can the Second Prime Minister unilaterally `dismiss' the First Prime Minister . . . (O)nly with the backing of his tanks Hun Sen gave to himself the right to dismiss the First Prime Minister and to announce the formation of a new government. 
A reign of terror has been launched and a shadow has fallen over a country now known more for its violence than its awesome natural beauty. Gunfire around the Angkor Wat Temple, revered by Buddhism and universally identified with solemnity, provides a sad contrast that illustrates all too well the tragic fate of Cambodia. The international community, which invested so much time, energy, prestige, and money in establishing in Cambodia a democratic form of government and the opportunity for the same peaceful and prosperous future enjoyed by so many of Asia's countries, can be forgiven if it does not attempt a repeat of its efforts earlier this decade. 
The United States should, I believe, work to resolve this crisis and repair the damage. I would be hard-pressed at the moment, however, to argue on behalf of foreign assistance for Cambodia while a government that took power via coup d'etat rules in Phnom Penh and the ousted FUNCINPEC party negotiates in the northwest with the Khmer Rouge. The administration must communicate more forcefully than it has to date to Hun Sen that his actions are unacceptable and it must meet with Prince Ranariddh while he is here in Washington at the highest possible level of government to convey our continued support for the democratically-elected government that was ousted. It must be reiterated that Hun Sen was made Second Prime Minister and the Cambodian People's Party given a sizable representation in Parliament not because of its popular support, which it lacks, but because of its history of extreme violence and willingness to employ that violence to attain its objectives. It must be illuminated the degree to which the international community bent over backward and the Cambodian people's interests sacrificed in order to bring the CPP into the coalition that was torn apart by the coup. 
Mr. President, the tragedy that is Cambodia continues. The Senate as a body, the Congress as an institution, and the administration as this country's representative abroad must communicate the message that the recent events in Cambodia represent a reversal that cannot be accepted without a price. I, for one, stand ready to do my part. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate adopted a symbolic, yet important amendment which grants a Federal charter to the Air Force Sergeants Association, a highly respected nonprofit, veterans association. 
Over the past 36 years, the Air Force Sergeants Association has been stalwart in representing the interests of Air Force enlisted men and women. The association has served a vital purpose by informing Members of Congress of the concerns of enlisted servicemembers and their families, and likewise informing enlisted personnel where Members of Congress stand on critical personnel issues, such as pay, military medical health care, quality of life and earned retirement benefits for active duty, Reserve component, and military retirees. 
This Federal Charter is a symbolic gesture that shows Congress appreciation to the Air Force Sergeants Association for the outstanding service they provide and to the dedicated men and women whom the association represents. We pay tribute to the noncommissioned officers who form the backbone of the Air Force. 
Noncommissioned officers turn the wrenches, prepare the aircraft, walk the perimeters, and train `new' junior officers as they report to their first assignments directly from their commissioning source. The contribution of our noncommissioned officers cannot be overstated whether as major contributors to dismantling the Iron Curtain, winning the Persian Gulf War, to carrying out vital peacekeeping missions throughout the world or projecting American power wherever and whenever it is needed. 
As the Air Force celebrates its 50th anniversary, Congress honors the commitment and contribution of enlisted servicemembers to our national security. Granting this Federal charter demonstrates our gratitude for their outstanding efforts. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the support of my colleagues for this amendment. It is with great honor and gratitude that I was asked to introduce this legislation by my friends at the Air Force Sergeants Association. 
I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Air Force Sergeants Association Federal charter amendment, amendment number 728, be printed again in the Congressional Record.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from Connecticut on proposing this amendment. 
As he has pointed out, quite often when something goes wrong in Mexico, we and our colleagues are quick to take the floor and criticize, which is our role. But I think, as the Senator from Connecticut also pointed out, when something good happens, it is also important for us to take the floor and encourage our neighbors to the south in continuing the very difficult process toward a free and open society, which has been very difficult and arduous. 
I also agree with the Senator from Connecticut we ought to have a vote on this amendment to tell the people in Mexico and their leaders of our support and our interest. Quite often, as I travel, especially in Latin America with my friend from Connecticut, I continue to be surprised at how much attention is paid to what we say here, how much attention is paid to what we do here. Quite often, we will do a unanimous-consent agreement, it comes to the floor, and it will make headlines all over that particular nation which is affected. Usually it is in the negative. 
I cannot elaborate on what the Senator from Connecticut said except to point out again--I believe the first time the Senator from Connecticut and I traveled together was in 1987. If, 10 years ago, he and I had been in a conversation and I said, `Guess what? In Mexico, an opposition party is now the mayor, a member of the opposition party is now the mayor of Mexico City,' which has the largest concentration of people in Mexico, `that many of the Governorships have been taken over by both opposing parties, both on the right and on the left, and that by all judgments that it was a free, fair, and open election,' the Senator from Connecticut and I would have been accused of irrational thinking, to say the least, because it was not in the realm of possibility 10 years ago. 
Now what has happened in Mexico, we are seeing a transition which, by the way, will be characterized and fraught with great danger and perhaps violence because of the inequities that exist in Mexico that we are all aware of, but a major step forward was made. It is an important landmark election in the history of the country of Mexico where the ruling party not only allowed but encouraged a free and fair process, which we all know was not the case before. 
I think that we, the representatives of the American people, should do everything in our power to applaud, appreciate, and encourage such actions. I want to thank the Senator from Connecticut, whose long involvement of many years on these issues is important, and it has been an honor and a privilege for me to have the opportunity of working with him, as we have seen our neighbors to the south, not just Mexico but the other nations in Central and Latin America, make a transition for which I think holds a prospect for the peoples of our hemisphere which most observers thought was highly unlikely, if not impossible, in the recent past. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I joined my colleague and friend, Senator Dodd, in introducing a joint resolution calling on the President to take concrete steps to increase the level of international cooperation in combating the flow of narcotics into this country, and to lead America toward coming to grips with the domestic demand that is tearing this country apart while enriching the drug cartels of Latin America and our own organized crime groups. 
This legislation acknowledges the problems endemic in waging the war on drugs while domestic demand continues to remain high. It further recognizes the failure of numerous previous efforts at stemming the flow of illegal narcotics. It consequently expresses the sense of Congress that the President should appoint a high level task force, to be chaired by the Director of the Office of National Drug Policy, to establish a framework for improving international cooperation in these efforts. Finally, and of particular importance, it suspends for 2 years the process by which countries are certified as cooperating in the war on drugs. 
The drug problem in this country dates at least as far back as the Civil War, when wounded soldiers were turned into morphine addicts as the only way to deaden the horrific pain caused from battle and disease. The problem grew to such an extent that President Nixon felt compelled to establish the Drug Enforcement Administration in order to better coordinate the antidrug effort. President Reagan assigned Vice President Bush to oversee a major escalation in the war on drugs, a war carried on at considerable monetary cost throughout the Bush administration. President Clinton, to his credit, appointed perhaps our finest `drug czar' in Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who has waged the drug war as valiantly as he led troops in combat during Desert Storm. 
And still, the flow of illegal narcotics continues virtually unimpeded. Record-breaking seizures serve mainly to remind us of how much more is getting through our porous borders undetected. Street prices alert us to the failure of our best efforts at putting a dent in the problem of drug trafficking. To the extent that one area, for example, cocaine, is tackled with any degree of success, another bigger problem--the resurgence in heroin abuse comes to mind--rises up in its place. Clearly, it is time to step back again and look more critically at every facet of the problem. 
I do not believe `chicken-and-egg' debates about which problem, supply or demand, should take higher priority serve any useful purpose. The bill we are offering today addresses both problems. Nor do I believe the certification process has accomplished its intended goal any more than such processes ever really do irrespective of the subject matter. In fact, the decision by the White House to decertify Colombia, which has waged a valiant and costly--in both lives and treasure--struggle against extremely powerful and ruthless cartels while recertifying Mexico, whose law enforcement agencies are so rife with corruption that that country's equivalent of Gen. McCaffrey was arrested for drug-related crimes, illuminates all too well the impracticality of the current process. 
It is easy to argue that the drug problem has been studied to death. It has not, however, been examined from the perspective, and at the level, recommended in this resolution. If I believed for a second that this resolution represented just another attempt at studying the problem of drugs, I would not have attached my name to it. The recommended steps, however, combined with the suspension of the drug certification process, constitute a real and meaningful effort at focusing the Nation's attention on one of our most serious problems. Drugs are, in every sense of the word, a scourge upon our society. We must take a comprehensive, sober look at the scale of the problem and what realistically can be done about it. We must do this domestically and internationally. We must, once and for all, wage the war on drugs as though we intend to prevail. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives will support this legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Before I call up my amendment, I wish to respond to my friend from Minnesota for just a moment on his amendment. I preface my remarks by saying I know of no more passionate or compassionate Member of this body than the Senator from Minnesota, nor do I believe that there is anyone in this body who articulates as well as he the plight of those who, as he pointed out, may be underrepresented here in this body in our deliberations. I have grown and developed over the years a great respect and even affection for the Senator from Minnesota because of my admiration for his incredible commitment to serving those who may not always have a voice. 
But I say to the Senator from Minnesota that this amendment, like many others, is what I call the Willie Sutton syndrome. When the famous bank robber was once asked why he robbed banks, he said, `Because that's where the money is.' And time after time I see amendments that are worthwhile and at times, as the Senator from Minnesota just articulated, compelling, but they come out of funds that are earmarked for national defense. In my view, that is not an appropriate way to spend defense money. 
I would also quickly point out that this is not the first time it has happened. There are literally billions of dollars now that we spend out of defense appropriations and authorization that have absolutely nothing to do with defending this Nation's vital national security interests, again because of the Willie Sutton syndrome. Although I admire and appreciate the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota, I would oppose it, not because of its urgency but because of its inappropriate placement on a defense appropriations bill. And I would also like to work with the Senator from Minnesota when the Labor-HHS appropriations bill comes to the floor to see if we cannot provide that funding, which the Senator from Minnesota appropriately points out is not a great deal of money given the large amounts of money we deal with and also considering the importance and urgency of the issue.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would authorize two additional base closure rounds in 1999 and the year 2001 consistent with the recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review, known as the QDR. The amendment authorizes a process which is identical to the process established in 1990 for the last three BRAC rounds. The amendment also contains language which addresses the politicization in the last BRAC process which permitted the President to implement privatization in place at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases. 
I might point out that I am working with the Senator from Texas [Mr Gramm], in trying to frame language to modify the amendment at the appropriate time which would allow the Secretary of Defense to privatize where it can be proven to be of benefit to the taxpayer. We are still working on that legislation. 
Mr. President, we need to authorize additional base closure rounds to correct a current imbalance in force structure and infrastructure. 
After four base closing rounds, only 21 percent of the military installations in the continental United States have been reduced. Our force structure, however, will have been reduced by over 36 percent by the time that quarterly defense review recommendations are complete. Obviously, retaining excess base infrastructure is unnecessary with a smaller military force and wastes scarce defense resources that are essential to future military modernization. 
I think it is important to frame the debate about this amendment in the terms of the realistic approach we have to take to future defense budgets. I do not believe there is any of us here, barring a national security emergency, who believes we are going to see increases in defense spending, certainly not increases in defense spending which would justify the size of our infrastructure as it exists today. It just is not possible, in a period, in real terms, of declining defense budgets, to maintain this infrastructure and, at the same time, modernize our force and provide the men and women in the military with the necessary tools to fight and to win any future conflict with a minimization of casualties. 
I am very confident that the United States has emerged at the end of the cold war as the world's No. 1 superpower. I don't think there is any doubt about that. But I also think it is important to point out that we are seeing problems within the military that some of us, with the benefit of experience and old age, recognize as having happened before. We are now seeing a failure to meet our recruitment goals for our All Volunteer Force. We are now seeing a derogation of our readiness capabilities in parts of the military establishment. We clearly are not modernizing the force in a way that will give us the ability to maintain our technological edge, which has made us the world's No. 1 superpower and won the magnificent victory of the Persian Gulf war. 
So, if you accept the premise that there will be at best a leveling of defense spending, and certainly realistically speaking a decline, at least in terms of inflation if not worse, then there really is no argument against closing more bases. I have heard some very interesting arguments and we will hear on the floor some interesting arguments against base closure. One that has some legitimacy is that, either in reality or by perception, the last base closing round was politicized by the President of the United States by privatizing in place two major bases, both of them with very large electoral votes. I wish that had not happened. It has caused an enormous amount of acrimony and division within this body, within America, within the Senate Armed Services Committee. And this particular reauthorization of further BRAC rounds will not allow a privatization in place to take place. So it will be well, I am sure, by some, to lament the politicization of the process as took place--or the perception that it took place, depending on which side you are on in the argument--of the last BRAC process. 
But it does not change the reality. It does not change the reality that we have a significant imbalance between operating forces and infrastructure. In other words, we don't need the number of bases that we have in our defense establishment in order to match up to the fighting forces that we must maintain. If we maintain that base structure, it will siphon more and more funds unnecessarily into a base structure and away from the much needed funding, such as pay raises, such as operations and maintenance, such as training funds, such as modernization of force, such as recruitment, such as, for example, addressing the problem we are seeing right now in aviation in the military, an exodus of pilots from the military to go with the airlines. One of the reasons is pilots are putting pen to paper and figuring out that after a short period of time financially they will be better off as airline pilots than as military pilots. 
If you couple that with ever-increasing deployments and separation from family and home, this is causing a hemorrhaging from our most highly skilled and highly trained branches of our military. 
Another argument you are going to hear is that we are spending too much money on other functions, such as peacekeeping. All of us regret that we have had to spend--I believe the estimates are now up to somewhere around $7.5 billion or $8 billion on peacekeeping in Bosnia. I regret that, too. I hope that by next June 30 the United States will not only be out of Bosnia militarily but also financially. I will bend every effort that I can, short of jeopardizing the lives of those young men and women and short of provoking another conflict in the region which may cost the United States more in the long run, but I will do everything in my power to see that we stop spending that money on peacekeeping. 
But what in the world is the connection between the money we are spending on peacekeeping and the base infrastructure? What is the point? There is none, because whether we had a large or small establishment, we would still be spending too much money on peacekeeping. 
So, I respect the arguments that will come in opposition to this amendment. Those are the two primary arguments. But I 
fail to see the relation between those arguments and what we have to do in the national interest. 
One of the interesting things that has happened since the end of the cold war is that we see very little, if any, interest in national security issues and national defense on the part of the American public. I think in some ways that is good news, because the American people feel content. They do not see a threat to our security out on the horizon. And, although that sentiment does not prevail when Americans are killed in places like Somalia and others, generally speaking there is no urgent feeling on the part of the American people that we need to spend, not only not more, but even as much as we are spending on national defense. 
It is also true, however, that we do have to maintain a certain level, otherwise we will not maintain our position in the world. It is also true in my view that, if we don't wish to be the world's No. 1 superpower, then it is a very valid question as to who, then, do we expect to be the world's No. 1 superpower? Because other nations, I think, would be perfectly willing to do so. 
Mr. President, I have a letter to Chairman Strom Thurmond, and I quote from it:  
We strongly support further reductions in base structure proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such reductions will have on the Service communities in which our people live. We ask your assistance in addressing this difficult issue. 
Sincerely, John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Joseph W. Ralston, Vice Chairman; Dennis Reimer, General, United States Army, Chief of Staff; Jay L. Johnson, Admiral, U.S. Navy, Chief of operations; Ronald R. Fogleman, General, United States Air Force; Charles Krulak, General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not think we can lightly ignore--or not seriously consider, I guess is a better way of saying it--this letter from the individuals that we have asked to lead our military. Every one of these individuals knows the pain and hardship that comes about when a base is closed. But each of these individuals has been charged by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to run our military establishment. And all of those individuals feel, not just supportive of what Secretary Cohen is saying, but obviously that this is a very important issue if they are going to be able to carry out their responsibilities. 
Mr. President, I have a letter from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Bill Cohen, former Senator Bill Cohen, whom we all know quite well. Secretary of Defense Cohen says: 
Reducing excess infrastructure was an essential element of the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Department has already reduced its overseas base structure by almost 60 percent and must now bring its domestic base structure into balance with its force structure. * * * * * 
Base closings are an integral part of this plan. The QDR found the Department has enough excess base structure to warrant two additional rounds of BRAC, similar in scale to 1993 and 1995. 
The Department estimates two additional base closure rounds would result in savings of approximately $2.7 billion annually. These savings are critical to the Department's modernization plans. 
Let me say that again: 
These savings are critical to the Department's modernization plans. 
He goes on to say: 
As you may know, when I was in the Senate, a base in my State was closed as a result of the 1991 BRAC. Therefore, making a recommendation for further BRAC rounds is not something I take lightly. However, the Service Chiefs all believe that additional BRAC rounds are necessary. 
Mr. President, I think it might be appropriate to point out at this time, in light of what I just read from Secretary Cohen's letter, that there are bases in my State that I know will be vulnerable in light of two additional rounds of base closing. And I know that I will have to go back to my home State, if one of them is closed, and say: Yes, I'm the guy who proposed the amendment for two more rounds of base closings. 
But I will also tell the people of my State that I did it because I told them, when I sought to serve in this body, that I would act in the national interest first. I would also add that we went through a base closing in my State, in the case of Williams Air Force Base, and I am happy to say, by the way, as has been the case in many bases in many areas of the country, that the community has ended up by generating more economic benefit than less. That certainly has not been in all cases, but it certainly has been in many. 
Mr. President, I want to point out that there are several urban success stories: Charleston Naval Base, Charleston, SC, where currently there are 32 agencies reusing this former naval base; Pease Air Force Base, Portsmouth, NH, the establishment of Pease International Tradeport created more than 1,161 new jobs; Sacramento Army Depot, Sacramento, Packard Bell NEC, the country's largest manufacturer of personal computers, has created more than 5,000 jobs at this former depot; Williams Air Force Base, now known as the Williams Gateway Airport, quickly emerged as an international aviation and aerospace center where more than 20 companies engage in aircraft maintenance; Mather Air Force Base; Gentile Air Force Station, Kettering, OH; Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino; Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis; Griffiss Air Force Base; Cameron Station, Alexandria; Naval Air Station/Naval Aviation Depot Alameda, Alameda--the list goes on and on. 
Mr. President, there are a large number of success stories. That does not diminish the fact that in some rural areas there will be significant economic impact. There is no doubt about that. But it also is part of the BRAC process that economic impact is a factor in the determination of a base closing. 
Mr. President, I have talked too long a time, probably, on this issue, because the issue is well known to my colleagues. I am grateful to my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, who, along with me in the Armed Services Committee deliberations, tried to--we were cosponsors of an amendment; had it put in the authorization bill. We were defeated on a tie vote. I appreciate the efforts of Senator Levin very much on this issue. 
This is a nonpartisan issue. It is an issue that has to do with the future military capabilities of this country and our ability, over time, if called upon, to defend our vital national security interests. It is not possible to modernize the force, maintain the level of training and readiness and recruit the qualified men and women in an all-volunteer force if we refuse to put back into balance the base support structure with the fighting forces and operational forces that are necessary to do the fighting. 
My friend from Virginia, Senator Robb, former Marine Corps officer, carries around with him from time to time a chart that is very simple. It shows what he calls the tooth to tail--tooth being the fighting forces, the tail being those in support--and how those two lines have diverged steadily over the intervening years. With this BRAC closure we may not cause that trend to reverse, but at least we can level it off. I believe we must do so. 
I know there will be a lot of debate on this amendment, and I hope we can agree to this and move forward. 
I feel so strongly about this particular issue that unless we do include a base closing round and unless we do something about the depot issue, if I were the President of the United States, I would be very tempted to veto this legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Michigan for a very lucid and, I think, fact-filled discussion of this issue, which I believe has become more Orwellian in nature, if I might characterize it as that. 
We are now debating whether closing a base will save money or not. If that were not the case, Mr. President, we made a terrible mistake at the end of World War II. We should have kept all the bases open that we built all over America during World War II and should not have closed any of them. I am, frankly, astonished. 
Now, I think there have been valid arguments made over the process. There have been arguments made as to whether the process was politicized in the last round of BRAC. I think that there have been some valid points here. But, Mr. President, anyone in the world, I think, can understand that if you have to reduce a business, a corporation, or whatever it is, because the 
in-flow of money has been reduced, then you have to close a number of facilities because you don't have the business. 
Mr. President, the military, in many ways, is a business. They are assigned a mission. They receive money to carry out that mission, and they build the facilities and equipment and hire the men and women to carry out that mission. Then, as that mission is reduced and the amount of money to support that mission is reduced, you shrink the size of the support establishment. 
It is not really very complicated. To make an argument that a base closing does not save money over time, really, to me, defies all logic. Yes, there have been costs associated with base closings that were not anticipated. I will certainly agree with that. A lot of it had to do with environmental cleanup. But the fact is, Mr. President, that those costs would have been incurred anyway and probably would have been higher as years went by and the pollution and the environmental poisoning would have become greater. So to somehow say that because we had to clean up bases that were closing does not justify the bases being closed, that ignores the fact that sooner or later the environmental cleanup would have had to take place. 
Now, Mr. President, if you have three bases and you only need two, then you need to keep paying the electric bill at the third base, keep the runways paved and the housing up and the grass cut. All of those are costs that are associated with excess inventory. So when you don't have the requirement for that inventory because the mission has been reduced--the funding in this case--then you reduce the support establishment. I don't know how it could be much less complex than that. 
When we talk about CBO estimates, DOD savings estimates are inconsistent, unreliable, and incomplete, maybe they are. Maybe they are all those things. But you can't deny the fundamental fact that unless you believe we are going to increase defense spending, we have to have a better match-up between the support establishment and the operating forces, and that because our reduction in overall funding and our failure to implement the reductions in the support establishment is not matched up, we therefore are losing in this `tooth to tail' ratio, which the Senator from Virginia, Senator Robb, has talked about on occasion. 
One of the opponents of this amendment said that Congress should be doing this. I totally agree that Congress should be making these decisions. It is a lack of courage on the part of Congress that we have to turn to a commission. But, Mr. President, it is perfectly clear that for 17 years not a base was closed, even though there was a requirement, in the view of one and all, to do so. It was because Congress didn't have the political will to do it. That is why we resorted to the Base Closing Commission. 
Now, if I had the confidence that Congress would act in a responsible fashion and we would close bases as necessary, then I would not support the commission. But the record is perfectly clear that, for all those years, we were unable to close a base because Congress was politically paralyzed, so we had to give the responsibility and the blame to a Base Closing Commission. 
The Senator from Michigan has already referred to the letter of the Secretary of Defense. I am told that a letter from the President is coming over. The inspector general of DOD found that, in some cases, they overestimated cost by $148 
million, and they underestimated savings by $614 million. The inspector general is a well-respected individual, and her memorandum, which is contained in the cover letter by Secretary Cohen, I think is abundantly clear. 
Mr. President, I don't like to drag out this debate too long. I think that some arguments have been made that I think are important to be made by the opponents of this amendment. I want to make it clear that if the Dorgan second-degree amendment is not tabled, the Senator from Michigan and I intend to have a vote on our amendment up or down. So we will raise that amendment again until there is a final adjudication by this body on the McCain-Levin amendment. I hope that the Dorgan second-degree amendment is tabled and we can have an up-or-down vote on the other. 
The Senator from Michigan pointed out and showed the stacks of information that have been sent over to the Senate. The Senator from Michigan and others have pointed out the abundance of information that has been sent over by the Department of Defense and the forms and reports as to how much money has been saved and where and under what circumstances. Yes, we underestimated the environmental cleanup costs, but we have underestimated the environmental cleanup costs in every toxic waste site in America, not just on military bases. Those toxic waste sites are not going to go away just because the base remains open. Sooner or later, that problem is going to have to be addressed. So I hope that we will act in agreement. 
One other thing. The letter from the chiefs of the services that came over, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--many of the allegations I have heard quite often are that members of the military are empire builders, they never want to give up a base or a weapons system, and they never met a weapon system they didn't love. These individuals are calling for these tough decisions to be made because they know what will happen if we don't close these bases. It will not free up the money, which is absolutely vital, in their view, to modernizing the force and retaining the men and women we need in the All Volunteer Force, to provide sufficient funds for training and operations in order to keep our military the best in the world, because you can't siphon off all this money into support functions and expect us then to have enough money left over to carry out the operations that are necessary. 
So, Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will move to table the Dorgan second-degree amendment. I hope we can dispense with this issue as soon as possible. 
I yield the floor.

I don't know where the Senator from Alaska has been traveling, but I suggest he go to Germany where we have basically dismantled our huge defense establishment, which was necessary and no longer is. There are stacks and stacks of information that can be provided about the costs that have been reduced as a result of the base closings that have taken place. 
Finally, we are now in an Orwellian argument that not closing bases somehow saves money. It is the strangest argument I have been through on the floor of the Senate. We have to reduce these. 
I do not intend to move to table the Dorgan amendment. I expect the Dorgan amendment will win. But I will tell my colleagues right now, this will be a sad day. 
This will be a sad day in the history of the Senate, because we will not have fulfilled our obligations to the men and women in the military because we continue to siphon off money to pay for bases that we don't need instead of paying for the troops and the equipment that they need to fight and win.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand, and I have been briefed that there will be an amendment proposed on behalf of several Senators to increase the amount for National Guard Civilian Youth Opportunity Program to $48 million and to provide a substitute for the provision extending and revising the authority of the program. 
Mr. President, I strongly object to this amendment. It is already at $20 million. The fundamental question here arises when we are complaining about the fact that there is not enough money for flying time, there is not enough money for pay raises, there is not enough money for quality of life for men and women who are in the military who are serving, and there is not enough money for modernization of the force--and every military leader will tell you that--and now we want to add $28 million to a program which, really, the National Guard has no business being in. It has no business being in a Civilian Youth Opportunity Program. 
Oftentimes we refer to the job and role of our Founding Fathers, Mr. President. Who in our Founding Fathers thought that the job of the National Guard was to administer Civilian Youth Opportunity Programs? 
The National Guard, I am told by my colleagues who are in areas where there have been floods, devastation, and other disasters, has its hands full. The National Guard has a great deal of difficulty in maintaining training levels of efficiency. We found that out during Operation Desert Storm. Now we want to add $28 million to a program that the National Guard has no business being in. 
Mr. President, I am sure when we have a recorded vote on this--and I will demand a recorded vote--that it will carry overwhelmingly, just like the military construction appropriations bill that is coming before us will carry overwhelmingly that has billions of dollars of wasteful and pork barrel spending, but sooner or later, sooner or later, Mr. President, the American people are going to be fed up. They are going to stop supporting spending for national defense and they will stop because they see this kind of unnecessary and wasteful and pork barrel spending. 
I read in the newspaper today the military construction bill has some $900 million additional for projects that the administration or the Department of Defense could not find anywhere on their priority list--nowhere to be found on their priority list as being necessary, but they also happen to match up to districts of powerful Members of the other body's committee. 
It has to stop, Mr. President. A lot of people are getting tired of it. I am sure, as has happened on many other occasions, that when we have a recorded vote on this, it will carry overwhelmingly, but sooner or later we will ask ourselves the question, When are we going to spend the money where the priorities are, according to the leaders of the military, both military and civilian? 
It certainly isn't in this program. Is $28 million a lot of money? Certainly not in this entire bill. But it is symptomatic of the problem that has afflicted defense spending for too long and is becoming epidemic. The House overwhelmingly wants to spend what potentially would be $27 billion additionally for B-2 bombers that they can't find a military leader who will say we need. $27 billion. We hear time after time that we are not modernizing the force, that we are losing quality men and women out of the military, we are having to lower our recruitment standards in order to meet our quotas. What are we going to do to solve it? Spend $27 billion on B-2 bombers, add $28 million to the National Guard, and the pork barrel list goes on and on and on. 
I am telling you, from talking to my constituents, people are getting a little weary of it, Mr. President. So when this amendment comes up, I tell the chairman and the Democrat manager, I will want to talk again on it, not because it is a lot of money--$28 million is not a lot of money in a defense bill--but it is the wrong thing to do. It is wrong what we are doing in military construction in the bill and wrong what we are doing authorizing projects and programs that we don't need, when at the same time there are severe and fundamental problems in the military that are not being addressed, which means that the Congress of the United States isn't performing its responsibilities in a mature fashion and in a way that will provide for the national security of this country. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment today to strike the language in the bill that provides an additional $3.8 billion in subsidies for the ethanol industry. 
The amendment is very simple. It strikes in its entirety Section 707 of the bill, which would extend for an additional 7 years the tax credits for ethanol and methanol producers. The value of these ethanol subsidies is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at $3.8 billion in lost revenues. 
Mr. President, enough is enough. The American taxpayers have subsidized the ethanol industry, with guaranteed loans and tax credits, for more than 20 years. Since 1980, government subsidies for ethanol have totaled more than $10 billion. Section 707 of the bill, if not stricken, would give another $3.8 billion in tax breaks to ethanol producers. 
Current law provides tax credits for ethanol producers which are estimated to cost the Treasury $770 million a year in lost revenue, and the Congressional Research Service estimates that loss may increase to $1 billion by the year 2000. These huge tax credits effectively increase the tax burden on other businesses and individual taxpayers. 
The current tax subsidies for ethanol are scheduled to expire in the year 2000. This amendment does not change current law; it allows the existing generous subsidies to continue through the year 2000. The amendment merely ensures that the subsidies do expire and are not extended for another 7 years. 
Mr. President, let me just take a moment and try to explain why we have such generous ethanol subsidies in law today. The rationale for ethanol subsidies has changed over the years, but unfortunately, ethanol has never lived up to the claims of any of its diverse proponents. 
In the late 1970's, during the energy crisis, ethanol was supposed to help the U.S. lessen its reliance on oil. But ethanol use never took off, even when gasoline prices were highest and lines were longest. 
Then, in the early 1980's, ethanol subsidies were used to prop up America's struggling corn farmers. Unfortunately, the usual trickle down effect of agricultural subsidies is clearly evident. Beef and dairy farmers, for example, have to pay a higher price for feed corn, which is then passed on in the form of higher prices for meat and milk. The average consumer ends up paying the cost of ethanol subsidies in the grocery store. 
By the late 1980's, ethanol became the environmentally correct alternative fuel. Unfortunately, the Department of Energy has provided statistics showing that it takes more energy to produce a gallon of ethanol than the amount of energy that gallon of ethanol contains. In addition, the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Department of Energy all acknowledge that the environmental benefits of ethanol use, at least in terms of smog reduction, are yet unproven. 
In addition, ethanol is an inefficient, expensive fuel. Just look at the 3- to 5-cent-per-gallon increase in gasoline prices during the winter months in the Washington, D.C. area when ethanol is required to be added to the fuel. 
Finally, let me quote Stephen Moore, of the CATO Institute, who puts it very succinctly in a recent paper: 
* * * [V]irtually every independent assessment--by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, NBC News and several academic journals--has concluded that ethanol subsidies have been a costly boondoggle with almost no public benefit. 
So why do we continue to subsidize the ethanol industry? I think James Bovard of the CATO Institute put it best in a 1995 policy paper: 
* * * [O]ne would be hard-pressed to find another industry as artificially sustained as the ethanol industry. The economics of ethanol are such that, for the industry to survive at all, massive trade protection, tax loopholes, contrived mandates for use, and production subsidies are vitally necessary. Only by spooking the public with bogey-men such as foreign oil sheiks, toxic air pollution, and the threatened disappearance of the American farmer can attention be deflected from the real costs of the ethanol house of cards that consumes over a billion dollars annually. 
Mr. President, the House Ways and Means Committee took a bold step and included in its revenue reconciliation bill a phase-out of ethanol subsidies. In the report accompanying the bill, the Committee stated: 
[Ethanol tax subsidies] were assumed to be temporary measures that would allow these fuels to become economical without permanent Federal subsidies. Nearly 20 years have passed since that enactment, and neither the projected prices of oil nor the ability of ethanol to be a viable fuel without Federal subsidies has been realized. The Committee determined, therefore, that enactment of an orderly termination of this Federal subsidy program is appropriate at this time. 
And what does the Senate Finance Committee say to support its decision to extend the ethanol subsidies beyond their current expiration date? Listen to this: 
The Committee believes that continued assurance of tax benefits for ethanol are [sic] an important signal to encourage the use of alternative fuels. 
I commend Chairman Bill Archer for his decision to try to phase out ethanol subsidies. The provision in the House bill would have saved almost $250 million in the next three years. Unfortunately, I understand the provision will be removed from the House bill because of opposition in the ethanol industry. I am very disappointed that the House is taking this step back from ending ethanol subsidies. 
Mr. President, we should end these subsidies. We cannot afford to subsidize the ethanol industry at a time when we are struggling with the dilemma of balancing the budget while maintaining our commitments to our senior citizens, taking care of our poor and disadvantaged citizens, and ensuring a healthy and secure future for our children. 
Current law terminates ethanol subsidies after the year 2000. This amendment would avoid the $3.8 billion cost of extending the ethanol subsidies. I urge my colleagues to oppose changing current law and adopt my amendment to strike Section 707 from the bill.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about actions taken in the reconciliation bills by the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means Committees to modify the current aviation excise tax structure. Although somewhat different from each other, both of the proposed modifications would increase taxes on airline passengers, and represent significant changes in aviation policy. 
Last year, Commerce Committee members worked closely with members of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees, during consideration of the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, to establish the National Civil Aviation Review Commission. The members of this Commission have dedicated themselves to developing a consensus within the aviation industry regarding the appropriate financing mechanism for the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], and the important safety programs it oversees. Together, the committees empaneled the Commission to consider substantive policy changes to the aviation excise tax formula, and I believe that the Commission should be given every opportunity to do so. The reconciliation bill should not make substantive changes to the tax formula without the benefit of the Commission s work.

Mr. President, I join with my colleague and friend, Senator Dodd, in introducing a joint resolution calling on the President to take concrete steps to increase the level of international cooperation in combating the flow of narcotics into this country, and to lead America toward coming to grips with the domestic demand that is tearing this country apart while enriching the drug cartels of Latin America and our own organized crime groups. 
This legislation acknowledges the problems endemic in waging the war on drugs while domestic demand continues to remain high. It further recognizes the failure of numerous previous efforts at stemming the flow of illegal narcotics. It consequently expresses the sense of Congress that the President should appoint a high level task force, to be chaired by the Director of the Office of National Drug Policy, to establish a framework for improving international cooperation in these efforts. Finally, and of particular importance, it suspends for 2 years the process by which countries are certified as cooperating in the war on drug. 
The drug problem in this country dates at least as far back as the Civil War, when wounded soldiers were turned into morphine addicts as the only way to deaden the horrific pain caused from battle and disease. The problem grew to such an extent that President Nixon felt compelled to establish the Drug Enforcement Administration in order to better coordinate the antidrug effort. President Reagan assigned Vice President Bush to oversee a major escalation in the war on drugs, a war carried on at considerable monetary cost throughout the Bush administration. President Clinton, to his credit, appointed perhaps our finest `drug czar' in Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who has waged the drug war as valiantly as he led troops in combat during Desert Storm. 
And still, the flow of illegal narcotics continues virtually unimpeded. Record-breaking seizures serve mainly to remind us of how much more is getting through our porous borders undetected. Street prices alert us to the failure of our best efforts at putting a dent in the problem of drug trafficking. To the extent that one area, for example, cocaine, is tackled with any degree of success, another bigger problem--the resurgence of heroin abuse comes to mind--rises up in its place. Clearly, it is time to step back again and look more critically at every facet of the problem. 
I do not believe `chicken-and-egg' debates about which problem, supply or demand, should take higher priority serve any useful purpose. The bill we are offering today addresses both problems. Nor I believe the certification process has accomplished its intended goal any more than such processes ever really do irrespective of the subject matter. In fact, the decision by the White House to decertify Colombia, which has waged a valiant and costly--in both lives and treasure--struggle against extremely powerful and ruthless cartels while recertifying Mexico, whose law enforcement agencies are so rife with corruption that that country's equivalent of General McCaffrey was arrested for drug-related crimes, illuminates all too well the impracticality of the current process. 
It is easy to argue that the drug problem has been studied to death. It has not, however, been examined from the perspective, and at the level, recommended in this resolution. If I believed for a second that this resolution represented just another attempt at studying the problem of drugs, I would not have attached my name to it. The recommended steps, however, combined with the suspension of the drug certification process, constitute a real and meaningful effort at focusing the Nation's attention on one of our most serious problems. Drugs are, in every sense of the word, a scourge upon our society. We must take a comprehensive, sober look at the scale of the problem and what realistically can be done about it. We must do this domestically and internationally. We must, once and for all, wage the war on drugs as though we intend to prevail. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives will support this legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I voted for an amendment to the Budget Act which would improve access to health insurance for uninsured children in our country by providing an additional $8 billion to the $16 billion already contained in this bill for children's health care. This $24 billion in new Federal funding will allow us to expand Medicaid coverage for very low-income children and will put affordable health care insurance within the reach of every family. 
I am deeply concerned about the approximately 10 million children in our country who are currently lacking health insurance coverage. It is distressing that such a large number of our children lack access to primary and preventative care. I find it even more disconcerting that recent reports indicate that most of these children reside in families with one or more working parents. 
Providing access to health care for uninsured children has been a priority for me since coming to the Senate. During the 103d Congress, I offered legislation which attempted to address this problem and provide access to health care for many of our Nation's uninsured children. This issue has remained a high priority for me in the 105th Congress and I am pleased that we were able to pass this amendment today. 
This amendment is financed by a 20-cent-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax, which will raise enough revenues to provide the additional $8 billion for children's health insurance coverage. Although I have traditionally opposed new taxes, I believe that this proposal is necessary to help working parents purchase affordable health care coverage for their children. 
I wholeheartedly believe that every child deserves a healthy beginning in life. There should not be any children in our country who cannot count on access to quality health care when they need it. I believe that this bipartisan children's health insurance proposal will address this problem in a fiscally responsible manner and allow us to provide coverage to our Nation's most vulnerable population.

Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I agree. I would also like to offer my support for the allocation of new spectrum for use by public safety and public service organizations, and would urge the FCC to adopt rules that would facilitate, if not promote, the development of shared radio systems by such entities. I also know that Senators Stevens, Lott, and Burns have been very concerned and involved in this issue. I look forward to working with them and Senator Bryan to ensure that the Commission takes such action as necessary to deal with this subject and I am also hopeful that we can, if needed, clarify any problem with this language in conference.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to have cosponsored amendment No. 428, which will significantly reduce fraud, abuse, and waste in the Medicare system. This is an issue which I have been working on for many years and I am pleased to have been joined in this battle to combat fraud and abuse in our health care system by my colleague from Iowa, Senator Tom Harkin. 
This important amendment introduced by Senator Harkin incorporates portions of my legislation, the Medicare Whistleblower Act S. 235, which would assist Medicare beneficiaries with identifying provider fraud in the Medicare system. 
Over and over again, I have heard from seniors about their personal experiences with fraudulent and negligent billings throughout the Medicare Program. Many of these seniors say that their Medicare bills frequently include charges for medical services which they never received, double billings for a specific treatment, or charges which are disproportionate and severely marked up. Usually, most of these seniors have no idea what Medicare is being billed on their behalf, and they have no way to obtain a detailed explanation from the Medicare providers. 
These personal stories from senior citizens are confirmed by analyses and detailed studies. According to the General Accounting office, fraud and abuse in our Nation's health care system costs taxpayers as much as $100 billion each year. Medicare fraud alone costs about $17 billion per year which is about 10 percent of the program's costs. 
This is quite disconcerting, especially in light of the financial problems facing our Medicare system. 
A fundamental problem with the Medicare system is that most beneficiaries are not concerned with the costs of the program because the Government is responsible for them. One of my constituents shared with me an experience he had when his provider double-billed Medicare for his treatment and the provider told him not to be concerned about it because `Medicare is paying the bill.' This is an outrage and we cannot allow this flagrant abuse of taxpayer dollars to continue. Remember, when Medicare overpays, we all over-pay, and costs to beneficiaries and the taxpayers spiral while the financial sustainability of the program is violated. 
The amendment addresses this fundamental problem in the Medicare program by strengthening the procedures for detecting and identifying fraud and waste in the Medicare system. Beneficiaries would be given the right to request and receive a written itemized copy of their medical bill from their Medicare health care provider. This itemized bill should be provided to the beneficiary within 30 days of the provider's receipt of their request. If anyone knowingly fails to provides a beneficiary with an itemized bill they will be subject to a civil fine. Once the beneficiary receives the itemized bill they would have 90 days to report any inappropriate billings to Medicare. The Medicare intermediaries and carriers would then have to review the bills and determine whether an inappropriate payment has been made and what amount should be reimbursed to the Medicare system. 
I recognize that provider fraud is not the sole source of waste and abuse in the Medicare system, and I wholeheartedly support other initiatives which address beneficiary fraud. However, studies indicate that provider fraud is most prevalent and the greatest concern for the system, making initiatives such as this one which specifically target provider fraud very important. 
It is imperative that we put an end to the rampant abuse and fraud in the Medicare system. I wholeheartedly believe that this provision would contribute significantly to this effort.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to have offered an amendment to the budget reconciliation package which provides incentives for States with expanding access to health care coverage under the Medicaid system to devise innovative and cost effective programs. This amendment is important to any State interested in best serving the health care needs of its people. 
My amendment authorizes the continuation of a State's Medicaid managed care program operating under a section 1115 waiver. States would have the option of requesting an automatic extension of their waiver program for 3 years or permanently continuing their waiver managed care program if it has successfully operated for at least 5 years and has demonstrated an ability to successfully contain costs and provide access to health care. 
In addition, this amendment allows these same States to utilize their own resources to revise their programs and expand coverage, while reducing both State and Federal costs. 
The amendment will assist States in expanding health care coverage to their most vulnerable populations. This is something Congress has spent a great deal of time talking about during this session of Congress in terms of children. But children are not the only ones for whom health coverage is a priority. There are still millions of people in this country who live below the poverty line who do not have coverage. Unfortunately, we often forget about these individuals. 
Several States have led the way in innovation for expanding coverage through cost containment: Tennessee, Oregon, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Arizona. My home State, Arizona, was the first to recognize that improved quality, better access and reduced costs could be achieved through the appropriate use of managed care as an integrated approach to health care for low income people. 
These States have summoned the political will and marshaled their State resources to improve their health care programs while reducing both State and Federal costs. Many new States are now following the examples set by the pioneers and have filed statewide section 1115 waiver requests to move their programs into managed care. 
In Arizona, 72 percent of the voters decided last fall that health care should be available to everyone under the poverty line. Arizona already covers children up to 133 percent over the poverty line. This means Arizona decided to cover the 50,000 men and women without children who live under the poverty line. This is their only hope of health care coverage. 
Unfortunately, the administration has recently erected additional barriers to Arizona's initiative. In spite of the substantial savings documented by Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] evaluators since the program began in 1982, more than enough to offset the cost of expanding coverage, the administration would not allow Arizona to reinvest these savings it achieved over a traditional fee-for-service program in expanded coverage. Nor will HCFA allow the State credit for their program's expected savings over the next 5 years. 
States like Arizona which have successfully been operating under an 1115 Medicaid waiver should not be penalized for a change in Federal guidelines which occurred after the program began. No one is questioning whether these States have saved the Federal Government millions. Arizona, Tennessee, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and any other State with such a proven track record, should be allowed to use the managed care savings it achieved over a traditional fee-for-service program to expand coverage for their most vulnerable populations. 
This important amendment assists States in providing access to health care for the most vulnerable populations.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate took several difficult votes in the last two days related to Medicare reform. After carefully considering each of the amendments offered in the Senate, I cast my vote in favor of preserving and protecting the long-term solvency of the Medicare system. 
I voted for an amendment to eliminate the bill's provisions which would require means testing of Medicare premiums. I also voted for an amendment which would have simply delayed the implementation of premium means testing until the year 2000. I believe it is foolish to hastily make such a drastic change as this without the benefit of an indepth study of the entire Medicare Program. Unfortunately, both of these amendments failed. 
I am concerned about the bill's provisions which would delay the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 from the current age of 65. However, the bill would not implement this change until the year 2003, which will not affect current beneficiaries and, I believe, will allow us to assess this change within the context of a larger study of the program. 
The bill does establish a bipartisan commission to study the entire Medicare Program and make recommendations for the changes necessary to keep the program solvent beyond the year 2001, which is when the trustees have reported the program will be bankrupt. I believe we should wait for the commission's recommendations before enacting any fundamental changes to the program. However, I felt it was important to show a willingness to consider taking a first step toward long-term structural changes in order to give impetus to the commission's work. 
The budget reconciliation bill before the Senate contains many key provisions to expand benefits under Medicare and incorporate choice and competition into the current program. For example, the bill authorizes Medicare coverage of mammography screening, colorectal screening, bone mass measurement, and diabetes management. It also creates a Medicare Choice Program and a demonstration program for medical savings accounts for seniors. It contains provisions designed to eliminate waste and fraud in the Medicare system which could result in significant savings. These are improvements to Medicare for which I have fought for many years. 
I believe firmly that our priority must remain protecting the Medicare system from bankruptcy by the year 2001, and I will continue to work toward that goal.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which would allow States to continue offering innovative cost effective health care through an 1115 Medicaid waiver on a permanent basis or on a continuous basis for 3 years. In addition, this measure would ensure that State's are given credit for the cost savings which they have incurred by operating an efficient managed care Medicaid program. 
Several States have led the way in innovation for expanding coverage through cost containment. These States have not used accounting gamesmanship to ask the Federal Government to do the job; they have used their own resources to revise their programs to expand coverage while reducing both State and Federal costs. 
Among these States is Arizona, Oregon, Rhode Island, Florida, and Tennessee. Any other State operating under an 1115 waiver may find herself in the same position. 
In Arizona, 72 percent of her voters decided last fall that they should cover everyone under the poverty line, whether man, woman, or child. This initiative is the only hope for health care coverage for 50,000 men who live under the poverty line. Arizona can afford to do this because of the success of the Arizona statewide managed care program. AHCCCS [access] in containing cost and providing access to care. This has been proven. The satisfaction of Arizona's health care providers, members, and taxpayers further underscore the success of the program. 
In spite of substantial savings documented by HCFA hired evaluators, documented savings since the program began in 1982, more than enough to offset the cost of expanding coverage, the Federal Government won't allow Arizona to reinvest the savings it achieved over a traditional fee-for-service program in expanded coverage. Nor will HCFA allow the State credit for their program's savings over the next 5 years. 
Other States have been allowed to use the savings managed care achieves over a traditional fee-for-service program in expanded coverage including the States of Tennessee, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Oregon among others. 
The rationale for treating Arizona different from these other States boils down to timing. When Arizona's program began in 1982, HCFA did not use a test of budget neutrality for approving section 1115 research and demonstration waivers. The budget neutrality requirement that is now applied was put in place several years later. If Arizona had a test of budget neutrality in 1982 where the baseline was a traditional fee-for-service program, then the State would be allowed to use its managed care savings. Because the requirement did not exist, the State is penalized. 
HCFA now indicates that the test of budget neutrality is the current, cost-saving, successful AHCCCS program, not the traditional fee-for-service program. 
Arizona should not be penalized for a change in Federal guidelines which occurred after the program began. No one is questioning whether AHCCCS saved the Federal Government millions. Arizona, as Tennessee, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and any other State with such a proven track record, should be allowed to use the managed care savings it achieved over a traditional fee-for-service program to expand coverage as Arizona voters overwhelmingly requested.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to S. 947, the Budget Reconciliation Act, that will redress what I assume to be an inadvertent omission in a section of this bill that discriminates against Amerasian children of U.S. military personnel who served in Vietnam. 
My amendment will add a new provision to section 5817 to include Amerasian children to the category of legal aliens eligible for Medicaid. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 excluded from eligibility these children of American soldiers because they are admitted as refugees under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Act of 1988, rather than section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, under which refugees are excepted from the Welfare Region legislation's ban on Medicaid, SSI, and other forms of assistance. This amendment corrects that oversight. 
Because there is a cost associated with this amendment, I propose to offset it by mandating that the Attorney General of the United States, acting through the Immigration and Naturalization Service, impose a $150 processing fee on each illegal alien deported from the United States who committed a felony while in this country. According to CBO, this will generate the revenue necessary to offset the cost of my amendment over the 5-year period for which the welfare bill excludes aliens from Medicaid eligibility. 
I hope that I can count on my colleagues' support for this worthwhile amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we begin consideration of the Senate's version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, I cannot help reflecting on the increasingly illogical nature of the process through which we have arrived at this point. By that I refer to the task of marking up yet another defense bill while budgets continue to decline in real terms, force structure continues to contract, and operational requirements continue to climb, while Members of Congress continue to waste considerable sums on projects of questionable merit. 
Let me say first that there is much in this bill that warrants our support, including an active duty pay raise, improvements in the way housing allowances for military personnel are calculated and applied, funding for tactical aviation modernization and missile defense programs, increased emphasis on defense against chemical and biological weapons, and much more. 
The bill includes, for example, a provision authorizing the Department of Defense to waive CHAMPUS deductibles and annual fees for service members and their families who are stationed in remote duty locations within the continental United States. These families, most of whom are junior enlisted personnel, are geographically separated from military treatment facilities and TRICARE Prime sites and now rely to a great degree on standard CHAMPUS for health care services. The legislation also approves several survivor benefit plans that will alleviate much of the emotional anguish experienced by surviving spouses of military retirees. 
The committee also adopted an amendment that enhances aviation special pays. Compelling testimony from the service chiefs of the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps revealed that our Armed Forces are facing critical shortages of skilled aviators. It is clear that this provision will be crucial in retaining sufficient aviators to operate today's technically advanced aircraft. Any failure to address this issue would certainly have an enormous impact on future readiness. 
I was particularly pleased that the Armed Services Committee continued to focus on improving the system by which the services determine unit readiness levels. The Department of Defense is directed to continue its study of the merits of maintaining units at differing levels of readiness, depending upon actual deployability and the likelihood of each unit actually responding to a crisis. With budgets being as tight as they are while fiscally daunting modernization decisions are fast approaching, it is worth examining whether savings in the operations and maintenance accounts--the largest portion of the defense budget and the most difficult to track--can be identified and reallocated to high priority research and development and 
procurement programs. 
I recognize that there is already a considerable amount of tiering that occurs in the Navy simply by virtue of the deployment, training, and maintenance schedules it must follow in order to meet requirements. The Army and Air Force, however, may be a source of some savings if units whose deployability is highly contingent on air and sealift capabilities are permitted to relax their readiness levels to some degree. In fact, many Army personnel have expressed the sentiment that they would fare better if forced to perform fewer training exercises, which place a strain on people and equipment. 
I am not arguing that units should be permitted to atrophy; on the contrary, I would like to think that none of us would acquiesce in the implementation of policies that would place U.S. interests and military personnel at risk. It is a legitimate question, though, whether certain units must be retained at the highest readiness levels despite the improbability of deployment, given operational plans, and the time it would take for such units to deploy given available lift assets. 
One of the more significant actions taken by the committee involved termination of funding for the B-2 bomber, including of funds required to preserve that aircraft's industrial base. Opponents of the amendment to end the program once and for all argued that we need to maintain the ability to build more of these extremely technically complex aircraft in the event future contingencies require more stealth bombers. We already have enough strategic bombers in the inventory, however, and the Air Force has repeatedly testified that it does not want and cannot afford any more. Most important, the time it takes to build even one B-2 precludes our being able to surge produce them in the event of a major deterioration in the international environment. Should a major regional contingency arise, it will be fought with the bombers on-hand--not ones more than a year from being operational. 
Unfortunately, for all that is good in this bill, there is much that is wasteful. The manner in which shipbuilding and conversion dollars are allocated no longer bears any resemblance to actual military requirements and available resources, nor does it correspond to essential industrial base preservation concerns. Rational discourse on whether to incrementally fund a $5 billion aircraft carrier cannot occur without other shipbuilding interests demanding something for themselves. After all, what's another destroyer above and beyond the number requested and budgeted for? What's another LPD-class ship, or an AOE fast support ship, or another submarine? For the last several years, we have seen a dangerous trend whereby decisions on shipbuilding matters, more than any other--save for the depot issue--are predicated solely on parochial considerations. This situation has to stop. 
One of the more disappointing results of the Armed Services Committee's mark-up of this bill was the rejection of an amendment sponsored by Senators Robb, Levin, Coats, and myself that would have statutorily mandated the two base closure rounds called for in the Quadrennial Defense Review. There is a broad consensus that the Defense Department, even after the previous four rounds of such closings, continues to maintain considerably more infrastructure than it needs. The expenditures associated with maintaining these installations and facilities constitute a major drain on declining resources allocated for national defense. Rejection of the amendment represented a serious setback in the efforts of some of us at instilling greater discipline into the budgetary process. 
Mr. President, you can support the Reserve component of our total force without acquiescing in the thorough hemorrhaging of scarce military construction dollars for National Guard projects. The total military construction budget request for projects located inside the United States was $2 billion, not including another $2 billion for base closure activities. The request for National Guard and Reserve construction projects was $172 million. Of the 87 military construction projects added to the administration's request, 46--more than half--are for the National Guard and Reserve. The Senate bill includes over $900 million in National Guard and Reserve procurement items, the House version $700 million. 
As I have already noted, the bill includes an ample supply of pork-barrel projects, including continued funding of High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, or HAARP. This project, while certainly interesting from a purely theoretical perspective, is thoroughly lacking in merit and does not belong in a defense spending bill. Nor do additional dollars for the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The Navy, out of whose budget this project is funded, derives no tangible return on its investment. This nondefense program may deserve to be funded in another area of the Federal budget, but it does not belong in this bill. Individually, projects like these are a serious waste of taxpayer dollars. Collectively, they constitute a serious drain on the resources needed to ensure future military readiness. 
In short, Mr. President, it is regrettable that the propensity of Members to continue to add pork as though it were still the early 1980's remains as strong as ever.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the public diplomacy conducted by the United States Information Agency, which, under the terms of the legislation before us, will be folded into the Department of State, USIA, as we are all aware, oversees the Voice of America and, more recently, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 
It has often been pointed out that, after the guns fall silent, the United States rushes to disarm. Many in this chamber would argue that such disarmament is being undertaken once again in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union and consequent end to the cold war. We are not here, however, to debate issues of military strategy and force structure. That discussion will take place in the near future when the defense authorization bill comes to the floor. 
The issue I wish to address today, however, is closely related to the phenomenon involving large-scale reductions in the size and aggregate capability of our Armed Forces in times of peace. There is another element to what has been called the arsenal of democracy that is vital to our national defense, yet which receives little attention and operates with minimal funding. That instrument of foreign policy is public diplomacy--the conveyance of accurate, objective news to people who otherwise are not exposed to a free flow of information, who have the misfortune of living in countries ruled by dictatorial regimes. 
Mr. President, there is little that an authoritarian or totalitarian government fears as much as the dissemination of truth. Whether broadcasts into German-occupied France or Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty transmissions behind the Iron Curtain, the truth is a powerful weapon when wielded with fortitude in the struggle against tyranny. The images of individuals and families hiding in darkened basements, gathered around a radio, volume kept low so as to avoid detection, is compelling. It is an image that has captured millions over the decades. Distribution of radio sets and literature can play as important a role in the fight for freedom as the aircraft, tanks, and ships on which we expend billions of dollars. 
The post-cold-war era coincides with the explosion in what has come to be known as the `Information Age.' As portable and home computers become more readily available, the ability to disseminate information has reached levels previously only imagined. It is very important that the United States not ignore this potential in the continuing fight for self-determination and democratization. 
I remain a strong supporter of the public diplomacy activities of the U.S. Government. It is true that the end of the cold war has diminished the need for Radio Free Europe. It has not, however, eliminated that need, as political turmoil in Albania and the ongoing problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as in Serbia itself, attest. Furthermore, while I am a strong supporter of maintaining open ties with China, including in the area of trade, the advent of Radio Free Asia is an essential element in our long-term effort at facilitating a transformation in that country toward a more liberal political system characterized by free speech. 
The bill currently before us restructures our public diplomacy apparatus to both streamline the bureaucracies and ensure their continued vitality and independence. Those are worthy goals deserving of our support. While I am concerned about the effort to retain Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty within the U.S. Government rather than privatize it as directed in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for fiscal years 1994-1995, the attention afforded public diplomacy in the State Department authorization bill for fiscal year 1998 is highly commendable. 
Public diplomacy remains an important instrument of our foreign policy. The free flow of information will never wane as an essential element of our national security apparatus. Truth remains the greatest enemy of tyranny, and until liberal democracies are firmly entrenched in every country of every region of the world, we must continue to support such activities. 
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is basically a technical correction to language that I had included in the Fiscal Year 1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. That language, and the amendment I offer today, are designed to make humanitarian exceptions for the unmarried adult children of former re-education camp detainees seeking to emigrate to the United States under the Orderly Departure Program. Despite what I considered to have been pretty unambiguous legislation in both word and intent, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and Department of State interpreted my amendment to the 1997 bill so as to exclude the very people to whom the provision was targeted. 
Prior to April 1995, the adult married children of former Vietnamese re-education camp prisoners were granted derivative refugee status and were permitted to accompany their parents to the United States under a sub-program of the Orderly Departure Program [ODP]. 
This policy changed in April 1995. My amendment to FY1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, which comprises part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, was intended to restore the status quo ante regarding the adult unmarried children of former prisoners. My comments in the Congressional Record from July 25, 1996 clearly spelled this out. 
Unfortunately, certain categories of children who, prior to April 1995 had received derivative refugee status and whom Congress intended to be covered by last year's amendment, are now considered ineligible to benefit from that legislation. 
To ask these widows to come to the United States without their children is equal to denying them entry under the program. Many of these women are elderly and in poor health, and the presence of their children is essential to providing the semblance of a family unit with the care that includes. 
The second problem stemming from INS and the State Department's interpretation of the 1997 language involves the roughly 20 percent of former Vietnamese re-education camp prisoners resettled in the United States who were processed as immigrants, at the convenience of the United States Government. 
Their unmarried adult children, prior to April 1995, were still given derivative refugee status, however, the position of INS and State is that these children are now ineligible because the language in the FY 1997 bill included the phrase `processed as refugees for resettlement in the United States.' 
That phrase was intended to identify the children of former prisoners being brought to the United States under the subprogram of the ODP and eligible to be processed as a refugee--which all clearly were--as distinct from the children of former prisoners who were not being processed for resettlement in the United States. 
The fact that a former prisoner, eligible to be processed as a refugee under the ODP subprogram, was processed as an immigrant had no effect prior to April 1995, and their children were granted refugee status. The intention of last year's legislation was to restore the status quo ante, including for the unmarried adult children of former prisoners eligible for and included in this subprogram but resettled as immigrants.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with Senator Hollings, the National Physical Fitness and Sports Foundation Establishment Act. This bill would create a charitable, not-for-profit foundation to raise funds from the private sector to support the activities of the President's Council on Physical Fitness. 
The President's Council presently relies on Federal appropriations to support its activities. In each of the last 2 fiscal years, the President's Council has received appropriations of approximately $1 million. Future appropriations for the Mr. President's Council are at risk as we strive to balance the Federal budget. 
The foundation created by this bill would raise private funds to sustain the President's Council on Physical Fitness. To facilitate fundraising, the foundation is permitted to offer the use of the seal of the President's Council for promotional purposes in exchange for sponsorship funds. The bill does not authorize the expenditure of Federal funds. 
The primary goal of the President's Council is to foster programs that encourage people of all ages to participate regularly in sports and physical activities. The President's Council focuses on grassroots, community-based programs. Perhaps the Council's most well known activity is the President's Challenge Physical Fitness Awards Program which is administered by teachers and youth programs across the country. 
We should act to preserve the President's Council. Its activities are particularly important because our Nation's children are becoming increasingly less physically fit even as we learn that physical fitness in one's youth is important to living a healthy life during adulthood.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague Senator Bob Graham in sponsoring the reauthorization legislation for the national Area Health Education Center Program. 
The Graham-McCain reuthorization legislation represents the consensus opinion of the Area Health Education Center community nation-wide. The Area Health Education Center Program Extension Act strives to not only reauthorize the existing act, but to do so in an innovative manner. 
Currently, 42 States participate in the AHEC program which originated in 1976 when Congress recognized the lack of quality health care available in our country--especially in our rural and low income urban communities. Too many of these cities and towns did not have access to primary medical care services. Too many communities were losing their bright, educated youth to the larger, economically strong cities and medical communities. Our rural and low income communities were faced with many disadvantages including shortages of physicians and a lack of access to basic health care services. 
In response to the health care problems facing our rural and low income urban communities, Congress created the Area Health Education Center Program to generate partnerships between medical schools or academic health centers and rural areas throughout a State. Through these partnerships the AHEC program strives to improve the supply and distribution of health care professionals while increasing access to quality health care. 
The AHEC programs work to meet the medical needs of undeserved areas by creating and implementing innovative methods and educational partnerships. Each AHEC program is individually established and created on a State-by-State basis and provides health professional student training, continuing professional education, student recruitment and placement, development of remote site learning resources, and other projects designed to influence the quantity and distribution of health personnel. Several years ago, this program was expanded to include the Health Education Training Center (HETC) program which addresses the high impact needs which exist in certain areas--particularly those along the Mexican-American border. 
However, despite all the progress and success of the AHEC and HETC programs over the last 21 years, the need for recruiting and keeping health care professionals still remains a challenge for many of our rural and low-income urban communities. This is why Senator Graham and I, along with 16 of our colleagues are introducing the Area Health Education Center Program Extension Act. 
The Graham-McCain reauthorization of the Area Health Education Center Program Extension Act would reauthorize for 5 years the core AHEC program and the existing HETC program. This bill would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants and enter into contracts with schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine to develop AHEC and HETC programs. 
Under this bill, AHEC and HETC programs are required to continue improving the distribution of health professionals in communities with serious, unmet health care needs. The programs are also required to increase the number of primary care providers in under served areas while recruiting individuals from these areas and from populations not equally represented into health professions. In addition, the AHEC and HETC programs are responsible for conducting training and education activities for health care students, including medical residents. 
Initially, funding for AHEC programs is a Federal responsibility. However, after the first 6 years of operation the AHEC program must obtain 50 percent of their funding from their State, county or municipal government or the private sector in order to continue receiving matching Federal funding. 
It is important that we continue to support and promote programs like AHEC and HETC which have developed and are implementing innovative, effective and efficient approaches for making high quality health care accessible throughout our Nation, particularly in rural communities, border States and low-income urban areas. 
I believe the AHEC and HETC programs are both bright lights with regard to the potential for addressing the health provider shortage and unmet medical needs in our country. Both the AHEC and HETC programs have clearly demonstrated they are fulfilling a very definite need and ought to be reauthorized and extended. These programs have tremendous potential to continue assisting in effectively addressing the critical health problems in our communities. I urge all of my colleagues to review this important legislation and consider joining us as a cosponsor of this bill.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the administration, today I am introducing legislation to disestablish the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps. This legislation is long overdue on the part of the administration, and I am pleased to be able to initiate a possible resolution on this issue. 
In 1807, an organization known as the Coast Survey was established; this organization would later become NOAA. The Survey was responsible for charting the U.S. coastline, and its civilian employees were often augmented with military personnel. This interaction between the Survey and the military continued, and, during World Wars I and II, members of the Survey served to defend our Nation. At the end of World War II, these members retained their military rank and compensation but returned to civilian duties as the NOAA Corps. Today, the corps numbers approximately 300 officers. 
The corps operates the NOAA Fleet, flies the agency's hurricane research planes, and conducts a variety of activities essential for managing the Nation's natural resources. This bill seeks to maintain these services while improving the cost-effectiveness of the program. Under this legislation, civilian service positions would be created equivalent to existing NOAA Corps positions. Those officers with less than 15 years service would be eligible for these new civilian positions, while those with more than 15 years of service would be retired. Retired officers would still have an opportunity to compete for additional NOAA positions, as determined by the Under Secretary. The entire corps retirement program would be transferred to the Department of the Navy under this proposal. 
Disestablishment of the corps has been recommended by the Vice President's National Performance Review, the Government Accounting Office, and the inspector general of the Department of Commerce. The GAO estimates that this bill would save $5 million over a 10-year period. 
I am concerned that the NOAA Corps officers be treated fairly, and I understand that several of my colleagues have additional concerns about the impacts of this legislation. I look forward to addressing these issues through the committee process.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank you, and I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. As always, they have done a very dedicated and very important job here. 
As I always do on these bills, Mr. President, I am compelled to talk about some of the parts of this bill which were added which I find very objectionable and which I find unacceptable. I, again, lament that these really nonessential and sometimes wasteful appropriations are added to a bill that is labeled an `emergency supplemental appropriations bill.' 
Mr. President, in this bill, some that I have found--I am sure there are others--are that it makes an additional $35 million available for new grants under the Commerce Department Advanced Technology Program. I am the chairman of the Commerce Committee. The Advanced Technology Program falls under the responsibility of the Commerce Committee. We have been investigating that program. We have had a lot of effort put in to making sure the best methods are used for selecting the recipients of these grants. And now in an emergency bill, we see $35 million for new grants under the Advanced Technology Program. 
It earmarks $5 million for the study of water allocation issues in Alabama, Florida and Georgia; $10 million for transportation planning and other purposes at Yosemite National Park; $15 million for research on environmental factors affecting breast cancer; $650,000 for the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education. Someone has to help me out here. Where is the emergency? Where is the emergency that requires $650,000 for the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education? 
It earmarks $5 million for the development of a legislative information system in the Office of the Secretary of the Senate; 
And $16 million to continue development of an automated targeting system for the Customs Service; a set-aside, Mr. President--a set-aside--of $12.3 million for discretionary authority to construct a parking garage at a VA medical center in Cleveland, OH. Do you want me to tell you that again? Mr. President, $12.3 million for the construction of a parking garage at a VA medical center in Cleveland, OH. I know this bill covers a lot of disaster areas. I don't believe Cleveland, OH, was an area that was afflicted, and certainly I do not suspect that a garage for a VA medical center would be an emergency. 
There is an earmark of $500,000 from previously appropriated funds for a parking garage--another parking garage--in Ashland, KY, to instead restore the Paramount Theater in that city; authorization to make grants under the Center for Ecology Research and Training for Bay City, MI. 
There are others, Mr. President. This is really not fair to the American people, it is not fair to the taxpayers, and I wish we would stop these things. I, frankly, grow weary. 
I want to talk about an important part of this bill, and that is the provision which has been put in the bill which prevents the President from shutting down the Government. That is what it is all about. It prevents the President from shutting down the Government. 
As we know, in the last 2 years, one time he shut down the Government and another time the Congress was forced to add some $8 to $9 billion in additional spending which they otherwise wouldn't because of a threat to shut down the Government. Why would I care and why should we care, when we are talking about disasters, about the shutdown of the Government? Because the shutdown of the Government was a manmade disaster, Mr. President. 
The shutdown of Government was a manmade disaster that afflicted the lives of millions of Americans and if it happens again because of our failure to do our work, we will, again, 
inflict pain and punishment on the American people. 
I was interested in and I appreciate the comments just made by the Senator from California about Yosemite National Park. There is a report on the `Economic Importance of National Parks: The Effects of the 1995-96 Government Shutdown on Selected Park-Dependent Businesses and Communities.' This is a report of the National Parks and Conservation Associations. 
On page 8 it says:  
Impacts were substantial in and around California's national parks, in spite of the fact that they were not in their peak seasons when the shutdowns occurred. 
The report goes on to say: 
At Yosemite National Park, an off season hardly exists. Impacts in and around the park, which normally receives more than 120,000 visitors in December, were the worst encountered in our investigation. 
And then it goes on to quote Gilbert Ghyselinck, owner of Yosemite Gateway Inn, estimated loss, $45,000; Jim Houtz, owner of the Cedar Lodge Inn and Parkline Restaurants in El Portal, CA, south of Yosemite, estimated loss, $40,000 to $50,000. `We put about 50 people on unemployment. It was pretty rough. The part that hurt us the worst was putting those people on unemployment when they were trying to put away for the winter.' 
Mr. President, I want to point out they were not Federal workers. They were people who were never repaid, never repaid for our shutdown of the Government. 
A gentleman in Oakhurst, CA: 
That Christmas and New Year's shutdown was the toughest on us. We're close to full that time of year--90 percent occupancy. I think we barely made 50 percent. It was only 10 days, but it was the 10 days you want. It's also had some lingering effect. 
Cheryl Tyler, of Oasis of Eden Inn, Yucca Valley, CA, estimated loss, $30,000. Cheryl Tyler said: 
It really killed us. They were canceling as fast they could get on the phone. People booked for 5 days. They stayed one night and left. We lost half our business. 
It goes on and on. Mr. President, this is what happens when you shut down the Government. I am totally and completely in sympathy with my colleagues who are seeking disaster relief. We, on this side of the aisle, are also seeking disaster relief. We are seeking relief from a disaster to ensure that it will never happen again. 
I would like to quote from a study that was made by the Congressional Research Service, a CRS report for Congress entitled `Shutdown of the Federal Government: Effects on the Federal Workforce,' James McGrath, analyst, National Government Division, updated June 17, 1996, conducted by the Congressional Research Service. Let me just tell you some things they talk about. 
Examples of Federal services adversely affected by the shutdowns include those related to health, welfare, law enforcement, public safety, financial services, parks, museums, monuments, visas, passports, services to American Indians and services to veterans, among many others as listed below. 
Health: New patients not accepted into clinical research. Toxic waste cleanup at 609 sites stopped; 2,400 Superfund workers sent home. 
Welfare: 10,000 new Medicare applications, 212,000 Social Security card requests, 360,000 individual office visits, 13 million recipients of aid to families with dependent children, 273,000 foster care children, over 100,000 children receiving adoption assistance services, and over 100,000 Head Start children experienced delays. 
There were 10,000 home purchase loans and refinancing applications totaling 800 million dollars worth of mortgage loans for moderate- and low-income working families nationwide that were delayed. 
Law enforcement and public safety: Well, there is one good piece of news here, Mr. President, the suspension of investigative activities by the IRS. So I guess something good comes out of every disaster. But on a far more serious note, the Department of Justice suspended work on more than 3,500 bankruptcy cases. Delinquent child support cases were suspended, the deadbeat dads program. Closure of 368 National Park Service sites. Loss of 7 million visitors. Grand Canyon National Park, closed for the first time in its 76-year history. 
Local communities near national parks lost an estimated $14.2 million per day in tourism revenues. I point out, again, Mr. President, the people who lost those tourism revenues never got them back. 
It was not like the Federal workers, where they were repaid when we started the Government up again. 
Closure of national museums and monuments--the loss of some 2 million visitors; 20,000 to 30,000 applications by foreigners for visas to come to this country went unprocessed each day; 200,000 U.S. applications for passports went unprocessed; U.S. tourist industries and airlines sustained millions of dollars in losses because of visa and passport curtailment. 
The American Indians. I will quote Deborah Maddox, the acting deputy commissioner for the Bureau of Indian Affairs: 
We are getting close to an emergency situation. This week, we would be generating our general assistance payments for 53,000 individuals and families. These grants are for very basic needs and are for people who are not eligible for other services. 
Mr. President, American veterans sustained a major curtailment in services as a result of the Federal shutdown, ranging from health and welfare to finance and travel. They include cancellation of vocational rehabilitation appointments; nonprocessing of payments for compensation, pension and education claims; delayed payments of GI bill education checks and insurance death claims; and canceled counseling services to avoid foreclosures. It goes on and on. 
Mr. President, what we did when we shut down the Government was unconscionable and unacceptable, and it cannot be repeated. And for the life of me--for the life of me--I do not understand why. There is some connection being made between the extension of emergency disaster relief services and this provision in the bill. The only reason, Mr. President, there is a distinction being made is the President of the United States does not want to have to sign the bill with this in it because the President of the United States does not want to see legislation which would prevent his ability to shut down the Government. 
Mr. President, in the Washington Post not long ago, a few days ago, there was a letter from Mr. Albert R. Wynn, who is a U.S. Representative to Congress representing a district in the State of Maryland, very close to here in the District of Columbia, it is a letter to the editor of the Washington Post. 
While I recognize that The Post considers itself a national newspaper, as a U.S. Representative from the Washington region, I find portions of The Post's May 15 editorial `Fooling Around in the House' very troubling. 
I cosponsored the bipartisan `Government Shutdown Prevention Amendment' to the `Disaster Recovery Act of 1997.' The amendment guarantees that the federal government will remain open and functioning at current funding levels if Congress and the administration cannot agree on the details of the Federal budget. Basically, this amendment provides a safety net for federal employees and the American taxpaying public, which expects its government to provide uninterrupted service. Given the devastating psychological and economic effect the last government shutdown had on our region, I am concerned that The Post considers such an amendment `fooling around.' 
The Post's assertion that this amendment `would change the balance of power between the elected branches' and that `the effect would be to lock in place a new norm in which an agency's appropriations would be frozen from year to year unless Congress acted to raise--or lower--it' is just plain wrong. The amendment clearly sunsets in 1998, and thus would affect only the appropriations bills now under consideration . . . 
Let me remind The Post of the effects of the last shoutdown: The cost to the federal government was $1.5 billion; 170,000 veterans did not receive December 1995 Montgomery GI Bill education benefits on time; more than 200,000 passport applications were not processed; pay for more than 750,000 federal employees was delayed; 7 million national parks visits were prevented; 2 million visits to historic museums were prevented; 5,200 small businesses did not receive guaranteed financing; 1,036 contract bid opportunities were lost for small businesses, and 30,000 FHA single-family home loans could not be insured. 
For those who apparently think the Republicans are so humbled that they wouldn't shut the government down again, I would remind them that we never thought the government would shut down during the Christmas season 1995. 
Thus, in the final analysis, I do not believe federal employees or taxpaying citizens think keeping the government open with a continuing resolution is `Fooling Around in the House.' 
Mr. President, I cannot say it any better. We have an obligation to provide for the needs of those who have suffered natural disasters. There is no one who sponsors this amendment who disagrees with that. And we want that money there as quickly as possible. 
But I would allege, Mr. President, that when we ignore the possibility and fail to address the looming possibility of a manmade disaster which would be caused by the shutdown of the Federal Government, again, Mr. President, I cannot quite comprehend why we would not understand that we also have that obligation as well. 
So I hope the President of the United States will change his mind. The Senator from Alaska, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has said, and I have said, we would be willing to negotiate the details of this amendment. We would be more than happy to talk about satisfying some concerns as long as we preserve the basic principle of keeping the Government open. 
So, Mr. President, I believe we are going to pass this bill. I believe it is going to the President with it included in the bill. And I hope that the President of the United States will sign the bill, and then we would prevent again the disasters that we inflicted upon the American people during Christmas of 1995, for which not only did the American people suffer, but I have to tell you, in all candor, the reputation of the legislative branch of Government and the entire Federal Government, the governing body, suffered as well. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is important, as the Senator from Montana said, that we be on record on this issue because there are three pertinent facts that we cannot forget here. Over $26 billion is assumed to be raised from the spectrum auction in the budget. Both the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, and myself seriously question whether raising that much money is possible. 
Unlike fees or taxes, as we all know, spectrum auctions are a function of the free market, and its value is determined solely by supply and demand. Due to the volatility of this market, as we have seen recently, it is virtually impossible to accurately know what spectrum is worth and, since it is planned to be auctioned 5 years from now, what it will be worth. Even the expert agencies, CBO and FCC, have not been able to accurately gauge spectrum value. 
I understand the task of the budgeteers here on this issue, but it is very, very questionable, these figures. 
This amendment has been offered by both myself and my good friend, the ranking member and former chairman of the Commerce Committee, Mr. Hollings. Simply, this amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that if the estimates regarding spectrum auctions contained in this resolution prove not be accurate that spending will be adjusted accordingly. 
The budget agreement before the Senate relies heavily on spectrum revenues, particularly spectrum auctions, to reduce the deficit and achieve balance by the year 2002. If this resolution passes as currently drafted, the Commerce Committee will be asked to raise between $26 to $28 billion. With the exception of some ancillary fees, the bulk of what the Commerce Committee will be asked to raise is assumed to come from spectrum. 
Of the total $26.3 billion in estimated spectrum revenues, about 95 percent, or $24.3 billion, would be derived specifically from spectrum auctions. 
The problem is this: experience demonstrates that it's very difficult to reliably estimate what a given block of spectrum is likely to bring at auction. And therefore, as the chairman of the Commerce Committee, I am very concerned that the assumptions contained in the budget resolution will not actually raise the money needed. 
In a letter to me last February 26, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, a staunch proponent of spectrum auctions, said this about predicting spectrum auction values: 
Determining the value of spectrum in advance of an auction is very difficult, and not something the Commission ordinarily does. 
One of the benefits of the auction is that the value of spectrum is not determined by government, but by a marketplace in which businesses have actual plans to develop and use spectrum. The value of any block of spectrum in the market thus depends on a number of factors, [including] the location of the spectrum, its technical characteristics, the amount of spectrum to be assigned with each license, the availability of technology suitable for a given band, the amount of spectrum already available for provision of similar services, the number of incumbents presently occupying the spectrum, and whether incumbents will remain licensed in that spectrum or will be relocated to other spectrum. 
Not surprisingly, therefore, auction estimates have been inaccurate on both the high side, as well as the low side, ever since the FCC was given spectrum auction authority in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. 
For example, the very first estimates of the revenue spectrum auctions would generate were very low. At that time Congress predicted that spectrum auctions would generate approximately $10 billion over 5 years. The actual amount generated was over $22 billion in 3 years. 
Similarly, the auction of digital broadcast satellite spectrum was estimated to raise less than $40 million. That auction raised $683 million. 
Other spectrum auction estimates, however, have been very high. The recent auction of wireless communications spectrum, which we estimated in August of 1996 would generate $3 billion, raised only $14 million. 
All these estimates were based on information provided by a cross-section of experts, including telecom providers, the financial community, and the FCC and NTIA--the expert agencies in this area. I don't fault their expertise, nor am I suggesting that spectrum isn't a valuable commodity and shouldn't be auctioned. To the contrary, it is an extremely valuable natural resource, owned by the public, and allocation should occur by auction. 
What I am saying, however, is that just because auctions assign spectrum efficiently to its most valued use does not mean that they can be guaranteed to produce a certain dollar figure. They are not, and were never intended to be, the functional equivalent of cash machines. They function as a component of the free market and therefore are subject to great highs and lows. 
As Chairman Hundt recognizes, it is impossible, even for experts, to reliably predict the value that a given block of spectrum is likely to bring at auction. Despite this fact, however, this budget places substantial reliance on these inherently unreliable predictions of spectrum auction revenues to balance the budget. 
Here are my specific concerns with the spectrum auction budget assumptions: 
First, revenues from auctioning 100 MHz of spectrum formerly used by broadcasters for electronic news gathering are estimated to total $9.7 billion between 1998 and 2002. This estimate is based on the spectrum being roughly comparable in potential usefulness to the lucrative PCS spectrum. Now, however, FCC and NTIA say that this spectrum is not comparable to PCS 
spectrum because it's already occupied and not suitable for a wide range of potential uses. Thus, a critical element in estimating the spectrum's $9.7 billion value is not accurate. 
Second, another $6 billion is estimated to come from the auction of spectrum left over from the reallocation ordered in 1993, plus the auction of new spectrum at now-available higher frequencies. The problems here are that the leftover 1993 spectrum, standing alone, isn't expected to generate all that much, and nobody yet knows precisely what the new high-frequency spectrum is usable for. Thus, what anybody might realistically be expected to bid for it is, at best, a guess. Technology may prove us wrong. But no companies, based on current technology--are clambering for this spectrum. 
Third, $5.4 billion more is estimated to come from the auction of analog broadcast channels in the year 2002--even though most of these channels won't even be available for use until 2006. That's tantamount to speculating in spectrum futures. 
Moreover, given the broadcasters' vehement objections to being required to give the channels back by 2006 or any other date, we simply cannot be sure when--if ever--these channels will actually be freed up. As Chairman Hundt correctly noted in his February 26 letter,  
When incumbent licensees are present, these licensees often have incentives to oppose the use of auctions to assign licenses in that band. 
Thus, the value to bidders of essentially nonexistent channels has got to be seriously questioned. 
Fourth, even the projections surrounding the comparatively modest $700 million estimated to come from auctioning so-called 888 telephone numbers are flawed. The $700 million estimate was made before these numbers began being handed out for free some time ago. Based on the quantity of numbers left to auction now, however, the probable revenue would be perhaps half the original $700 million estimate. 
Fifth, the impact of these potentially flawed estimates is made worse by the large proportion of spectrum auction revenues that this budget scores in 2001 and 2002. Altogether 70 percent of the total spectrum auction 
revenues are called for to be generated during these 2 years. However, it is during these outyears that the most spectrum can be expected to be on the market, and the more spectrum you put on the market, the less you are likely to get for it--simple supply and demand. 
Finally, there's also a potential problem with the $2 billion lump sum tied to broadcasters' use of their digital TV channels for non-HDTV uses. This $2 billion represents about a 7-percent hit on the $30 billion television broadcast industry. I am not one to protect the broadcast industry, but I am concerned about this fee. In the past, Senator Dole and I had advocated auctioning the digital spectrum before it was given to the broadcasters. That auction alone is estimated to have raised between $20 to $70 billion. However, we were unsuccessful and that spectrum was given free of charge to the broadcasters. 
Madam President, balancing the budget is critically important to the future of our country's economy, and spectrum auction revenues have been made critically important to balancing the budget. We must therefore be extremely concerned about the considerable uncertainty inherent in accurately predicting the amount of money spectrum auctions will generate, and we must have an insurance policy against the very real likelihood that these estimates will turn out to be too high. 
Madam President, I hope this amendment will pass. Voting for it does not mean that Senators oppose the budget resolution itself. However, supporting this amendment does recognize that the auction numbers assumed in this resolution are subject may not produce the revenue noted and that therefore, the Congress may need to act on this matter in the future.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the amendment is very simple. It just says we will not have highway demonstration projects. The Senate is on record. I wanted to get the Senate on record again, and I will before we take up ISTEA. We have seen this very unseemly situation over in the other body, where tens of billions of dollars are special projects called highway demonstration projects, which are really only gauged by the influence of the Members of Congress as opposed to merit. I am very pleased that this body is opposed to highway demonstration projects, and I want the Senate on record as reflecting that deal. 
The amendment I offer today is cosponsored by Senator Mack. My resolution states that Congress should not divert limited highway trust fund resources away from State transportation priorities by authorizing new highway projects and Congress should not authorize any new demonstration projects or other similarly-titled projects. 
Its a simple proposal, embodying a principle endorsed by three-quarters of the Senate less than 2 years ago. The principle is elementary, fair, and sound. The principle is--No new highway demonstration projects. 
Why is this amendment necessary? It is necessary because the largest domestic public works program, the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act [ISTEA], must be reauthorized this year. As my colleagues know, the lion's share of Federal highway and transit funding comes under the ISTEA umbrella. Through a Byzantine set of formula calculations, Federal gas taxes are collected by our States, sent into Federal coffers, and then are redistributed to the States. 
Some of us question the necessity of requiring State-collected gas taxes to be sent to Washington. I am one of those individuals. But that is an issue for another debate. Today, I want to focus on a clear abuse in the current highway funding distribution process. 
ISTEA funds are governed by a statutory distribution formula with a few limited exceptions. One major exception is funding for highway demonstration projects. It is this exception my amendment seeks to eliminate. This exception is neither necessary nor fair. 
What has been said about highway demonstration projects? Let me highlight a few comments. 
Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater, had this to say during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in February:  
The administration has taken a firm position in opposition to demonstration projects * * * [they] take resources from the [highway] trust fund. 
He further remarked that ending highway demonstration projects would `result in greater investment of resources * * * for general distribution based on formula.' 
Let me reiterate. The highway allocation process is policy driven. But as the Secretary said, highway demonstration projects are not. The Congressional Research Service [CRS] states: 
The demonstration project approach is often constituent-driven and focuses on increasing Federal outlays allocated to a particular State or district * * * When earmarking occurs, allocation stems less from concerns over marginal social and economic benefits, and more from marginal political benefit. 
The Heritage Foundation is strongly against highway demonstration projects. In its `Balancing America's Budget, Ending the Era of Big Government,' the Heritage Foundation says: 
Projects earmarked by Congress are classic examples of political favoritism obtained by powerful Senators and Representatives for public works spending in their states and districts. Federal `demonstration projects' are even more questionable . . . purely local projects funded by the federal government cannot be justified as being in the national interest. 
These are not new sentiments--they have been voiced for years. In fact 2 years ago, the President's budget submission called for the cancellation of some demonstration projects stating: 
Such projects have been earmarked in congressional authorization and appropriations laws. These projects limit the ability of the States to make choices on how to best use limited dollars to respond to their highest priorities. 
Pork-barrel highway demonstration projects were discussed in Vice President Gore's Reinventing Government report. It states: 
GAO also discovered that 10 projects--worth $31 million in demonstration funds--were for local roads not even entitled to receive Federal highway funding. In other words, many highway demonstration projects are little more than Federal pork. Looking specifically at the $1.3 billion authorized to fund 152 projects under the 1987 Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation and Assistance Act, GAO found that `most of the projects . . . did not respond to States' and regions' most Federal aid needs. 
One might have hoped that Federal budget constraints would curb highway pork barreling. But it has not. 
In 1982, 10 demonstration projects totaling $362 million were listed for special line-item funding in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. The 1982 Federal Budget deficit was $127 billion, and it jumped to $221 billion by 1986. 
In 1987, 152 demonstration projects totaling $1.4 billion were named in the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987. The 1987 Federal budget deficit was $149 billion, but it jumped to $269 billion in 1991. 
Then in 1991, the mother lode of all demo project bills was signed into law: 538 location-specific projects totaling $6.23 billion were included in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. 
If the budget deficit has not curbed demonstration projects, maybe fairness will. 
It is 1997 and time once again to authorize funding for our Nation's transportation infrastructure. Funding for highway, bridge, and transit needs remain great. Congress should give States the maximum amount of flexibility available to spend their highway dollars in whatever manner best meets their critical transportation needs. The States do not need Congress to micro-manage the transportation planning process. And the traveling public certainly is not well served when Washington forces limited funding to be spent on unnecessary road projects. 
Two years ago, the Senate adopted my amendment to prohibit the funding for future demonstration projects. That amendment was cosponsored by Senators Feingold and Smith. It passed by a vote of 75 to 21. 
We need to reaffirm Senate opposition to new demonstration projects. There are reports that more than 400 Members in the other Chamber submitted requests to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for highway, bridge, or transit projects. I am informed these requests include more than 1,000 projects. These requests could total hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars that would be siphoned away from formula-driven allocations, and poured into individually designated State or local projects. 
Past highway demonstration projects took almost $8 billion away from formula-driven allocations to the States. While we can't recapture this $8 billion, we can end the practice. My amendment states that `Congress should not divert limited highway trust fund resources away from State transportation priorities by authorizing new highway projects and Congress should not authorize any new demonstration projects or other similarly titled projects.' 
Mr. President, most Senators want to raise the amount of highway funding for our States and to assure an equitable distribution of that funding. One way to provide more money is to end the practice of designating highway demonstration projects or innovative projects, or any other creative description of pork-barrel projects. 
I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I voted with the majority of my colleagues in supporting the bipartisan budget agreement embodied in the Fiscal Year 1998 Budget Resolution. While I have serious concerns about several aspects of this agreement, I am hopeful that time will prove me wrong and the American people will actually reap the benefits of permanent tax relief and deficit reduction that are promised in this agreement. 
First, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for his hard work and excellent management of this difficult bill. In particular, I am grateful for his cooperation and support for my amendment regarding concerns about overly optimistic estimates of revenue from the future auction of broadcast spectrum. I am committed to enacting legislation to mandate these auctions over the next 5 years, but I am very concerned that this budget assumes much greater revenues from spectrum sales than can reasonably be anticipated at this time. 
Both Senator Domenici and I agree that spectrum auctions will raise a considerable amount of revenue for the Treasury. However, we also share the common concern that auctions depend on supply and demand, and therefore, the revenue received will undoubtedly fluctuate from today's estimates. 
The amendment that Senator Hollings and I offered simply states, that if the revenue from future sales falls short of the estimates in the resolution, deficit reduction targets will not be met. In that event, my amendment would require the Senate to find other savings or revenue to ensure that we stay on track in eliminating annual budget deficits by 2002. Senator Domenici's support for this amendment was critical to its adoption by a vote of 84 to 15. I am counting on him to work with Senator Hollings and me to identify spending cuts in the event spectrum sales fall short of the revenue estimates in the resolution. 
Mr. President, I have listened carefully to my colleagues who have discussed problems with the economic estimates underlying this plan. I, too, was disturbed when the Congressional Budget Office released a new estimate of future tax revenue just hours before the President and the Congressional negotiators on this balanced budget deal announced a final deal. While time may validate CBO's more optimistic estimates, the sudden announcement of an additional $225 billion in taxes was disconcerting, to say the least. While our economy's performance in recent months could very well justify a near-term revenue increase, I am concerned that the high rates of economic growth forecast into the next century might be too optimistic. More importantly, this tax windfall could hamper efforts in the near 
term to reduce both discretionary and mandatory Federal spending. 
Mr. President, under the plan in this resolution, we will continue to carry an annual deficit for the next 4 years. Our Nation's burden of debt will increase to $6.5 trillion by the year 2002. Annual appropriations spending will continue to increase under the plan in this resolution. I hope the Congress will resist the temptation to spend up to the limits in this resolution, and will instead work to advance the date when our budget is in balance and we begin to whittle away at the national debt. 
The most important and promising aspect of this resolution is its promise of permanent tax relief for Americans. The resolution sets up a procedure for swift enactment of a bill to provide tax relief that will create jobs and provide the fuel for even greater economic growth in our Nation. 
The $500-per-child tax credit will give immediate and much-needed relief to middle- and low-income families. Capital gains and estate tax relief will spur investment in new enterprises and reinvestment in family and small businesses. Until this agreement, the President had been implacably opposed to these profamily and pro-small-business tax reforms. Early enactment of these tax relief measures should be the first order of business for the Congress under this agreement. 
Mr. President, in the 15 years I have spent in the Congress, I have seen many plans and proposals to balance the budget. Yet, today, our Nation bears the financial burden of a $5.3 trillion debt. Yet, I voted for this plan because I remain hopeful that the Congress and the President are committed to both the letter and the spirit of the agreement reached just a few weeks ago. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the much-needed tax reform envisioned in this resolution and to ensure we carry out the terms of this agreement to achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, in introducing a series of tax relief bills designed to encourage investment, economic development, and growth on Indian reservations and other native American communities throughout the United States. The four bills that I am introducing today would amend the Tax Code to give Indian tribes the tools with which to improve their economies. 
In simple terms, native Americans as a group have experienced grinding poverty of epidemic proportions since the days when they were first uprooted from their homelands or overrun by settlers. At the end of World War II, the United States assisted in rebuilding the economies of Germany and Japan to the advancement of peace, stability, and our own prosperity. Since the time native America lost `the war,' their economy has never been rebuilt. The treaties that the United States made with tribes in exchange for their land and peace have, for the most part, not been honored. 
The economic conditions on Indian reservations have not improved even during those periods of economic growth that have swept much of the rest of our Nation. Instead, Indians have long suffered the indignity of promises broken and treaties discarded, and a personal hopelessness that reaches tragic dimensions. Many Indian reservations are, relatively speaking, islands of poverty in the ocean of wealth that is the rest of America. 
In previous Congresses, I have offered these amendments to the Federal Tax Code to create incentives for private sector investment on Indian reservations and remove inequities in the Tax Code so that tribal governments can enjoy the same tax benefits accorded other nontaxable government entities. I have offered these provisions, not to provide an advantage to Indians, but merely to give them the same kind of tax incentives and benefits the Congress has given other economically depressed areas and other units of government. Given the extremely underdeveloped economies of native American communities, I believe we must authorize these reasonable measures to stimulate economic growth and productivity for Indians.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, several weeks ago the ABC News `20/20' program aired a piece entitled `Your Tax Dollars at Work,' a report about an airport construction project in northwest Arkansas. The report focused on allegations that the new airport was unnecessary and a waste of Federal tax dollars. As chairman of the Commerce Committee, I believed it was incumbent on me to followup on these allegations. I consequently requested that the General Accounting Office [GAO] review the project to ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] followed the agency's established process to allocate discretionary airport funds to this project. 
I want to state at the outset that the GAO has said that nothing illegal has taken place with respect to the project. In its review, however, shortcomings were discovered with the FAA's grant decisionmaking process that need to be addressed. The FAA's decision to provide grants for the new Northwest Arkansas Federal Government does not always do the best job in managing the taxpayers' money. In this case, the FAA could have better managed the airport grant program. The FAA decided to fund this airport, although the circumstances on which it made its decision changed. When this new airport is built and ready for use in 1998, the Federal Government's share will be $70 million, almost two-thirds of the airport's total cost. It remains to be seen, however, if the airport will have an airline to serve it and if passengers will use it. 
The FAA must ensure that the limited Federal funds available for developing the Nation's airports to go to the most deserving projects. Maintaining and improving the Nation's airport system requires continual capital investment and the FAA provides Federal grants to help with that development. As with other Federal programs, the airport grant program has taken its share of cuts as we work toward balancing the budget. This situation makes it even more important that the FAA does the best possible job in managing the program's approximately $1.5 billion in funds. 
From the beginning, there were problems with the FAA's decisionmaking process in awarding grants to NWARA. The FAA went outside its priority system, and relied in part on its subjective assessment in awarding the airport $70 million over the 12-year period from 1991 through 2002. The FAA made its decision in 1990 and did not reconsider its position, although the circumstances on which the decision was based changed in the immediate following years. In making its decision, the FAA 
assumed that a nearby airport, Drake Field in Fayetteville, AR, would close and that all air service would move to NWARA. Drake Field, however, remains open and improvements to this airport have been made. The airlines are happy with the airport. Rather than closing, it appears that Drake Field will compete with NWARA. These airports are less than 30 miles apart. The FAA also said airlines were behind the construction of NWARA. To this day, however, no airlines have made a firm commitment to use this new airport. 
The FAA also decided to provide grants to NWARA under a rarely used special mechanism called a letter of intent. This mechanism allows the FAA to schedule grant payments in future years beyond the program's authorization period. Of the tens of thousands of grants the FAA has awarded, only about 50 letters of intent have been issued and only two--one of which went to NWARA--have been issued in the last 4 years. The Congress established letters of intent only to fund projects that significantly enhance the capacity of the national airport system. The FAA, however, awarded the letter of intent to NWARA without having defined what constitutes a significant capacity enhancement for small airports like NWARA. The agency also used a cost-benefit analysis to justify the letter of intent, analysis that was not redone even though it was not clear that certain assumptions the agency made would hold, such as the closing of Drake Field. 
The sloppiness of the FAA's decisionmaking process on this project has been disappointing, although legal. The GAO and other observers agree that it would be a waste of investments already made to withhold Federal funding now. NWARA has received about 40 percent of its total $70 million in grant funding, and construction of the airport is under way. The airport's runways will be completed by the end of 1997 and its terminal soon thereafter. 
Nevertheless, the review of this project has been a valuable exercise. We must be certain that scarce Federal resources are allocated to their highest and best uses. The FAA must be able to demonstrate compelling reasons for using subjective assessments to place projects on the priority list for Federal funding. The GAO will soon report to the FAA on how it can tighten up its grant award process, and better adhere to the criteria that the agency has laid out for itself. In the meantime, the Commerce Committee will continue to oversee the FAA's management of its grant program.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my amendment states that if legislation is enacted to establish an intercity passenger rail fund, as this budget resolution would make room for, the distribution of any new money should be in conjunction with legislation to reauthorize and reform the National Rail Passenger Corporation, better known as Amtrak. Money alone, cannot fix all of Amtrak's financial and operational problems. 
This amendment does not attempt to kill Amtrak or block its funding. It simply attempts to establish some level of fiscal accountability before the taxpayers are forced to pay $400 to $500 million more to fund Amtrak capital subsidies. 
We have an obligation to the American public to invest our Federal dollars wisely. We should reduce waste and inefficiency and allow Amtrak to achieve greater fiscal accountability. Statutory reforms are necessary if Amtrak is to increase efficiencies, reduce costs, and lessen its dependence on Federal assistance. 
Earlier this week, I met with Delaware's Governor, Tom Carper, who serves on the Amtrak board of directors. Governor Carper articulated clearly to me Amtrak's plan to turn its financial condition around. He talked about the need for capital investment and his support for establishing a trust fund for Amtrak. He also talked about the importance of legislative reforms. 
I may not agree with Governor Carper's views on the role that the Federal Government should continue to play in supporting Amtrak. But, it was refreshing to hear from someone close to Amtrak's operations discuss the critical need for statutory reforms--including labor and liability reforms--and not just the need for more money. 
Mr. President, Amtrak has not been authorized since 1994. The Commerce Committee has reported out reform legislation during the last two Congresses. But, instead of meeting our authorizing obligations, Congress has found it easier to just keep throwing good money at an inefficent operation. This fiscally irresponsible practice must stop. 
Last week, Senator Hutchison, the chairman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee, introduced S. 738, the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act. That bill proposes to reauthorize Amtrak for 5 years and provide comprehensive reforms to allow Amtrak to operate more like a business. In short, it provides all the things Amtrak's president, Tom Downs, says are needed in order for Amtrak to meet its glide path to zero Federal operating subsides by 2002. 
The Commerce Committee is prepared to move Senator Hutchison's bill during our very next executive session. We will be ready for floor action as soon as the leadership can agree on a schedule. Members can offer amendments and cast their votes. But we are committed to debate reform legislation on the Senate floor. 
I cannot understand how any Member could seriously argue that reform legislation should not be tied to any future `pot of gold' for Amtrak. Let me remind my colleagues that it is Amtrak that has said 
that money will not solve all its problems. 
For the past several years, Amtrak's president, Tom Downs, has testified before Congress explaining the three things needed to turn Amtrak around: Internal Restructuring; comprehensive legislative reforms; and a dedicated source of capital funding. 
And, just yesterday morning, during a DOT oversight hearing of the Commerce Committee, the GAO and the Office of Inspector General testified on the serious challenges Amtrak faces to achieving operating self-sufficiency. 
Mr. President, since 1983 I have listened to Amtrak officials talk about their plans to turn Amtrak into a viable operation. I imagine they've talked about it for 26 years. Amtrak says they can operate more efficiently and reduce the need for Federal assistance if Congress gives them the tools they have requested. Therefore, it would be extremely irresponsible to give Amtrak a substantial increase in Federal assistance and not remove some of the statutory burdens that are the root cause of many of their financial woes today. 
If Amtrak is given new money without reforms, I can hear them in the year 2002. They'll try to convince me how Congress still should continue subsidizing Amtrak because Congress never gave them what they said they needed. Well, enough is enough. If Amtrak is going to receive Federal assistance, let's make sure they also have the ability to increase efficiencies, reduce costs, and operate more like a business. 
Amtrak is in a financial crisis. Without comprehensive legislative reforms, it is business as usual. And today, that business faces a debt load fast approaching $2 billion. 
Mr. President, I do not support a never-ending drain on the Federal taxpayers in funding a passenger rail system that serves only 500 locations across the country. But, if the collective wisdom of Congress believes we should continue to invest billions of dollars in a passenger system that serves less than 1 percent of the traveling public, I am going to do all I can to ensure such investment is as fiscally sound at possible. Turning on a new Amtrak funding spigot absent comprehensive operational reforms would be wasteful and careless. 
I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I share the deep concern of my colleagues for the approximately 10 million children in our country who are currently lacking health insurance coverage. It is distressing that such a large number of our children lack access to primary and preventative care. I find it even more disconcerting that recent reports indicate that about 3 million of these children are Medicaid eligible, but are not enrolled in this program. 
However, after spending a considerable amount of time reviewing the proposal by my colleagues, Senators Hatch and Kennedy, I sincerely believe that it is not the best solution. 
There are several fundamental reasons why I can not support this proposal. First, I can not support a measure which would impose new unfunded mandates on the States and will place unfair burdens and excessive costs on our State governments. Second, I can not endorse a proposal which is creating another highly bureaucratic federal entitlement program. 
Also while I do have some concerns about provisions contained in the balanced budget agreement and I am continuing to review this plan, I believe that if enacted, many portions are worthwhile and will be beneficial to the American people, particular in providing tax relief and imposing spending controls. However, I believe the Hatch-Kennedy proposal would jeopardize some of the most valuable parts of this piece. 
The Republican leadership has worked hard to ensure that this agreement contains an appropriate amount of tax relief for America's working families. The Kennedy-Hatch proposal shatters this agreement by lowering the net tax cut in the budget agreement from $85 billion to $55 billion over the next 5 years. 
This proposal also fails to recognize that the budget agreement provides $16 billion for expanding health care insurance for low-income insured children. These additional funds will allow us to provide grants to the States to finance health care services to approximately 5 million children who currently lack coverage. Thus, about 5 million of the approximately 10 million children who are currently lacking coverage will now have access to health care under the bipartisan balanced budget proposal. 
Now, my colleagues may argue this still leaves approximately 5 million children without coverage. However, we must remember that about 3 million of these children already qualify for Medicaid services but are not enrolled in this program. Therefore, I believe that we should first focus our efforts toward a bipartisan solution for developing innovative outreach programs to reach these 3 million children and their families, educate them about the Medicaid program, and get these children access to health care. This is an achievable goal for the near-term which we all agree should and can be achieved in the near future. 
I have written the General Accounting Office and requested that they conduct a thorough analysis of the 3 million Medicaid eligible children who are not enrolled in this program. This analysis should provide Congress with a thorough profile of who these kids are, where they are located geographically and what their family environment is like. This detailed study will enable Congress with the necessary tools to develop the appropriate community outreach strategies and national education programs which will address this problem and assist in getting these children enrolled in the program and finally having access to very important health care services. 
Providing access to health care for uninsured children has been a priority for me since coming to the Senate. In fact, I offered legislation in the 103d Congress which attempted to address this problem and provide access to health care for many of our Nation's uninsured children. This issue still remains a high priority for me in the 105th Congress. Currently, I am developing legislation which will concentrate on developing new innovative, strategic outreach programs to educate qualifying families about the current Medicaid program. In addition, it will incorporate creative solutions for creating an environment which provides low and moderate income families with access to health care for their children. 
I sincerely believe that we must continue to work together to develop a bipartisan solution to this problem and find a way to provide access to health care for our Nation's uninsured children. I look forward to working with my colleagues in developing an affordable and equitable solution to this problem. However, I simply can not support this extremely expensive plan, which unravels the tax cut agreement between the administration and Congress, and creates another highly bureaucratic Federal entitlement program.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am grateful to be an original cosponsor with my distinguished colleagues and fellow Vietnam veterans in the Senate. It is appropriate that we commemorate the 15th anniversary of the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. 
My fellow Vietnam veterans who are cosponsoring this resolution and I wear glasses and have more gray hair than we did when we served in Vietnam, we come from different walks of life, served in different branches of the military, and were of different ranks. However, we share the experiences of combat that only those who went to Vietnam will ever understand. 
We also share--and this is harder to explain--the survivors' humility. That's a provocative statement, I know, and the nonveteran may easily mistake its meaning. I am not talking about shame. I know of no shame in surviving combat. But every combat veteran remembers those comrades whose sacrifice was eternal. Their loss taught us everything about tragedy and everything about duty. 
I am grateful, as we all are, to have come home alive. I prayed daily for deliverance from war. No one of my acquaintance ever chose death over homecoming. But I witnessed some men choose death over dishonor. The memory of them, of what they bore for country and honor, helped me to see the virtue in my own humility. 
It is a surpassing irony that war, for all its unspeakable horrors, provides the combatant with every conceivable human experience. Experiences that usually take a lifetime to know are all felt--and felt intensely--in one brief moment of life. Anyone who loses a loved one knows what great loss feels like. Anyone who gives life to a child knows what great joy feels like. The veteran knows what great joy and great loss feel like when they occur in the same moment, in the same experience. 
For my part, I would simply affirm that the sacrifices borne by veterans deserve to be memorialized in something more lasting than marble or in the fleeting effect of a politician's speech. The veterans' valor and the devotion to duty have earned our country's abiding concern for their well-being. I am committed to honoring that debt. 
I hope this small symbol of remembrance today will encourage all Americans to remember the sacrifices of our veterans.

Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to. I say to the Senator from Mississippi, I had discussed my original proposal with the Senator from Alaska before he left, and that is why I made the proposal. Obviously, with the additional request for time on the part of the Senator from West Virginia, we will wait until the Senator from Alaska returns. 
Mr. President, I see the Senator from California on the floor who is eager to speak. I will make my remarks relatively short. 
I think it is important that we make a few facts clear on this issue. The Senator from Massachusetts, who was on the floor before, and others, will allege that there is somehow some motivation to sabotage the budget agreement. Mr. President, the Senator from Indiana and I proposed this amendment last year. I know of no one who believes that the budget was even discussed last year; not this year. It is a matter of record. We wanted a vote on it, and were dissuaded from doing so at that time. 
My motivation on this issue is simple. It is clear, and I can be very concise about it; that is that I saw thousands of residents of my State whose lives were disrupted, and in many cases destroyed, because of the inability of the Congress of the United States and the President of the United States to come to an agreement on appropriations bills--not a budget. Let's get one thing clear. We have had a budget agreement. In 1990, we had a budget agreement, too, I might add, which was quickly destroyed and dismantled in a very short period of time. The appropriations process still has to be gone through. 
We all know from previous years that many times there are riders on an appropriations bill, even if there is an overall spending agreement which causes the President of the United States to veto a bill. 
As I say, my motivation is very simple. I saw the lives of hundreds and even thousands of people in my State, and millions all over the country, destroyed for reasons of political gain. I will freely admit to the Senator from West Virginia, who quoted me, that, yes, I intend to win this debate. 
I will also admit to the Senator from West Virginia with rhetoric that was used the last time the Government was shut down that his side of the aisle won the debate. The President of the United States during the last debate said what they really want is to end the role of the Federal Government in our lives * * * which they have, after all, been very open about * * * the President said. A lot of them--referring to Republicans; these are the comments of the President of the United States back when the Government was shut down--A lot of them will be happy about this because they don't think we ought to have a Government up here anyway. 
Mr. President, I found those remarks insulting. I have never said that about the President of the United States. I have never said that about the proponents of the Byrd amendment. I was offended. The rhetoric went on and on during that period. 
While we are talking about rhetoric, `Democrats contended that Mr. Gingrich was being overrun by a minority of children and inexperienced lawmakers, and should defer to more experienced Members. It is about time that adults with adult minds and adult experiences get together as Democrats and Republicans and at least agree to a 3-day continuing resolution to get the Government working again,' said Senator James Exon, calling the GOP freshmen `The Magnificent 70.' 
Mr. President, there was a lot of rhetoric thrown around the last time, and there will be on this floor. I know what the 
Senator from California and others who will speak here will say. They will allege that this amendment somehow will prevent the assistance being given to their States and to their areas that are devastated. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
We have agreed to a time agreement. We have been urging a time agreement. We have been urging quick passage of this bill. 
If the President of the United States chooses to veto it, then that is his privilege and his constitutional right to do so. 
It is also my obligation--and those Members of this Senate and the Congress--to make sure that what happened never happens again. 
There are natural disasters which need to be addressed. By the way, as the Senator from Texas pointed out yesterday, they are being addressed. The money is flowing. There is no holdup in the money. Disaster assistance is being rendered as we speak. 
But there are also manmade disasters. My State went through one, and the Nation went through a manmade disaster. And it is equally our obligation to see that a manmade disaster does not happen again. And it was a disaster. 
I understand some mayors of some of the towns that are affected by this latest natural disaster are here. I could bring mayors of cities from Arizona and from all over America, also who have had the lives of their citizens disrupted and destroyed because of a manmade disaster. 
Those of us on this side of the aisle who support the prevention of a Government shutdown have the deepest and most profound sympathy, and are willing to do anything within the Government's power to alleviate their incredible problems that they are suffering under. 
We also should be committed to seeing that we don't inflict on American citizens what we did last time. 
Later on, Mr. President, I will go through the statistics of the terrible tragedy that was inflicted when the Government was shut down. I will go through that. It has nothing to do with rhetoric. It has nothing to do with debate, nor political leverage. It has to do with harming the lives of American citizens which we did because we didn't carry out our obligations to them. When we don't carry out our obligations, it seems to me that some of us should join in an effort to see that it doesn't happen again. That is what this is all about. 
There will be an allegation that this is premature, that we shouldn't do this at this time. If we wait, as we did last year, the reason we were dissuaded from passing this amendment last year was we were too far down the road in the appropriations process, and it would disrupt the process then. 
So we are doing this early. We are doing it now. And we think it is important. 
Let me point out one other thing, Mr. President, because I have heard a lot of very interesting rhetoric already, questioning of motives, about not caring, about insensitivity, and all of that. 
I urge my colleagues to elevate it a little bit here. OK. All right. I don't question the motives of anybody on that side of the aisle. I resent it when our motives, those of us who are acting in good faith, are questioned. 
The second point I want to make, finally, is, look, we have asked the White House to negotiate with us on this issue. They say, as do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, `We want to prevent a Government shutdown too.' 
I again will quote later all of the lamentations and criticism of a Government shutdown that were uttered by the President of the United States, and all of the Cabinet, and all of those on the other side of the aisle. If we share the same goal, why can't we sit down and work out an agreement, an agreement that will prevent the shutdown of the Government from taking place? It seems that we should be able to do that. 
So, I, obviously, will be discussing this issue at more length. But, again, I urge my colleagues. Let's not let this debate degenerate into name calling and questioning of motivation, which I already heard from the Senator from Massachusetts. 
By the way, I have not heard that from the Senator from West Virginia. 
Do not accuse us of a lack of compassion; otherwise this debate will degenerate into name calling and questioning motivation, which I do not think will be illuminating nor in the best interests of the Senate. But if necessary, if necessary, obviously, we will respond, which I do not choose to do. 
Mr. President, I note the Senator from Alaska is on the floor. We have been searching for a unanimous-consent agreement on this issue, so I will yield the floor.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to be brief. 
I thank the Senator from Alaska. This has taken up a great deal of time. We are completing this legislation soon. I appreciate his patience and his appreciation on this very difficult issue. 
I also want to thank the Senator from West Virginia for his usual courteous, informative, and compelling debate in which we have engaged for many years. 
Mr. President, as I said, I will try to be brief. Let's try to be clear about what we are talking about here. There isn't an either/or choice here. The money is going to the disaster areas. It will continue to flow. The President doesn't have to in any way veto a provision that would prevent what he so loudly decried for a period of about 2 months in December and January--December 1995 to January 1996--when the Government was shut down. 
I am, frankly, astonished that during this debate people somehow think that because we will include a provision that prevents the shutdown of the Government that it would jeopardize anything else. 
Let me also point out that, although the agreement on a budget is a laudable situation, we all know that the heavy lifting is in the appropriations process. 
Mr. President, I still remember this much heralded budget agreement of 1990. It fell apart in a period of weeks. We got lots of tax increases. I remember a budget agreement in 1982 when it raised taxes to balance the budget. That was back in 1982. I know the Senator from West Virginia remembers it well. 
Let's be clear. A budget is a framework upon which to work, and the appropriations is the heavy lifting. Whether it is right or wrong, fair or unfair, the Congress sometimes puts provisions on appropriations bills which the President of the United States does not like and, therefore, as is his right and responsibility, vetoes those bills. 
What I am trying to prevent here is a situation where, even if it were within the agreed upon budget framework, there would not be a shutdown of the Government, which is patently and outrageously unfair to the American people. That is all we are trying to do here. To somehow convey the impression that that impairs either the budget process or the appropriations process simply is not accurate. 
Let me point out the problems that we face just very quickly, because we have to remember what happened last time. We can't allow it to happen again. 
Mr. President, according to a Greater Washington Consumer Survey in a poll taken, 4 out of 10 Federal employees fear losing their jobs because of budget reductions; 4 out of 5 Federal employees believe their agency will be hit by cutbacks; one-third of private sector employees believe their firms would be hurt by Federal budget reductions; and one-fifth of private sector employees believe their own jobs may be in jeopardy as a result of Federal budget reductions associated with the impact of a Federal shutdown. 
Mr. President, I know my colleagues remember when the Government was shut down. Let me remind you of the impact during that 23-day period. 
New patients were not accepted into clinical research at 
the NIH; the Centers for Disease Control ceased disease surveillance; hotline calls to NIH concerning diseases were not answered; toxic waste cleanup work at 609 sites was stopped; 2,400 Superfund workers were sent home; 10,000 new Medicare applications, 212,000 Social Security card requests, 360,000 individual office visits, and 800,000 toll-free calls for information and assistance were turned away each day--each day; 10,000 new Medicare applications were denied every day; 13 million recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, 273,000 foster care children, over 100,000 children receiving adoption assistance services, and over 100,000 Head Start children experienced delays. 
Mr. President, is that fair? Is that a decent way to treat the American people because we have a disagreement over an appropriations bill here in Washington, DC? 
Ten thousand home purchase loans and refinancing applications totaling 800 million dollars' worth of mortgage loans for moderate- and low-income working families nationwide were delayed; 11 States and the District of Columbia temporarily suspended unemployment assistance for lack of Federal funds. 
Mr. President, I ask again: Was that fair to the American people? Shouldn't we take whatever steps necessary not to have these innocent people suffer again? This is what it is all about. 
The disaster relief is about the suffering of American citizens because of a natural disaster. We are taking steps to cure that, and provide them with the relief assistance that is the obligation of Government to its people. I argue, Mr. President, that we have an obligation to provide relief, comfort and, care, and Federal programs and assistance that innocent Americans deserve, and not shut down the Government. 
I don't know how we justify 13 million recipients of aid to families with dependent children not receiving their funds, and 273,000 foster care children and over 100,000 children not receiving adoption assistance services. I don't know how we justify that. I think it is one of the blackest chapters in the history of the Federal Government. All we are doing is trying to see that that doesn't happen again. 
There was suspension of investigative activities by the IRS. I am not sure that was all bad, Mr. President. So I will pass over that one. 
Delays in processing alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosive applications by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The Department of Justice suspended work on more than 3,500 bankruptcy cases. OPM canceled recruitment and testing of Federal officials, including hiring 400 border control agents. On delinquent child support cases, the deadbeat dads program was suspended; closure of 368 National Park Service sites; loss of 7 million visitors; the Grand Canyon National Park closed for the first time in its 76-year history; local communities near national parks, losses estimated at $14.2 million per day in tourism revenue; and the closure of national museums and monuments for a loss of 2 million visitors; 20,000 to 30,000 applications by foreigners for visas for coming into this country went unprocessed each day; 200,000 U.S. applications for passports went unprocessed; U.S. tourist industries and airlines sustained millions of dollars in losses because of visa and passport curtailment. 
It had a terrible effect on Native Americans and American Indians. The American veterans sustained major curtailment in services as a result of the Federal shutdown, ranging from health and welfare to finance and travel. 
The impact of Federal contracting on the local and national economy is best shown by the fact that in 1994 the Federal Government purchased 196.4 billion dollars' worth of goods nationwide, and $18 billion in the Washington region. The billions of dollars received from Federal contracting is a boon to local economies. Over 500,000 small companies nationwide faced delays in Federal payments, and several companies with millions of dollars of exports couldn't get off the docks because there were no Federal inspectors to clear their cargo. 
Mr. President, I could go on and on as to the terrible and devastating effects not brought about by a natural disaster but brought about by a manmade disaster. 
I would argue that the facts are clear. The American people--who, by the way, don't think a great deal of us, if you believe the polls--deserve better. And, if we are concerned about the esteem or lack of esteem in which we are held by the American people, we should assure them that we would never do this to them again. 
So I hope we will vote on this issue. 
And let me finally say, in conclusion, Mr. President, as I have said on numerous occasions, I am eager--not willing but eager--to sit down with the White House and with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and frame a proposal and an agreement that will prevent the shutdown of the Government. 
If this isn't appropriate, if the President of the United States feels that this is not the right way to go, then we are open for business. We would like to talk, if we share the same goal. I know that the Senator from West Virginia shares the same goal to 
prevent the shutdown of the Government. 
Again, it seems to me that reasonable men can reason together in a reasonable fashion. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCain. Mr. President, we have heard a very spirited debate on the issue of rights-of-way across Federal land today. Both sides are passionate. 
On one hand, States worry that the Federal Government will exercise their authorities to invalidate, bona-fide historic rights-of-way. On the other hand, the Interior Department worries that States will liberally define their rights-of-way which could pose environmental threats to Federal lands, including parks and wildlife refuges. 
Mr. President, I believe that there is ample room for principled compromise in this dispute. States should not be denied their bona-fide rights-of-way, nor should excess or unreason be permitted to threaten our Nation's parks and pristine areas. 
Clearly this situation must be resolved, because if this stalemate persists, and the Secretary is precluded from proceeding under reasonable parameters, I don't believe we will have any official process or method for administratively assessing a claim. Such a stalemate serves the interest of no one and cannot stand. 
I've been engaged in an effort to find a process by which the Secretary, Governors, and local officials can work together to determine what constitutes a valid right-of-way; what methods and standards will be used to recognize the claim, and how such rights will be managed. 
I believe we can achieve a reasonable compromise and an appropriate process. While time does not permit us to reach an agreement before we must vote now, I will continue to work with the Senators from Alaska, Senator Bumpers, and the Interior Department to try and reach some agreement that we can all be proud of, one which will protect States rights, Federal interests and most of all the public interest. 
I appreciate the Senator from Alaska's support for that effort and I look forward to working with him to resolve this matter before the conference.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join the Senator from South Dakota in his remarks. 
Mr. President, I think I am going to have to call for the yeas and nays on this amendment because I think it is of serious import. 
I also believe that we should be out of Bosnia. I had severe reservations as to going in. I ended up supporting the President, as did the former majority leader, Senator Dole. But for us to say that unequivocally under no circumstances will American presence be there a long time from now, I think would be, from a precedent-setting standpoint, very dangerous and, second of all, would be a message that I am not sure we want to send at this time. 
There are some very bad people in Bosnia, Mr. President, as we all know. And if the administration was unequivocally on record or the United States Congress was on record as saying that under no circumstances could there be an American presence in Bosnia as of a certain date, I think it would have the unintended consequence of encouraging those very bad people. 
Mr. President, I think it is something that we should work out with the administration. It is well known that the present Secretary of Defense, a former Member of this body, has stated we will be out by June 1998. But that is not a firm administration policy. And there are certain proposals as far as a United States presence is concerned, both on sea and in the air, as well as possibly in a neighboring country. I am not sure that this amendment would not affect those options as well. 
The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee points out very accurately that we do not have any money anyway at that time, so this would be largely a symbolic vote. But, Mr. President, I believe that if I were one of our European allies or someone who had an interest in the situation in Bosnia, either as a participant or an observer, I would say that this is a very strong message and one that we do not want to send. 
I also remind my colleagues that, yes, we have the right to cut off funding, we have that constitutional right as a body. But it is always the last resort. Cutting off funding is the last resort that we seek in order to salvage Americans when they are placed in great danger. 
I suggest that this is the first option. If June 1998 begins to approach and it looks like the administration is in an open-ended commitment, I think we would have plenty of opportunity at that time. We would be considering lots of legislation in order to express our views on this issue. 
But to act at this time, I think, would send a very, very unfortunate and even dangerous signal. 
I was just in conversation with the Senator from Alaska and he pointed out that we did, indeed, cut off funding in the Somalia situation, but that was also with the agreement of the administration that they were leaving at that time. All of us were outraged at the wanton murder of some brave young Americans whose bodies were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. There is no doubt in that situation there was agreement that we were going to leave. 
The Bosnia situation is very fluid, it is very dangerous. I want us out, too, but I greatly fear if we passed a resolution at this particular time mandating such a thing--for example, cutting off all funds--that this would be an action that would have some unintended consequences associated with it. One of the major consequences I just mentioned is to encourage our adversaries and the enemies of peace in that poor, unfortunate land, who, I think, might take this as a signal to just wait, rather than seek national reconciliation, wait until the Americans leave and then really ignite the bloodletting and the conflict. 
Mr. President, I have to oppose this amendment, certainly at this time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment strikes earmarks to fund for highway projects: 
$3.6 million for the 2002 Olympics planning in Utah; 
$450,000 for the ATR Institute to continue the Santa Teresa border technologies project in New Mexico; 
Additional funding for Warrior Loop project in Alabama; 
$12.6 million to complete the William H. Natcher Bridge in Maceo, KY; 
Additional funding for Highway 17 Cooper River bridges replacement project in South Carolina; 
$100,000 for 86th Street Highway Project in Polk County, IA; 
And discretionary authority to spend additional funds to repair or reconstruct any portion of Highway 1 in San Mateo, CA, that was destroyed in 1982 and 1983; 
The set-aside of $12.3 million for discretionary authority to construct the parking garage at a VA medical center in Cleveland, OH; 
Earmark of $500,000 from previously appropriated funds for a parking garage in Ashland, KY, to instead restore the Paramount Theater in that city. 
Mr. President, this supplemental appropriations bill was an emergency appropriations bill. The title, as we all know, is an emergency supplemental bill. 
Mr. President, the earmarks I find included in this bill and others are not, in my view, of an emergency status. Let me talk about a few other earmarks that are in this bill. 
Language that makes College Station, AR, eligible for rural housing service program assistance. 
By the way, Mr. President, I understand that College Station, AR, has been badly damaged by a tornado, and that is probably a project that would qualify under emergency supplemental parameters. 
It makes the cost of repairing the Wapato irrigation project nonreimbursable; 
$15 million emergency funding for research on environmental risk factors associated with breast cancer. Report language lists Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Utah, New York, and California as States which should be considered for `competitive grants.' In other words, the other States are not considered for competitive grants. 
There is a $10 million earmark for phase 2 of nonemergency transportation planning at Yosemite Valley which is offset by rescission of clean coal technology funding; 
$5 million for development of the Legislative Information System in the Office of Secretary of the Senate which is transferred from other Senate appropriations. 
Let me say on that particular one, Mr. President, that I think the Legislative Information System in the Office of Secretary of the Senate is important. I do not think it qualifies as an emergency. 
Earmarks funds for highway projects, including $3.6 million for 2002 Olympic planning in Utah; 
$1.95 million earmarked for Colorado to provide security for the Denver Summit of Eight; 
Set-aside of $12.3 million for discretionary authority to construct a parking garage, which I mentioned earlier; 
$3 million earmarked from the Justice Department counterterrorism fund for Ogden, UT, preparation for 2002 Winter Olympics. 
By the way, Mr. President, we are going to start totaling up how much Federal money is going to be spent on the Olympics in Utah. I would guess that it will match or exceed the amount of Federal dollars that were spent in Atlanta. 
Mr. President, I am proud that these Olympics are being held in the United States and that we win these competitions for having the Olympics held here in the United States of America. Mr. President, I think the taxpayers ought to know what the cost is to the taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I am reminded, as I look over this list, of the need for the line-item veto. 
This is another graphic example of why the line-item veto is necessary. These projects do not qualify as emergencies, yet they are placed in. 
For many years I have come down here and complained about this kind of activity. I don't think it does us any good, Mr. President, to do these things and call them emergency supplementals. What it does is provide grist for the talk show mill. It provides ammunition for those who believe we do not act in a responsible fashion. It makes it more difficult for us to go home and say that we are trying to be careful of every dollar we spend that the taxpayers so much care about--things like EPA to provide a Federal grant to Middlebury, VT, to complete a project in 1997; 
Direct expenditures for study of flood control mitigation at Lualualei Naval Magazine in Hawaii; 
Special emphasis on need for flood prevention efforts at Devils Lake and Ramsey County Rural Sewer System. 
We can't afford to do this. We are trying to embark on an effort to balance the budget by the year 2002. We are going to 
ask the American people to make sacrifices as we embark on this effort. There will be some reductions in spending. 
Yet, at the same time we are appropriating $250,000 to replace salmon fry killed during an April snowstorm in New England, and $1.1 million to complete fire restoration at Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. 
So the bill has grown, I am told, from around $4.4 billion to over $8 billion. Much of that is necessary spending. 
Let me repeat again. In no way do I believe that we have any other obligation but to help those people who are victims of natural disasters. We have that obligation. It is a proper role of Government. 
If some of these projects that I mentioned are important and worthwhile projects, I believe they should be subject to the normal authorization and appropriations process. So my amendment would eliminate a few of those. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

I also appreciate the various influences that the Senator is under. I appreciate his understanding. I look forward to working with him as we go through the process. He and I, I believe, along with the Senator from West Virginia, have a clear understanding of where they stand and where I stand, and that relationship is characterized by nothing but respect and, indeed, affection.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the supplemental appropriations bill should allow the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] to spend additional funding on commercially available explosive detection systems for the Nation's airports, rather than for only one type of system as proposed by the House. The House bill provides an additional $40 million for the FAA to purchase this one system, while the Senate bill provides no additional funding. When the conference report returns to the Senate floor, however, we should make sure that any additional funding given to the FAA can be used to purchase whatever explosive detection equipment it believes will do the best job. 
The development and deployment of various devices that can detect explosives are a key component of the overall security for commercial aviation. Unfortunately, the House version of the supplemental appropriations bill does not move us in this direction because it earmarks additional funding for only one type of explosive detection system. This earmarking does not provide for a multilevel approach to security as recommended by the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. In its recent report, the Commission suggested that various explosive detection systems should be implemented at the Nation's airports because each one has its strengths and weaknesses. The Commission also urged FAA to deploy commercially available systems while continuing to develop, evaluate, and certify such equipment. Additionally, the General Accounting Office has criticized the FAA for ignoring a strategy more heavily focused on integrating several different procedures and technologies for detecting explosives. Explosive detection devices vary in their ability to detect the types, quantities, and shapes of explosives. For example, one device excels in its ability to detect certain explosive substances but not others. Other devices cannot detect explosives in certain shapes. 
The FAA believes that the greatest threat to aviation is explosives placed in checked baggage. It was an explosive placed in a checked bag that brought down Pan Am 103 more than 8 years ago with the loss of 270 lives. In response to this tragedy, the Congress approved the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990. Among other things, the legislation directed the FAA to certify explosive detection equipment. It also established a goal of having new explosive detection equipment in place by November of 1993. The TWA Flight 800 accident last July, however, highlighted the fact that no new explosive detection devices had been deployed in the United States since the Pan Am bombing. Congress responded, in part, in the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 by mandating that the FAA immediately deploy commercially available explosive detection equipment. 
The threat of terrorism against the United States has increased and aviation is, and will remain, an attractive terrorist target. The terrorist threat faced by the United States overseas has been with us for some time, as illustrated by the bombing in Saudi Arabia of the United States barracks. However, other incidents, such as the bombings of the World Trade Center in New York and the Federal building in Oklahoma City have also made terrorism an issue at home. In 1994, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that the most important development concerning terrorism inside the United States was the emergence of radical terrorist groups with an infrastructure that can support terrorists' activities. That same year, the State Department reported an increase in attacks by radical fundamentalist groups, who operate more autonomously than state-sponsored, secular terrorist groups. Fundamentalist groups are more difficult to infiltrate. Consequently, it is difficult to predict and prevent their attacks. 
Given the potential for a terrorist act against aviation, explosive detection systems should be deployed as quickly as possible. As the General Accounting Office reported in January 1994, terrorists' activities are continually evolving and present unique challenges to the FAA and law enforcement agencies. The bombing of Philippines Airlines Flight 434 in December 1994, which resulted in the death of one passenger and injuries to several others, illustrates the extent of terrorists' motivation and capabilities as well as the attractiveness of aviation as a target. According to information that was uncovered by accident in early January 1995, this bombing was a rehearsal for multiple attacks on specific United States flights in Asia. 
Today, various explosive detection devices are commercially available for checked and carry-on baggage and could improve security. Some of these devices are already being used in foreign countries such as the United Kingdom and Israel. Other devices are under development and may soon be available. We must untie the FAA's hand and allow them to dedicate additional resources to the technologies they believe would be the most effective in detecting explosives. To see that this occurs as quickly as possible, any additional funding appropriated by the Congress should be available to purchase commercially available explosive detection devices. By taking such action we can move toward deploying the best systems for the Nation's airports.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the concern of the Senator from West Virginia. I hope that he will then understand why the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, and I have an amendment to raise the spending to a full 100 percent of the previous year rather than 98 percent, rather than force the impact that the Senator from West Virginia, as always, so eloquently described. So, therefore, I hope that the Senator from West Virginia will have no objection to a unanimous-consent request to lay aside his amendment so I can bring up my amendment, No. 112, which calls for 100 percent funding at the previous year's level and, that way, I hope that most of the concerns that the Senator from West Virginia has will be allayed and he then, of course, hopes that many of his concerns he voiced will be addressed. 
So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment and call up amendment No. 112.

Mr. McCAIN. I, of course, will have to make a motion to table the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia and ask for an immediate vote, because I believe that it is only fair to raise the spending level to 100 percent. I think that it is important for us to do that. I think the Senator from West Virginia, or his staff, knew that Senator Hutchison and I had planned on doing that when the original schedule was we were going to bring up his amendment and ours tomorrow morning. 
So I hope that the Senator from West Virginia will agree to allow our amendment for 100 percent funding to be considered and his amendment be laid aside.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to talk for quite a while on the issue and hope that perhaps sometime this evening the Senator from West Virginia will find it agreeable to raise the spending level, which is a very important part of this legislation, to 100 percent. 
Frankly, I do not understand the rationale of why we cannot go ahead and just have that done and move forward with the debate on the issue itself. The issue itself is whether we are going to subject the American people, citizens, both Federal workers and non-Federal workers, to the hardship and the incredible discomfort and sometimes the wrecking of entire lives as a result of a shutdown of the Government. 
In 1995, there were thousands of people in my State, non-Federal workers--non-Federal workers--who, unfortunately, were dislocated because of the shutdown of the Government and, therefore, not allowed to ever recover as the Federal workers were. 
Some people have questioned what we are trying to do here and why. Perhaps their memories are not as good as mine as to the impact on my State and the Nation. I received this information from the Office of Management and Budget. 
The National Park Service facilities were closed. On an average day, 383,000 people visit National Park Service facilities. Potential per day losses for businesses in communities adjacent to national parks could reach $14 million due to reduced recreational tourism. 
As a result of the closing of Yosemite National Park, Mariposa County declared a state of emergency and asked Governor Wilson of California to declare the county an economic disaster area and, therefore, eligible for State aid. 
Access to and use of national forests was restricted. The Forest Service-operated campgrounds, monuments and visitor centers were closed in the 155 national forests. No timber sales activities, including preparation, advertising and award of sales, occurred. Harvesting continued for sales awarded prior to the shutdown. 
FHA mortgages and housing vouchers were halted. On an average day, the Federal Housing Administration processes 2,500 home purchase loans and refinancing totaling $230 million worth of mortgage loans for moderate- and low-income working families nationwide. 
Last January of 1996, HUD was unable to renew 49,000 vouchers and other section 8 rental subsidies for low- and moderate-income households, which could have led to the eviction of those families. 
Applications for passports were not processed. Foreign visitors were unable to obtain visas. On an average day, the State Department receives 23,000 applications for passports. On an average day, the State Department issues 20,000 visas to visitors, who spend an average of $3,000 on their trips, for a total of $60 million. Foreign students studying in the United States and home for the holidays were unable to obtain visas to return to the United States for their classes. 
Veterans' benefits were not delivered. When the continuing resolution provided funding for certain benefits and payments, it expired and consequently contractors providing services and supplies to hospitals were not paid and benefits for January were not paid in February. 
In addition, approximately 170,000 veterans did not receive their December Montgomery GI bill education benefits and did not receive benefits in January. Funding had lapsed for processing veterans' claims, for rehabilitation counseling, and veterans were unable to obtain VA guaranteed home loans. 
Programs for the elderly were at risk. Some 600,000 elderly Americans faced the loss of Meals on Wheels, transportation, and personal care provided by the Health and Human Services Administration on Aging because the continuing resolution was not passed. 
Contractors that handled Medicare claims were not paid. Approximately 24,000 contracting employees were involved in paying Medicare claims which averages about $3.5 billion per week, and most had to self-finance payrolls and other expenses or stop their activities. Federal funds to States for Medicaid were limited and will be limited in the case of another shutdown. In December 22 States received only 40 percent of the estimated quarterly payment for Medicaid. Without further action, the Federal match for Medicaid and its 36 million beneficiaries, including 18 million children, would have run out in late January. 
Mr. President, I intend to talk more about the impact of the shutdown last time and the potential impact this time of a shutdown. 
Let me just say that in some quarters, the Congress of the United States is not held in the highest esteem. When we shut down the Government because of our failure to agree with the President of the United States, that esteem plummets even further. What we did to the American people, average citizens who had no control over the situation, in December of 1995, is unconscionable and should not and cannot be repeated. 
The whole purpose of what Senator Hutchison and I are trying to do, with the able leadership and assistance of the Senator from Alaska, is to make sure it does not happen again. We cannot let this kind of thing happen again. Too many innocent lives are injured and harmed permanently. 
I understand the very eloquent statement of the Senator from West Virginia about what a shutdown would do at 98 percent. That is why the Senator from Texas and I are willing to raise it to 100 percent of the previous year's funding. Every program will be funded at the previous year's funding level until such time as there is agreement. 
Mr. President, there are many other arguments that have been made against this shutdown-of-the-Government provision, one of them being perhaps there would be no incentive for the executive branch and legislative branch to agree on an appropriations bill. 
We all know that there are many, many issues addressed in appropriations bills, far more than I would like, many of which I have complained about from time to time. There are policy changes, if I may be so crass, a great deal of earmarked spending which I have objected to from time to time. 
It is still clearly in the interest for there to be an agreement. And it is still clearly in our interest to work together with the President of the United States. But, Mr. President, the option of such irresponsible behavior on the part of both branches that we would shut down the Government again is not thinkable and inexcusable, and I will not be a party--I will not be a party--to a situation again where the citizens of my State, who I am responsible for, when I have that responsibility will suffer as they did. 
I note that the Senator from Wyoming is in the chair as the Presiding Officer. He knows the devastation that was wreaked in the national park--I believe Grand Teton in Jackson Hole--when the national park was shut down. We cannot have that repetition, and will not. And I would hope that the administration would continue to negotiate with us so we can avoid this and at the same time come to an agreement where we can prevent a future shutdown of the Government. 
I would hope that the Senator from West Virginia would change his mind and agree to setting aside his amendment so that we may take up the 100 percent funding. And I intend to make that motion in a very short time again. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank the Senator from Texas for her commitment to the people of her State and her efforts now for a long time to make sure that never again do we put the American people through the trauma of a Government shutdown. 
I, as a conservative, believe in a minimal role of Government, but I am not a Libertarian. I do believe that there is a role for Government, and that is to provide basic and fundamental services to our citizens. That did not happen during the Government shutdown. I think we have an obligation to see that it does not happen again. 
Mr. President, I want to point out again, we have been in negotiations with the White House on this issue. I believe the President of the United States, along with the Senator from West Virginia, who has many Federal workers in his State and many people who are dependent on the Federal Government, does not want another shutdown of the Government. I am still hopeful that at some point before we have a real showdown here and a possible veto of this very much needed supplemental appropriations bill, emergency supplemental appropriations bill, that we can get an agreement worked out that would prevent a shutdown of the Government ever again. 
I have a lot to say, and I know that the Senator from West Virginia does, too. In fact, we were discussing the outlines of a unanimous consent agreement where the Senator from West Virginia would consume about 2 1/2 hours tomorrow on this issue before we would vote on it. I look forward to that debate. I do not think we will need that much time. 
I always pay attention to the arguments and discussions of the issues as articulated by the Senator from West Virginia. There is no one more respected in this body than the Senator from West Virginia. Some day he may leave, I am sure it will be after I do, but if and when he ever does, we will lose the corporate memory and the standards of conduct and behavior that was handed down to us by our predecessors. That flame is kept alive by the Senator from West Virginia. Over the past 10 years when I have been in the Senate in the company of the Senator from West Virginia, we have engaged in spirited but always respectful debate, occasionally on issues that the Senator from West Virginia feels the most passionate about--the line-item veto, of course, comes to mind. 
I must admit again--I am almost sorry I brought it up--but I must admit again that the Senator from West Virginia has won the first round, a major victory in a Supreme Court decision concerning the line-item veto. I say to my friend from West Virginia the words of the famous philosopher Casey Stengel, `It isn't over till it's over,' and I am glad the U.S. Supreme Court has expedited their procedures to give us a final rendering on this issue. 
I yield to the Senator from Texas for a question.

Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Texas, who is always in tune with the world's great philosophers, for correcting me on that, and I appreciate that. 
But back to the issue at hand, I hope the Senator from West Virginia recognizes that I do take to heart his admonitions concerning a 98-percent funding as opposed to a full funding. It is clearly our intention to make this 100 percent funding, and that we could debate this issue on those parameters. I think it would be not as useful for us to be conducting this debate on this issue of the Prevention of the Shutdown of Government Act under conditions which would not prevail in the event of a final vote on this issue. 
I respectfully, again, request the Senator from West Virginia if he would allow me to raise this to 100 percent and perhaps we could adjourn and discuss this issue tomorrow where we would have more attention from our colleagues and the American people. I do not mind debating and discussing this issue tonight, and the Senator from West Virginia and I have spent many evenings in debate and discussion, but I think with the importance of this issue, that it deserves tomorrow where we have, frankly, our friends in the media who will pay more attention and perhaps report this issue to the American people in a more accurate fashion than tonight. 
So, having said all that, I request of my friend from West Virginia if I could make a unanimous consent agreement to set aside the pending amendment and call up amendment 112 for purposes of consideration and voice vote, and then return to the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am, of course, disappointed in the response of the Senator from West Virginia. I guess at this time I have to contemplate an amendment to table the motion of the Senator from West Virginia based on the grounds that if other speakers came and spoke on this issue, Mr. President, they would not be speaking about it in its entirety, in its actuality, when the entire Senate would decide on this issue. 
In fact, I have already gotten a taste of that debate by saying that it would make all these draconian cuts to different programs, et cetera. I do not feel it is appropriate not to have an agreement that we should debate the issue as the Senator from Texas and I intended. I say that with all respect. I do not think it is appropriate not to have a debate and discussion until the true parameters and the intention of the sponsors of the amendment are taken into consideration. 
So, Mr. President, in a moment I will suggest the absence of a quorum and then decide as to whether I will move to table, and call for a recorded vote at this time.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Digital Television Conversion Act. This legislation codifies the rules and policies recently adopted by the Federal Communications Commission to govern the transition of the over-the-air television system from analog to digital broadcasting. 
Mr. President, every American has a stake in the speedy and successful implementation of new digital broadcasting technology. Those of us who like to watch TV will benefit from crisper, larger video, CD-quality audio, and more channels of video programming choices. Even better, those of us who would prefer to interact with TV will find that the convergence of digital television and computer technology will make exciting new interactive video service offerings possible. The economy will benefit from the new jobs created by manufacturing new digital television receivers. The television broadcasting industry stands on the threshold of a transformation that will assure that over-the-air broadcasting isn't relegated to the slow lane on the digital information superhighway. 
To enable this all to happen, the $100 billion television industry will be given extra channels of broadcast spectrum valued at up to $70 billion for free. In return, each television licensee will only be required to incur the cost of installing digital broadcasting equipment--a cost, I assure you, far below the estimated value of the new digital spectrum each broadcaster will be given--and, when the transition is complete, return the analog channels they now occupy, to be auctioned for other uses. 
The new and improved services that will come from digitial television, plus whatever revenue is derived from auctioning the analog channels, is what the American people will get from the television industry in return. It is therefore absolutely imperative, Mr. President, to guarantee that this transition to digital takes place as quickly as conditions will reasonably allow. Put another way, Mr. President, it is incumbent upon us to make sure, on behalf of the American people, that the television industry actually crosses the digital threshold upon which it now stands. 
And that is the reason I am introducing this legislation today. For the rules recently adopted by the Federal Communications Commission do not establish 
firm timetables and deadlines to govern the television industry's critically important digital conversion. For example, although the FCC set out target dates for television stations in each market to convert to digital, this conversion schedule is not binding on more than 90 percent of all television stations, and the Commission has not adopted any way to verify licensee's compliance with the nonbinding conversion schedule. Likewise, there is no rule requiring that television licensees return their current analog channels by any given date so they can be auctioned. 
Given the tremendous promise that digital broadcasting holds for television licensees, why not simply rely on broadcasters to voluntarily implement a rapid transition out of their own best interests? The answer, Mr. President, is that different licensees may see their own best interests in different ways. 
Some may see their own best interests served by delaying the conversion to avoid the added expenditure, at least until a majority of other stations take the plunge. This could produce a classic `chicken-and-egg' problem, especially in smaller markets: Local stations wait to convert until the cost comes down and until local viewers buy digital sets or converter boxes--but the cost won't come down and consumers won't buy digital sets or converter boxes because local stations aren't broadcasting in digital. It would be unfortunate that viewers in smaller markets, who probably stand to benefit the most from the diverse array of new services that digital broadcasting can provide, are most likely to fall victim to these perverse incentives. 
And of course, Mr. President, there is that element of self-interest that any broadcaster, regardless of market size, might have: the perfectly understandable interest in retaining both the old analog and the new digital channel for as long as possible. But this, of course, would doubly enrich television licensees, who would already have been given their digital channel for free. It would also delay the ability to use the returned analog channels for different telecommunications services from which the public would benefit. Moreover, any delay in returning the analog channels would also affect the revenues realized from auctioning them. This has now become an especially important consideration with the bipartisan agreement between Congress and the White House to balance the budget by the year 2002: Revenues from the auction of these channels have been scored and included in the estimates on which this bipartisan budget agreement is based. 
To be sure, many station licensees are apparently eager to get on with the job of conversion, although they sometimes foresee practical difficulties beyond their control getting in the way. In recognition of these potential problems, this legislation also codifies the FCC's standard for waiving the conversion schedule on a case-by-case basis. And in codifying the FCC's nonbinding analog channel giveback dates, the bill also recognizes the special circumstances faced by noncommercial broadcasters, and codifies the more liberal analog channel giveback target dates the FCC provided for these licensees. 
Nor am I concerned, Mr. President, that some markets could lose over-the-air television if analog channel reversion deadlines are codified but, for some unforeseen reason, digital broadcasting does not take hold. Codifying the digital conversion timetables will assure that as many stations as possibly can convert to digital, will. And it is simply preposterous to think that, even if digital broadcasting somehow fails to take hold during the next 9 years notwithstanding this bill's legislative impetus for it to do so, further legislation extending the date for the give back of the analog channels would not swiftly be enacted. 
In sum, Mr. President, those televisions broadcasters who are willing and eager to convert to digital will not be hurt in any way by codifying the deadlines and the waiver standard. It is only those licensees who, for whatever reason, might be less than anxious to make the transition who will have their feet held to the fire. Is this fair? You bet it is. We cannot be lax in our duty to guarantee, to the greatest extent we can, that consumers enjoy both the telecommunications benefits of digital television and the economic benefits of the analog channels' auction revenues.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I, of course, like all Americans, extend my deep and profound sympathy and pledge of assistance to those who have been ravaged by these natural disasters which are unprecedented in some parts of the country. But I am, frankly, very surprised that the Senator from North Dakota, and others, would not want to also prevent a man-made disaster that took place 2 years ago. 
I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he realizes, if the Government were to shut down again, whether those people would be able to get that assistance? The answer is no, I say to the Senator from North Dakota, and it is foolishness--it is foolishness--not to understand that when there are manmade disasters, it affects people just as badly as natural disasters do. 
I say to the Senator from North Dakota, I am sorry he is not concerned about the people of Arizona, the hundreds of families who were put out of work and lost their livelihood the last time the Government was shut down, the thousands of families who didn't work for the Federal Government, who were never repaid--never ever repaid--when the Secretary of the Interior, my fellow Arizonan, in his wisdom decided to shut down the Grand Canyon for the first time in 76 years. 
Mr. President, I am astounded at the arguments that are made against this amendment that Senator Hutchison and I and those of us on this side of the aisle are supportive of to prevent the effects of a manmade disaster which happened 2 years ago, which every American decried, which every American thought was terrible, the hundreds of millions of dollars that were lost, the people who were trying to apply for Medicare benefits, the people who were trying to apply for Social Security, the other aspects of Government services that they lost, like getting a passport so they could get back from school in Europe or take a vacation--all of the Government services that we were deprived of. Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have the unmitigated gall to call this an extraneous provision. 
I don't know where the Senator from North Dakota was--and I am sorry he left the floor--3 years ago when the California emergency earthquake supplemental contained language inserted by then Majority Leader Mitchell that dealt with the investigation of potato diseases. 
I didn't see the Senator from North Dakota on the floor when Senator Byrd put language in the bill that funded employees at the fingerprint lab in West Virginia. You know, it is a long way from West Virginia to California, Mr. President, and that language required $20 million to be expended to hire 500 employees to remain available, to be expended without regard to any other law--without regard to any other law. That was put in the California emergency earthquake supplemental. 
Where were my colleagues on the other side of the aisle when all of these extraneous provisions were put in, which is a habit around here which I have decried and taken the floor in opposition to time after time after time. 
Mr. President, this is crazy, this is just crazy, and do you know why they are doing it? Because they want to be able to threaten the shutdown of the Government so they can achieve one of two things: one, an enormous political advantage like they gained 2 years ago when, over Christmas, we saw pictures of Federal workers sitting around empty Christmas trees; or what they were able to do last year, and that is to basically blackmail the Congress into spending around $9 billion more than had been budgeted for. That is the kind of leverage they want to maintain. 
Do you know what, Mr. President? I understand political leverage, I think I understand it fairly well after a few years around here, but I am not prepared to do it at the expense of the lives and welfare of the American people, and clearly those on the other side are willing to do that. I view that as gross and crass and cynical and the worst aspect of this kind of process that we are engaged in here. 
We are trying to prevent the shutdown of the Federal Government, which affects the lives of millions of Americans, perhaps 250 million, and for the Senator from North Dakota, who I am glad came back to the floor, to say that this is an extraneous amendment when it has been a habit in the Congress to put extraneous information--where was the Senator from North Dakota when Senator Byrd put on the amendment that required $20 million in the hiring of 500 employees in West Virginia on the California earthquake disaster bill? Where was the Senator from North Dakota when then Majority Leader Mitchell put in the California emergency earthquake supplemental an investigation of potato diseases? 
I hope the American people know better than to accept these bogus arguments when we are trying to prevent a manmade disaster. 
I repeat, again, to the Senator from North Dakota, I am concerned about the people of North Dakota. I want to get them money as quickly as possible, but I am deeply disturbed he 
doesn't care about the people who live around the Grand Canyon who, if the Government shut down, would be out of work and not get the money back. It happened in my State. I don't know what happened in North Dakota when we shut down the Government. I know what happened in Arizona. I know what happened in Texas. I know what happened all over the country. I was flooded with calls and letters and messages: `What are you idiots doing in Washington shutting down the Government?" 
I do not want it to happen again. It cannot happen again. This is a big issue; this is an important issue. I am going to object and come to this floor every time someone from the other side of the aisle says this is extraneous and the President is going to veto it. If the President wants to veto it, fine. The President of the United States then will be responsible the next time the Government shuts down--don't blame us--and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, too, who don't support preventing the Government from being shut down. That is where the responsibility will lie. 
The President may veto it. It may come back. We may cave. We have done that before. If we do, the record will be clear, I say to my colleague from North Dakota. I really appreciate, again, his concern about extraneous amendments. I hope he joins me the next time a supplemental bill comes to the floor and we will propose amendments together to take out those extraneous amendments, because he wasn't there on the other times that I have been on the floor when there have been extraneous amendments on a supplemental appropriations bill. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that would provide an administrative process for obtaining a waiver of the coastwise trade laws to allow certain vessels to commercially operate in the coastwise trade. This legislation will improve the responsiveness of the Federal Government in meeting the needs of many vessel-operating small businesses. 
The coastwise trade laws require that vessels operating between U.S. ports be built and documented in the United States and owned and operated by U.S. citizens. Today, if a U.S. citizen owner of a foreign-built vessel wants to carry passengers for hire on that vessel in the coastwise trade of the United States, that person must obtain a legislative waiver of the coastwise laws. 
Many of my colleagues are familiar with these private relief bills. The legislative process for consolidating these numerous House and Senate bills usually involves including them in the Coast Guard authorization bill for final passage. 
While some Members may value the current process as a useful constituent service, it often delays resolution of a constituent's request by a year or more, causing financial hardship for the constituent's business. The potential influence of campaign contributions on such private relief bills is also a concern. The legislative process is slow, inefficient, and potentially unfair. Our constituents would be better served by delegating this waiver authority for noncontroversial requests to an appropriate administrative agency. 
My bill would authorize the Secretary of Transportation to administratively waive certain coastwise trade restrictions for vessels that meet the following criteria, which the Commerce Committee currently uses to determine if a waiver is warranted: 
First, this waiver authority would apply to foreign-built vessels of at least 3 years of age, and U.S.-built vessels that were rebuilt in foreign countries at least 3 years prior to the effective date of the waiver. The vast majority of the waiver requests considered by the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in the past 3 years were for vessels of at least this age that had originally been used for recreational or other noncoastwise purposes. 
Second, this bill would limit the coastwise trade use of vessels obtaining such privileges through this process to service carrying a maximum of 12 passengers for hire. Again, the vast majority of waiver requests considered by the Commerce Committee specified this type of intended use. 
Finally, the Secretary would be required to make a determination that the use of the applicant's vessel in the coastwise trade would not adversely affect U.S.-vessel builders or the coastwise trade business of any person who employs U.S.-built vessels in the same trade. An exemption granted under this authority could be revoked if the vessel use substantially changes so as to cause such problems. 
Mr. President, during the 104th Congress, 73 of the 119 bills considered by the Commerce Committee were requests for waiver of the coastwise trade laws for special vessels. If my bill is enacted, only a few waiver requests falling outside the above criteria would need to be considered by the Commerce Committee each year, allowing the Committee to focus its attention on more weighty matters. 
This bill would not authorize exemption from existing U.S. citizen ownership and crewing requirements. Also, this bill would not apply to vessels used for any purpose other than the carriage of a maximum of 12 passengers for hire. My approach to these waivers is supported by the Passenger Vessel Association, National Association of Charterboat Operators, the Offshore Marine Services Association, the Committee for Private Offshore Rescue and Towing, and the Shipbuilders Council of America.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, failure to approve the amendment proposed by the Senator from Delaware would require the United States to delay ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention until we obtain the agreement of other CWC parties to delete one of the treaty's articles and significantly alter another. 
I believe the issue of technology transfer is a serious one because it is the one argument that seeks to demonstrate that ratifying the CWC will actually harm the United States national security. 
The critics argue because of article XI of the CWC we will have to eliminate our national controls on chemical technologies and disband the Australia Group, a multilateral framework for restraining transfers of sensitive chemical technology. This interpretation of the treaty is contradicted not only by the text of the treaty which subordinates Article XI on the basic undertakings in Article I for parties not to acquire chemical weapons or to assist another state in doing so, but also by our experience with other nonproliferation treaties and the agreed consensus conditions included in the resolution of ratification before us. 
First of all, Mr. President, our experience with essentially similar language in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty shows that we need not weaken our national or multilateral export controls. The Nuclear Suppliers Group, the counterpart of the Australia Group, was actually founded after the NPT went into force. Nor has the NPT obliged us to curtail our national controls on the transfer of nuclear technology, even to other NPT parties. The United States enacted the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, 10 years after the NPT 
was signed. 
Moreover, beyond the text of the CWC itself we have condition 7 of the resolution of ratification before us. This requires the President to certify not only that the United States believes that the CWC does not require us to weaken our export controls but also that all members of the Australia Group have communicated at the highest diplomatic levels their agreement that multilateral and multinational controls on sensitive chemical technology are compatible with the treaty and will be maintained under the CWC. 
We also have condition 15 obliging the United States to share only medical antidotes and treatment to countries of concern if they are attacked with chemical weapons. 
Finally, we have received today from the majority leader a letter which President Clinton has sent to him committing the administration to withdraw from the CWC if other parties misuse articles X and XI of the treaty. In the words of the majority leader, this commitment is unprecedented and ironclad. 
Let me just remind my colleagues, Mr. President, that the President of the United States in this letter states: 
In the event that a State Party or States Parties to the Convention act contrary to the obligations under Article I by:

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Newspaper Ownership Act. This legislation would eliminate one of the most archaic provisions remaining in telecommunications law: that which prohibits a newspaper from being co-owned with a local radio or television station. 
Mr. President, at a time when the number of outlets for news, information, and entertainment has expanded exponentially, and at a time when other restrictions on ownership of mass media companies have been rethought and liberalized one fossil from the age of Walter Winchell and the Dumont Network remains--the law that keeps one entity from owning both a newspaper and a radio or TV station in the same market. It's time to finally get rid of this relic. 
The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership prohibition dates from a day when there was a realistic fear that common control of both media in the same locale could result in the public's receiving only one point of view on important issues. 
Radio and television outlets abound. Many are supplemented by multichannel news and entertainment outlets like cable TV and satellite broadcasting. Even in the smallest markets, diversity of viewpoints is as close as clicking on the Internet. 
It is not surprising that, in this era of media diversity, newspapers have found it tough going, their numbers steadily declining over the years. In this environment, the infusion of resources that would result from allowing them to be owned by local radio and TV station owners would be most beneficial. Moreover, is there any reason to think that an attempt to make a newspaper walk in the lock-step with a co-owned broadcast station would not be readily detected by the public, and rejected in favor of more diverse sources of information? It is difficult to believe that, given the almost bewildering variety in the numbers and types of information sources available in even the smallest markets, any seeker of information could be either so passive or so defenseless. 
Mr. President, I introduce this bill in an effort to engage informed debate on this outdated restriction. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed on the Record.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I submit a Senate concurrent resolution honoring the lifetime achievements of Jackie Robinson. I urge its immediate consideration. 
After an already distinguished career in the Negro League, Jackie Robinson became the first African-American to play major league professional baseball and one of the best individuals ever to play the game. Just over 50 years ago, Mr. Robinson animated for the entire country the simple premise on which our Nation was founded--that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Given that this animation occurred more than a decade and a half before Martin Luther King reminded us that man should be judged not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character, Mr. Robinson's accomplishments were truly great. 
As his biographers have noted, Jackie Robinson began playing major league baseball 7 years before the historic Brown versus Board of Education Supreme Court ruling, 18 years before voter registration drives in Selma, Alabama. And 18 years before passage of the Voter Rights Act of 1965. 
At a time when African Americans were still being forced to walk to the back of the bus, Jackie Robinson was walking up to the plate and receiving cheers of Americans from all walks of life. But for the cheers given the efforts of Jackie Robinson, I doubt we would have heard the cheers given to Arthur Ashe, Michael Jordon, and Tiger Woods. 
While Jackie Robinson is best known for being the first African-American to play major league baseball, his entire life was full of achievements. These are all detailed in this resolution. 
Jackie Robinson was the first four sport letterman at the University of California at Los Angeles. 
Jackie Robinson was named Rookie of the Year and subsequently led the Brooklyn Dodgers to six National League pennants and a World Series championship. 
Jackie Robinson's career earned him recognition as the first African-American to win a batting title, lead the league in stolen bases, play in an All-Star game, win a Most Valuable Player Award, play in the World Series and be elected to baseball's Hall of Fame. 
Beyond his accomplishments in baseball, Jackie Robinson was active in the civil rights movement and founded the first bank owned by African-Americans in New York city. 
Jackie Robinson's legacy continues to uplift the Nation through the Jackie Robinson Foundation that has provided 425 scholarships to needy students. 
It is difficult to list the many heights obtained by Jackie Robinson. He was as successful off the playing field as he was on. It is fitting for the Congress of the United States to honor and celebrate the achievements and contributions of Jackie Robinson; that his dedication and sacrifice be recognized; and that his contributions to African-Americans and to the Nation be remembered.

Mr. McCAIN. Was the Senator aware that Senator Dole, former majority leader, has just announced his support of the treaty with the changes that have been made, which the Senator from Delaware was able to achieve in this agreement? I think this is a very important expression of support and one that I feel will be very much respected by our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
Also, I was curious, for purposes of the time, how much longer the Senator from Delaware statement will be?

Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Delaware and the Senator from North Carolina. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina deserves great credit, in my view, because he, as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, allowed this treaty to come to the floor. The distinguished chairman could have bottled up this treaty under his authority as chairman of the committee. He deserves great praise. 
I also point out that, as various groups have gotten into this debate, there have been a lot of allegations, a lot of impugning of character and patriotism and views about whether people are tough enough or not tough enough or what is too soft. This is a debate amongst honorable people who have honorable differences of opinion, as I do with the junior Senator from Arizona, my dear friend and colleague, Senator Kyl. I would like to see, especially in the columns of various periodicals interested in this view, the debate elevated a bit as to the virtues or vices, as the observers of this treaty might view them, as opposed to speculations about the motives of those who either support or oppose this treaty. I think the American people would be far better off. 
Madam President, the importance of this issue has been pointed out. We will have political and economic consequences for the United States for many years to come. The most important question is whether this agreement is good for U.S. national security. 
In my view, one central fact dominates consideration of this issue. Regardless of whether the United States ratifies this treaty, the United States will, in the next decade or so, complete the destruction of its own aging chemical weapons stockpile. Our reasons for doing so have nothing to do with arms control. The decision was made before the CWC became a near-term possibility. I am not aware of any interest of Congress or the U.S. military in getting the United States back in the chemical weapons business. So when we consider the wisdom of ratifying this treaty, we should bear in mind that this is, first and foremost, a treaty about limiting other countries' chemical weapons, not our own, because we are doing away with ours. In practical terms, the alternative to ratification of the CWC is U.S. unilateral disarmament in the field of chemical weapons. 
The critics point out that a number of countries, such as Iraq, Libya, Syria, and North Korea, will not ratify the CWC and will therefore not be bound by its limits. True. But will our efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction out of their hands 
be enhanced if we don't ratify this treaty? No, they will not. In fact, I am confident that these rogue states are desperately hoping the Senate will reject ratification because, if we do, we will not only spare them the mandatory trade sanctions that the CWC imposes on nonparties, we will also undermine a near global consensus that all chemical weapons, including those of nonparties, should be banned. 
Madam President, for 10 years I have had the privilege of working with the former Senate majority leader, Bob Dole. Probably the closest working relationship I had with him was on issues of national security. In fact, I was privileged to serve as one of his advisers in the last campaign in his efforts for the Presidency of the United States. Madam President, I know of no one more credible on these issues, and I know of no one, going back to World War II, who understands service and sacrifice and our national security interests more than Senator Bob Dole, a man whose friendship I cherish and whose companionship I enjoy but, more important than that, a person whose views I hold in the highest esteem and regard. There are many other experts on national security issues in this town, but I know of no one who has had the experience and hands-on involvement with these issues, that is, the tough decisions, than Senator Dole. We all know that Senator Dole issued a letter today that I think is of great importance.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will not read Senator Dole's whole statement, but I think it is important what he said. I will read parts of it: 
I commend Senator Lott, Senator Helms, Senator Lugar, and many other former colleagues, as well as President Clinton and the administration officials for their constructive efforts. Is it perfect--no--but I believe there are now adequate safeguards to protect American interests. 
I repeat. 
* * * I believe there are now adequate safeguards to protect American interests. We should keep in mind that the United States is already destroying its chemical weapons in accordance with legislation passed more than 10 years ago. The CWC would require all other parties to destroy their stockpiles by April 2007. 
He goes on to say: 
As a Member of the Senate, I supported the START I, START II, INF, and CFE treaties because they met the crucial tests of effective verification, real reductions, and stability. If I were presently in the Senate, I would vote for ratification of the CWC because of the many improvements agreed to. 
Madam President, it is well known that, last fall, one of the reasons the treaty was withdrawn by the administration was because of the reservations expressed by Senator Dole at that time--then candidate Dole. It is well known that Senator Dole's reservations were legitimate and sincere. There is also now no doubt--at least in my mind, as well as in Senator Dole's--that those reservations and concerns have been satisfied by the 28 conditions that are included in this treaty, with only 5 remaining, which we will be voting on tomorrow. 
Obviously, every U.S. Senator thinks for himself or herself; there is no doubt about that. But, in my mind, this is an important event that Senator Dole should weigh in on this issue--not because there is any benefit to Senator Dole; clearly, there is a downside for his involvement, and he could have kept silent. But, once again, Senator Dole has chosen to speak out for what he believes is important to U.S. vital national security interests. I applaud him and, again, hope that he will continue his involvement in the challenges that we face in the years ahead to our Nation's security, as he has so successfully done in the past. 
The CWC critics also contend that the treaty will weaken our nonproliferation policy because article XI of the treaty says the parties will have the right to participate in `the fullest possible exchange' of chemical technology for purposes not prohibited under the convention. As a result, we will have to eliminate our national controls on chemical technologies and disband the Australia Group, the multilateral framework for restraining transfers of sensitive chemical technology. 
This interpretation of the treaty is contradicted not only by the text of the treaty--which subordinates article XI to the basic undertakings in article I for parties not to acquire chemical weapons or to assist another state in doing so--but also by our experience with other nonproliferation treaties and the agreed `consensus' conditions included in the resolution of ratification before us. 
First of all, article XI is essentially similar to the language of article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in that it blesses technology exchanges among treaty parties, but the NPT has not caused us to disband the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which was, in fact, founded after the NPT went into force. 
Nor has it obliged us to curtail our national controls on the transfer of nuclear technology, even to other NPT parties; the United States enacted the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 10 years after the NPT was signed. There will always be some countries that object to our technology controls, but these are decisions the United States makes for itself. And successive administrations, Republican and Democratic, have maintained and expanded our export controls on nuclear technology, while the NPT has contributed to our ability to obtain support from our allies in this effort by establishing an international consensus that nuclear proliferation is an evil that must be countered. 
Moreover, beyond the text of the CWC itself, we have before us 28 agreed conditions in the resolution of ratification. As a member of the group that the majority leader put together to address issues regarding CWC ratification, I am proud of the work done at the member and staff level to achieve agreement with the administration on a number of difficult issues. I am also grateful for the work done by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking minority member, who together resolved many additional problems. This work has greatly strengthened the resolution of ratification on which we will soon vote. 
Agreed condition 7 of the resolution requires the President to certify not only that the United States believes that the CWC does not require us to weaken our export controls, but also that all members of the Australia Group have communicated, at the highest diplomatic levels, their agreement that multilateral and national export controls on sensitive chemical technology are compatible with the treaty and will be maintained under the CWC. 
Conversely, if the United States rejects ratification, I doubt that we will be able to play our traditional leadership role in attempting to persuade other chemical suppliers to exercise restraint. The world will blame the United States for undermining a chemical weapons ban that the vast majority of other countries were willing to sign. If we reject ratification, where will we get the moral and political authority to persuade other Australia Group participants to block exports to countries of concern? 
The same case can be made regarding article X of the treaty, which critics claim will require us to share defensive technologies with potential enemy states. Not only does this provision apply only to CWC parties, so countries outside the treaty like Libya cannot benefit, but condition 15 in the resolution of ratification obliges the United States to share only medical antidotes and treatment to countries of concern if they are attacked with chemical weapons. And our respected former colleague, Secretary of Defense Cohen, has committed the United States to use every instrument of U.S. diplomacy and leverage to block transfers of chemical technology that would undermine our security, and he has made the obvious point that we will be better able to do this if we are inside the CWC regime rather than outside. 
It is true that the Chemical Weapons Convention will be more difficult to verify than nuclear arms control agreements such as START and INF. But regardless of whether the United States ratifies the CWC, we will have to monitor closely the chemical weapons programs of other states. The intelligence community has repeatedly told the Senate that the CWC's verification measures will be a useful tool in doing this job. General Shalikashvili has told the Armed Services Committee that `I believe that the system of declarations, of routine inspections, challenge inspections, all put together, give us a leg up to the ability to detect whether (potential violators) are, in fact, embarked upon a program that would be in violation of the CWC. So I think our chances are improved when they are members of the CWC. Our chances decrease dramatically if they are not members of the CWC.' 
While some want to reject the CWC because of verification concerns, it seems to me that this would have the practical effect of reducing the United States' ability to monitor the chemical weapons programs of other countries. This is an example of the best being the enemy of the good. 
Discussions among Senators and between the Senate and the administration have produced other agreed conditions to the resolution that have strengthened the case for ratification. 
Madam President, I also want to commend the work of the majority leader, Senator Lott, who has worked long and hard to address the legitimate concerns many Republicans Senators had 
expressed about the Convention and to accommodate the administration's correct assertion that the Senate has a duty to vote, yea or nay, on the treaty. Senator Lott and his indefatigable foreign policy advisor, Randy Scheunemann, labored tirelessly to facilitate negotiations between members and between the Senate and the administration. They ensured that these negotiations bore fruit and resulted in a resolution of ratification that resolved most, if not all, of the reservations expressed by some Senators. Both the Senate and the administration are in their debt. 
It is also appropriate, Madam President, to commend administration officials for working with the Senate in a genuinely nonpartisan way that was notable for the respect paid to the views of all Members, and the good faith shown in trying to come to terms with so many difficult issues. I have on many past occasions been critical of administration policies and the lack of bipartisanship in promoting those policies. In this instance, administration officials took great pains to secure the Senate's advice and consent in a manner that was, as I said, genuinely respectful of every Senator's views. Thus, I am happy to give praise where praise is due. 
Madam President, I respect the concerns of those Senators who cannot vote in favor of ratifying the CWC. But in my opinion, we do not need killer amendments to ensure that this treaty--negotiated under President Reagan and signed by President Bush--is on balance a good deal for the United States. This view is shared by former Presidents Ford and Bush, numerous Nobel Prize winners in chemistry, the chemical industry trade associations, gulf war victors Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, retired CNO Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, plus the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Reserve Officers Association. I am comfortable in their company, and that of every U.S. ally in Europe and Asia. That is why I intend to vote to ratify this treaty, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Madam President, I yield back my time to the distinguished Senator from Delaware.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my friend and colleague, Senator Levin, entitled Ending Double Standards for Stock Options Act. This legislation requires companies to treat stock options for highly paid executives as an expense for bookkeeping purposes if they want to claim this expense as a deduction for tax purposes. 
Currently, corporations can hide these multimillion-dollar executive compensation plans from their stockholders or other investors because these plans are not counted as an expense when calculating company earnings. Even the Federal Accounting Standards Board [FASB] recognized that stock options should be treated as an expense for accounting purposes. This month, new accounting disclosure rules issued by FASB require that companies include in their annual reports a footnote disclosing what the company's net earnings would have been if stock option plans were treated as an expense. 
An article in the Wall Street Journal, dated January 14, 1997, stated these new rules could reduce some companies' annual earnings by as much as 11 to 32 percent. One might reasonably ask how an arcane accounting rule could have such a large effect on the bottom line of corporations. The answer lies in the growth and value of stock options as a means of executive compensation. These plans now account for about one-fourth of total executive compensation. 
We all have heard the reports of executives making multimillion-dollar salaries, while average worker salaries stagnate or fall. Recently, The Washington Post reported that Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney, was given a stock option package estimated to be worth as much as $771 million over the next 10 years. Why shouldn't the value of this compensation package be included in calculating Disney's earnings? How can stockholders evaluate the true value of executive compensation if the value is just buried in a footnote somewhere in the annual report? 
No other type of compensation gets treated as an expense for tax purposes, without also being treated as an expense on the company books. This double standard is exactly the kind of inequitable corporate benefit that makes the American people irate and must be eliminated. If companies do not want to fully disclose on their books how much they are compensating their executives, then they should not be able to claim a tax benefit for it. 
This legislation does not require a particular accounting treatment; the accounting decision is left to the company. This legislation simply requires companies to treat stock options the same way for both accounting and tax purposes. 
I hope my colleagues will join in cosponsoring this important legislation that will end the double standard for executive stock option compensation.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to amend the Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA] of 1978 to make the process that applies to voluntary Indian child custody and adoption proceedings more fair, consistent, and certain. The provisions of this legislation would further advance the best interests of Indian children without eroding tribal sovereignty and the fundamental principles of Federal-Indian law. 
I want to thank my principal cosponsors, Senators Campbell, Domenici, and Dorgan, for their continued support of this much-needed legislation. Let me point out also that this bill is identical to legislation which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on September 26, 1996. It is the result of nearly 2 years of discussions and debates among representatives of the adoption community, Indian tribal governments, and the Congress to address some of the problems with the implementation of ICWA since its enactment in 1978. 
Mr. President, ICWA was originally enacted to provide for procedural and substantive protection for Indian children and families and to recognize and formalize a substantial role for Indian tribes in cases involving involuntary and voluntary child custody proceedings, whether on or off the Indian reservation. Although implementation of ICWA has been less than perfect, in the vast majority of cases ICWA has effectively provided such protection. It has compelled greater efforts and more painstaking analysis by State and private adoption agencies and State courts before removing Indian children from their homes and communities. It has required recognition by all parties that an Indian child has a vital interest in retaining a connection with his or her Indian tribe. 
Nonetheless, particularly in the voluntary adoption context, there have been occasional, high-profile cases which have resulted in lengthy, protracted litigation causing great anguish for the children, their adoptive families, their birth families, and their Indian tribes. This bill takes a measured and limited approach, crafted by representatives of tribal governments and the adoption community, to address the problems of implementing ICWA in voluntary adoption proceedings. 
This legislation would achieve greater certainty and speed in the adoption process for Indian children by providing new guarantees of early and effective notice in all cases involving Indian children. The bill also establishes new, strict time restrictions on both the right of Indian tribes and families to intervene and the right of Indian birth parents to revoke their consent to an adoptive placement. Finally, the bill includes a provision which would encourage early identification of the relatively few cases involving controversy and promote the settlement of cases by making visitation agreements enforceable. 
For a full analysis of the provisions of the bill, I respectfully refer my colleagues to the report accompanying the legislation as it was reported to the Senate on July 26, 1996, which is Senate Report No. 104-335. 
Mr. President, nothing is more sacred and more important to our future than our children. The issues surrounding Indian child welfare stir deep emotions. I am thankful that, in formulating the compromise that led to the introduction of this bill in the last Congress, the representatives of both the adoption community and tribal governments were able to put aside their individual desires and focus on the best interests of Indian children. 
Mr. President, last year, proposals were put forth in the House which would have gone too far in restricting the application of ICWA. Those proposals, which were considered by the Senate as title III of H.R. 3286, the Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996, were deleted by the Indian Affairs Committee because of our concern about the breadth of the language and the fundamental changes the provisions would have made to the government-to-government relationship between the United States and Indian tribes. 
I believe this bill represents an appropriate and fair-minded compromise proposal which would enhance the best interests of Indian children by guaranteeing speed, certainty, and stability in the adoption process. At the same time, the provisions of this bill preserve fundamental principles of tribal government by recognizing the appropriate role of tribal governments in the lives of Indian children. 
Mr. President, this bill has been thoroughly analyzed and debated in the Senate, as well as in the adoption community and Indian tribal governments. I believe it is time for the Congress to act in the best interests of Indian children by approving these amendments to the voluntary adoption procedures in the 1978 ICWA.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for all of his efforts in making this possible. 
I also would like to especially thank my friend from New Hampshire who is a dogged, a determined, a zealous, and a committed advocate of attaining a complete and full accounting of those who are still missing in action in Vietnam. 
The Senator from New Hampshire and I have had differences of view on this issue from time to time. But no one has ever questioned the absolute dedication of the Senator from New Hampshire to the commitment to those fellow Americans for whom we still have not been able to obtain an accounting. 
Mr. President, I thank him because if it had not been for him this very important letter from the White House would not have come over to our leader signed by Sandy Berger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. It lays out a very important set of priorities for further actions that need to be taken by the United States and by the Vietnamese so that we can finally put this very difficult chapter behind us. 
I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his efforts in that direction. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would like to wish, since I am confident that Pete Peterson will be confirmed by the Senate, a dear friend, Godspeed. He is traveling back to a place that he found quite uncomfortable the last time he resided there, and I am very grateful that we have an American like Pete Peterson who is willing to go back and serve his country in a very vital and important manner. And perhaps one could argue that only Pete Peterson could do this job in the way that it needs to be done in this very difficult and very critical time in our relations with Vietnam and Asia. 
So we all wish Pete Peterson every success, and we are grateful that we have someone like him who is willing to continue to serve his Nation. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Smith.

Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to reorganize and restructure the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I am joined by Senators Domenici, Dorgan, and Thomas as original cosponsors of this legislation. 
This legislation is virtually identical to the bill that was approved by the Indian Affairs Committee and reported to the Senate on January 26, 1996. Unfortunately, the Congress did not complete action on that bill prior to the end of the 104th Congress. This legislation is intended to build on the agreements contained in last year's bill and stimulate further discussions in Congress and among the tribes about the many problems in the management and operation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
I will not take the time of the Senate to reiterate the long history of efforts to reform the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Suffice it to say, after more than 150 years of proposals, reports, hearings, and other efforts, the Bureau of Indian Affairs remains a hindrance, not a help, to our Native American population. 
Since 1824, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been the principal agency of the Federal Government which is responsible for meeting this nation's trust responsibility to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Yet, based on the health, social, and economic conditions on Indian reservations, the Bureau has failed miserably in carrying out its responsibilities. 
Just take a brief look at the statistics on native American quality of life. 
Nearly one of every three native Americans in this Nation lives in poverty, including half of the families and half of the children under the age of 6 living on Indian reservations. 
Unemployment on Indian reservations exceeds 25 percent, and the per capita income for an Indian living on the reservation is $4,478. 
Approximately 90,000 Indian families are homeless or underhoused, with nearly one in five Indian families living on the reservation classified as severely overcrowded. One of every five Indian homes lacks complete plumbing facilities. 
It is long past time to change the way this Nation deals with American Indians. It is time to break down the barriers to true tribal self-governance and self-determination by providing Indian tribes the authority to design both the structure and function of their trustee, the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
This bill I am introducing today will enable the Congress, the tribes, and the administration to work together to enact the basic reforms in the management and organization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs that are necessary to improve the quality of life of native Americans today. This bill will provide an opportunity for Indian tribes to participate in the reshaping and redefining of the trust relationship with the Federal Government. 
For a detailed explanation of the provisions of this bill, I refer my colleagues to the text of the bill which follows, and to Senate Report 104-227 accompanying the legislation reported from the Indian Affairs Committee last year, which is the basis for this legislation. 
Mr. President, the reintroduction of this bill marks only the first step in achieving meaningful reform of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I remain committed to working with the new chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Campbell, my colleagues in both Houses of Congress, the administration, and most importantly, the Indian tribes to ensure that this legislation meets the goal of real and necessary change in the Bureau. I look forward to our discussions, and I urge my colleagues to join in sponsoring this bill to ensure prompt enactment of this important and much-needed legislation to reorganize the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I and Senator Hutchison and Senator Lott and Senator Nickles, Senator Stevens, and Senator Craig are introducing the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. This bill creates a statutory continuing resolution as sort of a safety net CR, which would trigger only if the appropriation acts do not become law or if there is no governing continuing resolution in place. 
I want to emphasize here, after a long series of negotiations with the House, with the advice and consent and leadership of the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the active participation and leadership of Senator Stevens especially, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, negotiations with the Speaker, the Appropriations Committee chairman, Mr. Livingston, in the House, and also Majority Leader Armey, we have come up with this legislation. 
Mr. President, this legislation is important. It must be done soon. I believe the lesson of the last 2 years is that we cannot allow the Government to be shut down again. Nor can we allow the threat of a Government shutdown to be so impactful that we fiscal conservatives are somehow forced to appropriate billions--in the case of last year around $8 billion--additional because of the threat of a Government shutdown. So, this is very important legislation. It is not something that I am idly throwing into the hopper. 
I thank Senator Hutchison for her efforts and participation on this bill. What this legislation does is ensures that the Government will not shut down and that Government shutdowns cannot be used for political games. This safety net continuing resolution basically would set spending for fiscal year 1998 at 98 percent of 1997 fiscal year levels. 
In other words, the way this would work is if we could not get agreement on the appropriations bills, rather than the threat of a shutdown of Government or parts of Government because of failure to appropriate funding for their continued effort, this would be funded at 98 percent of the previous year's level. That would ensure, if any kind of standoff between the Congress and the White House occurs, that vital Government functions will continue and Government employees will continue to serve the public. 
It is our intention to move this bill quickly. It is very important we act before the appropriations season begins in earnest. Therefore, it is the intent of Senator Hutchison and myself to move this bill as soon as possible, specifically on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that will be before this body probably within a month or so. 
We all saw the effects of gridlock in the past. No one wins when the Government shuts down. Shutdowns only confirm the American people's suspicions that we are more interested in political gain than doing the Nation's business. The American people are tired of gridlock. They want the Government to work for them, not against them. The budget process in the last Congress, in my view, was a fiasco and, more important, in the view of the American people. 
Our Founding Fathers would have been ashamed of our inability to execute the power of the purse in a responsible fashion. I am sure they would have been quite shocked by the 27 days that the Government was shut down, 13 continuing resolutions, and almost $6 billion in blackmail money that was given the administration to ensure that the Government did not shut down a third time. 
Although Republicans shouldered the blame for the Government shutdown, President Clinton and his colleagues were equally at fault for using it for their political gain. Republicans were outmaneuvered by President Clinton because we were not prepared for him to use the budget process for his own political purposes. We thought that by doing the right thing--passing the first balanced budget in a generation, and fiscally sound appropriations bills--that we would eventually prevail. What we did not realize was that the President was more interested in playing politics with the budget than actually balancing it. This year we have to be prepared for these games and launch a preemptive strike to ensure that basic Government operations will not be put at risk during the next budget battle. 
This legislation does not erode the power of the appropriators and gives them ample opportunity to do their job. It is only if the appropriations process is not completed by the beginning of the fiscal year, as was the case in the last Congress, that the safety net continuing resolution will go into effect. 
In addition, I emphasize that entitlements are fully protected in this legislation. The bill specifically states that entitlements such as Social Security--as obligated by law--will be paid regardless of what appropriations bills are passed or not passed. 
According to President Clinton, the combined cost of last year's Government shutdown was $1.5 billion. However, this figure does not begin to account for the millions of dollars lost by small businesses who depend on the Government being open. In my State of Arizona, during the Government shutdown the Grand Canyon was closed for the first time in 76 years. I heard from people who work close to the Grand Canyon. These were not Government employees. These were independent small business men and women. They told me that the shutdown cost them thousands of dollars because people could not go to the park. According to a CRS report, local communities near national parks alone lost an estimated $14.2 million per day in tourism revenues as a direct result of the Government shutdown, for a total of nearly $400 million over the course of the shutdown. 
The cost of the Government shutdown cannot be measured in just dollars and cents. During the shutdown millions of Americans could not get crucial social services. For example, 10,000 new Medicare applications, 212,000 Social Security card requests, 360,000 individual office visits and 800,000 toll-free calls for information and assistance were turned away each day. There were even more delays in services for some of the most vulnerable in our society, including 13 million recipients of AFDC, 273,000 foster care children, over 100,000 children receiving adoption assistance services and over 100,000 Head Start children--not to mention the new patients that were not accepted into clinical research centers, the 7 million visitors who could not attend national parks, or the 2 million visitors turned away at museums and monuments. And the list goes on and on. 
In addition, our Federal employees were left in fear wondering whether they would be paid, would they have to go to work, would they be able to pay their bills on time. In my State of Arizona, for example, of the 40,383 Federal employees, over 15,000 of them were furloughed in the last Government shutdown. I do not want to put these workers at risk ever again. 
A 1991 GAO report confirmed that permanent funding lapse legislation is a necessity. In their report they stated, `Shutting down the Government during temporary funding gaps is an inappropriate way to encourage compromise on the budget.' 
Neither party can afford another break of faith with the American people. Our constituents are tired of constantly being disappointed by the actions of Congress and the President. They are tired of our not being prepared for what appears to be the inevitable. That is why this legislation is so important. We want the American people to know that there are some of us in Congress who are thinking ahead and who do not want a replay of the last Congress. 
I want to especially note the support of our good friend, Senator Stevens, the distinguished Senator from Alaska and chairman of the Appropriations Committee. His support of this bill is crucial, and I thank him for it. I wish him well in overseeing the appropriations process. 
While I am sure we will all have our differences, I am confident he will be able to do his best to ensure that the Senate enacts the appropriations bills in an efficient and expeditious manner. Let us show the American people that we have learned our lessons from the last Congress. Passing this preventive measure will go a long way to restore America's faith that politics or stalled negotiations will not stop Government operations. It will prove to our constituents that we will never again allow a Government shutdown or threat of Government shutdown to be used for political gain. I hope the Senate will act quickly on this important matter. 
I thank the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, who is on the floor, for her continued efforts on behalf of this legislation. The State of Texas is a very large State. It was very heavily impacted, as was my State. As I say, we fully intend to move this legislation onto the supplemental appropriations bill, which should be before the body either this month or sometime next month. 
I want to say that this is not an idea that Senator Hutchison and I came up with. It was an idea that is supported throughout the Congress. We engaged in serious and sincere negotiations with the leader, Senator Lott, whose leadership was vital in this endeavor.

Mr. McCAIN. 
Mr. President, today, I proudly reintroduce the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act of 1997. This legislation addresses the importance of Parkinson's research by authorizing $1 million for Parkinson's research. 
Approximately 1 million people in this country are afflicted with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a debilitating, degenerative disease which is caused when nerve centers in an individual's brain lose their ability to regulate body movements. People afflicted by this disease experience tremors, loss of balance and repeated falls, loss of memory, confusion, and depression. Ultimately, this disease results in total incapacity for an individual including the inability to speak. This disease knows no boundaries, does not discriminate, and strikes without warning. 
This important piece of legislation honors Mo Udall, a dear friend of mine who served as a dedicated Congressman from Arizona for 30 years. Mo is remembered most for his warmth, compassion, integrity, and his wit. He was a champion of civil rights, political reform, and a protector of the environment. In 1980, Congressman Mo Udall was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and he began his valiant battle against this disastrous disease. Mo was forced to resign from Congress in 1991, his exemplary career prematurely ended by Parkinson's. 
I was fortunate enough to have not only worked with Mo Udall as a Representative from Arizona, but to have Mo as a mentor and a close, personal friend. Mo's stewardship and integrity would not allow him to become involved in partisan politics. When I arrived in Washington, DC, as a freshman Congressman from Arizona, Mo reached across the aisle, took me under his wing and provided me with guidance, leadership, humor, and, most importantly, friendship. I can never begin to adequately thank Mo for all that he provided me and his profound impact on my early years as a Member of Congress. In some way, I hope that my efforts on his behalf and the millions of others with Parkinson's can be a token of appreciation for all that Mo has given me and our country. 
Personally, I have witnessed the devastating effects and personal tolls which Parkinson's disease has on its victims, as I have watched this horrible disease wreck havoc on my dear friend, Mo. I have watched Mo, his family, and friends wage a daily battle against this painful disease. Every day, Mo and millions like him throughout the country face a disease which is physically crippling and financially devastating. I can truly empathize with the fear and frustration that Mo and others like him must be feeling as they become prisoners within their own bodies, clinging to the hope that a scientific breakthrough may soon be discovered and they will be liberated from their personal prison. 
The Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act provides the hope Mo and millions like him are looking for. This bill will help us make significant scientific progress by increasing the Federal Government's financial investment in Parkinson's research for fiscal year 1998 by authorizing $1 million. 
An important component of this legislation will be the establishment of up to 10 Morris K. Udall Centers for Research on Parkinson's Disease throughout the Nation. These centers will be responsible for conducting basic and clinical research in addition to delivering care to Parkinson's patients. Uniting these three areas will assure that research developments will be coordinated and the care delivered to patients will be effective, high quality services based upon the most recent research developments. The Morris K. Udall Centers will be structural in a manner which allows them to become a source for developing teaching programs for health care professionals and disseminating information for public use. 
In addition, this bill will create a national Parkinson's Disease Information Clearinghouse to gather and store pertinent data on Parkinson's patients and their families. This collected data will facilitate and enhance knowledge and understanding of Parkinson's disease. 
This bill will establish a Morris K. Udall Excellence Award to recognize publicly the investigators with a proven record of excellence and innovation in Parkinson's research and whose work has demonstrated significant potential for the diagnosis or treatment of the disease. 
I am heartened by the tremendous progress scientists are making in Parkinson's research. There is significant scientific evidence indicating that there is very strong potential for major breakthroughs in the cause and treatment of Parkinson's in this decade. According to a wide array of experts, we are on the verge of substantial, ground-breaking scientific discoveries regarding the cause and potential cure of Parkinson's disease. We need to seize this rare opportunity to discover the cause, treatment, and a potential cure for one of the Nation's most disabling diseases. It is imperative that we give our scientific researchers the necessary funding and support to combat this and other neurological diseases, and to improve the lives of many Americans. 
This is why we must enact the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act of 1997. We can't allow this opportunity to make significant progress in the area of Parkinson's research slip away because of a lack of support for our Nation's scientific researchers. 
Finally, I would like to thank the hundreds of individuals who have written or called my office in support of this measure. These individuals are committed to seeing this legislation enacted this year and are hopeful that Parkinson's research will finally receive a fair and justifiable investment from the Federal Government.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on March 30, 1997, there was a political rally outside the Cambodian National Assembly in the capital city of Phnom Penh. One of the participants in this rally was Sam Raimsy, a prominent opposition figure and leader of the Khmer Nation Party. 
In the course of the demonstration, someone lobbed grenades into the crowd. Nineteen people were killed, including one of Sam Raimsy's bodyguards. More than a 100 others were injured, one of which was an American citizen, Mr. Ron Abney. Ron works for the International Republican Institute, of which I am proud to be chairman. For years, Ron has worked with all political parties to promote free and democratic institutions in Cambodia. We all hope for his prompt and complete recovery from his injuries. 
Mr. President, this was a particularly cowardly and brutal act of political terrorism. Among the killed and injured were many women and children. In addition, the real target of this attack was Cambodia's efforts to build a peaceful and democratic future on the ruins of the devastation wrought by decades of war and tyranny. 
Immediately after the attack, I wrote to Cambodia's two Co-Prime Ministers, Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, expressing my outrage and demanding that the perpetrators of this attack be brought to justice. I have received a response from Prince Ranariddh, in which he calls the March 30 atrocity a `most heinous and savage criminal act committed on innocent and peace-loving people.' He also said that he had ordered `immediate measures to be taken to arrest, try and sentence the criminal(s) and all those involved.' 
I believe, however, that it is also important for the Senate to make clear its outrage at this attack. The resolution that I have just introduced extends the Senate's sympathy to the victims of the grenade attack, condemns the bombing itself as an act of terrorism, and calls upon the governments of Cambodia and the United States to cooperate in identifying and prosecuting those individuals responsible for the attack. 
I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

 Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I have read the report in the Wall Street Journal that Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed E. Hundt proposes to implement only a portion of the new universal service fund rules by the statutory deadline of May 8. Specifically, he suggests delaying the adoption of rules assuring reasonable rates for telephone subscribers in rural and high-cost areas, although he would proceed to implement a new $3 billion yearly fund to wire schools, libraries, and health care facilities through an unspecified tax on telephone company revenues. 
Last January I wrote to Chairman Hundt about his apparent desire to implement these provisions prior to implementing the remainder of the universal service provisions of the statute. At that time, I stated that sound implementation of the Telecommunications Act requires that the Commission resolve all the related issues involved in universal service carefully and contemporaneously. 
Apparently Chairman Hundt has not changed his view, Mr. President, but neither have I. 
Implementing universal service funding in separate stages would be incompatible with the law. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 states clearly and unambiguously that the FCC `shall initiate a single proceeding to implement the recommendations from the Joint Board . . . and shall complete such proceeding' by May 8, 1997. 
It would be consistent with this unequivocal statutory requirement for the FCC to adopt specific new rules on May 8 and have them take effect in the future. It would also be consistent with the statute for the FCC to adopt general outlines of new rules on May 8, and fill in specific details by subsequent order. The FCC can, and in my judgment should, avail itself of these courses of action if it finds, for whatever reason, that it cannot adopt final rules on all aspects of universal service on May 8. But one thing the FCC cannot do by law is pick and choose some statutory requirements to put into effect on May 8, and delay the rest till later. 
Let me be clear. I can understand the possible problem Chairman Hundt faces: too much proposed subsidy, and not enough revenue to handle it without raising rates for telephone service. I emphatically am not suggesting that he simply proceed to adopt final universal service fund rules and thereby raise telephone rates on May 8. But if, after studying universal service as extensively as it has, the FCC has concluded that it cannot implement the universal service provisions of the statute without increasing telephone rates or incurring similar unacceptable outcomes, it must defer from implementing any universal service rules until it can satisfactorily demonstrate to both the Congress and the public that any rate increases that would result are inevitable in fact and appropriate in amount. 
Unless and until the FCC can do that, the Commission should take no final action on universal service. To try and evade the issue by implementing the parts of universal service that may be politically desirable while dodging the rest because it appears politically unpalatable would be a dereliction of the Commission's duty under law.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, thank the distinguished majority leader because last night he played a very key role in assisting us in making what I thought was an extremely difficult agreement. 
I also want to thank the Democrat leader, Senator Daschle, who also was in agreement that he would move forward on this issue, get it resolved, and have it done. I was prepared to come over here shortly before the vote in praise of really what was an outstanding bipartisan effort. The administration, the Democrats, and the Republicans worked together to come up with something which required significant compromise on the part of 
all sides in order to come up with an agreement that we could move forward and get this issue behind us, which we know has extraordinary dimensions associated with it, given the emotion associated with the issue of drugs and the explosiveness of our relations with Mexico. 
Now, I understand that one of the Members of this body wants to tie this hard-fought agreement, of which he was not a party, to the Chemical Weapons Convention. I hope that the individual who wants to block moving forward with this resolution understands that we are working on a Chemical Weapons Convention and an agreement to move forward on it. There are active discussions and negotiations that are going on. But to tie that to this, in my view--and I say this with careful consideration--is totally irresponsible. 
The Senator from California, the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from Texas, the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, the President's National Security Adviser, the Secretary of State all joined together. I again applaud the Senator from California who had a very tough position on this, and a very principled one, I might say. And now we are being hung up on a Thursday before going into a recess, which a lot of us would like to go on, because one Member of this body who was not a part of the negotiations, nor, by the way, is a part of the Chemical Weapons Convention negotiations, of which I am a part, is going against the direct agreement of the majority leader, the Democratic leader, and all of us. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to get this thing done. And I hope that the majority leader will move this unanimous-consent agreement, and let whoever objects come to the floor and move forward in a parliamentary fashion with a live quorum call. 
This is an important issue that we have to get done with today. The majority leader has described this scenario of what happens if we went to conference, and what happens if we go ahead on a direct vote for decertification. This flies directly in the face of a completely bipartisan agreement. 
Mr. President, there is a lot of conversation about the rancor and partisanship. We just went through a very bitter situation on the point of the CIA Director. We proved that we can work together for the good of the country, and now it is about to be derailed. I strongly object to it. 
I yield to the Senator from Texas for a question. 
I apologize for taking time from the Senator from California. Again, I have the utmost praise for her, not only on agreement on the compromise last night, but for her constant attention and concern over this vitally important issue. 
I don't know of anything right now that is more important than our relations with Mexico and the war on drugs, which is destroying young Americans as we speak. 
I yield to her for a question.

Mr. McCAIN. That is correct. 
I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Texas. All of us understand the importance of the war on drugs. Those of us from border States perhaps--I emphasize perhaps--appreciate it a little bit more because of the direct involvement that we have. 
I am not going to speak on this again in the Chamber and take time. I think we are going to work this out. We have to. I want to especially express my appreciation to the Senator from California, the Senator from Texas, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, and the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, and others, and members of the administration who sat down with us and negotiated, I think, an important and positive agreement and a way around this issue. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from California, and I yield the floor.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, daily we are learning of new allegations and revelations regarding how last year's elections were financed. Just yesterday, we learned that the Chinese Government created a $1.8 million fund with which it sought to influence up to 30 Members of Congress with campaign contributions. 
The Congress now faces a monumental task. How can the system be effectively and fairly changed? The answer is both simple and daunting: by passing comprehensive, bipartisan campaign finance reform. Some openly oppose campaign finance reform. One of the leaders, if not the leader, my friend, Senator McConnell, is there. I admire him and respect the fact that he is a standup guy. He does not hide that fact. Others have said to me, `I am for campaign finance reform, just not yours.' I challenge my colleagues and say that every aspect of Senator Feingold's and my bill is open for debate. Everyone is welcome at the table. I believe there is no excuse for inaction. 
Real reform must do two things. It must limit the influence of money in campaigns, and it must level the playing field between challengers and incumbents. I believe those two principles cannot be compromised, but the rest is up for negotiation. 
I find that there are fewer and fewer Americans--in fact, recent polls show that 9 out of 10 Americans believe that we must repair this system and that it is out of control. I just heard my colleagues talking about how in 1974 it didn't work, and if we passed further campaign finance reform, somehow that would be bad, as it was bad in 1974. 
Now, Mr. President, I wasn't in Congress in 1974, but I am very aware that, in 1972, there were people walking around this town with valises full of hundred dollar bills. The stories I have heard concerned people being asked to contribute 1 or 2 percent of their gross income. Somehow to allege that the changes made in 1974 didn't help reform the system I think, frankly, flies in the face of facts. The facts are that, as a result of the 1974 reforms, we did fix the system for quite a while. Mr. President, when I was elected to Congress in 1982, there was a far different environment than exists today in fundraising. The fact is, it worked for quite a while, and then loopholes were exploited, Supreme Court decisions gave additional avenues for the funneling of so-called `soft money' into campaigns, and it is out of control again. 
Mr. President, in 1986, we reformed the tax system in this country--supported overwhelmingly here in Congress--and closed some tax loopholes. We took several million people off the tax rolls, and it was generally applauded. We fixed the system to a significant degree. We all know now, in 1997, we need to fix the tax system again. I say to you, in 1974, much needed reforms were enacted by an overwhelming majority of Congress. They did some good things. It did clean up the system dramatically. 
Now circumstances and times have changed. We all know the problems, Mr. President. We all know the problems. They are made abundantly clear by picking up any newspaper today. The pursuit of funds and money has become a full-time occupation, and the average citizen no longer has the same voice in Washington, DC, that they did years ago. 
Earlier this week, a man who I have not only grown to respect and admire enormously, but I have also become a good friend with over the many years I have been here and worked very closely with, is Senator Ford from the other side of the aisle. I think many would describe Senator Ford, with admiration, as a partisan member of his party. I also know that there are many others of us who have had the opportunity of working with him for many, many years. If you want to reach a legislative result and you want to reach it in a nonpartisan and, if necessary, bipartisan fashion, you sit down with Wendell Ford, along with, 
by the way, my friend from South Carolina, Senator Hollings. Example: At the end of last year, we were able to pass legislation which was the most massive change in aviation, how we fund and structure it, since 1978 when we deregulated the airline industry. Wendell Ford, acting in a bipartisan fashion, made that legislation possible. I intend, as is appropriate, when the time comes, to elaborate on my feelings of affection and respect for Senator Ford. 
One of the things Senator Ford mentioned as the reason why he was not going to seek reelection was because he was going to have to raise $100,000 a week between now and election day. He also added, in his own inimitable style, that his wife would not allow him to rent out the spare bedroom. But the fact is, Mr. President, that every time one of our Members leaves this body, they cite the money chase. They cite the problem that money has become the overriding factor in the determination of candidacy and outcome. That should not be, Mr. President. 
Ask anyone who is considering running for public office. They come here to Washington, DC, because they need the support of the party people and the money and the PAC's and the interest groups, and they will tell you they are only asked one question when they announce they are going to seek election, and one question only. It's not, `How do you stand on taxes?' or `on the role of Government,' or `how do you feel about national defense?' There is only one question they are asked, Mr. President: `Where are you going to get the money?' 
When we get into a full-blown debate on this issue--which I hope we will because I still hold the fervent hope and belief that we will address campaign finance reform on this floor in one way or another before this year is out, and I don't know when that will be--I suggest that it will only be done in a meaningful fashion when there is sufficient anger and outrage on the part of the American people who demand that we fix this broken system, and not until. 
I don't think we really ought to debate this until we are ready to achieve a legislative result. I don't know when that will be, Mr. President. But I can tell you, we are a heck of a lot closer to that point than we were, say, 6 months ago. I believe 3 months from now, or 2 months from now--after the hearings Senator Thompson is going to be holding--there will be a much greater impetus and desire on the part of the American people that we more thoroughly and completely address this issue and try to fix the broken system. 
I believe that we can and should and will. It used to be that we waged a battle of ideas between candidates. The battle was well fought and hard won on the election battlefield. Now it is the battle of the bucks. 
Again, at an appropriate time, I will talk about the well-known public facts and how much campaign costs have risen, how much it costs to run a Senate race, how much it costs in order to buy television, and how much soft money has grown in exponential numbers to the point where, according to the Washington Post not long ago, the cost of Federal campaigns was well over $2 billion, whether they be small States or large States. 
Mr. President, I do not believe that the constitutional amendment is the answer. We can enact campaign finance reform without a constitutional amendment. S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill, is fully consistent with the law. I can point out many more constitutional scholars, including a former chief counsel of the ACLU, as to constitutionality because it is based primarily on voluntary spending limits. 
The Supreme Court has ruled that we cannot stop someone who is willing to spend an unlimited amount of money to campaign for a Federal office from doing so. 
This bill provides strong incentives for candidates to voluntarily comply with spending limits regardless of personal wealth. Candidates who choose to spend unlimited amounts of their own money receive none of the benefits under our legislation. 
Mr. President, there is an argument that is being bandied about that somehow we cannot place a limit on soft money, that it would be unconstitutional to do so. I find that curious. I find that curious because the courts have clearly allowed the Congress to place limits on contributions to campaigns. We have placed an individual limit of $2,000. We placed a PAC limit of $10,000. We do not allow a corporation or a union to provide any direct contributions. Yet somehow people on this floor are saying somehow it would be unconstitutional to place limits on soft money. There is no rational constitutional argument there in my view. There is no justifiable need for soft money. All contributions made to the party should be done using hard, fully traceable, fully disclosed dollars. There is no constitutional right to soft money. The courts have stated that any contribution can be limited.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the reason I asked that the letter be included in the Record is that he says: 
I am writing in response to a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell, dated February 20, 1997, from the American Civil Liberties Union, arguing that critical provisions of S. 25, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1997, are unconstitutional under existing Supreme Court precedent. I am the John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law at New York University and Legal Director of the Brennan Center for Justice. I served as National Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union during the 1980's, and remain active in defense of the First Amendment. I continue to serve as an ACLU volunteer counsel. I believe, however, that the ACLU letter on S. 25 is simply wrong in a number of assertions, despite the fact that it was written by an able lawyer whom I respect and admire. 
Mr. President, I think it is an interesting rebuttal to the position that the ACLU has taken on S. 25. 
I would also like to point out that I have great respect for the ACLU. But there are very few occasions on which I have agreed with the positions that the ACLU has taken on a broad variety of issues. 
We can argue the constitutionality of this issue, and, if we win, we will get into the major debate. But I will have a very large body of constitutional opinion--not just the ACLU--as to the constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold bill. 
I also suggest again that we have to clean up this system. It is broken. It is out of control. Almost every American agrees with that. Poll after poll after poll is telling us that the American people are cynical about us, the way we are selected, and the system under which money seems to be the determinant factor in the selection of our public servants. 
I will continue to seek support both inside the Halls of Congress and outside the beltway, and I and Senator Feingold fully intend to bring this bill up this year. The ideal way that we would seek to do that would be us all sitting down together and coming up with a package as we did on the gift ban, as we did on lobbying reform, as we did on the line-item veto, as we have on a broad variety of reforms we have enacted by near unanimous if not total unanimous agreement. 
My message to those who say I am now in favor of campaign finance reform is, as you know, so am I, so are many others, so are most Americans. So let us sit down adhering to principles and recognize what the problems are and sit down as mature individuals and move forward and reform this system for the benefit not only of those of us who have the honor and opportunity to serve today but provide an opportunity for dedicated and outstanding young men and women to serve this Nation in the future in elected office. 
I intend to continue to conduct this debate with respect and appreciation for the views of my colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who disagrees with me, my colleague from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton, and others. I believe that we can strongly disagree on this issue and respect each other's views, and I think the American people deserve a debate that is conducted in an environment of mutual respect. I am happy to say that at least in my view we have conducted this debate on that level during this period of time, recognizing that it is a very emotional issue on both sides. But I think the American people will be far better off if we continue to conduct this debate on the Hollings bill today as well as our overall debate on campaign finance reform in that vein in the future, and I commit to my colleagues that I will conduct it in that fashion. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President. I introduce legislation designed to clarify the authority of the FCC to authorize foreign investment in United States broadcast and common carrier radio licenses. Joining me today, is Chairman Burns of the Subcommittee on Communications. 
Mr. President, American companies and consumers worldwide will benefit tremendously from the passage of this legislation. No one can deny that U.S. telecommunications services providers ability to compete in the global market is hampered by the restrictions that we place upon foreign companies seeking to do business here. The problem is quite simple: the more restrictive the foreign ownership rules are here in the U.S., the more oppressive are the regulations that are placed on United States companies in other countries. The solution is just as simple: the greater the willingness by the United States to permit foreign ownership of U.S. companies, the greater the success of the U.S. companies wishing to maximize their ownership opportunities overseas. 
This bill accomplishes just that by amending section 310(b) to: First, remove the statutory limitation on foreign indirect investment in U.S. corporations holding common carrier or aeronautical radio licenses (but not broadcast licenses); second, allow foreign direct investment greater than 20 percent in U.S. corporations holding common carrier or aeronautical radio licenses, if the FCC finds it in the public interest; third, explicitly prohibit any corporation with more than 20 percent foreign government ownership from holding common carrier, aeronautical or broadcast licenses. 
It is clear that lowering barriers to foreign ownership in this country will result in greater opportunities for U.S. service providers overseas. The ripple effect on the U.S. telecommunications industry as a whole would increase the benefits across the board from consumers to manufacturers to service providers. The only way for the United States to effectively lead the world in establishing an expansive global marketplace is to set the standard in this country by which U.S. companies want to be measured overseas. Liberalizing foreign ownership restrictions under 310(b) would send that message to our foreign partners loud and clear. 
That is why I am introducing this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to join me and support the legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota. The fact is, it is hard for me to understand the argument when the American economy is the best it has been, in the opinion of any expert, in a long, long time. Our unemployment is low, our trade continues to grow, our economy continues to grow. It is a direct result of free trade. How can we make the argument, which will be done later on, that somehow we should be reraising barriers that are protectionist and isolationist when it flies in the face of what every outside expert says has been the main engine of growth of the American economy, and a that is free trade? 
What Ms. Barshefsky has just done, in the negotiation of the telecom agreement, is a signal, an important and remarkable advance to the effort of free trade in allowing American companies and corporations into foreign markets so we can hire more Americans and 
continue to have this remarkable growth in our economy and a bright future for Americans. The debate will be drawn, time after time, and has been, between protectionism, between the desire to raise those protectionist barriers, to go back to the good old days of Smoot-Hawley or whether we are going to move forward with free trade and reduce barriers. 
I believe the American people and those people who are engaged in business, those who are in the business of doing business, will strongly support the position that the administration holds of free trade and reduction of barriers for competition. 
I yield back to my colleague from Ohio.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will not be able to use that time because I have to go to another meeting. I appreciate the time and the courtesy of the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth. But I would like to use 20 minutes because my friend from South Carolina covered a broad variety of issues, some of which I assure my colleague from South Carolina we will be addressing in hearings in the Commerce Committee--the results of NAFTA, the results of free trade; perhaps some of the reasons why unemployment is at its lowest in America. The last quarter it was just downgraded to 3.9 percent GNP growth--the reason Americans finally in the lower middle-incomes are seeing increases; why this economy is the envy of the world; why it is that free trade has played such an important role. 
I had the pleasure--the distinct pleasure, I say to my friend from South Carolina--of spending some time in his State. There happened to be an important Republican primary in the last election. It was a great privilege and honor for me to get to know many of the wonderful citizens of his State. In case he has not noticed, they are doing very well. They are working at the BMW plant. They are working at the Sony plant. They are working at all these corporations and companies that have come to this terrible country of ours which is so protectionist and so outrageous. They are coming to our country, I am sure the Senator from South Carolina has noticed. And in the view of the South Carolinians that I spoke to, they think it is a lot better with the high-paying jobs at the BMW plant than at a textile mill; than standing in front of a loom in that kind of back-breaking, sweat labor that existed; where they are getting higher salaries and more benefits, thanks to the companies and corporations that have come into South Carolina; thanks to the enlightened leadership of the State of South Carolina, including the Senator from South Carolina who has attracted them.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from South Carolina that I did travel the entire State. His point is well made that it is not a totally even economy. He can come to my State and find out that in the southern part of my State it is as high as 35 to 40 percent unemployment in the city of Nogales. But the overall economy is good. It is better, in my view, because of free trade, and again the enlightened policies of seeking and obtaining foreign corporations who come in and give high-paying jobs. 
I also, by the way, have had the chance to go to Hilton Head and Charleston and some of the other areas that are doing extremely well. But there is no sense in going through a road map of the depiction of the State of South Carolina which is a lovely and beautiful State, as certainly the Senator from South Carolina well knows. 
But I want to repeat to him again. We will have hearings in the Commerce Committee about the state of the American economy, about the impact of trade, where protection works and where it doesn't, and what the effects of NAFTA has been and whether we should expand NAFTA, which would be a proposal of the administration. 
I will say with all respect to the Senator from South Carolina, I believe the members of the committee and the American people will be enlightened by our debate because I know that the Senator from South Carolina is well informed and holds very strong views, as do I and other members of the committee. I note the Senator from West Virginia is here, who also has his problems within his State. 
So I hope the hearings we will have will not only have a legislative result but also will perform the much-needed function of enlightening the American people and our colleagues as to what free trade is all about, its effects, and, by the way, the effects of protectionism and restraint of trade. 
I do oppose the amendment offered by Senator Hollings, and I will at the appropriate time offer a motion to table. This amendment, in my view, jeopardizes Ms. Barshefsky's nomination. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Archer, has conveyed to Finance Committee Chairman Roth that the House will reject the amendment and thereby kill the nomination of a very qualified individual.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I will not go through the whole statement of administration policy except to say the administration strongly supports the resolution which will authorize the appointment of Charlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. Among other things it says: 
The Hollings amendment could require congressional approval of every trade agreement that might be construed to require changing U.S. law. The amendment is unnecessary to assure the executive branch is conforming to congressional mandates on trade negotiations, is overly burdensome for both the President and Congress, and could endanger the benefits to the United States of some trade agreements. 
The prospect of nearly continuous consideration of trade agreements by the Congress also raises the possibility of delaying the entry into force of agreements beneficial to the United States. For example, the Hollings amendment could greatly delay--and perhaps jeopardize--recent agreements that eliminate tariffs on 400 pharmaceutical products shipped to key markets around the world * * * cut $5 billion in global tariffs on semiconductors, computers, telecommunications equipment, software * * * open the global market for basic telecommunication services, providing enormous benefits to our dynamic U.S. telecommunications industry. 
Mr. President, what does the Washington Post say about it? It says: 
The Telecommunications Deal. After 3 years of tough negotiations, the world's leading economies have reached a landmark agreement to liberalize trade in telecommunications services. Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who led both sets of talks, predicted the U.S. information technology industry will now lead the growth of the U.S. economy as the car industry did 40 years ago. This wasn't a traditional agreement in which one country grudgingly agreed to accept textile imports, say, in order to gain access for its tomato exports. Instead, every nation involved acknowledged the benefit to itself of liberalization and deregulation of the model that the United States and Great Britain have pioneered. Half the world's people have never made a phone call. Poorer countries, where most of them live, will attract the investment that they need only if they play by these new rules of openness and competition. 
The Washington Times: 
Teleco Mania. For the second time in three months, tough minded and determined U.S. trade negotiators under the auspices of the 2-year-old World Trade Organization have hammered out a multinational high tech trade agreement that will be immensely beneficial to firms and workers based in the United States and consumers worldwide. 
The list goes on and on, Mr. President, of the almost universal praise of this landmark agreement that Ms. Barshefsky has been able to achieve. Frankly, there were a lot of pessimists who believed that she could not do that. I believe she is well qualified for the job. President Clinton referred to Ambassador Barshefsky as a brilliant negotiator for our country. She is a tough and determined representative for our country, fighting to open markets to the goods and services produced by American workers and businesses. 
I will not go through her qualifications, Mr. President, in the interest of time because they are illustrious. 
Her foresight and depth of understanding of our country's international trade relations are essential to our Nation's continued economic growth. She is exceptionally qualified, and I am sure that the full Senate will join me in confirming her nomination to be the U.S. Trade Representative. 
From financial services to Japanese insurance to global telecommunications, Ambassador Barshefsky has proven herself to be a tough negotiator. For example, in April of 1996, as one of her acts as USTR, Ambassador Barshefsky walked away from the poor efforts made under the auspices of the World Trade Organization regarding basic telecommunications services. She made everyone come back to the table and last month concluded the WTO's basic telecom agreement which represents a change of profound importance. A 60-year tradition of telecommunications monopolies and closed markets will be replaced starting in January 1998 by market opening, deregulation and competition, the principles championed here by many of us for a long time. 
Senator Hollings has concluded that the recently announced telecommunications agreement of the World Trade Organization would change U.S. statutory law. Not only do I disagree, but as I mentioned, the Senator finds himself on the other side of the argument with President Clinton.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the reason why I ask that is because there are many technical and legitimate questions that are raised by Senator Lott, Senator Kerrey, and by Senator Hollings. The responses that Ambassador Barshefsky made, I think, are important to be in the Record. I will not take the time of the Senate to read those. 
The amendment, I believe, is not only not good for America, but I believe that the amendment represents a different view of trade and how nations should treat each other in this world competitive marketplace. I believe that the American worker can compete with any worker in the world. I believe that the American worker is the finest in the world. I would rather have an American working to build a product than any other nationality, without any disrespect to any of them. With that fundamental belief that American workers can compete and do a better job, then I am in favor of reducing the barriers, which the agreement that Charlene Barshefsky has negotiated will accomplish. 
Telecommunications is a $600-billion-a-year industry. The World Trade Organization's basic telecom agreement will double the size of the industry over the next 10 years. There is not a single telecommunications business in America that does not totally support this agreement. The agreement will lead to the creation of countless jobs in U.S. communications companies, in high tech equipment makers, and in a range of industries such as software, information services and electronic publishing that benefit from telecom development. 
This agreement is literally unprecedented. It covers over 90 percent of world telecommunications revenue and includes 69 countries, both developed and developing. It ensures that U.S. companies can compete against and invest in all existing carriers. Before this agreement, only 17 percent of the top 20 telecommunications markets were open to U.S. companies. Now they have access to nearly 100 percent of these markets. 
The range of services and technologies covered by this agreement is breathtaking--from submarine cables to satellites, from wide-band networks to cellular phones, from business internets to fixed wireless for rural and underserved regions. The market access opportunities cover the entire spectrum of innovative communications technologies pioneered by American industry and workers. 
Most important, the agreement will save billions of dollars for American consumers. The average cost of international phone calls will drop by 80 percent, from approximately $1 a minute on average to 20 cents per minute over the next several years. The agreement, as I said earlier, was widely lauded by those in the telecommunications industry. 
Mr. President, of equal concern is the impact this amendment would have on the ability of the President to negotiate future trade agreements. The Hollings amendment could require congressional approval of every single trade agreement that might result in any change in regulations or administrative practice, no matter how slight the change. 
The overwhelming majority of trade agreements that the President concludes can be--and traditionally have been--implemented under statutes that the Congress has already put on the books. If the President tries to implement an agreement in a manner that is not provided for under legislation, the courts can prohibit him from taking those steps. 
The amendment is harmful to our Nation's trade interests. The approval requirement imposed by the amendment would impose long delays and could create uncertainties for lucrative trade agreements that would otherwise bring immediate benefits to American consumers, firms and workers. It is the American workers who would be hurt by this amendment. 
Under Senator Hollings' amendment, the President could not use the powers already granted him if he intends to make any change in regulatory or administrative practice, no matter how insignificant. This amendment would require an act of Congress every time the President allocates a new cheese or sugar quota, adds a quota on a textile or apparel product, or implements a tariff rate quota on agricultural products, such as those recently negotiated on imported goods such as tobacco. The President has traditionally made these routine changes under proclamation authority granted by the Congress. 
Finally, Ambassador Barshefsky will also have a busy coming year. It is my hope that she will move quickly to send the Congress legislation to provide for a clean reauthorization of fast-track authority so negotiations can begin immediately to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement to Chile. Pending successful expansion of NAFTA, negotiations should continue on the development of a free trade area of the Americas. 
Substantial questions will also arise regarding extension of MFN status to China and the accession of China into the World Trade Organization. I am confident that Ambassador Barshefsky is up to these challenges. 
Mr. President, the United States has historically been a world leader in opening markets and expanding trade. I believe leadership waned over the first term of the Clinton administration. It is my hope, and, indeed, my prediction, that under the leadership of Charlene Barshefsky, the United States will again take its place as the world leader for open and fair trade. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the Hollings amendment and support Senate Joint Resolution 5 so that Ambassador Barshefsky can be confirmed and appointed to serve as our next U.S. Trade Representative. 
Mr. President, I regret there is not time, but there will be opportunities in the future to debate these issues with my friend from South Carolina, who I have said on many occasions is not only enlightening but on occasion entertaining as well, which makes for spirited and involved debate. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time back to Senator Roth.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Passage of this constitutional amendment to balance the budget is the only way to provide the needed discipline to guarantee our Government's fiscal restraint. 
This constitutional amendment simply requires the Federal Government's total outlays not exceed total receipts for any fiscal year. It is important to note that Congress may waive this requirement if 60 percent of each body votes to do so. The amendment can also be waived in times of war. In order to become part of the Constitution, two-thirds of the House and Senate must vote in favor of the amendment, and then it must be ratified by three-fourths of the States. 
The facts are clear. History has proven that Washington is incapable of making the tough spending decisions necessary to put our fiscal house in order. Despite endless debate and support for a balanced budget, our Federal budget has not been in balance since Neil Armstrong landed on the moon 28 years ago. 
For years, politicians--in Congress and in the White House--have talked incessantly about the need and their desire to balance the budget. Listen to the following quotes:  
We must balance the federal budget . . . I shall recommend a balanced budget . . . 
--RICHARD NIXON 
JANUARY 22, 1970 
With careful planning, efficient management and proper restraint on spending we can move rapidly toward a balanced budget--and we will. 
--JIMMY CARTER 
JANUARY 19, 1978 
The path I've outlined is fair, balanced and realistic . . . aiming toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade.' 
--RONALD REAGAN 
JANUARY 25, 1983 
If only talk meant action. 
Neither the current rhetoric about balancing the budget nor the momentary good news that our annual deficits have been coming down more than was expected should trick us into believing that we are on the right path. 
According to a January 1997 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office [CBO], the deficit will climb from the current $107 billion to $124 billion this year. And it will not stop there. It will increase to $188 billion in 2002 and reach $278 billion in 2007. In 10 years, without fundamental changes in our spending habits, the deficit will be over 2 1/2 times what it was in 1996. CBO's assessment of these skyrocketing deficits is very disturbing: 
The budget deficits projected for the future years are so large that they could put an end to the upward trend in living standards that the Nation has long enjoyed. Thus current U.S. budget policies cannot be sustained without risking substantial economic damage. 
Talk about a risky scheme. `Substantial economic damage'--the CBO report went further, stating that if we fail to bring our deficits to a halt, our economy will enter a period of `accelerating decline.' 
How many warnings will it take to spur us to action? Are there any words strong enough to force us to act? 
The number crunchers show us that if we do not act, our children will face tax rates of 82 percent. Talk about taxation without representation. Staggering statistics show that a child born today will have to pay nearly $200,000 in taxes over his or her lifetime just to pay interest on the debt. 
Have we completely forgotten Thomas Jefferson's stern warning? 
We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves. 
Mr. President, it is clear we have dismissed the moral implications of deficit spending. We only need look at the buildup of our national debt as proof. Although it took us over 200 years to reach the $1 trillion debt mark, in less than 20 
years the debt has grown more than five times. It now stands at a staggering $5.3 trillion. Do you realize to pay off this debt, every family of four would have to pay $1,156 a month for the next 5 years? That is $38 per day. 
As more than 200 economists told the Congress in an open letter, in which they urged support to the balanced budget constitutional amendment: 
We have lost the moral sense of fiscal responsibility that served to make formal constitutional restraints unnecessary. We cannot legislate a change in political morality; we can put formal constitutional constraints in place. 
We have a moral obligation to ensure that our children and grandchildren and their grandchildren are not burdened with backbreaking debt. We are snatching away their prospects of ever achieving the American dream. I was struck by a recent report on generational accounting that showed a child born today will keep just 16 percent of their lifetime wages if we do not change the course of our Government spending. How can we believe that we are preserving liberty and freedom if we are asking our children to surrender 84 percent of their lifetime earnings to feed the Federal trough? I have seven children and three grandchildren. It is simply not fair to my children or anyone's children to pass down this legacy of debt. 
Even in this time of some optimism about balancing the budget by the year 2002, there are no assurances that we will actually achieve that goal or that we will keep the budget in balance beyond 2002. One year in balance is not enough. Let us not forget that Congress and the President have been trying with little success to balance the budget for almost three decades. 
Time and time again, Congress has passed statutes that were supposed to restore fiscal discipline--the 1990 budget agreement, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings I, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings II, just to name a few. Unfortunately, good intentions have not produced the desired results. Spending targets were adjusted and readjusted. Deadlines came and went. Promises of spending restraint were broken again and again. We cannot afford any more empty promises. 
Opponents of this amendment will tell you we do not need 
this amendment to balance the budget because both the President and the Congress have agreed to work together to balance the budget by the year 2002. Our well-intentioned colleagues should not be lured into this false sense of security that ignores history. 
Since 1960, we have had a balanced Federal budget only one time. Why? People in public office like to do popular things. One need only look at the budget fiasco of 1995 to realize that balancing the budget is neither popular nor easily achievable in today's political climate. 
The late Senator Paul Tsongas put it best: 
If you ask yourself why are these deficits always voted for, the answer is very simple * * * There are a lot of votes in deficit spending. There are no votes in fiscal discipline. What you have here is a sad case of pursuit of self as opposed to pursuit of what is in the national interest. The balanced budget amendment is simply a recognition of that human behavior. 
Now, I want to talk for a moment about Social Security. I had hoped that Social Security would have been exempted from the balanced budget constitutional amendment, and I voted twice to remove Social Security from the effects of this amendment. I believe that exempting Social Security--with the caveat that it is administered honestly and we do not turn the trust fund into a slush fund for other Federal spending--would have protected the Social Security trust funds and ensured the viability of the system for our current and future retirees. 
At the same time, I fully recognize that exempting Social Security from this amendment would force us to address the need for real spending reductions in other Federal programs. I believe my record on cutting Government spending is pretty clear--I have proven time and time again I am willing to make the tough votes to cut popular programs. However, I am not sure that some of my colleagues who supported the Reid and Dorgan amendments to exempt Social Security would actually be willing to rein in spending by the additional $700 billion necessary to balance the budget without including the Social Security trust funds in the calculations. 
Our efforts to exempt Social Security did not prevail. 
Nonetheless, I will be vigilant in my fight to protect the Social Security trust fund and end this charade of using trust fund moneys to mask the deficit. I know Arizonans do not want their hard-earned dollars invested in the Social Security system to be used for studying cow flatulence, shrimp aquaculture centers, wood utilization research programs, or potato research programs, just to name a few. 
Mr. President, I firmly believe that the most serious threat to Social Security at this time is deficit spending and our ever-growing national debt. As Robert Myers, the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration from 1947-1970, stated recently: 
[T]he most serious threat to Social Security is the federal government's fiscal irresponsibility. If we continue to run federal deficits year after year, we will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid the trust funds to pay for our current profligacy, or we will print money, dishonestly inflating our way out of indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the real value of the Social Security Trust Funds. Regaining control of our fiscal affairs is the most important step that we can take to protect the soundness of the Social Security Trust Funds. 
Mr. President, that is exactly what the balanced budget amendment would do--it would force us to control our fiscal affairs. Passage of this amendment in the Senate is only one small step toward fiscal responsibility. This amendment still has a way to go before becoming part of our Constitution--the most sacred and important document underpinning our Nation's history and Government. A tough vote awaits in the House, and then three-fourths of the States must ratify the amendment. 
But we must move this process forward. The mere fact that this amendment has been trapped in Washington for so many years proves just how out of touch we are with those we supposedly represent. Poll after poll of the American people shows the balanced budget amendment winning approval ratings of nearly 80 percent. Yet, Washington politicians want to keep this debate inside the beltway, probably because they fear what might happen if we let the people decide. 
What are the opponents of this amendment afraid of? Quite simply, they are afraid that it will pass. I can understand why they are scared. You see, many are spending addicts who have 
built their entire political careers spending other people's money on their own priorities. They do not want to part with their Federal credit card that has no limits and never comes due. They hide behind excuses about why a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget will not work. They say they support a balanced budget amendment, just not this one. Or they talk about balancing the budget, but refuse to actually do it. 
In short, they want to protect themselves from making tough spending decisions. They prefer the status quo. 
Opponents of this amendment probably understand best the real effect of this amendment. They understand that it will be a straitjacket on spending. 
However, let me be perfectly clear that nothing in the balanced budget amendment precludes Congress from continuing on our current path. We could still deficit-spend even with this amendment in effect, so long as 60 percent of each House votes in favor of doing so. Granted, this would be a tougher hurdle to clear. But why not force Congress to live up to a higher standard, to be more accountable, when the future prosperity of our country is at stake. 
Finally, the games that politicians in Washington have long played will be exposed for what they really are--to use a favorite phrase of President Clinton and Vice President Gore from the election--a `risky scheme' that threatens to devastate Social Security, Medicare, education, and the environment. 
Passage of this amendment would finally force Washington to do what needs to be done, namely, determine our long-term spending priorities; address projected deficits in important programs; shift power back to the States, local communities, and families; and provide incentives for savings and investment. Perhaps the real fear of this amendment's opponents is that President Clinton's own words would finally come to fruition--the era of big government would be over. 
Mr. President, we cannot allow career politicians seeking to preserve their own interests to hold this amendment hostage any longer. In State Houses across the country, we must begin the debate about whether the Federal Government should be forced to live within its means. 
I call on every American to read carefully this proposed constitutional amendment. Do not be fooled by the scare tactics of those who cannot control their hunger for Federal spending. Decide for yourself whether it will help or hurt our current state of fiscal affairs. 
It is time for real Americans to closely examine all the what ifs and the excuses about why we should pass this disciplinary tool, and see if they hold water. Unfortunately, we know all too well that all of the what ifs and excuses cannot erase the facts. 
In January 1995, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, chaired by Senators Bob Kerrey and John Danforth, warned us that in the year 2012, projected spending for entitlements and interest on the national debt will consume all tax revenues collected by the Federal Government. By 2030, projected spending for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Federal employee retirement programs alone will consume all our tax revenues, leaving us nothing to educate our kids, keep our streets safe or protect our environment. 
The warnings are clear. Time is wasting. Since we last voted on the balanced budget amendment in June 1996, our national debt has increased nearly $200 billion. We would be wise to remember the words of one of our great founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson:  
I place economy among the first and most important of republican virtues, and public debt as the greatest of dangers to be feared. 
I hope my colleagues will pay heed to Jefferson's sage advice and support the balanced budget amendment.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend, Senator Dodd, to introduce an important piece of legislation which would have a tremendous impact on the lives of many blind people. Our bill restores the 20-year link between blind people and senior citizens in regard to the Social Security earnings limit which has helped many blind people become self-sufficient and productive. 
Unfortunately, by passing the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act last year, Congress broke the longstanding linkage in the treatment of blind people and seniors under Social Security, which resulted in allowing the earnings limit to be raised for seniors only and did not give blind people the same opportunity to increase their earnings without penalizing their Social Security benefits. 
My intent when I sponsored the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act was not to permanently break the link between blind people and the senior population. Last year, time constraints and fiscal considerations forced me to focus solely on raising the unfair and burdensome earnings limit for seniors. I am happy to say that the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act became law last year, and the earnings exemption for seniors is being raised in annual increments until it reaches $30,000 in the year 2002. This law is allowing millions of seniors to make their lives better and continue contributing to society as productive workers. 
We now should work in the spirit of fairness to ensure that this same opportunity is given to the blind population. We should provide blind people the opportunity to be productive and make it on their own. We should not continue policies which discourage these individuals from working and contributing to society. 
The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator Dodd, will restore the traditional linkage between seniors and blind people and allow them the same consideration as seniors in regard to the Social Security earnings test. This bill would reunite the earnings exemption amount for blind people with the exemption amount for senior citizens. If we do not reinstate this link, blind people will be restricted to earning $14,400 in the year 2002 in order to protect their Social Security benefits, compared to the $30,000 which seniors will be permitted to earn. 
There are very strong and convincing arguments in favor of reestablishing the link between these two groups and increasing 
the earnings limit for blind people. 
First, the earnings test treatment of our blind and senior populations has historically been identical. Since 1977, blind people and senior citizens have shared the identical earnings exemption threshold under title II of the Social Security Act. Now, senior citizens will be given greater opportunity to increase their earnings without having their Social Security benefits being penalized; the blind, however, will not have the same opportunity. 
The Social Security earnings test imposes as great a work disincentive for blind people as it does for senior citizens. In fact, the earnings test probably provides a greater aggregate disincentive for blind individuals since many blind beneficiaries are of working age--18-65--and are capable of productive work. 
Blindness is often associated with adverse social and economic consequences. It is often tremendously difficult for blind individuals to find sustained employment or any employment at all, but they do want to work. They take great pride in being able to work and becoming productive members of society. By linking the blind with seniors in 1977, Congress provided a great deal of hope and incentive for blind people in this country to enter the work force. Now, we are taking that hope away from them by not allowing them the same opportunity to increase their earnings as senior citizens. 
Blind people are likely to respond favorably to an increase in the earnings test by working more, which will increase their tax payments and their purchasing power and allow the blind to make a greater contribution to the general economy. In addition, encouraging the blind to work and allowing them to work more without being penalized would bring additional revenue into the Social Security trust funds. In short, restoring the link between blind people and senior citizens for treatment of Social Security benefits would help many blind people become self sufficient, productive members of society. 
I want to stress that it was always my intent that the link between blind and senior populations would only be temporarily broken. I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this important measure to restore fair and equitable treatment for our blind citizens and to give the blind community increased financial independence. Our Nation would be better served if we restore the work incentive equality provision for the blind and provide them with the same freedom, opportunities and fairness as our Nation's seniors. 
I ask unanimous consent that numerous letters of support from various community groups and state organizations be included as a part of the Record. In addition, I would like to thank the many chapters of the National Federation of the Blind from throughout the country who have sent letters of support for this important piece of legislation including the Arizona Chapter, Idaho Western Chapter, Minnesota, Alabama, South Carolina, Shoreline Chapter of Connecticut, Iowa, Idaho, Minnesota's Metro Chapter, Virginia, Maryland, Connecticut, New York, Utah, Pennsylvania, California, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Idaho s Elmore County, and the Pend Oreille Chapter of Idaho.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the legislation before us to reinstate the aviation excise taxes, which support important aviation safety and security improvements, as well as system capacity enhancements. It is our duty to take action now to restore this vital revenue stream. I commend the Finance Committee for recognizing the urgency of this situation and moving the legislation forward on a fast track. 
The aviation excise taxes lapsed on December 31, 1996. Current estimates show that if we do not restore the aviation trust fund taxes immediately, the trust fund balance will be insufficient to pay for the safety and security programs we approved last year as part of the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. The Federal Aviation Administration predicts, and budget officials confirm, that under current circumstances capital spending on aviation will come to a halt in March. We are clearly doing the right thing by approving this legislation in these emergency circumstances. 
I am disappointed, however, that we could only agree to extend the current tax structure for aviation improvements until the end of September. I fear we will face another tax lapse at that time, and risk jeopardizing the trust fund sponsored programs again. The taxes for aviation safety and security should remain in place until we are ready to offer a suitable alternative to the current structure. Congress last year established the National Civil Aviation Review Commission to study and make recommendations along these lines. The term of the tax extension should coincide with this process. 
Nevertheless, I endorse this legislation because my foremost priority right now is restoring the viability of the trust fund. I realize that if the Senate successfully extended the term of the reinstatement beyond September, the House would object. We would have to take the issue up in conference, and thus delay resolution of a situation that has already reached critical mass. Realistically, we would probably end up in a position no better than the one we are in today. 
That said, we should be clear about one of the main reasons we are setting ourselves up for another lapse. The dedicated aviation trust fund taxes have fallen victim to congressional budget games. The excise taxes that support our aviation system expired late last year and late the year before, following years of uninterrupted renewal. Congress figured out that if it allows the aviation taxes to lapse, it can reinstate the taxes later, and use the revenues to offset tax cuts or increased spending elsewhere in the budget. 
This is budget chicanery, pure and simple. We should use the taxes paid by air travelers and shippers exclusively for aviation safety, security and capacity improvements. When we use these aviation revenues to offset spending elsewhere in the budget, the American people rightfully question how we intend to use their dedicated aviation taxes. 
More important, we should not play with this dedicated aviation revenue stream, simply to take advantage of convoluted congressional budget procedures. The need for budget process reform is clear. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to impress upon them the reality that it does not matter if revenues and appropriations are accounted for on different sides of the ledger. Even if the excise tax revenues are deposited in the trust fund, deficit pressures will reduce incentives to spend these funds for their dedicated purpose--aviation safety and capacity improvements. 
Budget process reform is a debate for a later date. Today, I rise in full support of this legislation to reinstate the aviation excise taxes on a short term basis to support critical aviation safety and security improvements. We must remain vigilant in seeing this legislation through to enactment. Any further lapse in the taxes that support the trust fund would jeopardize safety-related capital improvements, and shake the public confidence in the Government's ability to safeguard the Nation's air travelers. 
We should all be held accountable for not letting the excise taxes that support our aviation system lapse in the future. It would be wrong and irresponsible for us to let the aviation trust fund get caught up in our budget games again.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important issue related to reinstatement of the aviation excise taxes. Financing for the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], and for the aviation safety and security initiatives it supports, is an issue of critical importance in both the short and the long term. That is why the last Congress established a process for achieving a long-term solution. 
The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 created the National Civil Aviation Review Commission, and tasked it with developing specific legislative proposals for long-term FAA funding. Unfortunately, the administration has failed to appoint any of the 13 members it is responsible for appointing to the Commission despite the fact that the reauthorization act was signed into law nearly 5 months ago. This Commission has very important responsibilities and it needs to begin its work soon. The exercise we are engaged in today clearly demonstrates that need. 
The Commission has a limited time in which to complete its tasks and must begin its work immediately. In fact, an independent assessment of the funding needs of the FAA should be completed this week. The assessment was prepared specifically for the Commission s use. However, because the administration has failed to make any appointments, there probably will not be a Commission to receive the assessment. 
The aviation leadership of the Commerce Committee wrote to the President on January 28 to request that he take action to ensure that the commissioners are appointed immediately. I have also made Transportation Secretary Slater aware on numerous occasions of the urgency of the Commission appointments. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the President on this subject from Senators Gorton, Hollings, Ford, and myself be printed at this point in the Record.

Mr. McCAIN. The majority leader is absolutely correct. As mentioned in our letter to the President, the chief sponsors of the FAA reauthorization bill wanted to be sure that the commission was a balanced group. We fully expected the administration to act very quickly to appoint commissioners, so that then the congressional leadership would have an opportunity to address any perceived biases or omissions.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Lieberman and I are here to announce the introduction of bipartisan legislation to address a health care crisis facing over 7 million Americans who each year receive life-saving or life-enhancing medical implants. The availability of these implants is jeopardized because the suppliers of raw materials used in the implants can no longer afford to expose themselves to the ridiculous and unjust litigation costs that can result from doing business with implant makers. 
The problem is that, in the quest for a deep pocket, biomaterials suppliers are roped into product liability lawsuits concerning the implant even though those suppliers are not involved in the design, sale or manufacture of the implant. Biomaterials suppliers just provide raw materials used in the production of vital medical devices such as brain shunts, pacemakers, and artificial joints. 
In virtually every case, biomaterials suppliers are not found liable in these lawsuits. Unfortunately, the massive cost of defending these lawsuits often overwhelms the relatively small amount of revenue biomaterials suppliers receive through the sale of their product to implant makers. As one might expect, biomaterials suppliers are deciding they cannot risk financial ruin to supply biomaterials. 
This bill, the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1997, shields biomaterials suppliers from the crushing costs of unwarranted litigation. The bill simply permits suppliers of biomaterials to be quickly dismissed from a lawsuit if they did not manufacture or sell the implant and if they met the contract specifications for the biomaterial. This bill will not prohibit someone who has been injured from filing a lawsuit and recovering damages. 
This legislation is critically important to saving lives. In 1995, Tara Ransom, a young girl from Arizona, wrote me a letter indicating her concern that she would die because a new brain shunt would not be available for her. Tara has a life-threatening condition called hydrocephalus where excess fluid builds up on the brain. Without a silicone-based brain shunt to drain the fluid build-up, the pressure would likely kill Tara. 
The supplier of the silicone for Tara's brain shunt has indicated they must withdraw from the biomaterials market due to the risk of unwarranted litigation. Thirteen other companies have also indicated they will no longer supply biomaterials due to concerns about unwarranted litigation. 
We cannot let this insanity continue. Lives are at stake, and we have a moral duty to Tara and the thousands of others whose lives are at stake to pass this litigation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I recognize the important contribution that voluntary family planning programs can make to the effectiveness of U.S. foreign aid programs. Clearly, high rates of population growth are an immense barrier to economic and social change in developing countries. 
I also recognize that increased access to population planning programs can help reduce the number of abortions, as I understand has been happening in Russia, for example. 
However, we must also recognize why the Congress imposed the funding limitations contained in the fiscal year 1997 foreign operations appropriations bill. It was because of a serious difference of views, within the Congress and between the Congress and the administration, over whether U.S. population planning funds should go to organizations that also provide abortion services. 
Like many of my colleagues, I have long supported the Mexico City policy of the Reagan and Bush administrations, which restricted funds for any non-governmental organizations that were involved in any way in abortion activities. Although there is a broad consensus that no U.S. aid funds should be used to fund abortions themselves, it is intellectually dishonest to ignore the fact that dollars are fungible. 
Providing funds to an organization for purposes other than abortions can free up funds from other sources that can then be used for abortions. That organization can say, with a straight face, that the U.S. funds did not pay for the abortions, but the practical effect is the same, which is contrary to the intent of the law and the desires of the American people. 
I have no desire to hold up the release of funds for population planning programs. And if the administration agrees to return to the Mexico City policy, there will be no future delays in the release of such funds. Funding for population programs may even increase. But if we vote to release the fiscal year 1997 funds early, it will be viewed by the administration as an endorsement of its current policy regarding funding for organizations that provide abortion services. 
For this reason, I will vote against the early release of the funds.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that would allow us to make desperately needed improvements within America's national parks. 
The National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 1997 would allow private fundraising organizations to enter into agreements with the Secretary of the Interior to issue taxable capital development bonds. Bond revenues would then be used to finance park improvement projects. The bonds would be secured by an entrance fee surcharge of up to $2 per visitor at participating parks, or a set-aside of up to $2 per visitor from current entrance fees. 
Our national park system has enormous capital needs--by last estimate, over $3 billion for high priority projects such as improved transportation systems, trail repairs, visitor facilities, historic preservation, and the list goes on and on. The unfortunate reality is that even under the rosiest budget scenarios our growing park needs far outstrip the resources currently available. 
A good example of this funding gap is at Grand Canyon National Park. The park's recently approved park management plan calls for over $300 million in capital improvements, including a desperately needed transportation system to reduce congestion. Despite this enormous need for funding, the Grand Canyon received only $12 million from the Federal Government last year for operating costs. The gap is as wide as the Grand Canyon itself. Clearly, we must find a new way to finance park needs. 
Revenue bonding would take us a long way toward meeting our needs within the national park system. Based on current visitation rates at the Grand Canyon, a $2 surcharge would enable us to raise $100 million from a bond issue amortized over 20 years. That is a significant amount of money which we could use to accomplish many critical park projects. 
I want to emphasize, however, the Grand Canyon would not be the only park eligible to benefit from this legislation. Any park unit with capital needs in excess of $5 million is eligible to participate. Among eligible parks, the Secretary of the Interior will determine which may take part in the program. 
I also want to stress that only projects approved as part of a park's general management plan can be funded through bond revenue. This proviso eliminates any concern that the revenue could be used for projects of questionable value to the park. 
In addition, only organizations under agreement with the Secretary will be authorized to administer the bonding, so the Secretary can establish any rules or policies he deems necessary and appropriate. 
Under no circumstances, however would, investors be able to attach liens against Federal property in the very unlikely event of default. The bonds will be secured only by the surcharge revenues. 
Finally, the bill specifies that all professional standards apply and that the issues are subject to the same laws, rules, and regulatory enforcement procedures as any other bond issue. 
The most obvious question raised by this legislation is: Will the bond markets support park improvement issues, guaranteed by an entrance surcharge? The answer is yes, emphatically. Americans are eager to invest in our Nation's natural heritage, and with park visitation growing stronger, the risks would appear minimal. For example, a recent Washington Times editorial printed on December 8, 1996, noted that park visitation has increased to nearly 280 million since 1983, so that now more than a quarter of a million people visit our national parks every year. That editorial went on to point out that attendance is expected to further increase to well over 300 million by the turn of the century. 
Are park visitors willing to pay a little more at the entrance gate if the money is used for park improvements? Again, yes. Time and time again, visitors have expressed their support for increased fees provided that the revenue is used where collected and not diverted for some other purpose devised by Congress. 
With the fee demonstration program currently being implemented at parks around the Nation, an additional $2 surcharge may not be necessary or appropriate at certain parks. Under the bill, those parks could choose to dedicate $2 per park visitor from current entrance fees toward a bond issue. 
Finally, I want to point out that the bill will not cost the Treasury any money? On the contrary, it will result in a net increase in Federal revenue. First, the bonds will be fully taxable. Second, making desperately needed improvements sooner rather than later will reduce total project costs. 
Mr. President, this legislation seeks to use park entrance fees to their fullest potential through bonds. I appreciate that some details may remain to be worked out in this bill and I encourage the administration and other interested groups to work with me to fine tune this legislation. But, I believe that use of revenue bonds to pay the staggering costs for capital improvements within our parks is an idea whose time has come. 
America has been blessed with a rich natural heritage. The National Park Service Organic Act, which created the National Park Service, enjoins us to protect our precious natural resources for future generations and to provide for their enjoyment by the American people. The National Parks Capital Improvements Act must pass if we are to successfully fulfill the enduring responsibilities of stewardship with which we have been vested. I urge my colleagues to support me in this important effort.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep disappointment in the President's 1998 budget request for critical aviation safety and infrastructure purposes. Most notably, the administration proposes to fund the Airport Improvement Program [AIP] at only two-thirds of its current level. This represents a drastic cut to our Nation's airport grant program, which supports airport safety, security, and capacity programs. 
Mr. President, the administration has assured the American public of its commitment to a safe and secure aviation system. Without adequate resources, this assurance rings hollow. 
For instance, the White House Commission on Safety and Security is due to report tomorrow on a number of steps we should take to enhance the security of the aviation system. I expect the Commission will offer valuable insight on where we should go from here to implement additional security enhancements. How we pay for these enhancements is a significant issue. 
In addition, Congress approved and the President signed into law the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. Administration officials hailed the importance of the bill's safety and security initiatives. We all joined together at the signing ceremony in praise of the legislation's security improvements. However, these improvements are meaningless without adequate financial support. For politicians to praise their own efforts in a press conference and yet fail to provide sufficient resources is cynical, at best. 
Again, I want to be clear. The administration's actions and assurances are only as good as the resources allocated to implement them. Unfortunately, the administration submitted a budget request significantly short on aviation capital improvements, so that he can use these resources elsewhere in the budget to support his spending initiatives. Meanwhile, he knows he can count on Congress to step up to the plate and restore funding for vital aviation initiatives. Such budget chicanery is neither serious nor responsible. 
Past experience bears out this point. When President Clinton took office, the Airport Improvement Program was a $1.9 billion program. Every year, Congress has funded the program at a level higher than the request. For example, in fiscal year 1996, the AIP request was for $1.3 billion, and Congress enacted a $1.45 billion level. In fiscal year 1997, the administration requested $1.35 billion and Congress responded with a $1.46 billion appropriation. At the same time, the administration claimed record-level investments in transportation infrastructure improvements. 
The AIP funds more than just airport construction projects, which 
make airports safer and enhance the system's ability to handle ever increasing levels of air traffic. Airports also use these funds to support their security programs and purchase security-related equipment. 
The Administration's budget request also proposes reduced funding for the FAA facilities and equipment account. This account is the principal resource for modernizing and improving the air traffic control system, providing enhanced baggage screening equipment, and enhanced weather detection programs. 
I recognize that the Administration has made efforts to bolster its safety and security work force. Even so, a significant funding source for FAA operations depends on an unspecified user fee for which the FAA has no statutory authority to collect. 
Mr. President, this is not a serious budget proposal. The Administration should back up its safety and security recommendations with enough funding to put them in place. The Nation's air travelers have paid taxes dedicated to support the aviation system. They rightfully expect the Government's commitment to spend these funds on their intended purpose.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate began debate on the balanced-budget constitutional amendment, of which I am an ardent supporter. Passing this amendment, and abiding by it, is the most important action we can take to protect the future of our children, grandchildren, and future grandchildren. Congress' insatiable appetite for spending is mortgaging the prosperity of these future generations. Not only is this irresponsible, but it is immoral. 
Our Founding Fathers recognized the basic principle that the Federal Government must not spend beyond its means. Thomas Jefferson said, `We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.' Unfortunately, we have strayed far from Mr. Jefferson's wise advice. 
The Federal Government's uncontrolled spending has built up an enormous national debt that currently stands at $5.3 billion. Apportioned equally, this means that every man, woman and child in this country currently owes almost $20,000. Put another way, if you spent a dollar every second, it would take 150,000 years to spend our current debt. And our debt is still growing by $4,500 per second--about the same amount it would cost to send three people to a community college. 
The economic rewards for balancing the budget should be reason enough to act. Many well respected economists predict that if the budget were balanced, interest rates would drop by about 2 percent. This would mean annual savings of $1,230 on a middle-class family's home mortgage; $216 on an average student loan; and $180 on an average auto loan. In the Federal budget world of billions and trillions, these savings are all too often ignored, but these are real savings that would lead to a better life for America's families. 
Although Congress has talked endlessly about balancing the budget, the budget has not been balanced since 1969. Without a balanced-budget constitutional amendment, I doubt the President or Congress will ever have the political courage to balance the budget. We simply lack the discipline to control our spending habits. We have ignored our responsibility to put our fiscal house in order, choosing instead to leave future generations of Americans with an overwhelming legacy of debt. It is simply immoral to allow this deficit spending to continue. Our duty as elected officials must be to preserve a strong and solvent nation for the next generation. 
Let us show the American people that we take our duties seriously. We must prove we are ready to embrace fiscal responsibility permanently. The moment has finally come for Congress to pass the balanced budget amendment and send it on to the States. Let us begin a national debate, in every State legislature in this country. Americans have waited decades for this opportunity. They have waited long enough.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate, in just a minute, will vote on the nomination of Rodney Slater to serve the Nation as Secretary of Transportation. 
I congratulate Mr. Slater on the honor of being selected by the President for this very important post, and I urge the Senate to confirm his nomination. 
Mr. Slater currently serves as the top official at the Federal Highway Administration and has received much praise on both sides of the aisle and from across the country for his good work in that important capacity. 
On January 29, the Senate Commerce Committee conducted a thorough hearing on the Slater nomination, and, yesterday, the committee voted unanimously to refer his nomination to the full Senate with our approval. 
As part of the committee's examination, we submitted a battery of questions to the nominee regarding his qualifications and fitness to serve as Secretary; about his priorities in serving the transportation needs of our country; and about his plans to ensure that he and the Department effectively serve the public interest in keeping with the highest standards of professional conduct. 
He faithfully responded to our many questions and while members may disagree about some of his policies, the nominee is experienced in the transportation arena; has proven himself to be a dedicated public servant; and has assured the committee that he has not engaged in any activity which would cast doubt on his ability or fitness to serve. 
Mr. Slater, has a very difficult job ahead of him. The Transportation sector affects every facet of our country's economic and social life. The ability of our citizens and the Nation's goods to travel freely, economically and safely, will be directly and deeply influenced by the policies established by the new Secretary. 
Our Nation faces severe challenges in the effort to keep our transportation systems the most modern, efficient, and safest in the world. In particular, upgrading the Nation's highways, railways and aviation infrastructure in an era of necessary budget constraint will be especially difficult and will require vision and leadership. 
Above all, the new Secretary's top priority must be protecting public safety in all modes of transportation. And, he must apply himself to prioritizing national needs and eliminating unjustified programs so that limited resources can flow to the Nation's most pressing requirements according to merit and need. Achieving these lofty goals will take a Secretary who can say no, as well as yes, and who can keep an unflinching eye on the interests of the country rather than on politics. 
Mr. Slater, assured us that he understands the magnitude of the responsibilities awaiting the new Secretary, and is qualified and eager to take them on. Having questioned and examined this nominee, and given his track record of public service, the committee trusts and believes that is so. I urge my colleagues to confirm Rodney Slater, and we look forward to working with him to best serve the transportation needs of our Nation. 
I ask for the yeas and nays on this vote.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be introducing legislation today which will significantly reduce fraud and abuse by providers in the Medicare program. The Medicare Whistleblower Act of 1997 will provide strong incentives for Medicare beneficiaries to identify provider fraud in the Medicare system. 
As I travel around my home State of Arizona, seniors keep telling me about the fraudulent and negligent billings which are rampant throughout the Medicare Program. Over and over again, they tell me about their personal experiences with fraud and overbillings in the Medicare system. Many of the seniors say that their Medicare bills frequently include charges for medical services which they never received, double billings for a specific treatment, or charges which are disproportionate and severely marked up. Usually, most of these seniors have no idea what Medicare is being billed on their behalf and they have no way to obtain a detailed explanation from the Medicare providers. 
These personal stories from senior citizens are confirmed by analyses and detailed studies. According to the General Accounting Office, fraud and abuse in our Nation's health care system costs taxpayers as much as $100 billion each year. Medicare fraud alone costs about $17 billion per year which is about 10 percent of the program's costs. 
This is quite disconcerting, especially in light of the financial problems facing our Medicare system. Currently, the Medicare system is expected to run out of funds in the year 2001. 
A fundamental problem with the Medicare system is that most beneficiaries are not concerned with the costs of the program because the Government is responsible for them. One of my constituents shared with me an experience he had when his provider double-billed Medicare for his treatment and the provider told him not to be concerned about it because, `Medicare is paying the bill.' This is an outrage and we cannot allow this flagrant abuse of taxpayers dollars to continue. Remember, when Medicare overpays, we all overpay, and costs to beneficiaries and the taxpayers spiral while the financial sustainability of the program is violated. 
My bill, the Medicare Whistleblower Act addresses this fundamental problem in the Medicare Program. This legislation strengthens the procedures for detecting and identifying fraud and waste in the Medicare system. This bill provides beneficiaries with incentives for carefully scrutinizing their bills and actively pursuing corrections when they believe there has been an inappropriate or unjustified charge made to the Medicare Program. The beneficiaries would be financially 
rewarded if they detect negligent or fraudulent charges in their Medicare bill. 
I recognize that provider fraud is not the sole source of waste and abuse in the Medicare system, and I wholeheartedly support other initiatives which address beneficiary fraud. However, studies indicate that provider fraud is most prevalent and the greatest concern for the system, making initiatives such as this one which specifically target provider fraud very important. 
The Medicare Whistleblower Act will give beneficiaries the right to request and receive a written itemized copy of their medical bill from their Medicare health care provider. This itemized bill should be provided to the beneficiary within 30 days of the provider's receipt of their request. Once the beneficiary receives the itemized bill they would have 90 days to report any inappropriate billings to Medicare. The Medicare intermediaries and carriers would then have to review the bills and determine whether an inappropriate payment has been made and what amount should be reimbursed to the Medicare system. 
If the Secretary of Health and Human Services confirms that the charges were either negligent or fraudulent, the beneficiary would receive an award equal to 1 percent of the overpayment reimbursed up to $10,000. The financial awards given to the beneficiaries would not increase costs to the Federal Government since they would be paid directly from the overpayment. In cases of fraud, the rewards would be paid directly by the fraudulent provider as a penalty, and would therefore not even reduce the amount of the overpayment reimbursed to the Federal Treasury. 
Several important safeguards have been built into this legislation. First, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to establish appropriate procedures to ensure that the incentive system is not abused by overzealous beneficiaries. Second, an incentive payment would be awarded only to the extent that the Health Care Financing Administration HCFA is able to recover the overpayment from the provider. Finally, there would be no incentive payment if HCFA can demonstrate that it had identified the overpayment prior to receiving the beneficiary's complaint. 
Some may argue that seniors and other beneficiaries should not receive financial rewards for fighting fraud--that it should be their civic responsibility. While I may agree with this contention, I also recognize that these seniors would not be able to detect and report fraud or abuse without having access to the itemized bills that this legislation provides. Besides, I do not see anything wrong with providing beneficiaries with a financial incentive for fighting waste. After all, we currently pay Federal employees for suggestions which result in savings for the taxpayers, and we pay private citizens for identifying fraud by defense contractors. 
It is imperative that we put an end to the rampant abuse and fraud in the Medicare system. This bill would contribute significantly to this effort.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which addresses a very serious problem in the Medicare system--Medicare overpayments. Medicare overpayments are costing the Medicare trust funds billions of dollars each year. 
This bill imposes an administrative fee on providers who submit inaccurate Medicare claims and are overpaid by the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA]. The purpose of the fee is to discourage overpayments and to offset the costs which HCFA incurs while recovering overpayments. 
In addition, this bill requires HCFA to screen claims for accuracy, paying particular attention to procedures and services which have high rates of overbillings and inaccurate billings. 
Under Medicare part A, hospitals and providers are prepaid annually by HCFA for expected Medicare expenditures. Currently, many hospitals grossly overestimate their Medicare funding needs and use the overpayment to subsidize services delivered at their facility which are not Medicare related. This is an abuse which must be stopped. This legislation will impose an administrative fee if a hospital overestimates its Medicare needs by more than 30 percent and does not repay the overpayment to HCFA within 30 days. 
Unlike hospitals, doctors must submit claims for payment to Medicare part B after they provide services to beneficiaries. However, these claims sometimes are submitted for services that were never provided or that are incorrectly coded. The fee which this bill would impose will discourage physicians from submitting false or misleading claims and will help HCFA cover the costs incurred while recovering overpayments to providers. 
Most importantly, prepayment screening will help eliminate overpayments in the first place. The technology for prescreening is available and already used extensively in the private sector. I believe that it is imperative that we start using prescreening to improve Medicare payment accuracy. 
As my colleagues know, the Medicare system is in serious financial condition and will be bankrupt in 2001 if we do not make necessary reforms. We have an obligation to take every possible step to protect the Medicare trust funds and preserve them for current beneficiaries and future generations. 
I recognize that overpayments are not the only financial problem with Medicare, but they are a significant problem within the system. GAO reported that over $4.1 billion was overpaid from the trust funds in 1995. Had this legislation been in place, I believe that we could have prevented a large portion of these overpayments if not prevented we could have at least imposed the administrative fee and recouped a significant amount. 
This bill is not the cure for what ails our Medicare system, but it is a step in the right direction. Overpayments are costly and contribute to the Medicare solvency problem. This legislation will help stop them.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to promote safety and quiet in our national parks. I want to thank Senator Frist for joining me as an original cosponsor of this bill. 
Under this legislation, the Secretary of the Interior would develop recommendations which may include flight-free zones, curfews, and other flight restrictions for aircraft operating over certain national parks. The Federal Aviation Administrator would then develop a plan, based upon these recommendations, to promote quiet and safety in our parks. Under the bill, the entire process would be completed within months after enactment of this legislation. 
To ensure that we take immediate action in those parks experiencing the greatest threats to their natural resources from aircraft noise, this bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to recommend a proposal for prioritizing the implementation of appropriate flight restrictions at certain parks. The bill also requires the Secretary and the Administrator to work together on recommendations that propose methods to encourage the use of quiet aircraft in our parks, unless such proposals are not needed to meet the goals of protecting quiet and promoting safety. 
This bill promotes safety in our national parks by allowing the FAA Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, to set minimum altitudes for overflights in certain parks and to prohibit flights below those minimum altitudes where necessary to meet safety goals. The bill makes safety the paramount concern for the Administrator in developing an overflight plan for a national park. Under the bill, the Administrator may revise the Secretary of the Interior's recommendations to ensure public health and safety goals are met. 
Mr. President, this bill is intended to begin a dialog on how we can best promote safety and quiet in our national parks. I am sure that this legislation can be refined to better meet its essential goals and I am eager to start that process. 
I also want to make clear that I fully appreciate that air tourism provides a legitimate way for visitors to see national parks and also provides an important opportunity for disabled persons to view certain parks. I want to ensure that this legislation provides a balanced and fair approach to solving safety and noise problems in our national parks. 
I believe this bill takes a crucial first step toward restoring and preserving a vital resource within many national parks--natural quiet. The natural ambient sound conditions found in a park, or natural quiet, as it is commonly called, is precisely what many Americans seek to experience when they visit some of our most treasured national parks. Natural quiet is as 
crucial an element of the natural beauty and splendor of certain parks as those resources that we visually observe and appreciate. 
I also believe that this bill provides important safety protections. As the air tour industry in many parks continues to grow, safety concerns also increase. By addressing safety now, before tragic accidents occur, we can assure the public that we have taken every precaution to protect visitors in our parks. 
Ten years ago, legislation I authored to promote safety and provide for the substantial restoration of natural quiet in the Grand Canyon was signed into law. This year, the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] issued a final rule which modifies and expands flight-free zones in the canyon. The final rule is scheduled to go into effect on May 1, 1997. But lawsuits threaten to further delay implementation of additional measures to meet the goals of the 1987 law. 
Moreover, the final rule does not contain incentives for operators to convert to quiet aircraft, although the FAA recognizes that moving to quiet aircraft technology offers the most promising approach to providing for the substantial restoration of natural quiet in the Canyon. Rather, a notice of proposed rulemaking was issued outlining a proposal for mandating conversion to quiet aircraft. This proposed rulemaking must now undergo public comment and agency review of those comments before it becomes final. In the meantime, natural quiet still has not been restored at the Grand Canyon. 
There are many lessons to be learned from our efforts to restore natural quiet in the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon experience teaches us that we cannot afford to wait until natural quiet has been lost before we take steps to protect and preserve that resource. Simply put, we have found that it is very difficult to undo what has already been done. Thus, wherever possible, we must strive to prevent the impairment of natural resources in our national parks. To that end, this bill sets up a process for achieving balanced and fair approach to resolving noise concerns in other national parks before any problems get out of hand in those parks, too. 
In addition, as a result of the Grand Canyon experience, we have learned some very valuable lessons about what we can and must do to ensure safety in the air above our national parks. Providing for public health and safety in our national parks must always be a foremost concern in our minds when developing any park overflight plan. 
Finally, I expect the administration, in exercising its authority under this bill, to meet with interested groups and affected communities, including local chambers of commerce. These groups should be involved in the process before implementing any flight restrictions in order to ensure that proposed actions are appropriate and necessary and that all important issues have been thoroughly considered and addressed. 
Again, Mr. President, this bill is intended to begin an open dialog on how we can best achieve our safety and natural quiet goals. Many parks throughout America are now being threatened by the same kind of air pollution problems and noise pollution problems that we had over the Grand Canyon. I believe we can begin to work on ways in which we can protect and preserve one of the most precious natural resources within many of our national parks--natural quiet. At the same time, the bill seeks to ensure that public health and safety is not compromised as a result of increasing park overflights. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to reach an important balance and preserve our natural heritage while we provide for the safe and continued enjoyment of our parks.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Law Enforcement and Public Safety Telecommunications Empowerment Act. This legislation addresses a longstanding need by police, fire departments, and emergency medical services for more channels of radio communication and for more state-of-the-art technology to use in their efforts to safeguard life and property. 
Mr. President, the telecommunications needs of the public safety community have been a subject of widespread concern for many years. In many instances, channel capacity for safety-of-life communications is dangerously low. In many others, budgetary constraints have kept law enforcement and other public safety officials from getting new communications equipment and services that would make their transmissions more efficient and reliable. 
Most recently, a Federal advisory committee documented these needs for more spectrum. There are clearly ways this can be done. But spectrum is a limited, and therefore very valuable, resource, and big businesses that would compete for this same spectrum must not be allowed to divert it for commercial use. Further, this bill creates specific mechanisms that will continue over the years to assure that money and equipment are available for the continuing need of those whose job is to safeguard our lives, our health, and our property. 
Let me outline the provisions of this bill. First, the bill orders the FCC to give public safety radio users four new radio channels. These new channels are currently allocated to television use and are located between TV channels 60 and 69. Ongoing plans to convert television broadcasting to more spectrum-efficient digital transmission technology is expected to make this channel reallocation possible without significant impact on the television service people receive. 
Next, this legislation provides that the rest of the available spectrum between TV channels 60 and 69 will be auctioned to the highest bidder for commercial use. Of the money raised, 10 percent, or a sum of not less than $200,000,000 or more than $750,000,000, is earmarked for distribution to the Governors of each of the States for use in purchasing services and equipment that would increase the ability of public safety radio users to communicate quickly and easily in times of emergency. 
Third, to make sure that the four new public safety radio channels are used in as efficient a manner as possible and to provide added public safety communications resources tailored to their specific needs, this legislation gives the Governors the authority to lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of any extra channel capacity they may have. This will enable them to procure new technology or services that will further improve the effectiveness of public safety communications. The remainder of the money raised at auction would be used for deficit reduction. 
Mr. President, in closing, this is a fair bill. The spectrum is owned by the public and the public should benefit from its use. This plan benefits the public in two ways: It helps protect the public by augmenting police and fire services, and it helps pay down the deficit.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Biennial Appropriations and Budget Act--A bill introduced today by Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation. 
Under a biennial budget, the President would submit a 2-year budget in the first session of a Congress. The priority in the first session of the Congress would be completion of the biennial budget resolution and biennial appropriations bills. The second session would be reserved for authorization legislation and enhanced oversight. The planning and performance requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 would be incorporated into the budgeting process as well. 
I have long advocated changing our budget process in this manner. As a matter of fact in 1993, I introduced similar legislation. Changing our budget process would give Congress more time to develop and implement long-term budget plans. In addition, the 2-year cycle would allow more time for oversight and thorough evaluation of programs and spending. 
Our current process is simply not working. Only three times in the past 20 years has Congress passed the budget resolution on time, and this is only the first step in congressional action on the budget. Only twice since 1950, has Congress met the fiscal year deadline for completion of all 13 individual appropriations bills. Most of the time Congress is rushing to pass appropriations bills, continuing resolutions, or omnibus spending bills at the last minute, trying to avoid a Government shutdown. This is not how we should be managing the power of the purse. 
This idea is not new. President Clinton's former Chief of Staff and OMB Director, Leon Panetta, introduced the first biennial budget bill in 1977 when he was a Congressman. Vice President Gore strongly endorsed this idea in his National Performance Review. In his book, `Creating a Government that Works Better and Costs Less,' Gore states, `Biennial budgeting will not make our budget decisions easier, for they are shaped by competing interests and priorities. But it will eliminate an enormous amount of busy work that keeps us from evaluating programs and meeting customer needs.' 
Congress' failure to meet our prescribed deadlines, in current budget process, contributes to the American people's cynicism about politics. The time has come to recognize that our current budget process is broken and we must find a way to fix it. Biennial budgeting is an important first step toward fixing our current system by making our budget process more efficient and streamlined. I hope that Congress will act on this important legislation expeditiously.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, soon the Senate will vote on the nomination of William Daley to be Secretary of the Department of Commerce. Yesterday, the Commerce Committee reported favorably Mr. Daley's nomination by a vote of 19 to 1. I hope the full Senate will also vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Daley. 
The confirmation of nominees by the Senate is a duty prescribed by the Constitution. The advise-and-consent obligation given to the Senate in the Constitution is an extremely important task. It should not and must not be taken lightly. At the same time, I believe that it is the President's prerogative to appoint whomever he chooses to administration positions and that such nominees should only be opposed and defeated if there is clear and compelling evidence that such nominee is unfit or unable to serve the Nation. Such decision should be made only after exhaustive questioning of the nominee and much soul searching. 
Mr. William Daley has been asked by the President to serve this Nation as Secretary of the Department of Commerce. Three major lines of questioning were asked by the committee: 
What are Mr. Daley's qualifications to serve as Secretary? What are Mr. Daley's plans for the Department? And what are Mr. Daley's policies that would implement those plans? 
Numerous questions regarding the Commerce Department have been asked of the nominee. He has either fully answered the questions or has committed to providing the committee an answer in a timely fashion. 
Mr. President, I am particularly pleased to announce that the Department will cut 100 political appointees from its ranks. The Department has a staggering 256 political appointment positions available. Mr. Daley pledged to reduce that number by 100. He should be strongly commended for this action. 
Additionally, at his confirmation hearing, Mr. Daley announced that all foreign trade missions would be halted until the Department, in consultation with the Congress, develops a set of criteria designed to ensure such missions are not politicized. 
We have all read the press reports alleging that political quid pro quos were a part of such trade missions. Promoting U.S. products abroad and opening foreign markets to U.S. business, not electoral politics, should be the only purpose of such missions. 
Again, I am very pleased that Mr. Daley has agreed to work with the committee to ensure that the occurrences of the past do not happen again. I am very pleased that Mr. Daley has agreed to refrain from preferential politics. Discretionary money appropriated to the Department of Commerce should be allocated based on a set of standards and fair criteria that do not give special treatment to any specific locality or region. 
Mr. Daley's commitment in this area is commendable. Mr. Daley has also pledged to act expeditiously on any requests for information for files if asked for by any congressional committee. 
Mr. President, I think it is appropriate for me to say that we all know that there are serious allegations concerning individuals who were part of the Department of Commerce. Mr. Daley is aware of those allegations. He is fully aware and appreciative of the obligation that he has to refurbish the image of that Department because of the activities of some. I am very confident that he is committed to doing so and will be able to do so. He is an experienced, talented individual who I believe is very capable of carrying out that daunting task. 
Last, Mr. Daley promised to recuse himself from any issue that would present a conflict of interest and to work to restore the integrity of the Commerce Department. Such a task will certainly not be easy, but I believe it can and must be done. 
For the record, Mr. President, some press reports have raised questions regarding Mr. Daley's past business and political activities. Such reports infer that Mr. Daley or his family may have benefited either personally or politically in certain circumstances. Those press reports have been made part of the permanent committee record. All such allegations were raised with the nominee and found to either lack credibility, be proven false, or were fully explained to the satisfaction of the committee. 
Let me reiterate that point. Based on the evidence presented by all concerned to the committee, the nominee has engaged in no activity that would cause this Member to vote against him. In fact, the nominee has taken great steps to rebut all allegations and explain the facts surrounding them. After such explanations were forthcoming by the nominee, the committee moved expeditiously to approve this nomination. 
In closing, the Commerce Committee has looked into Mr. Daley's qualifications and his fitness to serve, and we believe he is a fine individual who will make an outstanding Commerce Secretary. Mr. Daley has a tough road ahead of him. But I am confident he is up to the task. He has already begun to demonstrate the leadership necessary to move the Department into the next century. 
I look forward--and I know I speak for all Members on my side of the aisle--to working with the new Secretary and wish him and his family the very best during their time here in Washington. Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate to confirm this nomination. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is the wish of the majority leader that we not vote until 10 o'clock. I do not have a lot of additional comments to make about the nominee that I did not already make. 
I appreciate the overall broad bipartisan support that has been given this nominee. I think he appreciates it as well. Because of the importance of working on these issues on a nonpartisan basis, the issue that Senator Durbin and Senator Hollings raise about trade are accurate. 
I point out to my colleagues, yes, the Department of Commerce and Secretary of Commerce has a very important role to play in the conduct of trade and fostering relations and helping U.S. businesses compete abroad, and I also appreciate the Senator from Illinois' comments about the new kind of war we are in. But the problem has been, I point out, that there has been a lack of coordination and coherence to the conduct of these policies, where on the one hand we send our human rights secretary from the State Department, who bashes this particular country, in this one case, China, on human rights violations; and then our Secretary of Defense goes over, a very close and warm relationship with their military establishment--who, also, by the way, run many of these companies and corporations in China; and then our Commerce Secretary goes over and has an entirely different environment. 
I think the President of the United States understands better, but not completely, the absolute requirement that if we are going to have a coherent foreign policy, which is probably the most important, single, fundamental conduct of foreign and trade policy, then we all have to have a coordinated effort, led by the President of the United States. Yes, human rights plays an important role in our relations with foreign countries; yes, in the furtherance of the United States' national security interests; yes, providing access and an equal playing field for U.S. companies and corporations to compete, especially in emerging nation markets, is important, but there cannot be discordant voices and disjointed messages to these people, otherwise they become confused and sometimes enraged, because you cannot tell the rulers of China, `By the way, I have no relationship whatever.' 
On one occasion they were told by our State Department that the President of Taiwan would not visit the United States of America. Two weeks later it was announced that the President of Taiwan was being given a visa to visit the United States of America. 
Now, I could argue both sides of that position, but I cannot argue for that methodology. There is no excuse for that kind of methodology. You either say and make sure that the President of Taiwan visits the United States or you say that he will not--one of the two. But especially when we are talking about the power shift that is going on right now, a transition, with the leader who has taken longer to die than the Ayatollah Khomeini, and emerging, if not aggressive, certainly assertive behavior in the region, trade has an important role. But it has got to be part of an overall foreign policy. That has been and will be my major criticism of this administration's conduct of foreign policy. 
I am pleased to say from my conversations with Secretary Daley that he understands that. He understands how important it is to coordinate his efforts with those of the President, the Secretary of State, the National Security Adviser and others so we can shape a far more effective foreign policy, which at the end of the day will help us immeasurably in our efforts in 
increasing trade than some of the kinds of modus operandi we have seen in the past. I am convinced our nominee has that understanding and that commitment. 
I was interested and appreciated my dear friend's, Senator Hollings, comments about Mr. Daley's efforts on behalf of NAFTA. I do believe that Mr. Daley did a very effective and important job in that effort. I know that both my colleagues here on the floor were aware of his effort at that particular point, showing his ability to work with the Congress of the United States on both sides of the aisle. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help protect the valuable resources of the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress Protection Act will help the Library of Congress stop abuses of its free book loan program by authorizing the Library to impose fines for books that are long overdue. 
I am introducing this legislation to empower Library of Congress officials to crack down on individuals who seriously abuse their Library privileges, by keeping books too long or failing to return them. Library of Congress officials should not have to tolerate the fact that many individuals are apparently unconcerned about returning the books that taxpayers provide for them. Congress should not prevent the Library from instituting strengthened policies to hold severely delinquent borrowers responsible for their tardiness. 
This legislation will enable the Library of Congress to implement a reasonable overdue book charge policy similar to those of most public libraries across America. By doing so, the many Members of Congress, congressional staffers, and executive branch employees who benefit from this magnificent institution will have an added incentive to comply with the generous loan policies of the Library of Congress. 
This proposal is very basic, but it will afford Library officials the leverage and flexibility they need to address this problem. This bill will help Library of Congress officials keep better track of their resources, and will spur many delinquent borrowers to return the books that taxpayers provide for them completely free of charge. 
The Library of Congress Book Protection Act would direct the Library to implement an overdue book charge policy for books improperly held over 70 days. These individuals or offices will have their privileges suspended until their fines are paid in full. Library of Congress officials will, however, be able to waive such penalties when appropriate. The Library would also be authorized to retain the funds received from late book fines, as well. Finally, the offices of severely delinquent borrowers and the fines they owe will be published in the annual report submitted by the Library to its oversight committees. 
While figures for the 104th Congress have not been published yet, preliminary data shows that as of December 28, 1996, over 2,200 books were over 30 days overdue. Figures published by the Library during the 103d Congress showed that out of the 20,000 books that were out on loan, over one-third were listed as overdue. One half of the 4,200 books on loan to congressional staff and the media were listed as overdue, and 1 in 5 books out on loan to Members, committees, and congressional support agencies had been overdue for more than 2 months. Library of Congress officials state that over 300,000 books are missing from their collections dating back to 1978, and the estimated cost of these thefts is $12 million. 
I am concerned about the fact that it is all too easy for individuals to disregard their responsibility to return books to the Library of Congress in a timely manner. This negligence is not only unfair to the other users of the Library, but it also drains the Library's resources in chasing down overdue or missing books. 
In addition to Members of Congress and congressional staff, the Library of Congress also makes loans to executive branch departments and agencies, the judiciary and diplomatic corps, the press, and other institutions. As I have mentioned, Mr. President, the Library of Congress is barred from charging late fees for overdue books in contrast to virtually every other publicly funded library in America. Furthermore, the Library cannot retain any funds that might be collected due to the loss or damage of loaned books. It's clearly time to change these unwise restrictions and strengthen the Library's ability to protect its resources, and I hope Members of the Senate will support this legislation to do so. 
Surely, it's not asking too much of the individuals and offices fortunate enough to use the Library of Congress to do so in a responsible manner. Even under the new borrowing guidelines that would be instituted by this legislation, there really is no reason for any well-intentioned borrower ever to have to pay late fines or have their privileges suspended. I'm optimistic that the mere specter of having to pay overdue book fines will coax delinquent borrowers into responsibility renewing their book loans or returning the books. 
I hope that the Senate will adopt this legislation to implement prudent new guidelines in the book loan policies of the Library of Congress.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American Family-Owned Business Act--a bill that will preserve the American family businesses and save jobs across the country. This bill cuts estate tax rates in half and also creates a new exclusion that completely eliminates the estate tax for small businesses. Under the new exclusion, family-owned businesses can exempt up to $1.5 million of family business assets from their estate. If a family business is valued at more than $1.5 million, the excess is taxed at one-half of the current rates--thus providing a maximum tax rate of 27.5 percent. 
This legislation was introduced in the last Congress by my good friend, the former majority leader, Bob Dole. Although this legislation was included in S. 2, The Family Tax Relief Act, I feel so strongly about the need for estate tax relief for family-owned businesses and farmers that I felt it was necessary to introduce this legislation on its own. 
The current Federal estate tax is just too burdensome on the American family. Time and time again, farmers and other business owners across the country have told me that estate tax rates are just too high. They rise quickly from 18 to 55 percent, effectively making the Government a 50-50 partner in a family business. 
Even the most sophisticated estate tax planning and the purchase of life insurance cannot sufficiently mitigate the effects of these high rates, leaving families no recourse but to sell their businesses to pay the estate tax. This bill will stop these forced sales from happening again. 
I agree with many who say that estate tax rates should be reduced across the board, or repealed entirely. I applaud my colleague, Senator Kyl, who is leading the effort to repeal the estate tax. And I hope that we do that some day. But given our current budget crisis, we will likely have to take an incremental approach on the estate tax. This legislation takes an important step in that direction. 
This legislation will protect and preserve family enterprises. We know too well the adverse impact of an estate tax-forced sale. The family loses its livelihood, the family business employees lose their jobs, and the community suffers. 
We must do all that we can to help family-owned businesses not only survive, but also prosper. They are the job creators in this country. In the 1980's alone, family businesses accounted for an increase of more than 20 million private-sector jobs. 
By relieving families of the burden of the estate tax and letting them keep their businesses, they can continue to prosper. And when families continue to operate their businesses, we all benefit--the business' employees keep their jobs, the government receives income taxes on business profits, and the families retain their livelihood. 
The bill requires heirs to participate in the family business. These participation rules are deliberately flexible and recognize that different family businesses need differing levels of participation by heirs. 
The estate tax is not a Democratic or a Republican problem, or one that affects only rural or urban families. There are farmers, ranchers, or other family businesses in each State that would benefit from this legislation. 
This bill provides the critical relief needed for American families' businesses. I urge my colleagues to support this effort, and I hope that Congress will act expeditiously on this important legislation.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I introduce legislation entitled the `Tax Fairness and Accountability Act of 1997.' This legislation requires a supermajority vote in the Senate in order to raise taxes and eliminates the 60-vote Congressional Budget Act point of order against reducing taxes. A supermajority vote requirement is the strongest possible defense for this body's spending excesses. By requiring 60 votes in the Senate to approve a tax increase rather than a simple majority, we will ensure that Congress does not balance the budget on the backs of taxpayers. 
Although our national debt currently stands at over $5.3 trillion, Congress' insatiable appetite for spending has not diminished. Our inability to reach a balanced budget for the past 28 years is not due to undertaxation but rather over spending. It is time that we place limits on the ability of government to casually dip into the pockets of an already overtaxed citizenry. 
According to the Tax Foundation, Americans spend more on their tax bill than food, shelter and clothing combined. This is simply outrageous. The American people cannot afford to be taxed anymore. Arizonans, for example, had to work until almost the beginning of May to pay their tax bill. Today nearly 40 percent of the American family's paycheck goes toward some kind of tax. 
There have been numerous studies that show when Congress increases taxes it increases spending by a greater amount. One study by the Joint Economic Committee, showed that for every dollar that was raised in taxes, Congress spent $1.16. Thus, the deficit reduction claimed by those who support raising taxes is lost. The 1990 budget debacle is the best example of Congress' chronic disease called tax and spend. Under the 1990 budget deal Congress was supposed to cut spending but of course it never did. The tough spending caps that were put in place under this agreement, were raised by Congress in order to satisfy their insatiable appetite for spending. We must do everything in our power to find a remedy for this disease. The supermajority vote requirement is the first dose of the medicine. 
This legislation is so important because politicians have forgotten whose money they are spending in Washington. Americans work very hard for the money they earn and send to Washington. Again and again studies show that people are working harder for less and are spending more time at work. In many families one or both parents must work two and three jobs just to make ends meet, leaving less and less time for family. Congress needs to take heed of these facts and recognize that families all across America are being forced to tighten their belts as the tax man continues to take an evergrowing portion of their money. Balancing the budget should require Congress to tighten their belt by reducing spending, not by asking Americans to pay more. I hope the Senate will act quickly on this important legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, cosponsored by Senators Hollings and Ford, to reinstate the aviation excise taxes until September 29, 1997. 
On December 31, 1996, the aviation excise taxes expired. The aviation excise taxes include a 10-percent passenger ticket tax, a 6.25-percent freight waybill tax, a $6 per person international departure tax, and fuel taxes imposed upon general aviation aircraft. These taxes were the principal source of revenues for the airport and airway trust fund, which funds most of the budget of the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] and all of the FAA capital programs. 
Recent estimates by the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the FAA indicate that, unless the excise taxes are reinstated, the trust fund will be out of available moneys by March or April of this year. The FAA will have to terminate spending on its capital programs--the safety and security enhancements that we have worked so hard to institute. 
It is unconscionable to allow the FAA to go without money that is absolutely essential to fund the safety and security programs of the national air transportation system. 
The current estimates of when the trust fund will be out of available money--which I just learned today--are much more dire than originally anticipated. There are several reasons for the unexpected worsening of the FAA's fiscal situation. 
The Treasury Department may have mistakenly credited the trust fund with $1.5 billion. Under normal circumstances, there is a gap in the time between the collection of taxes on airline tickets and the payment of those taxes into the Treasury by the airlines. In addition, those taxes are first paid into the general fund before being credited to the trust fund. When the aviation excise tax expired, so did the authority to transfer the revenues from the general fund to the trust fund. 
The result of this process is that billions in tax revenues from 1996 are not paid to Treasury until 1997. Because those revenues cannot be transferred out of the general fund, the trust fund may have far less money than originally estimated. The trust fund could be out of available money by March, with curtailment of spending beginning even before that time because of the stringent provisions of the Anti-Deficiency Act. 
On one particular point, I want to be very clear--the taxes should not be extended for more than a few months. We have a process in place to explore alternative long-term funding mechanisms to ensure the fiscal viability of the FAA and its important safety and security missions. Until the results of those studies are available and alternative mechanisms are in place, we must ensure that adequate funding is provided for these programs. 
These taxes were allowed to expire at the end of last December so that reinstatement of the taxes would count for new revenues which can be used to offset tax cuts or spending in other parts of the Federal budget. Playing budget games with these excise taxes is simply deplorable. The excise taxes paid by the users of the national air transportation system must be dedicated to that system. 
Mr. President, if the situation was dangerous before, it has now reached a very critical point. We must not delay any longer. Therefore, I am introducing this bill to take immediate action to begin the process of reinstating the aviation excise taxes until September 29, 1997. I will work closely with Senators Lott and Daschle to ensure early Senate action on this vitally important measure, so that the safety of our airline transportation system is not adversely affected.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that repeals the increase in tax on Social Security benefits. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the taxable proportion of Social Security benefits from 50 to 85 percent for Social Security recipients whose threshold incomes exceed $34,000--(single)--and $44,000--(couples). The legislation I am introducing today simply phases out this increase gradually over a 4-year period. In 1997, the applicable percentage would be 75 percent; in 1998, 65 percent; in 1999, 60 percent; in 2000, 55 percent; and finally in 2001, the taxable percentage would return to 50 percent. 
I believe the increase in the taxable portion of Social Security benefits was blatantly unfair because it changed the rules in the middle of the game. Responsible senior citizens who had carefully planned for their retirement were penalized and saw their income fall while their marginal tax rate skyrocketed. Nearly 9,000 seniors representing 23.4 percent of recipients are affected by this provision. These Seniors relied on, and based their decisions on, the old law, and they have no recourse to go back in time to change their decisions based on the new law. 
Clearly, we should be encouraging all Americans to save and invest for the future. We can no longer expect that Social Security benefits will take care of all our retirement needs. If Congress continues to change the rules after plans and investment decisions have been made, we will diminish the incentive for Americans to prepare for the future and plan accordingly. 
I am consistently amazed by the perverse disincentives Congress enacts. Aside from being patently unfair, taxing 85 percent of Social Security benefits above the current income levels creates a tremendous disincentive for affected seniors to work. It simply doesn't make sense to work if every dollar you earn over the threshold drastically reduces your Social Security benefits. 
I am pleased that this legislation is supported by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and the Seniors Coalition. I ask unanimous consent to submit their letters of endorsement into the Record. 
The problems with this additional tax on Social Security benefits are strikingly similar to the Social Security earnings limit. I am pleased that Congress finally enacted an increase in the earnings limit last year and I hope that we will act expeditiously on this legislation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today Senators Stevens, Hutchison, Abraham, Ashcroft, and I are introducing the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. This bill creates a statutory continuing resolution [CR]--a safety net CR which would trigger only if the appropriations acts do not become law or if there is no governing CR in place. This legislation ensures that the Government will not shutdown and that Government shutdowns cannot be used for political gains. 
This safety net CR would set spending at the lowest of the following spending levels: 
First, the previous year's appropriated levels; 
Second, the House-passed appropriations bill; 
Third, the Senate-passed appropriations bill; 
Fourth, the President's budget request; or 
Fifth, any levels established by an independent CR passed by the Congress subsequent to the passage of this act. 
By setting the spending level for the safety net CR at the lowest possible level, there is new incentive to actually pass the appropriations bills on time. In addition, it restores the bias in appropriations negotiations toward saving the taxpayers money instead of spending it. We cannot afford another replay of last year's successful effort by the administration that forced Congress to spend billions more just to avoid a third Government shutdown. Passage of this legislation will guarantee that we are not faced with a choice between a Government shutdown and spending taxpayer dollars irresponsibly. 
We all saw the effects of gridlock last year. No one wins when the Government shuts down. Shutdowns only confirm the American people's suspicions that we are more interested in political gain than doing the Nation's business. The American people are tired of gridlock. They want the Government to work for them--not against them. 
The budget process in the last Congress was a fiasco. Our Founding Fathers would have been ashamed by our inability to execute the power of the purse in a responsible fashion. I am sure they would have been quite shocked by the 27 days the Government was shut down, 13 continuing resolutions and almost $6 billion in blackmail money given to the administration to ensure that the Government did not shut down a third time. 
Although Republicans shouldered the blame for the Government shutdown, President Clinton and his Democrat colleagues were equally at fault for using it for their political gain. Republicans were outfoxed by President Clinton because we were not prepared for him to use the budget process for his own political gains. We thought that by doing the right thing--passing the first balanced budget in a generation and fiscally sound appropriations bills--we would eventually prevail. What we did not realize was that President Clinton was more interested in playing politics with the budget than actually balancing it. This year, we have to be prepared for these games and launch a preemptive strike to ensure that basic Government operations will not be put at risk during the next budget battle. 
This legislation does not erode the power of the appropriators and gives them ample opportunity to do their job. It is only if the appropriations process is not completed by the beginning of the fiscal year, as was the case in the last Congress that this safety net CR will go into effect. In addition, I want to emphasize that entitlements are fully protected in the legislation. The bill specifically states that entitlements such as Social Security--as obligated by law--will be paid regardless of what appropriations bills are passed. 
Mr. President, according to President Clinton the combined cost of last year's Government shutdowns was $1.5 billion. However, this figure does not begin to account for the millions of dollars that were lost by small businesses who depend on the Government being open. In my State of Arizona, during the Government shutdown the Grand Canyon was closed for the first time in 76 years. I heard from people who work close to the Grand Canyon. These were not Government employees. They were independent small businessmen and women. They told me that the shutdown cost them thousands of dollars because people couldn't go to the park. According to a CRS report, local communities near national parks lost an estimated $14.2 million per day in tourism revenues as a direct result of the Government shutdown--for a total of nearly $400 million over the course of the shutdown. 
The cost of the Government shutdown cannot be measured in just dollars and cents. During the shutdown millions of Americans could not get crucial social services. For example: 10,000 new Medicare applications, 212,000 Social Security card requests, 360,000 individual office visits, and 800,000 toll-free calls for information and assistance were turned away each day. There were even more delays in services for some of the most vulnerable in our society including 13 million recipients of AFDC, 273,000 foster care children, over 100,000 children receiving adoption assistance services and over 100,000 Head Start children. Not to mention the new patients that were not accepted into clinical research centers, the 7 million visitors who could not attend national parks or the 2 million visitors turned away at museums and monuments. And the list could go on and on. 
In addition our Federal employees were left in fear wondering whether they would be paid, would they have to go to work or would they be able to pay their bills on time. In my State of Arizona for example, of the 40,383 Federal employees over 15,000 of them were furloughed in the last Government shutdown. I do not want to put these workers at risk ever again. 
A 1991 GAP report confirmed that permanent funding lapse legislation as necessary. In their report they stated, `shutting down the Government during temporary funding gaps is an inappropriate way to encourage compromise on the budget.' 
Mr. President, neither party can afford another break of faith with the American people. Our constituents are tired of constantly being disappointed by the actions of Congress and the President. They are tired of us not being prepared for what appears to be the inevitable. This is why this legislation is so important. We want the American people to know that there are some of us in Congress who are thinking ahead and who do not want a replay of the last Congress. 
I want to especially note the support of my good friend Senator Stevens, the distinguished Senator from Alaska and chairman of the Appropriations Committee. His support of this bill is crucial and I thank him for it. I wish him well in overseeing the appropriations process. While I am sure we will have our differences, I am confident that he will do his best to ensure that the Senate enacts the appropriations bills in an efficient and expeditious manner. 
Let us show the American people that we learned our lessons from the last Congress. Passing this preventive measure will go a long way to restore American's faith that politics or stalled negotiations will not stop government operations. It will prove to our constituents that we will never again allow a Government shutdown, or the threat of a Government shutdown, to be used for political gain. I hope the Senate will act quickly on this important matter.

 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to establish an independent, nonpartisan Commission to eliminate corporate pork from the Federal budget. 
The nine-member Commission, called the Corporate Subsidy Reform Commission, would be charged with reviewing all Federal subsidies to private industry, including special interest tax provisions. The Commission would identify those programs which are unnecessary, unfair, or not in the clear and compelling public interest, and recommend them to Congress for reform or termination. Congress would then be required to consider and vote on a comprehensive corporate subsidy reform package under expedited floor procedures. 
Mr. President, our Nation cannot continue to bear the financial burden of servicing an ever-growing $5.3 trillion national debt--which equates to more than $19,000 in debt for every man, woman, and child in the country. We are asking millions of Americans--from families who receive food stamps to our men and women in uniform--to sacrifice in order to rein in our annual budget deficits and begin to pay down that debt. 
As a matter of simple fairness, we have an obligation to ensure that corporate interests share the burden of deficit reduction. Last year, the CATO Institute and the Progressive Policy Institute identified 125 Federal programs that subsidize industry to the tune of $85 billion every year, and the Progressive Policy Institute found an additional $30 billion in tax loopholes for powerful industries. 
The American public cannot understand why we continue to pay these huge subsidies to corporate interests, at a time when we are asking average private citizens to tighten their belts. Corporate pork cannot be justified in an environment where our highest fiscal priority is balancing the Federal budget. 
Let me say very frankly that I do not generally like the idea of commissions. It is a sad commentary on the state of politics today that the Congress cannot even cut those programs that are obviously wasteful, unnecessary, or unfair. Unfortunately, however, Members of Congress have demonstrated time and again their unwillingness to cut programs that serve their own interests. 
For many years, I have tried to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending from the annual appropriations bills--with only limited success, I must admit. A little over a year ago, I offered an amendment to eliminate 12 particularly egregious corporate pork barrel programs, and I garnered only 25 votes in the Senate. 
Clearly, Members will not gore their own ox, unless others are forced to do the same. The recently ordered military base closures were finally accomplished only through the workings of an independent commission established by Congress. It appears we have reached a point that, unless congress is forced to act to eliminate programs, it will not. Perhaps independent commissions are the only fair way to ensure that neither side is given an advantage to protect their special interest corporate pork. 
The independent commission and expedited congressional review process established by this legislation would depoliticize the process and guarantee that the pain is shared. In reality, the corporate pork commission is probably the only means of achieving the meaningful reform that the public and our dire fiscal circumstances demand. 
Mr. President, corporate pork wastes resources, increases the deficit, and distorts markets. Corporate pork has no place either in a free-market economy or in a budget where we are asking millions of Americans to sacrifice for the good of future generations.

 Mr. McCain. Mr. President, when a good man dies, heaven profits at humanity's expense. My friend, Burt Barr, was a good man whose loss we can scarce afford lest our society further succumbs to the cynicism and distrust that cheapens our times. He was a man whose virtues were so exemplary and so apparent that he won the admiration and affection of all he encountered. He was the kind of man whom fathers hope their sons will become. 
He grew to manhood in a time when Americans believed to sacrifice for your country was an ennobling experience. He took up arms in his country's defense, risked death and grave harm, endured enormous deprivation for a cause he knew was greater than his own life. He marched across Europe to liberate the peoples of that continent from tyranny; to protect America's freedoms, and to keep alive in this world the prospect that our freedoms and prosperity might someday flourish in all societies. 
Burt's service in the Second World War, as it was for most of his generation, was the defining event of his life. The experience of shared hardship, of complete faith in and devotion to the men who fought beside you engendered in him an enduring love and respect for the men and women who have worn the uniform of the United States. But his experiences in war affected more than his regard for the military. They inspired in him an abiding love for and desire to remain of service to his country, and to distinguish his public service with an unflagging belief that we are all part of a cause more noble than self-interest, and that, as such, we deserve each other's respect and admiration. 
No one who worked with Burt Barr ever suspected his purposes or doubted his decency. Republican and Democrat alike knew that in Burt the State of Arizona had found a model public servant whose sole public ambition was to work with any willing partner to help Arizona grow and prosper. 
As is obvious by the presence here of so many Arizonans of different political affiliations, Burt was a man who kept his priorities straight. He never set the price of partisan advantage so high that it cheapened his regard for personal friendships. He knew by instinct, by instruction and by experience that political success is such an inconsequential thing when weighed against the love and trust of your neighbors and friends. When our days begin to run out there will be little solace found in the prideful recollection that we advanced our professional ambitions at the expense of others. That solace abides only in our family's love, God's grace, and the satisfaction of a life well-lived in the service of others, and not to the detriment of anyone. 
As Bruce Babbitt and Art Hamilton can attest, as anyone who worked with Burt in the service of our beautiful State can attest, Burt won his share of political contests, but never at the cost of a friend. He presided as majority leader in the Arizona House for many years, and worked with many Governors. He did not exult in the perquisites of power, but only in the opportunity to be of use to his community. Under his patient, inclusive leadership, the legislature never functioned more smoothly or productively. He considered Bruce and Art and everyone who labored with him on behalf of Arizona to be comrades-in-arms, not enemies. War had taught him that such relationships were to be cherished as indispensable to a good life. 
Burt's good life, his decency to others was of inestimable value to Arizona. Together with former Governor Babbitt, with Art, with all his Republican and Democratic colleagues, Burt helped to make this State the wonderful place to live it remains today. Arizona's extraordinary growth was not just coincident with, but was, in large part, a consequence of his public service, and the comity and trust that distinguished his relationships with his colleagues. 
Burt was the first person whose advice I sought when I first considered a political career. I placed a high value on his counsel then and in all the following years of our friendship. That I continue my public career in a time of growing incivility and cynicism, in a time when partisan opponents seek to criminalize our political differences is a source of deep disappointment to me, as I'm sure it was to Burt, although he was always too kind to say so. 
I am part of a system that has grown too coarse and venal, and I bear my share of responsibility for that decline. The memory of Burt Barr shames me, as it should shame all of us when we reduce public service to anything other than a noble calling to make our times a moment of hope and opportunity, of decency and unity. All the blessings of his friendship, all the wisdom of his counsel--though I cherish them greatly--will not make of me as good a man as Burt Barr. Only the shame that his memory will visit on me when I stray from his example gives me hope that when my days are near an end, I might know--as Burt knew--the great solace of a life well-lived in the service of something greater than self-interest. 
Life will be less pleasant absent the company of this good man. His cheerful nature, his enormous generosity to me, his patience and kindness as he tried to help me become the kind of public servant that not just he, but that I could be proud of, make his loss indescribably profound. But he goes to a reward he so surely deserves, and we cannot begrudge him that. 
He will rest now in the field where America buries her heroes. He well-earned his place there, and the place in God's presence we are all promised should we love our fellow man as well as Burt Barr loved us. 
Louise, Stephanie, Michael, and Suzanne, there are no words to dull the pain of a loss felt so keenly as you feel that loss of Burt. But I know he wanted for you all the happiness that life affords. He would want you now to live happy and fulfilling lives until the time when by the grace of a loving God you will see him again.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the resolution that is before the Senate. 
This resolution directs the Senate legal counsel to appear in the name of the Senate to defend the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, Public Law No. 104-130, 110 Stat. 1200 (1996). While both the Line Item Veto Act and the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 provide authority for the Senate to intervene or appear as amicus curiae in legal proceedings, the adoption of a resolution by the Senate is necessary in order to activate participation by legal counsel. By adopting this resolution, we will ensure that the Senate is fully represented in the case of Sen. Robert C. Byrd, et al. versus Franklin D. Raines, et al., which is pending in the U.S. District Court. 
The case that has been filed by Senator Byrd, former Senator Hatfield, Senator Levin, Senator Moynihan, Representative Skaggs, and Representative Waxman challenges the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act on the grounds that it violates article I of the Constitution. I firmly believe that their assertion is false and that the Line Item Veto Act which was passed last year by an overwhelming vote of 69 to 31 is constitutional. 
The act passed last year was very carefully drafted to ensure constitutionality. While I would not presume to tell the court how they should rule on this case, I am confident that the Senate legal counsel will present a very compelling argument that proves that Congress does have the authority to delegate this very limited and strictly defined power to the President. 
Our $5 trillion debt, our voracity for spending and our lack of political courage to cut spending led Congress to pass the Line Item Veto Act. Finally, Members of Congress will be forced to defend their pork barrel spending projects publicly. I am hopeful, although not convinced, that the mere threat of a Presidential veto will cause Members of Congress to rethink putting special interest items in appropriations bills like aquaculture centers to study shrimp in landlocked Arizona, bicycle paths, and millions of dollars for pony trekking facilities in Ireland. The time has come to force Congress and the President to take responsibility for how we are spending taxpayers' dollars. 
The purpose of the line-item veto is to reduce the deficit by allowing the President to cancel wasteful Congressional spending. Prior to passage of this important Government reform tool, it was easy for Members to slip projects into large appropriations bills or tax bills and not have to be accountable for wasting taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. When these large 
bills came to the President, often on a deadline, his hands were tied, leaving him with a take-it-or-leave-it decision on the entire bill. In essence, the old system allowed both Members of Congress and the President the ability to blame each other and point fingers without accepting responsibility for these ridiculous projects. 
The court challenge launched by a few Members of Congress is simply an effort to continue their battle to preserve the status quo budget process--a budget process that favors seniority and the Appropriations Committee, and one that allows Members to hide wasteful and parochial spending projects in large appropriations bills that previously the President was forced to sign or reject in total. Some of these members support the current process because they directly benefit from it. Last September, the Portland Oregonian reported that since 1980, former Senator Hatfield sent $3.2 billion home to Oregon. It is simply not fair to allow a disproportionate share of taxpayer dollars to be distributed on the basis of position or committee assignment. 
The Line Item Veto Act ends this practice of unaccountable spending by allowing the President to use an enhanced rescission process that builds on the President's current authority under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. It strengthens the existing rescission authority by placing the onus on Congress to overturn the President's rescissions rather than waiting for Congress to act on rescissions that the President recommends. 
History shows the current rescission process simply does not work because it is too easy for Congress to deliberately fail to act. Since 1974 only $23.7 billion of the $74 billion in rescissions proposed by Presidents have been adopted. That is just 32 percent--not a very good batting record. It was, after all, our frustration with the current process and the Congress' insatiable appetite for spending that led Congress to cede this limited authority to the President. 
Our opponents will attempt to persuade the courts that we have abdicated our constitutional powers by delegating to the President powers that we do not have authority to delegate. There is strong historical evidence in tax and tariff law that proves Congress can delegate this kind of power to the President. The delegation of power is narrowly defined and limited to canceling dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority in an appropriation law, new items of direct spending, or limited tax benefits for the sole purpose of deficit reduction. The statute outlines strict prescriptions for how the President must use this authority and gives Congress an opportunity to overturn the President's cancellation under expedited procedures. All of these limitations on the President's use of this power ensure the constitutionality of this process change. 
Despite what the plaintiffs in this case may lead you to believe, I have found nothing in the Constitution that requires 
the President to spend every dollar that Congress appropriates. Our opponents would like to equate preserving Congress' autonomy to spend taxpayers money with protecting the delicate balance of power of our government. Actually these big spenders are trying to cling to power that has been unfairly tipped in their favor. Since Congress usurped the President's power to impound funds in 1974, it has been Congress that has upset the delicate balance of power in our government system. 
Congress' power has been even further expanded by the evolution of a budget process that results in huge appropriations bills, omnibus tax and reconciliation measures as well as passage of continuing resolutions at the last minute just before the fiscal year ends. In addition, this process of passing enormous bills has substantially undercut the current veto power to challenge wasteful spending measures. I doubt our founding fathers could have ever envisioned fathomed legislation totaling hundreds of pages. In their day, an appropriations bill was one page--giving the President a relatively easy choice. 
The line item veto finally puts the President on a level playing field with the Congress by giving the President a necessary tool to govern responsibly in light of the how the legislative process has evolved. For over 25 years it has actually been Congress that has quietly undermined our system of checks and balances. Passage of the line item veto was necessary to restore an equilibrium between the executive and legislative branch. 
The line item veto in no way alters or violates any of the principles of the Constitution. It preserves wholly the right of the Congress to control our Nation's purse strings--a trust I might add the Congress has often violated. The law as crafted does nothing more than embrace the Constitutional tenet to give the President functional veto power. I am confident that the court will look at this new authority in light of the historical evidence and court precedent and find that it is fully constitutional. 
I do not believe it is necessary to engage in a lengthy discussion about the line item veto since the Senate has already debated this subject vigorously and I believe the record speaks for itself. I would, however, like to remind the Senate that two former solicitors general--one Democrat and one Republican--testified before Congress that the law is fully constitutional. The American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service reviewed the law and asserted `nothing in delegation doctrine suggests that Congress may not delegate powers . . .' And the Justice Department reviewed the legislation before the President signed the bill and determined it was constitutional. 
In closing, let me say, I look forward to working with the President to help him identify spending and tax provisions that he should cancel. I hope that President Clinton has the political courage to exercise this authotity diligently and will not bow to the prolific spenders in Congress, thus squandering this historic opportunity. The American people have waited for this for over 120 years. Let us not disappoint them.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to establish a system to ensure that funding for the construction and repair of Federal buildings is allocated according to need and priority. 
First, the bill would require the President to submit the administration's building construction budget request in the form of a prioritized list of projects. Second, and most importantly, the bill would require the General Services Administration to prepare and maintain a ranked priority list of all ongoing and proposed construction projects. The list would be updated and reprioritized with each new project added either through administrative or congressional action. 
Last year, Congress provided nearly $900 million for Federal building construction and major repairs not including the funds provided to the Department of Defense. Over the past 5 years Congress obligated over $4 billion for this purpose. This is an enormous sum of money. Clearly, the Federal building construction program can and must share in the sacrifice as we seek to gain, control over the deficit. 
As we rein in spending, it is more critical now than ever to ensure that scarce financial resources are allocated to our highest priorities. In order to trim the fat in an informed and efficient manner, Congress, the administration and the taxpaying public must know what our construction priorities are. 
During debate on the rescission bill in the last Congress, the Senate considered proposals to cut Federal construction funding. The list of projects proposed for defunding was rather arbitrary and capricious. The tenets of good government dictate that when we reduce spending, our lowest priorities should be put on the chopping block first. Yet, Congress cannot readily determine what those priorities are. By requiring the General Services Administration, which administers the Federal building fund, to maintain a ranked list of project priorities, we can be sure that funding decisions will be made on the basis of merit rather than politics or congressional caprice. 
Mr. President, foremost, this legislation will help us address the pork barrel politics which has played far too great a role in the process of Federal building construction. Currently, when a Member of Congress decides a new building is needed in his or her State or district, the General Services Administration conducts what is known as an 11b survey to determine the need. In most cases, the GSA determines that a need exists. The study is then used to justify project authorization and appropriation, even though a finding of need is not a finding that such a project is a priority. 
As projects that are not in the President's budget request are added by Congress, we do not always have a clear idea of where they are ranked among competing priorities. Passage of this legislation will ensure that this vital information is readily available. 
I urge the relevant committees to expeditiously examine this proposal so that we can approve rapidly this relatively minor but, I believe, important and helpful change in procedure.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President today I am introducing legislation entitled the `Lobbying Conflict of Interest Elimination Act.' This bill would ban a candidate or a candidate's authorized committee from paying registered lobbyists for political services. Additionally, the bill would mandate that any political contributions made by a registered lobbyist be reported by such individual when he or she files his or her lobbying disclosure report as mandated in the Lobbying Disclosure Act. 
In the last Congress, we were successful in passing legislation that bans gifts from lobbyists to Members and staff in order to put a wall between lobbyists who seek to curry special favor by the giving of gifts. Unfortunately, a loophole allows lobbyists to serve as fundraisers for Members of Congress, which could result in an increase in their influence. 
Mr. President, this practice must stop. Registered lobbyists who work for campaigns as fundraisers clearly represent a conflict of interest. When a campaign employs an individual who also lobbies that Member, the perception of undue and unfair influence is raised. This legislation would stop such practices. 
The two important changes made by this legislation represent a substantial effort to close any loopholes that exist in our lobbying and gift laws. The Congress has begun to make great strides to restore the public's confidence in this institution. We must continue that good work.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to restore fairness and fiscal accountability to the Federal Government's many research and development programs and activities. The bill would require that commercial interests share the cost of constructing and operating new Federal research facilities that are intended to benefit their industries. 
Last year, the Federal Government spent $73 billion for research programs, including facility construction. Many of these programs are intended primarily to assist private industries and are sponsored by a host of Federal agencies, predominantly the Department of Defense, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, and the National Research Council. 
For example, the Department of Agriculture spends nearly $750 million per year for 116 centers under the Agriculture Research Service. These federally funded centers are designed to help a variety of agricultural industries, many of which have enormous resources and do not require Federal assistance. I understand the agency is planning to construct even more facilities. Last year, Congress appropriated $26 million to construct a new swine research center at Iowa State University, even though we already have 12 Federal centers dedicated to swine research. This additional facility will cost nearly $10 million a year to operate. 
Mr. President, I recognize the importance of research and development to our competitiveness and economic growth, although I seriously question why we need 13 centers dedicated to swine research. Nevertheless, given our serious fiscal condition at a time when we are contemplating significant reductions in practically every area of domestic discretionary spending, I see absolutely no reason why Government research that benefits private industries, many of them quite prosperous, should not be cost-shared by the private sector. 
Regarding swine research centers, the pork industry generates nearly $66 billion per year. Surely, it is reasonable to expect the industry, and the many others that directly benefit from Federal research, to share the cost of the centers and its operation. I should add that the legislation would not require cost sharing for any research conducted for the purpose of helping industry comply with Federal regulations. 
Mr. President, industry is historically more cautious with their resources than the Federal Government. If the private sector will not expend their resources for a program that is intended for their benefit, one must question why we should feel compelled to spend the taxpayers' hard-earned money on the same venture. Public-private cost-sharing arrangements for commercially oriented Federal research will ensure that proposed activities are truly cost-beneficial and that the potential outcomes of the research are worth the dollars invested. 
Again, I realize and appreciate the importance of research and development. I believe, however, that the legislation is a prudent and responsible approach which, no doubt, can be improved, but which should receive the Senate's full and timely consideration. I hope that we can have a hearing in the very near future to examine what I believe is a very important fiscal issue.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Feingold, Thompson, and Wellstone in introducing the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform bill of 1997. This measure is similar to last year's bill that we introduced on the same subject. I will not lay out all the details of the bill at this time, but will submit for the record a summary of our bill at a later date. 
Passage of campaign finance reform is necessary if we are to curb the public's growing cynicism for politics and Congress in particular. We can no longer wait to address this issue. 
I am under no illusions that this will be an easy fight. No other issue is felt more personally by Members of this body. No other issue stirs the emotions of Members of the Senate more. But we were sent here to make tough decisions and we must address this subject. 
The public demands that we achieve three goals: limit the role of money in politics, make the playing field more level between challengers and incumbents, and to pass a legislative initiative that will become law. 
To pass a bill will require principled compromise and a great deal of work. I want the members of my party to know that I am willing to work with you to address your concerns regarding this legislation. I want to let my friends know on the other side of the aisle that the offer also stands for them. The co-sponsors for this bill are willing to negotiate technical aspects of the bill. The three principals I just outlined, however, are not negotiable. 
Twenty-five years after Watergate, the electoral system is out of control. Our elections are awash in money which is flowing into the system at record levels. Some public interest groups estimate that when all is said and done, that nearly $1 billion will have been spent during this last election cycle. Something must be done. 
Do we have the perfect solution? No. I do not know if a perfect solution even exists. But our bill, the McCain-Feingold-Thompson bill is a good first step toward reform. I hope that soon we will be on the floor debating this measure. I look forward to working with all my colleagues as we move forward. It is only in a bipartisan manner, putting parochial interests aside, that we will be able to do the people's business--that we will pass meaningful campaign finance reform.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good friend, the junior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] to introduce legislation that will limit the number of political appointees in the executive branch a total of 2000. This legislation could save an estimated $400 million over the next five years. 
There is no doubt that our Government is bloated. In recent years, the number of political appointees has grown exponentially. Author Paul Light, in his book Thickening Government: Federal Government and the Diffusion of Accountability, reports a 430 percent increase in the number of political appointees and senior executives in the Federal Government between 1960 and 1992. The Congressional Research Service also found that from 1980 to 1992, the number of political appointees in the executive branch grew 3 times faster than the total number of executive branch employees 17 percent compared to 5.6 percent. 
The Government must continue to tighten its belt, and the executive branch must not protect itself from needed cuts. Our current $5 trillion debt and our efforts to reach a balance budget by the year 2002 call for immediate action. No area of Government spending should be overlooked, not the least of which is funding for Government employees. I am hopeful that this administration will live up to their rhetoric about reducing the deficit and balancing the budget by supporting this and other measures that get us closer to a balanced budget. 
Since this measure is consistent with the recommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review [NPR], the administration should not have a problem endorsing this legislation. NPR called for reducing Federal managers and supervisors, arguing that `over-control and micromanagement' not only `stifle the creativity of line managers and workers, they consume billions per year in salary, benefits, and administrative costs.' 
Limiting the number of political appointees to 2000 was recommended by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker who chaired The National Commission on Public Service. His report supported reducing the number of Presidential appointees, stating that the number of political appointees may `actually undermine effective presidential control of the executive branch.' 
Despite all this compelling evidence, Senator Feingold and I have yet to be successful in actually getting this legislation enacted. Last year, we passed an amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill that would have placed a 2300 cap on political appointees. Unfortunately, however, the cap was dropped in conference. Given the new era of bipartisanship and the President's repeated statements that he wants to balance the budget, I am hopeful that we will be successful in this Congress. 
I look forward to working with my friend from Wisconsin to enact this important legislation that will streamline Government operations and save the taxpayers money.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Product Liability Reform Act of 1997 overhauls an unfair and inefficient product liability system for the benefit of American consumers and entrepreneurs. The text of this bill will be familiar to all Senators who are veterans of the 104th Congress: it is the conference report that Congress approved last year. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed that conference report, but I want to remind my colleagues that the President said in his veto statement `I support real common sense product liability reform.' Well, Mr. President, we will soon again hold your words to task. 
The introduction of this bill today, as one of the first 10 bills introduced in the Congress, is an indication of the importance of the legislation and the priority that we place on its consideration. The text of the Conference Report has been introduced because it is the last action Congress took on this matter. 
Now members from both sides of the aisle will undertake bipartisan discussions and diverse viewpoints will be addressed. In the last Congress Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller did an excellent job in developing a bipartisan consensus to pass this legislation. I appreciate their hard work and dedication. Their efforts will be called on again. Senator Ashcroft has assumed the chairmanship of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over this bill and I know he will be a valuable asset as this legislation advances. 
As we address this important legislation I look forward to working with the President as well. The President's veto statement outlined some of his concerns with the conference report. In my opinion, many of those concerns can be addressed easily and directly. Other issues, such as reform of punitive damages and joint and several liability, will require meaningful discussions. 
I am nevertheless hopeful that those negotiations will succeed. I am encouraged that the President has strongly indicated his support for meaningful product liability reform. I recall that in the first Presidential debate with Senator Dole, in October 1996, the President said, when discussing product liability, `we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.' In that debate, the President reminded the public that he has supported tort reform in the past. In 1994, the President signed the General Aviation Revitalization Act which, by instituting a statute of repose, truly revitalized a withering industry and in the process created hundreds of high quality jobs. 
As this legislation moves forward, I remind my colleagues that we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Much is at stake. Federal liability legislation is urgently needed. The present system in the United States for resolving product liability actions is costly, slow, inequitable and unpredictable. I find it shocking that the system's transaction costs exceed the compensation paid to individuals who have sustained injury. These transaction costs are inevitably passed on to consumers through higher product prices. The inefficiency and unpredictability of the product liability system has also stifled innovation, kept beneficial products off the market, and has handicapped American firms as they compete in a global market. 
Consumers who are legitimately injured suffer most from this broken system. Many consumers who are injured by defective products and are in need of compensation are unable to recover damages or must wait years to recover them. They are thrown into a product liability litigation system where identical cases can produce shockingly different results. Sadly, severely injured victims tend to receive far less than their actual economic losses, while those with minor injuries often are dramatically overcompensated. This legislation will help fix this broken system. I feel it is important to emphasize that this legislation will greatly benefit consumers and it will not bar the door to the court house or limit the compensatory damages that an injured plaintiff can receive. 
The malfunctions of this system are particularly evident in the area of biomaterials where valuable life-saving products are kept from consumers. I was introduced to this issue when the Ransom family in Mesa, AZ wrote to me about their daughter's desperate need for a specialized brain shunt. They were concerned this life-saving device may not be available for their daughter because companies were no longer willing to supply the raw materials necessary due to the high risk of being unjustifiably sued. 
In the last Congress, Senator Lieberman and I introduced legislation to address this problem. That legislation, the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act, became part of the product liability bill and was included in the Conference Report of the bill. In the closing weeks of the last Congress, Senator Lieberman and I proposed a version of our bill that excluded breast implant litigation from its coverage. I expect the legislation advanced in this Congress will also contain that exclusion for breast implant litigation. I look forward to working closely with Senator Lieberman on this matter. 
I hope that bipartisan negotiations begin in earnest on The Product Liability Reform Act. It is my desire to have this legislation be the first bill reported in this Congress by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was watching on television the discussion going on here. I just urge my colleague from Minnesota to let us go ahead with the ordinary historical business of the Senate. He and I share the same zeal, dedication, and effort toward getting this issue done. I appreciate the comments of the majority leader and of the distinguished Democrat leader. 
I think at this point it would not be appropriate for us to begin the very first day of the U.S. Senate, the first day of the new term, for us to begin on this note. I think we will have plenty of time to adopt that strategy and tactic. I do not like for us to discomfort our colleagues on this day of celebration for both new and reelected Members. I think that the issue has to be addressed as quickly as possible. I believe that American public opinion will demand that we move forward. I do not think there is any doubt about it. 
I urge my friend from Minnesota to let the Senate move forward on this day, this very important day, before we have to start calling people back here and going into quorum calls and that kind of thing. This is, if I may say in all due respect to my friend from Minnesota, not appropriate on this day. I urge my friend from Minnesota allow the Senate to move forward, again, reemphasizing my commitment to him that we will move forward in a bipartisan fashion on this compelling issue.
