   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for a short time today. 
   The Senate was expected to consider the final appropriations bill during today's session. However, because of changes in the House schedule, the Senate will not begin consideration of the final package until tomorrow morning pending its receipt from the House. It is hoped that the House can complete action shortly after noon tomorrow. Senators will be updated on the vote time throughout the day today. 
   I think that probably covers the concerns of my colleagues, and I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the House is not in session because of the funeral of Congressman Julian Dixon. 
   Many here in the Senate did not know the Congressman, but I did. I had the great opportunity to serve with him in the most difficult of circumstances. We served on the Ethics Committee together during the period in which Jim Wright was examined for what was believed to be, and what was later found to be, unethical activities for which he finally resigned. 
   Julian Dixon was a fine American. Oh, yes, he was a partisan. But when it came to the responsibility of leadership, there was no question that his chairmanship of the Ethics Committee during that time was fair, equitable, and responsible. I must tell you that in working with him during those long hours and difficult times, I grew to respect him a great deal. I must say that we have lost a great public servant in the death of Congressman Julian Dixon. I will miss him. I think all of us will.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, recently, I attended the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-6) at The Hague, in the Netherlands. I went to observe Undersecretary of State Frank Loy and the rest of the U.S. negotiating team confront the complex issues associated with the requirements of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
   The experience brought into clearer focus for me some disturbing themes that appear to be behind the intense international pressure brought to bear on the United States to reach agreement on some profound economic, social, and environmental issues. 
   At the outset, let me make clear that I did not arrive at The Hague without first studying the climate issue. For several years now, I have closely followed the progress of the climate change debate. 
   I have sought the input of nationally recognized scientists credentialed in the disciplines of atmospheric, ocean, and computer modeling sciences. I have reviewed scientific reports, most notably the document entitled Research Pathways for the Next Decade, prepared by scientists affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate. 
   In addition, I have traveled to institutions such as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts and met with ocean scientists who are very involved in climate research. 
   All of these scientists have, for many years, studied and disagreed on how much our planet is warming, and whether it was driven by natural causes or by carbon dioxide emissions from industry, and other human activities. 
   Scientists from around the world have had legitimate disagreements on how drastic a problem global warming is likely to be in this century and beyond. The debate has been further complicated by politically motivated ``junk science'' predictions of ``imminent'' environmental catastrophes capitalizing on weather events that most scientists agree are not linked to current temperature increases. 
   The emotional intensity of this debate cautioned many policymakers not to take sides early. However, as Republican Policy Committee Chairman, I felt compelled to address the many valid concerns expressed about this issue in a balanced way. 
   This led me to introduce with my colleagues, Senators MURKOWSKI, HAGEL, and others, over a year ago, comprehensive legislation that I believed, and still believe, provides the framework for some responsible and immediate consensus action on this issue. 
   A few days before leaving for The Hague, I met with the Director of the National Research Council's Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, and other scientists on the Board to discuss the status of the scientific research on climate change. Prior to that date, the NRC was reluctant to agree with earlier summary scientific assessments of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that humans were contributing to increasing temperatures recorded around the globe--the so-called ``anthropogenic effect.'' 
   Indeed, at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing held just last Spring, Dr. Joe Friday, testifying on behalf of the NRC stated that the ``jury is still out'' on why global temperatures are rising. The NRC was clearly unable at that time to state on the record that it had detected clear evidence of an anthropogenic fingerprint on the warming trends of earth's climate. 
   At our meeting a few weeks ago, the NRC scientists were less passionate in their refusal to acknowledge the ``anthropogenic effect.'' I took from our discussion that day that there was increasing evidence that land-use practices and human emissions of greenhouse gases were having some contributing effect to the increased land surface temperatures monitored around the globe. 
   To be sure, the scientists did not suggest or imply that temperatures would reach dangerously high levels during the next 50 to 100 years. Indeed, the scientists offered their opinion that the rise in temperature would more likely be closer to 1.5 degrees rather than the 5 to 10 degree high range predicted for later this century by the IPCC. 
   Moreover, the NRC scientists underscored the uncertain nature of the computer modeling results on which most, if not all, predictions depend. They cautioned against fully embracing any set of predictions because of the uncertain nature of input data and the ability of computers to fairly and adequately handle the many variables that are included in computer programs. 
   They further noted the need for continued technological advancement in super computer capability. 
   What was clear to me after that meeting was that the issue of human contributions to increasing temperatures was reaching some consensus within the National Academy of Sciences.  
   However, it was also clear to me from my discussions with those scientists that many other important scientific issues concerning the extent of the human contribution to warming trends, the extent to which the earth will continue to warm, and perhaps, most important, the extent to which mankind can take actions that will effectively stop or slow climate change are far from settled and will likely take years to determine. 
   Indeed, the consensus that is forming among scientists working on this issue for the National Research Council is that we need a 
   plan to focus more on climate change ``adaptation'' rather than climate change ``mitigation.'' This thinking would have been considered radical a little over a year ago and today still may be anathema to many in the environmental community. Yet, a July, 2000, Atlantic Monthly article entitled ``Breaking the Global Warming Gridlock'' by Daniel Sarewitz and Roger Pielke, Jr. boldly and intelligently addresses this issue and persuasively makes the case for new thinking on what many of us would agree is one of the most important issues for this new century. 
   Instead of discussions at The Hague centering on ways to reach consensus on actions that would reduce vulnerability to climate change such as encouraging democracy, raising standards of living, and improving environmental quality in the developing world through the use of innovative American and other industrialized countries technology, many discussions were consumed by scathing anti-American rhetoric. 
   Some non-governmental environmental organizations and some European Environmental Ministers were criticizing the United States for not wanting to surrender some of its sovereignty by allowing other nations to police American fuel use and economic expansion strategies. 
   Many in the developing world were brazenly demanding billions of dollars in ``pay-offs'' for the perceived harm that climate change--in their opinion, brought about by American greed--was causing developing countries. Astonishingly, all of this pay-off money would be in addition to the large sums currently being sent to developing countries through AID and many other American taxpayer programs designed to help developing nations reach better standards of living. 
   The motives of America's strongest critics at The Hague Climate Conference appeared to be nothing more than transparent efforts to have wholesale redistribution of wealth to the developing world and to maneuver our competitors in the global market place into stronger competitive positions. 
   Many in the non-governmental environmental community appeared to be more interested in promoting non-growth and anti-population agendas than taking actions that would offer the best prospects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or helping vulnerable nations adapt to capricious climate variations. 
   I believe America will responsibly move forward in addressing the climate change issue whether or not Kyoto is ever ratified by the Senate. We should not, and the Senate will not allow the international community or powerful non-governmental environmental organizations to force our nation to accept a deal that will be economically threatening or scientifically ineffective. 
   Secretary Loy and his negotiating team at COP-6 should be commended for their hard work and steadfastness in demanding from the international community solid proposals that fully recognize both America's determination to defend its sovereignty and its unmatched ability through its technological prowess to help the world deal with any potential calamities as a consequence of climate change. 
   Moreover, the United States won key concessions from international negotiators at Kyoto that now appear to be at serious risk. Indeed, European negotiators at The Hague, with strong pressure from some non-governmental environmental organizations, made aggressive attempts to rescind those concessions. 
   The flexible mechanisms provision and the sinks provision were elements of the Protocol that were prominently displayed to Congress by the Clinton/Gore Administration when Congressional Oversight Committees questioned the costs associated with the Protocol. Each time the Administration responded to such queries, the Administration would point to the carbon sink and flexible mechanism provisions to rationalize its assessment that compliance with the Protocol would be inexpensive. 
   Clearly, without those provisions, the Protocol's cost will be prohibitive and violate one of the critical tenets of Senate Resolution 98--the Byrd/Hagel Resolution--which passed the Senate 95-0 in 1997. 
   I can only hope that the current Administration will do nothing to compromise these principles in the coming weeks. To do so would be irresponsible and unproductive. Clearly, it would be politically ineffective inasmuch as the Senate would not ratify such agreement. 
   Meanwhile, as scientists continue to research, discover, and even disagree on the causes and effects of global warming, I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to aggressively establish a system of incentives that reduce the environmental impacts of human activity, while preserving the freedoms and quality of life that make the United States the greatest Nation on Earth.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Katie Kirkham, a high school sophomore from Century High School in Pocatello, ID. Katie represented Idaho's horse program at the National 4-H Congress in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 24-28, 2000. She was one of twelve teens in the nation honored with the responsibility of introducing a guest speaker at the event. 
   There are thousands of young people involved in 4-H in the state of Idaho. And as a former 4-H member myself, I take special pride in recognizing the 4-H program, which has been educating Idaho youth on agricultural issues for generations, and will continue to do so for generations to come. I congratulate Katie on her outstanding accomplishment.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on November 11 of this year, we will commemorate the sacrifice made by veterans and all Americans during World War II by dedicating the National World War II Memorial. The Memorial is a tribute to the men and women who risked their lives for our freedom and democracy. Sixteen million men and women served our country during this war, and many more contributed on the home front. Each day, more veterans pass away, and it is imperative we remember the great effort they made, securing the liberties we enjoy in the United States of America. 
   Hundreds of Americans from all sectors of our society joined the effort to show their appreciation to America's World War II generation by raising millions of dollars. The Memorial was almost completely funded by private contributions, and among the many who contributed to this effort were students from Eagle High School in Eagle, Idaho. 
   In November of 1999, high school students Fi Southerland and Kate Bowen decided to raise $20,000 for the National World War II Memorial. These students were soon joined by many of the Eagle High students and staff. With the assistance and under the direction of their high school teacher, Gail Chumbley, they held various events to raise money. I am pleased to report that this group of outstanding young people and the many others involved in the project have not only met the goal of raising $20,000 but have actually surpassed it by seven thousand dollars. 
   Those who participated in this effort expressed how the effort changed their perspective on the great sacrifice made by our War Veterans. The students said one of the most satisfying parts of this year-long project has been letters and stories they have received from people involved in WWII. One of the most interesting was from a man who was not a veteran, but born in Holland and lived through the war and now is a United States citizen. He told the students that as a child, he heard the allied bombers flying overhead at night on their way to Germany, his parents called the ``sound of freedom.'' 
   Kate Bowen summed up the reasons for raising the funds. ``The effort is about paying respect to that generation. Look at what they did for us.'' We recognize, with gratitude, the difference World War II veterans made in our every day lives. I commend all those involved with this project for their dedication and hard work, and hope their interest and concern will inspire others. 
   Other students and organizations involved in the project include Kristen Ediger, Sam Johnson, Karl Krohner,  Hilary Case, Lacey Rammel-O'Brien, Katria Taylor, Amy Marcotte, Darcy Haney, David Sant, Tony Bergman, Jennifer Martinez, Chase Deobald, Cassie Southerland, Kiley Southerland, Kristen Clark, Lindsey Marshall, Robert Frazier, Josh Miller, Melissa McGrath, Catherine Sant, Bryan Jolly, Brandon Putzier, Melvin Delic, Jason Steik, Shaun Huntington, Deanne Jenkins, Tana Martin, Traci Mayhugh, Tysen Janak, Carolyn Michaud, Jimmy Hallyburton, Taylor Cooley, Cory Snethen, Brian Price, Elizabeth Pearson, Aimee McCauley, Dawn Leavitt, Matt Reines, Devan Satterly, Ashley Ellis, Craig Cahan, Justin Bodine, Jason Gates, Patrick Bulson, John Winder, Shyann Harris, Shannon Bruce, Michael Johnson, James Burdick, Edis Kajic, Merzine Ceric, Jason Kalk, Steve McClenny, Casey Spirk, Conrad Crisman, Paul Moore, Jason Lindquist, Steven Baker, Nathan Nichols, Katie Miller, Adam Brundy, Jason Peterson, Jeff Auchampach, Roy Brewer, Danny Edvalson, Larissa Martinson, Robbie Buck, Travis Barney, Nicola Miller, Ryan Griffiths, Bret Anderson, Diana Chong, Andrea Banks, Brad Smith, Dena Smith, Robert Frazier, Kia Black, Cathy Peterson, Heidi Webb, Jeff Collier, Kimber Crosgrove, Jennifer Pengelly, Ryan Small, Linda and Mike Bowen, Kacey Bowen, Kelly Bowen, Lili Gonzales, Lindsay Miller, Brandon Rapp, Clipper Net, Chapparal Elementary School, Amanda Vissotski, Amy Barnes, Eagle Middle School, McMillian Elementary, Bill and Wendy Southerland, Emerson and Patricia Smock, Bruce Gestrin, Eagle Albertons, Dick Bengoechea, Andrea Mahan, Lori Smock, Joanna Lee, Eagle Lions Club, Eagle Volunteer Fire Department, Eagle Chamber of Commerce, Chad Chumbley, Henni Keller, Pat O'Oloughlin and Kepa Zubizaretta.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I very recently came to the floor and expressed my grave concern about the reliability of affordable electricity. I am not alone in my concerns about this issue. Indeed, some of the loudest voices expressing similar concerns about energy prices are coming from not just Idaho but California, and specifically from my distinguished colleagues from California here in the Senate. 
   By my comments today, I do not diminish or in any way cast doubt about the substantial hardships experienced by the ratepayers in California, particularly southern California. Indeed, I have great empathy for them, primarily because Pacific Northwest ratepayers are bracing for power shortages in the near future that will cause energy prices to soar and hurt large and small businesses alike and put some residential customers in danger, especially during the cold and hot periods of the year in our region of the Pacific Northwest. I share equal concerns with the citizens of California. 
   We must confront the obvious facts facing all energy consumers today. 
   There is an energy supply crisis in the United States. It is clear that the administration didn't see it coming, or at least ignored it. We in the Congress heard no alarms from the Department of Energy and were given not enough warning during the last 8 years that an energy supply crisis was about to threaten the electrical industry of our country. 
   One of the very few pieces of energy legislation that was sent to Congress for review and passage was the administration's Comprehensive Electrical Competition Act in April 1999. This legislation was purported to result in $20 billion in savings a year to America's energy consumers. However, this legislation would not have precluded the crisis in California, the kind that Californians experienced this summer. Indeed, the legislation was full of mandates and rules that didn't offer any economic incentives or investments in new supplies. 
   Moreover, the legislation included a renewable portfolio mandate that did not include cheap hydropower as a renewable. I know the Presiding Officer and I talked about it at that time--that all of a sudden we had an administration that was not going to include hydropower as a renewable. This renewable portfolio requirement would have made electricity more expensive and more scarce to the consumer. Part of the problem in California appears to be that it is unwilling to accept the tradeoff of high prices required by environmental regulations. Either the tough environmental standards that currently exist in California are an acceptable cost of energy consumption or California must make necessary environmental adjustments for more abundant supplies at a cheaper price. 
   In addition, the administration must reexamine the use of the price caps that apparently have caused the supply problems in California. 
   Mr. President, these are some of the reasons why the legislation failed to get the desired support in Congress from a majority of the Members which included many Democrats as well as Republicans. We recognized you simply can't just go out and say here is the energy, what it is going to cost, cap it at prices, and put all these environmental restrictions on it. It is going to ultimately get to the consumer and, boy, did it get to them in California this summer. Many of us were justifiably concerned about the impact such legislation would have on the current electrical supply network that supports the most reliable electric service found anywhere in the world. 
   The administration did not adequately explain how the legislation would prevent energy supply problems from occurring if its legislation was passed--perhaps because it simply didn't have an adequate explanation or, if it knew the facts, it certainly wasn't willing to have them known publicly.  
   Rather than wait for Federal direction on this issue, many States embarked on their own experiment with electrical restructuring. Some of those State programs appeared to be experiencing some success by giving to their electricity consumers choice of energy suppliers without jeopardizing reliable service. However, other States are experiencing great difficulties ensuring reliable service at affordable prices. And California happens to be one of those States. 
   I am not interested in pointing blame for failures. I am interested in getting at the facts and understanding them as they relate to how they contributed to the failures so that objective assessments of future legislative proposals can be made to avoid what happened in California again in the coming 
   years. Moreover, I want to ensure that the distinguished Members from California have all of the facts necessary to fully understand and appreciate the role the Bonneville Power Administration plays in the California markets. There were a lot of accusations made this summer about how the Bonneville Power Administration was handling its electrical supply. I think the facts are soon to be known and an entirely different story will emerge. 
   I fully expect the facts to prove that the Bonneville Power Administration has not contributed to the energy cost crisis in California and that BPA can and will continue to play a positive role in bringing affordable surplus electricity from the Pacific Northwest to the California markets when that surplus is available. 
   For these reasons, it is imperative to get relevant information about the California energy price crisis to Congress and the American people as soon as possible. It has come to my attention that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's investigative report on California's wholesale electricity markets is complete and ready for distribution. I was told just this morning that they have finally decided to release it. 
   Indeed, in a news report yesterday, I read that a Democrat Commissioner from FERC stated that the FERC could not find evidence that California power rates were unjust and unreasonable. The Commissioner also told the reporters that there was no evidence of abuse by energy companies operating within the State. 
   This is important information that must be shared and now will be shared with Congress and all electrical consumers. The news reports also say the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission report would address sweeping structural changes in California's independent supply operator, or ISO, which controls the high voltage transmission grid, and the State's power transmission grid, and the State's power exchange, where power is bought and sold. 
   It has come to my attention that the FERC report has been complete since October 16. There was some effort to keep it quiet, but it appears now to be breaking on the scene. This important information has been available and is now, as I say, beginning to come out. I do not understand why Congress should resist this kind of information. It ought to be made immediately available to Members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the committee of jurisdiction for FERC issues and shared with members of the House Commerce Committee, where all of these issues will have to be considered. 
   Indeed, one of the FERC Commissioners recognized its importance and talked about the issuance of this report. Commissioner Hebert captured these thoughts with some pretty eloquent words on October 19 when he said:  
   Rather than wait for November 1 to release the findings of our staff's investigation--  
   Which they finally did. He felt it was important that they do it at this time. He said--  
   I urge the Chairman to release the completed report now.  
   It seems that Commissioner is finally getting his way.  
   Open government requires it; fairness does as well.  
   And, most importantly, on this kind of information.  
   The people of California should have as much time as possible to digest findings and consider the options presented. 
   Justice Brandeis often remarked, ``Sunshine is the best disinfectant.'' Let the sun shine on our staff's report.  
   The Commissioner is speaking of the FERC staff.  
   It can only help heal the raw emotions rampant in the State of California.  
   It is time Californians look at themselves and decide what went wrong in California because it wasn't as a result of the Bonneville Power Administration hoarding its power or choosing not to send power to California. It was California now finding out that some of the environmental restrictions they wanted in their marketplace are going to be very expensive restrictions indeed for which the average consumer of California will have to pay. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important legislation designed to clarify the tax treatment of employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). The Worker Investment Protection Act provides this needed clarification. 
   Employee stock purchase plans are a common tool used by employers to allow rank-and-file employees to set aside part of their paychecks to purchase the company's stock. The tax code provides incentives for employees to participate in ESPPs to encourage employee ownership. This legislation is necessary because in selected cases around the country, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has begun to act contrary to almost 30 years of published policy, and is attempting to collect income taxes and payroll taxes on  ESPPs. For three decades, the published IRS ruling position (Rev. Rul. 71-52) has been that transactions under qualified stock option plans do not give rise to income that is subject to employment taxes. In Notice 87-49, the IRS extended the principles of this ruling to incentive stock options (ISOs). In a series of private letter rulings, the IRS applied the same position to ESPP transactions, which are generally governed by the same Code provisions as qualified and incentive stock options. The IRS has periodically indicated that it may reconsider the positions in Rev. Rul. 71-52 and Notice 87-49, but no further official guidance has been forthcoming. 
   Rev. Rul. 71-52 and Notice 87-49 remain the best statements of current law and represent the only publicly published IRS position on current law. Nevertheless, IRS agents have selectively begun seeking to collect retroactive assessments of employment taxes, including withholdings, from employers who reasonably relied on these rulings and did not subject transactions under ESPPs to such taxes. 
   The IRS's actions in this area are inconsistent with long-standing published IRS positions. This legislation would clarify that any income arising from transactions under ISOs and ESPPs, either upon grant or exercise, or qualifying and disqualifying disposition, is not subject to employment taxes or federal income tax withholding. 
   ESPPs are the primary vehicle through which rank and file workers purchase stock in their companies. However, additional tax liabilities on employees and high administrative costs for plan administration will discourage employers from offering these programs that encourage broad-based employee stock ownership. Imposing employment taxes on otherwise nontaxable transactions will weaken incentives for employees to participate. The taxes involved are very modest when compared with the compliance costs and the unfair burdens on rank-and-file workers generally. 
   This legislation will clarify what is sensible tax policy regarding ESPPs. More important, it will empower workers during their working years because they will be both employees and owners of the company as well as additional providers of their own retirement security. Furthermore, it will thwart the arbitrary and selective IRS actions, contrary to all previously published Treasury and IRS policies. 
   I am introducing the Worker Investment Protection Act in the closing days of the 106th Congress with the hope that the Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence Summers, will clarify longstanding IRS policy, and therefore preclude the need for this legislation. If not, I intend to pursue this legislation aggressively during the next session of Congress. I urge my colleagues to support the Worker Investment Protection Act. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the attached letters from the American Electronic Association, Micron Technology, and the National Association of Manufacturers in support of my efforts regarding employee stock purchase plans be made a part of the RECORD, immediately following my remarks.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thought this time was an opportunity of which I could take advantage to talk about something we all experienced this morning when we awakened here on the east coast. That was the chill of fall in the air. 
   I think most of us had failed to recognize that we were late into October because the weather has been so mild and so generally warm. But we are really at the threshold of winter, and as winter comes, so does cold weather. And as cold weather comes, the average American reaches to the thermostat on the wall of his or her home and begins to turn it up. 
   This fall, as that experience occurs, something else is going to happen in America that will be very dramatic, and that will be the turning up of the heating bill because, whether it is electricity or oil for space heating, the cost of those commodities in the average American's household budget has increased dramatically. 
   In fact, in the Northeast, where home heating oil for space heat is a major commodity, those costs will have better than doubled since last year and could go even higher this year as the amount of supplies for those needs continues to not increase at the rate of demand. 
   Why has this happened? Why are we at the threshold of an energy crisis in this country that we have not experienced in a long, long while? 
   In nearly every part of the energy consumer basket--be it electricity, or home heating oil, or automobile gasoline, or diesel for our truck transportation, or fuel for the great turbines of the jet engines that fly Americans across America--there is no surplus today. 
   That is a historic fact. This country was built on the abundance of energy. Our successes in our economy have always been the result of having the necessary energy to accomplish what we wanted. It was always one of the least-cost items in that accumulation of costs that made up the price to the consumer of a product on the market shelf. That is no longer the case. 
   For the next few moments, I would like to once again address, as have I and other Senators for the last year and a half, the energy crisis we are now into and why we are there. 
   Largely, it gained our attention about a year ago when we became aware that the members of the OPEC countries were going to move the price of oil from about $10 a barrel to $28-$30 a barrel. It had been selling for around $10 in the world spot market, and it was beginning to increase because they were beginning to decrease their production. 
   Admittedly, no one was making money at $10 a barrel. Whether it is oil of the Middle East or oil in Texas or Oklahoma or on the overthrust belt of the west in Colorado and Wyoming, oil is not profitable at $10 a barrel simply because of the cost of production and compliance, especially in this country, with environmental rules and regulations. Somewhere at $17 to $20 a barrel  is where it begins to be profitable. So for a long time, for the last several years, we were operating on less-than-profitable oil for at least the producers. 
   For the consumer, it was a bonus. I remember just a year ago, across the Potomac in Northern Virginia, I bought regular gasoline for 90 cents a gallon. Today, one is going to pay at least $1.60 to $1.75, maybe even more than that, depending on your location and the location of the particular service station. That is a dramatic increase. That is a 110-120 percent increase. So that 90-cent gas, while there was a bit of a price war going on out in Northern Virginia at the time, was still based on $10-a-barrel oil. 
   We know that has changed. We saw it change. Now we see the Arab nations receiving anywhere from $28 to $30, $31, $32, $33 a barrel for their crude oil. That all translates into a much greater cost at the pump to the consumer, but it also translates into a variety of other things. 
   As we know, the petrochemical industry of this country is involved in almost all we do and sometimes a lot of what we wear because of the byproducts of the petrochemical industry, be it plastics or nylon or a combination of consumer goods. Slowly but surely, the increased cost of those byproducts is beginning to roll across the American economy. 
   The other evening I did a conference call in Idaho with a group of farmers. They happened to be sugar beet farmers and potato farmers. The price of potatoes is well below break even this year. It has been for 3 years. Many of those farmers will not make money again this year, and they are very frustrated. Some of them will lose their farms. It is also true in sugar beets, with the price of sugar at near an all-time low. 
   What they were most concerned about was their energy costs. As we all know, agriculture is a large consumer of energy. It is an intensive industry. Those large tractors and trucks used in the process of farming all consume large quantities of energy. The pesticides, insecticides, herbicides are all hydrocarbon or petrochemical based. All of their costs have started going up. Fertilizer costs will nearly double this year as a direct result of energy costs because when you are dealing with phosphates and phosphate fertilizers, huge volumes of energy are used to transform those from the rock to the fertilizer product that ultimately goes to the ground that the farmer uses. 
   All of those costs are going up, and all of them are based on one simple fact; that in this economy, the energy costs to the consumer have nearly doubled in just about a year. So the farmers, while their prices were at an all-time low, were talking to me about energy. What is this country going to do? What is this administration going to do. What is this Congress 
   going to do about an energy policy that would ultimately begin to bring those prices down. They were dramatically concerned. 
   When the Congress gets back in January and February, we are going to hear a hue and cry coming out of the Northeast in relation to the cost of space heat and home heating oil, even though we have tried to deal with that in short-term measures. But those are some of the circumstances in which we are involved. 
   The consumer is still going to the pump, and they are still filling up their vehicles. In most instances, consumers are working. They all have good jobs at this time. We are at nearly full employment. Nobody has really stopped to factor in that over the course of a year, they are going to be paying more than $300, $400, sometimes $500 out of their household budget for their energy costs than they did a year ago. But it will be the single highest increase in relation to cost over a 12-month period of any one item the American consumer will buy this year. It will be their energy. Never in the history of this country has energy gone up that fast for that sustained period of time and affected all segments of the economy. 
   Those are some of the realities we are facing. Let me, for a few moments, explore why it has all happened. We now import about 56 percent of our supply of crude oil. That has gone up very dramatically over the last few years. In 1975, when we established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we were 36-percent dependent on foreign oil. The political rhetoric at that time--I was not here; the Presiding Officer was not here--was loud and boisterous: Never again will America be dependent on foreign sources of oil; we will establish a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in case of a national or an international crisis. Never will we have to be held hostage to the attitudes or the political concerns of a small group of Arab nations known as OPEC. 
   That was 1975 when we were 36-percent dependent. So we established SPR and we put hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in a salt dome down in Louisiana as a special reserve to be used in an international or national emergency where supply would be disrupted. 
   Today, we are 58-percent dependent on foreign oil, not 36-percent dependent. 
   I have run my 10 minutes and there are others here to speak. I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 more minutes.

   Mr. CRAIG. We have not heard this administration in any way talk about the need to change things very much. Why is that the case? Why are we now at the threshold I have described? 
   The large reason is that for the last 8 years, during a time when this dependency on foreign oil has skyrocketed, we have had no energy policy coming from the Clinton-Gore administration. In fact, in almost every instance, they have, by rule and regulation or by process slowed down production in our fundamental sources of energy, be it domestic crude production, down 14 percent over the last decade; be it any exploration because of new environmental regulations; the inability to get out on the land and explore, even though our oil companies have the highest environmental standards to protect the land and to protect the environment around any new discoveries and developments. 
   Out in my State of Idaho and in the Pacific Northwest, this administration is talking about taking down four very large hydrodams. They believe that by doing so and turning the Snake and the Columbia Rivers back to a more natural flow, they could actually improve fisheries. Somebody says: It is only 5 percent of the supply. 
   Well, 5 percent of the supply of that region from those four dams generates enough electricity for the entire city of Seattle, WA--again, another attitude as to why we are not producing this and solving this problem but simply getting more deeply into this problem. 
   Well, there are a lot of other reasons, and my time is short. But as a result of all of those problems and no solution coming from the administration--well, they did have one solution. They sent Bill Richardson, the Secretary of Energy, to the Middle East, and he had in his briefcase a tin cup. He got it out and he held out his tin cup and he said to the Arab Emirate oil nations: Please fill up my cup; please turn your valves on. You see, we have no energy policy. You are our supplier. We are victim to your political and economic whims. 
   That has been the energy policy of the Clinton administration. That is the only real thing they have attempted to do, other than the politically charged action to open the SPR and bring about 30 million barrels of oil out of there to somehow change the price and the supply. Of course, we have held several hearings on that and, no, that hasn't happened. But this year, I, Senator FRANK MURKOWSKI, TRENT LOTT, and many others introduced the National Energy Security Act of 2000, S. 2575. We brought it to the floor. It is a major, new effort to bring our dependency on foreign oil at or below 50 percent, to encourage and maximize utilization of alternative fuels and renewable energy and increased domestic supply of not only oil but gas production, because natural gas has better than doubled in price in less than a year. 
   Yet this administration sits happily by, as if nothing were occurring, knowing very clearly, but not wanting to talk very loudly in this political season, that their energy policy will drive costs to the consuming public to a higher rate than ever in the history of our country. Their only real good argument is that they did it all in the name of the environment. 
   In closing, let me talk about the environment we are about to experience.  It is going to be a cold environment this winter. That is a normal environment then. When elderly people and poor people have to make choices this winter between food and medicine and heat, that is not a very good environment. We will do all we can here to supply them with alternative resources to hold down their heating bills, but there is one remaining fundamental fact about why they must make those choices in this environment. We have lived for 8 years without an energy policy coming from this administration, except one--the tin cup in the hand of Bill Richardson--and a policy that somehow the production of hydrocarbons in our country was environmentally damaging. I think most of us know that is no longer true today. 
   So I thought as I awoke this morning and felt the cool in the air and turned up the thermostat on the wall, while I may be able to afford my heating bill this winter, I know a good many people won't be able to afford theirs. That is a tragedy in this country that should not have to happen--a country that has always been so wise to allow the marketplace to provide one of the great abundances that we have always had that has set our Nation apart from all others, in our ability to produce and succeed, and that was an abundant supply of energy. 
   In 8 short years, that abundant supply has dwindled to a point where we really have no surpluses at all today. The average demand for growth in energy goes up 1.4 percent in our country on an annualized basis, and we have only increased 
   production by 0.4 percent in the last 8 years--in all segments of energy. That tells you one thing very clearly. Somebody has failed along the way, and I must tell you, serving on the Energy Committee and studying and examining this issue very thoroughly over the last several years, I know who has failed. It is the Clinton-Gore administration. They failed to recognize the reality of the marketplace, the reality of the world production supply, and disallowing us from producing our way out of it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Yes. I do appreciate the majority leader speaking to that. 
   I saw the Senator from California wishing to make a comment on it. I cochair the Adoption Caucus with Senator LANDRIEU. We worked together this year to change the character of the adoption tax credit. 
   We did not get all we wanted--and I know the Senator has been out on the floor speaking of concern about it--but we got a great deal. We went from a $5,000 to a $10,000 tax credit for a normal adoption. But most importantly, we focused our efforts this year on children of special needs, I say to our 
   majority leader. And there we went from a $6,000 to a $12,000 tax credit, and we phased it in more rapidly than we did the normal adoption. 
   But what is important here is the character of the adoptions. For children with special needs, oftentimes their costs up to adoption are less than normal children because the Government fronts a lot of that cost. To parents adopting children of special needs, it comes after the adoption. We tried to characterize this provision a little differently. And we will do that in the coming year. 
   No, we did not get all we wanted. But for any Senator to say it is not good to double the adoption credit on children with special needs, and to phase it in faster than we are doing for the children of normal adoptions, somehow is really not understanding what we are accomplishing. 
   This Senate, in the last 5 years, has taken a quantum leap to allow Americans to form families through adoption and to render tax credits. We did not even recognize it a few years ago. People forming families the normal way could write off the expenses of their pregnancy and the birthing of children, but people spending $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 to adopt a child were on their own. We have said no to that. 
   Truly, for these children of special need, who are oftentimes almost unwanted, we have now said to loving and caring people, we are going to give you a $12,000 tax credit, and we are going to accelerate it. 
   Come on, folks. We ought to be cheering about this for the formation of families through adoption. This is a major step in a loving and caring direction. 
   No, MARY LANDRIEU and LARRY CRAIG did not get everything they wanted, but there is not a Senator on this floor who got everything they wanted this year. But let me tell you, I am voting for this bill on that alone because it shows that this Senate cares about children and about families who want to form through adoption.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator BOND for yielding. 
   I have been listening to the Senator from North Dakota. I have to remind him by quoting his own leader. Here is what his leader said in USA Today on September 8: We will stall the spending bills until we get our way. 
   I suggest to the Senator from North Dakota that he ought to listen to his leader because his leader said it and that is exactly what is going on at this moment. 
   Let me also say to the Senator from North Dakota, after all these spending bills and after this tax cut we are debating, we will pay down the national debt by $700 billion. That is one whale  of an accomplishment. No, it doesn't go to bigger Government. No, it doesn't go to create a new program. It goes to pay down the debt. 
   So between what his own leader has said and the facts of what we are doing, let me remind the Senator from North Dakota, stalling your way through this session has complicated matters. The box canyon that he referred to is a box canyon that his own leader created. 
   From USA Today: Senate Minority Leader DASCHLE, Democrat of South Dakota, has a simple strategy for winning the final negotiations over spending bills: stall, until the Republicans have caved in because they can't wait any longer to recess. 
   That is the reality of where we are. They have stalled their way into a big problem. Now we will work the weekend, if we have to. We have to resolve these issues for the sake of the American people. 
   For just a few moments, let me talk about the tax bill that is before us. I so vividly remember the first Clinton-Gore 
   campaign in 1992, running for election and saying: We will give America a middle-class tax cut. It was the mantra of their campaign. 
   Remember, they said in that banner during the campaign: It is the economy, stupid; we have to make this economy work. And we are going to make it work by giving a middle-class tax cut. 
   Well, let's remember what happened once they were elected. They pushed through the largest tax increase in the history of this country. The new bigger bite on the middle class included a fuel tax, a new tax on Social Security benefits, a hefty variety of small business taxes. And when the new administration nearly pulled off the greatest scheme of all, and that was to nationalize one-sixth of our Nation's economy--that was that great, new health care bureaucracy that became affectionately known across the country as ``Hillary Care'' that was to give every American the opportunity to live inside the greatest HMO of all, a federalized Government health care program--when Americans heard the detail of that, thanks to a few Senators and a few Congressmen on this side of the aisle who stood up hour after hour and went through page after page of what Bill and Hillary Clinton were talking about, Americans rejected that resoundingly. 
   We know what happened. America said things had to change. And they did change in 1995; A Republican Congress was elected. Slowly but surely, we have tried to roll back those massive tax increases. What we have in front of us today is an installment in that effort. At a time of unprecedented surpluses, at a time when we are paying down $700 billion on the debt and that side of the aisle does not want to give a dime back to the American taxpayer, shame on them. But then again, their Presidential candidate says: I need it all because I want to spend it all for all kinds of new Federal programs. That is the reality of what they are dealing with.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, because we have collapsed this time--and I think appropriately so--and several colleagues need to be elsewhere later today, let me close my comments. 
   Now some of our bills have been vetoed. We have yet to return to the American people all the tax increases they suffered as the result of the 1993 hike. But the last five-plus years also have produced a solid record of tax relief and IRS reform, thanks to Republican principles and bipartisan partnerships. Perhaps most important, that record highlights the Democrat and Republican contrasting views of people priorities. 
   Decades of liberal government meant more and more Americans were over-taxed on the one hand, and more and more dependent on ``government programs'' on the other. But a determined Republican Congress has been turning the tide, slowly but surely--even in the face of frequent vetoes and partisan obstruction--because it has believed in its mission of returning power to the people. 
   People are empowered when they can keep most of the fruits of their own labor, and use those resources to provide for families and their future the way they feel is best. People are empowered when the tax laws are a help, not a hindrance, to them choosing and being able to afford a good education, medical care that meets their specific needs, the right balance between work and family, and secure retirement planning. People are empowered when the government--especially the tax collector--respects the dignity and rights of the individual taxpayer. 
   The Republican-majority Congress has been making strong, steady, incremental progress in areas like these. While several major bills have been vetoed, several have become law. Among them: In 1996, Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This law increased health insurance deductions for the self-employed, created new Medical Savings Accounts so folks can set aside money for future needs, made it easier for workers to transfer from one job to another without losing benefits, allowed penalty-free IRA withdrawals for medical expenses, and reduced the cost of long-term health care. 
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 included, among other things, the $500 per-child tax credit, credits and deductions for higher education, expanded IRA limits and the new Roth IRA and the first significant steps in death Tax relief for family-owned farms and small business. 
   The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 finally began shifting the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS, required the IRS to pay court costs more often, provided protection for innocent spouses from IRS collection efforts, and created a new, taxpayer-oriented oversight board. The  Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act of 2000 repealed the ``earnings limit'' on the amount of outside income seniors of retirement age can earn without having their Social Security benefits cut. 
   That's a good record but--we can and should do more. The tax collector should not be the uninvited guest at every wedding and the rude intruder at every funeral. But the Clinton-Gore Administration vetoed bills to repeal the Death Tax and the Marriage Penalty. I promise you, however, those issues will not go away. And now, in the waning hours of the 106th Congress, we are hard at work on wrapping up one more bill to provide tax relief to make health insurance affordable to millions of uninsured Americans, help more with retirement planning, help family farmers and small businesses, and encourage investment in economically depressed areas. In a matter of days it will be up to the President to decide the fate of that bill, with his signature pen or his veto pen. I hope, this time, he chooses power to the people over power to the tax collector. 
   I will conclude by saying this: This very meager tax package in front of us, which has been objected to so strenuously by the other side, is a small step in trying to put money back into the pockets of taxpayers during a time of unprecedented surplus. It is also an opportunity to facilitate; that is, to allow small businesspeople and others who want to provide health care and to provide farmers and ranchers and other people in agriculture the flexibility to do all kinds of positive things. 
   But most importantly, the reason the gnashing of teeth and the wringing of hands has been heard so loudly on the other side of the aisle is they don't want to give any tax cut. They don't want to provide any of that opportunity. They want to spend it all and they want to spend it all in a way that will grow Government and grow it in a way that will reduce our freedoms and, most importantly, deny the American taxpayer what should justifiably be theirs. Once you have balanced the budget and you have a surplus, you ought to give just a little bit of it back--that is, the surplus--to those from which it came. 
   With that, I yield the floor for other allocations of time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, the conference report that includes fiscal year 2001 Commerce-Justice-State appropriations picks up some Senate report language providing up to $900,000 for completion of a Federal Trade Commission investigation into slotting allowances and fair competition in the retail grocery business. 
   I understand that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. BOND] originally requested that language. I would like to engage the Senator from Missouri and the chairman of the subcommittee [Mr. GREGG] in a colloquy simply to clarify the scope and intent of that provision. 
   Because this language is brief, I wanted to make sure it would not be misread to suggest that we are providing these funds for use in any company-specific investigation. 
   It is my understanding that committee's intent is for the FTC to use these funds solely to undertake a general study, collecting comprehensive data on the current competitive environment related to such practices, assessing their impact, and reporting back to Congress on appropriate policy considerations. 
   I am concerned that our current understanding of the practice of slotting fees, as well as the payment of other discounts, fees, and promotional allowances, is still limited. A thorough understanding of industry practices and their effects should inform policymaking.

   Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for clarifying the committee's intent. 
   I want to add my personally strong feeling that it would be inappropriate for the FTC to launch individualized investigations and enforcement actions on the basis of notions about industry practices that are not-fully-informed, before it can sort out what appropriate law and policy should be. Unfocused, premature, or ad hoc actions could be counterproductive, possibly disrupting markets and chilling some positive industry practices that actually benefit consumers. It is important now for the FTC to focus on resolving uncertainties and acquiring a better understanding the facts, law, market practices, and impacts related to these issues.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thought for the next few moments I would speak basically in response to my colleague from Nevada, who is here on the floor. He has taken the floor in the last two evenings to quote rather liberally and at length statements made by Republican Presidential candidate George W. Bush, and of course those statements stand in the RECORD as he has presented them. He quoted them verbatim, saying he believed it was necessary to demonstrate the policy positions of this Presidential candidate. 
   I thought it would be appropriate to lay into the RECORD this evening similar quotes from AL GORE, the Presidential candidate for the Democrat Party, who on many occasions has made a variety of embellishments about certain facts. For the next few moments, I want to take this opportunity to read some of his quotes, which I think is appropriate as a comparative between the two Presidential candidates. 
   I will start with a CNN quote on ``Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer,'' March 9, 1999. Vice President AL GORE, at that time, said:   
   During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.  
   In the New York Times, December 1, 1999, he said:  
   I found a little place in upstate New York called Love Canal. I had the first hearing on that issue and Toone, Tennessee.  
   I assume he meant in Tone, Tennessee.  
   But that was the one that started it all.  
   I think that was the one where we knew the Vice President took credit for discovering Love Canal and acting on it. 
   During a flight on Air Force One, GORE was chatting with reporters. This is what he said:  
   He ..... spent two hours swapping opinions about movies and telling stories about old chums like Eric Segal, who, Gore said, used Al and Tipper as models for the uptight preppy and his free-spirited girlfriend in ``Love story.''  
   That is a quote out of Time magazine, December 15, 1997. 
   This is from the first Presidential debate on October 3, 2000:  
   I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when the fires broke out.  
   Of course, he recanted that the next day, saying he really didn't do that. He was down there on the ground, but not with Mr. Witt, Director of FEMA. 
   Then during the first Presidential debate on October 3, he said:  
   They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.  
   Of course, immediately that school rejected that, saying that was simply not true. The first day of classes, her desk was not available, but the second day it was. 
   On the NBC ``Today Show,'' January 24, 1997, he said:  
   I did not know it was a fundraiser.  
   Of course, we know what he is talking about because then in an FBI deposition transcript on May 23, 1997, he said:  
   I didn't realize it was in a Buddhist temple.  
   Those are actual quotes from a man who wants to be President of the United States. 
   He went on to say this in the Washington Post on September 24, 2000, talking about the Strategic Oil Reserve which was established in 1975, 2 years before AL GORE was elected to Congress:  
   I've been a part of the discussion on the Strategic Oil Reserve since the days when it was first established.  
   In reference to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, he said:  
   I've worked on this for 20 years because, unless we get this one right, nothing else matters.  
   That was on the Al Gore 2000 web site, October 14, 1999. Of course, during his career here in the Senate, Mr. GORE openly opposed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   In reference to the death penalty, Mr. President, candidate GORE has said this:  
   I have always supported it because I think society has a right to make careful judgments about when that ultimate penalty ought to be applied.  
   That was from the Associated Press, November 19, 1999. Senator AL GORE voted against the death penalty for drug kingpins on June 28, 1990, and against the death penalty for terrorists on February 20, 1991. 
   Remember, he said, ``I support it,'' and then he twice voted against it. 
   In reference to the earned-income tax credit, he said:  
   I was the author of that proposal. I wrote that, so I say, welcome aboard. This is something for which I have been a principal proponent for a long time.  
   That was in Time Magazine, November 1, 1999. 
   Carthage Courier, February 21, 1980. AL GORE cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate on August 6, 1993, to raise taxes on Social Security benefits. 
   He said:  
   Social Security Benefits will remain untaxed ..... I sincerely believe that any plan to tax Social Security benefits would place an unforgivable burden on our senior citizens who are currently trying to enjoy their retirement years in the face of ever-increasing prices....... It is totally inconceivable....... It is unfair.  
   Yet, of course, he was the one who cast the tie-breaking vote August 6, 1993. 
   In reference to investing Social Security funds in the stock market, he said:  
   We didn't really propose it. We talked about the idea.  
   See Clinton-Gore fiscal years 2000 and 2001 budget proposals. They not only talked about it; they proposed it in their budget, Mr. President. 
   Here is another interesting quote:  
   Does he (George W. Bush) have the experience to be President? You know he has never put together a budget. The Governor of Texas is by far the weakest chief executive position in America and does not have the responsibility of forming or presenting a budget.  
   Now, if you look at Texas law, section 401.041, it reads:  
   The Governor of Texas is the chief Budget Officer of the State.  
   Also, section 401.406 reads:  
   The Governor shall deliver a copy of the Governor's budget to each member of the legislature not later than the sixth day of each regular legislative session. 
   In reference to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance legislation, he said, ``Unlike Senator Bradley, I was a cosponsor of it.'' 
   That was in the New York Times, November 24, 1999. 
   Cosponsor? I didn't know that Vice Presidents could become cosponsors of legislation. But be that as it may, that is what he said. 
   Here is another quote; The American Prospect, June 5, 2000.  
   One-hundred and sixty-three bills for free or reduced-cost TV have been introduced in Congress since 1960.  
   Here is what the Vice President said about it:  
   Some of you may know that I don't come new to this issue; I introduced the very first free TV legislation in the Senate, exactly nine years ago this past Saturday, October 18, 1998.  
   Interestingly enough, the first bills were introduced in 1960. 
   Again, another mistake by our Vice President from the Columbia Journal Review, January 1993:  
   In an interview published last Sunday by the Des Moines Register, Gore was quoted as saying he ``got a bunch of people indicted and sent to jail'' while working as a reporter for the Tennessean in the 1970s.  
   Two people were indicted for alleged corruption during the same period AL GORE covered the Nashville Metro Council. Neither of the two were imprisoned.  
   I carried an M-16 ..... I pulled my turn on the perimeter at night and walked through the elephant grass, and I was fired upon.  
   Los Angeles Times, October 15, 1999. 
   According to witnesses, AL GORE was a reporter who never saw combat and was kept out of harm's way. 
   A speech to the New England Business Council, November 30, 1999: 
   ``I was a home builder after I came back from Vietnam..... I know a good bit about how to make money that way''--meaning home building--``to build this country is a great thing.'' 
   Tanglewood Homebuilders was a Gore family corporation. The contractor said AL GORE visited the construction site once or twice.  
   I live on a farm today. I have my heart in my own farm.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota has just left the floor. I was off the floor for a few moments, but I know he talked about the Presidential campaign and the proposal by the Governor from Texas to reform Social Security, especially for the young people of our country as it relates to their future participation in it and the amount of money they will ultimately pay into it versus that which they get out. 
   I thought I would come to the floor for a few moments to share with the Senate several experiences I have had over the last couple of years dealing with Social Security. About a year ago, I did a series of town meetings across my State called senior-to-senior. I invited high school seniors and senior citizens to come together in the same place to talk about Social Security. 
   Every time you go to a high school, one of the top two or three questions asked is about Social Security. Now, my guess is that the average American would not believe a senior in high school would be that interested in Social Security. But they have probably heard their mom or dad saying you really ought to not plan on Social Security; it is certainly not going to be there when you get to be your grandparents' age. That has been a fairly standard refrain across America for the last decade. Why? Why would parents of today suggest to their young people not to expect to get a Social Security benefit? 
   Largely because they have been told it would go bankrupt, that it would create so much liability that it could never pay for itself. 
   What I think they failed to recognize is that since the Social Security reforms of the mid-1980s, Social Security has been building a reserve trust fund and we are taking in more than we are paying out. But sometime in the near future--sometime in the future of the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from North Dakota--when we get to be Social Security age along with other baby boomers, there is going to be a peak of Social Security liability, or Social Security obligation. It will be some $7 trillion-plus. That is a fact. We know that. 
   But we also know that the seniors of today and immediately tomorrow, at least for the next decade or two, are well protected because of the reforms we made in that system in the mid-1980s and the very dramatic tax increases that workers and employers have paid since that time. Social Security is strong today. But we didn't do it by cutting benefits very much, we did it by dramatically raising taxes on the working men and women of this country. 
   If you want to keep this cycle up, if you do not want to make it self-supporting, and if you do not want it to yield what the other annuities and private annuities are yielding, then you keep it up and you say to the young people: You are going to pay in hundreds of thousands of dollars of your wages in taxes, and for every dollar you put in during your lifetime, you are going to get only three quarters back. 
   Is that being very honest with the young people of America today? They are going to work all of their lives and put all of their money in, and they are going to be taxed at an even higher rate. And in return, even the likelihood of getting back a 5-, 4-, or 3-percent return just isn't going to be there. 
   Yet you can say to them: If you invest in private investment funds, the average return over the last 100 years invested in the industry of this country is about a 10-percent analyzed rate. 
   Young people aren't dumb. They are pretty darned bright. With today's Internet and their ability to calculate, to communicate, and to invest independently, they pretty well understand that what their parents are telling them has some truth, makes some sense. 
   Social Security may be there. But it is not a very good investment unless you are paying for your parents' retirement--or, should I say ``enhanced income,'' because your parents paid for your grandparents. The only problem is that every senior in high school today can expect a 20-percent increase in their taxes over what their parents are paying today, when they get to be their parents' age, to fund the current Social Security system. 
   That is why Social Security has become a debate issue in this Presidential campaign. And it darned well should be. No responsible Presidential candidate is going to stand out there and say all is well. It is well for the immediate future--for the next decade or two. But for young people today to invest in this system without significant reform in it is not only bad policy, it is bad politics. 
   But I hope we reside on the side of good policy and ultimately good politics. It tends to go hand in hand. 
   It has been fascinating for me to watch the debate between Governor Bush and Vice President GORE, with GORE saying Bush is going to bankrupt Social Security and Bush suggesting that what GORE might do would simply increase the system's liability and increase the debt burden on future citizens. Where does the balance lie? 
   I really believe it is time for this Senate and this Government to investigate the opportunity to take a small piece of Social Security taxes and allow taxpayers to invest them in what we call personal savings accounts. 
   I always notice when the Senator from North Dakota or others talk about this issue, they only talk about investments in the stock market. But that is not Governor Bush's proposal. It was Bill Clinton who said invest it in the stock market. 
   What Governor Bush has consistently said for the last month is personal accounts invested somewhat like the Federal retirees have--like the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Idaho have, which means they don't invest their individual accounts in individual stocks. They have categories of investment that are high risk, moderate risk, and low risk. Yes, some of that money is invested in the stock market, because that is where you invest money--you invest it in the economy of this country--but some is also invested in private and government bonds and other less risky investments. 
   We all know the demographics. We will soon have a record number of seniors in this country. What we are suggesting is that, as we shift back and forth, as older people get older and younger people move into the system, that over the next few decades we transform the system; we adjust it. Over that period of time, we can create less dependency on the American taxpayer and as future retirees--if we adjust it properly--increasingly rely on their individualized account. That makes awfully good sense.  
   Here is what doesn't make good sense to me. When Vice President began to talk about his Social Security proposals--increasing benefits for widows, and increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents by attributing earnings to them while they stay at home--oh, did that sound like good politics in an election year. My guess is it is pretty good politics in an election year. But the question is, Is it good policy for the Social Security system? Does it keep Social Security stable? Does it keep it well funded? Or down the road does Mr. GORE--if he becomes President and long after he has left--create such a liability that the person who will be serving here from Idaho long after I am gone has to say to the young people and wage earners of this country that we are either going to have to cut your benefits or raise your taxes? My guess is that is exactly what is going to happen. Let me for a few moments suggest why. 
   Everybody wants to help moms and widows, especially during election years. But, Mr. President, let me suggest to you that Social Security is the wrong tool for that job. 
   The Gore Social Security surplus scheme would fail to provide meaningful assistance to the people they are targeting to aid. Worse, it would increase the Social Security's unfunded liability by almost a third; reduce Social Security trust fund balances by hundreds of billions of dollars; and simply accelerate the cash-flow problem in which Social Security will find itself in the near decades if we don't make reasonable reforms. 
   Social Security is one of the few Federal programs that already takes stay-at-home parents into account. In the current system, married spouses generally receive about the same Social Security benefits regardless of whether they worked full time, part time, or took a break in child rearing and did not work at all. 
   For example, in 1996, women who received Social Security benefits based upon their own work record received an average of $675 in benefits while women whose benefits were based on their husbands' work record received $569. What I am saying is women who stayed at home received almost the same benefit. 
   Let's remember that Social Security is not designed to be the sole source of retirement income. It was designed to be supplemental income, and it should be understood to be just that. Nevertheless, for many seniors, Social Security is their sole source of income. For those seniors, our first priority should be to ensure we don't further endanger the program by adding additional obligations on top of the ones we already cannot afford. 
   If the Vice President wants to help mothers, why didn't he embrace the tax relief the Senate Marriage Tax Relief Act would have provided? That would have been immediate relief. Instead, his proposal takes a program already under financial stress, and it would put it, in my estimation, at substantially greater financial risk. 
   What does it cost? Everybody has seen what the Vice President has proposed for Social Security. And yet, while the short-term cost of Governor Bush's proposal has been discussed--there has been a trillion dollar figure floated around--Nobody wants to talk about what the Vice President's plan will cost. 
   This is what we believe and this is what others believe the Vice President's plan will cost. The Vice President said it would just cost a few billion over the next 10 years. While the Social Security Administration has not estimated the motherhood proposal, economist Henry Aaron offered a seat-of-your-pants estimate in Slate Magazine of about 0.25 percent of taxable wages. That is about $150 billion over the next 10 years. Meanwhile, Vice President's GORE's proposal to increase widow's benefits would constitute about 0.32 percent of taxable wages, according to the report of the 1994 through 1996 Advisory Council on Social Security, Volume 1: ``Findings and Recommendations.'' That translated into about $166 billion over the next 10 years. 
   Now the Vice President has put a limit on his benefits so it would cost maybe a little bit less than that. The bottom line is, if you spread this concept out over the lifetime of the beneficiary, we truly are talking about these proposals costing trillions of dollars. He doesn't propose to raise taxes. He proposes a finance scheme which simply advances the liability and expands the liability into future generations. 
   If you are going to raise benefits in Social Security, at least have the political integrity to propose a tax increase to offset the benefits so you don't stress out the trust funds beyond where they currently are and you don't create outyear liabilities. 
   But then again, how could you be all things to all people and propose this great benefit, if on the backside you looked the worker in the eye and said, ``And now you are going to have to pay for it''? 
   So, once again, it is a Ponzi scheme. We shift a little around and we move a little over here. Now, the Governor from Texas has different approach. He clearly recognizes that by setting aside a couple of percentage points and allowing them to be invested within a fixed universe of investments, that we begin to build for the future of Social Security by compounding our investment income instead of compounding our liabilities and our debts by adding to the benefit structure. 
   If we are going to improve the condition of widows and spouses, let's do it in a way that is realistic and honest. If we want to use Social Security as that vehicle, then at least provide a revenue flow that effectively justifies those benefits in the outyears, the several hundreds of billions of dollars that ultimately the motherhood proposal and the proposal that relates to widow's benefits would cost. That is what we ought to be talking about. That is the fair way to do it. 
   The amount of new liabilities required under the Vice President's proposal is truly staggering. Some economists have suggested it is in the trillions of dollars. A trillion here, a trillion there adds up to be real money. In the past, those involved in public policy--and, more importantly, those involved in the electorial process--said that Social Security is off limits unless you are willing to increase benefits. Don't talk about new taxes, only add to the benefit structure. 
   Thank goodness, a few years ago Congress stopped that. We reformed Social Security, and we said we are going to leave it alone. 
   As a result, we stabilized it. We made the tough votes in the 
   mid-1980s. We raised the taxes dramatically on the working men and women of this country--but we stabilized the system. So today, I say don't add benefits to that system unless you are clearly willing to offset those benefits by revenue flows. 
   The Governor is talking about an idea, a concept that he would work with the Congress of the United States. Recognizing we are in historic surpluses at this moment, there is a unique opportunity to reform the Social Security system so we can go to the young men and women entering the workforce in this country and say, in your lifetime, your Social Security annuity will amount to something very significant instead of getting back just three quarters for every $1 you pay in. 
   For my parents, Social Security has been a tremendous benefit. For their parents, it was a windfall. For me, it will be about a break even for the amount of money I have invested my lifetime. For my children, unless we reform it as the Governor from Texas has proposed, it will be one very bad investment. I don't want to ask that of my children. Certainly the Senator from North Dakota and I are better thinkers than that. We ought to be able to come together to devise a system that doesn't create outyear liabilities of the kind the Vice President is proposing. 
   Those are the real issues. Sure, it is worthy of a Presidential debate. That is where it ought to be debated. Clearly, the facts and figures ought to be well established. At the same time, I am pleased there is a candidate out there who isn't willing to live in the shell of the past and the concept of a system that was crafted way back in the 1930s, under a Bismarckian plan that simply said it is going to work because you will never live out its benefit cycle. Thank goodness my parents will live it out. People are living longer. 
   Because of the demographics of this country today, it is critically important that the Congress develop the political will to reform Social Security,  to establish personal savings accounts underneath a governing body to ensure sound investments and the security of the system. That makes good sense to me. And it sounds, by the numbers out there, it is making even better sense to Americans. 
   I want my children to have a strong Social Security supplemental income system for them so they receive a healthy return instead of a three quarters for the dollar. That makes good sense. They can do it in the private sector. Why aren't we smart enough to design a plan so we can do it in the public sector? 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. I know proper procedure, Mr. President, is to ask the question, but it is important to suggest this Senator did not say Social Security does not work. Quite the opposite. I believe it has worked. 
   What I talked about today is who pays for it because what the Senator from North Dakota is suggesting, I think--and I agree with him, the tremendous benefit that has come, but he has also seen the doubling and the quadrupling of taxes on the working people to pay for that benefit. 
   I suggest this to the Senator from North Dakota. I think it is important. CBO has just scored the Gore transfers within his plan. They have suggested those transfers are around $40 trillion over the next 54 years. If that is true, 40 trillion bucks would have to flow out of other sources, such as the general fund, because we know the Vice President is not talking about a tax increase. The question is, How do you handle it? Do you create higher Government debt? Do you do direct investments? The Senate voted 99-0 against Government investments. 
   So the legitimate question in this debate is not whether Social Security has successfully benefitted current and past retirees. The Senator from North Dakota and I just flat agree that it has. Senator DORGAN and I know of too many cases of individual citizens who find that Social Security is almost their sole source of income. Thank goodness it is there. I am talking about is the growing tax burden on our children. We are imposing a 20-percent payroll tax liability on the young working men and women in this country and we have to be extremely cautious.

   Mr. CRAIG. For 1 minute only. 
   The Vice President starts the benefit, accrues the debt into the trust fund, and then you have an increased debt over in the trust fund of Social Security. An increased debt because the new benefits are going out. 
   On the other hand, I believe Governor Bush is proposing the following: He will take $1 trillion out of a $2.4 trillion surplus to create these personal accounts. It is not current money to pay for current programs. No. No. The Senator from North Dakota and I agree that under current law, and under current benefit rates, Social Security is building a trust fund surplus that will peak at $2.4 trillion. 
   Therein lies the difference. Those are the facts. The Gore plan is a Ponzi scheme, Mr. President. It is a Ponzi scheme.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, one of my top priorities this Congress has been to improve the process by which our Nation's non-federal hydroelectric projects are relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Over the next 15 years, over half of all non-federal hydroelectric capacity (nearly 29,000 MW of power) must go through a relicensing process that takes too long and results in a significant loss of domestic hydropower generation. Oversight and legislative hearings before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee this Congress have established a solid record of the problem and the need for a legislative solution. I want to commend the Chairman of the Water and Power Subcommittee, Senator SMITH, for his dedication to this issue and for working with me to seek a bipartisan, legislative solution to the licensing problem. I look forward to working with all my colleagues to pass this legislation in the next Congress.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I note that the bill allocates approximately $100 million to HUD to fund its lead abatement program. In a number of areas around the country some of our children are still at increased risk of exposure to high levels of lead, which can lead to development problems. 
   The bill further provides that from this account, HUD will provide financial assistance to the Clear Corps lead abatement and education network administered by the University of Maryland at Baltimore. This assistance is set at $1 million. 
   Clear Corps is a public-private partnership which organizes and manages cleanup and education affiliates around the country in close cooperation with local organizations and government. Significant resources are provided to this program by various companies in the paint industry, and by the National Paint and Coatings Association. 
   Based on reports I have seen, it has proven highly efficient and cost effective. At my invitation, Clear Corps representatives visited Northern Idaho to meet with officials of several private and public organizations, including U.S. EPA, to determine if an affiliate arrangement might prove helpful in addressing the lead exposure issue in that area. While significant progress has been made, there remain pockets where further testing, cleanup (particularly inside some older houses), and focused education could reap large rewards in the near future. It appears that with its growing national network and in-depth experience in providing cost effective solutions, my state and its children would benefit from such a project. Clear Corps is currently evaluating the resources which might be required to establish a new site in Idaho. It is my hope, Mr. Chairman, that we are able to at least begin to establish this program this year in Northern Idaho. Next year, I hope to work with the Chairman and the other members of the VA-HUD Subcommittee to review the Clear Corps approach with a view towards increasing the federal share of its resources. We need to see more of creative and cost effective approaches to issues such as reducing lead exposure of children. Public-private ventures to address such issues make a lot of sense.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator DASCHLE to introduce the Harmful Non-native Weed Control Act of 2000--to provide assistance to eligible weed management entities to control or eradicate harmful, non-native weeds on public and private land. I am pleased that Senators BAUCUS, BURNS, CRAPO, JOHNSON, and GORDON SMITH, are joining us as original cosponsors. 
   Currently, noxious weeds are a dangerous threat to the viability of both public and private lands across the country. Over a century ago, a wave of noxious weeds entered North America from Europe and Asia. Unlike native species, which have natural predators and control mechanisms, these weeds lack native insects, fungi, or diseases to control their growth and takeover of native plants. 
   Noxious weeds are estimated to spread at the rate of 4,600 acres per day on federal lands alone in the Western United States. Idaho's own rush skeltonweed has increased from a few plants in 1954 to roughly 4 million acres today. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year by Western states to prevent and stop the growth of noxious weeds. 
   These nonnative weeds threaten fully two-thirds of all endangered species and are now considered by some experts to be the second most important threat to biodiversity. In some areas, spotted knapweed grows so thick that big game like deer will move out of the area to find edible plants. Noxious weeds also increase soil erosion, and prevent recreationists from accessing land that is infested with poisonous plants. Bikers are often met with a formidable foe when 2-inch-long thorns pop their tires on bike paths overrun with puncture vine that can pierce all but the most rugged materials. 
   In response to this environmental crisis, I have worked with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Public Lands Council, and the Nature Conservancy to develop the Harmful Non-Native Weed Control Act of 2000. This legislature will provide a mechanism to get funding to the local level where weeds can be fought in a collaborative way. Working together is what this entire initiative is about. 
   Specifically, this bill establishes, in the Office of the Secretary of the Interior, a program to provide assistance through States to eligible weed management entities. The Secretary of the Interior appoints an Advisory Committee of ten individuals to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding the annual allocation of funds. The Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Committee, will allocate funds to States to provide funding to eligible weed management entities to carry out projects approved by States to control or eradicate harmful, non-native weeds on public and private lands. Funds will be allocated based on several factors, including but not limited to: the seriousness of the problem in the State; the extent to which the Federal funds will be used to leverage non-Federal funds to address the problem; and the extent to which the State has already made progress in addressing the problems. 
   The bill directs that the States use 25 percent of their allocation to make base payments and 75 percent for financial awards to eligible weed management entities for carrying out projects relating to the control or eradication of harmful, non-native weeds on public or private 
   lands. To be eligible to obtain a base payment a weed management entity must be established by local stakeholders for weed management or public education purposes, provide the State a description of their purpose and proposed projects, and fulfill any other requirements set by the State. Weed management entities are also eligible for financial awards which are funds awarded by the State on a competitive basis to carry out projects which cannot be funded within the base payment. Projects will be evaluated, giving equal consideration to economic and natural values, and selected for funding based on factors such as the seriousness of the problem, the likelihood that the project will address the problem, and how comprehensive the project's approach is to the harmful, non-native weed problem within the State. A 50 percent non-Federal match is required to receive the funds. 
   The Department of Agriculture in Idaho (ISDA) has developed a Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds through a collaborative effort involving private landowners, State and Federal land managers, State and local governmental entities, and other interested parties. Cooperative Weed Management Areas (CWMAs) are the centerpiece of the strategic plan. CWMAs cross jurisdictional boundaries to bring together all landowners, land managers, and interested parties to identify and prioritize noxious weed strategies within the CWMA in a collaborative manner. The primary responsibilities of the ISDA are to provide coordination, administrative support, facilitation, and project cost-share funding for this collaborative effort. Idaho already has a record of working in a collaborative way on this issue--my legislation will heighten the progress we've had, and establish the same formula for success in other States. 
   We are introducing this legislation today to get the discussion started. We hope to refine the bill over the winter and introduce an improved bill next year. Constructive suggestions are welcome and we look forward to working with other Members of Congress to get this bill passed next year. Noxious weeds are not only a problem for farmers and ranchers, but a hazard to our environment, economy, and communities in Idaho and the West. The Harmful Nonnative Weeds Act of 2000 is an important step to ensure we are diligent in stopping the spread of these weeds. I am confident that if we work together at all levels of government and throughout our communities, we can protect our land, livelihood, and environment.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first I would like to thank Chairman COCHRAN and Senator KOHL for the hard work they have put into the Fiscal Year 2001 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. It is a challenging process, and they have done an excellent job balancing competing interests within the confines of a balanced budget. 
   I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee regarding the funding for the National Rural Development Partnership (NRDP) and state rural development councils (SRDCs). As you may be aware, NRDP and SRDCs have always depended on allocations of discretionary funds from USDA and four other federal agencies. They have never had a stable and predictable source of funds. 
   Earlier this year, the Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and Rural Revitalization, which I chair, held an oversight hearing on the operations and accomplishments of the NRDP and SRDCs. The Subcommittee heard from a number of witnesses, including officials of the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Transportation, and Health & Human Services, state agencies, and private sector representatives. The hearing established the need for some legislative foundation and consistent funding. I was recently joined by 27 Senators in introducing legislation to accomplish this. 
   The legislation formally recognizes the existence and operations of the Partnership, the National Rural Development Council (NRDP) and SRDCs. In addition, the legislation gives specific responsibilities to each component of the Partnership and authorizes it to receive Federal appropriations. 
   This legislation was not passed in time for the FY2001 appropriations process, so funding is necessary to keep the program viable until the legislation can be passed. Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that there is no funding earmarked or specified within the Agriculture Appropriations conference report for this program. However, the Secretary has made discretionary funds available for this program in the past and it is my hope he would continue to do so, and that we can encourage him in this regard, until freestanding legislation can be passed.

First I would like to thank Chairman COCHRAN and Senator KOHL for the hard work they have put into the Fiscal Year 2001 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. It is a challenging process, and they have done an excellent job balancing competing interests. While I don't agree with everything in this bill, I believe this bill provides vital funding for several programs in my state and across the nation. 
   This conference report includes much needed emergency spending to deal with the fires and drought in the West. As you all know, the West was hit hard this year by wild fires. In Idaho alone over 1.2 million acres were burned. I visited a ranch where, within a couple of hours time period, a fire had destroyed the rancher's business. Of this rancher's 800 head of cattle, close to 600 were killed or had to be destroyed because they were so badly burned. I think this is an emergency, and it is only right that Congress provide funding to assist producers who have been impacted by such a natural disaster. That is why I support the livestock indemnity payments included in this conference report. Ranchers that were lucky enough to get their cattle out of the fires path are now searching for feed for their cattle and are working to rehabilitate the pastures that were destroyed. This conference report helps them by providing livestock feed assistance, as well as Emergency Conservation, Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations and Pasture Recovery Program funding to help defray the costs of rehabilitating the pasture lands. I also support this. 
   However, I do not believe that all of the spending called emergency in the conference report is really emergency. I am disappointed to see the size of the emergency spending as well as some of the authorizing contained in this conference report. This and some of the other bills represent a bad omen for the future. We need to have a realistic budget resolution every year and we need to enforce it. We need fiscal discipline to maintain an adequate surplus. We will need that surplus to protect and modernize Social Security, to save and reform Medicare, to meet high priorities we know will be there in defense and other areas, and to provide some relief to the most heavily taxed generation in American history. 
   The bills we are considering at the end of session do not represent a disaster but they are a bad start in terms of planning for our future. I am not pointing fingers. I think our current process is not responding well to the new idea of surpluses. But we need to start now to do a better job. 
   I am also concerned with some of the legislative provisions contained in this bill. I do not support a rollback of welfare reform, and I am concerned that some of the provisions contained in this conference report are a start at doing just that. While I am strongly opposed to these provisions, this bill contains many things that benefit my state as well as help that is sorely needed. On balance, I have been forced to conclude that I cannot, in good conscious vote against this bill even though I do not agree with each and every item included in this conference report. 
   I hope the Senate passes this bill today and the President signs it into law. However, I hope that we will reform the process so next year we are not in the same situation we find ourselves in today.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important legislation designed to correct a fundamental flaw within the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) dispute resolution mechanism, known as Chapter 19. As many of my colleagues are aware, Chapter 19 has revealed itself to be unacceptable in its current form. The Integrity of the U.S. Courts Act, that I introduce today with my colleague Mr. BAUCUS, is necessary to make certain bilateral dispute resolution decisions from the NAFTA are made pursuant to U.S. trade laws. 
   At present, antidumping and countervailing duty determinations made by NAFTA members are appealed to ad hoc panels of private individuals, instead of impartial courts created under national constitutions. These panels are supposed to apply the same standard of review as a U.S. court in order to determine whether a decision is supported by substantial evidence on the agency record, and is otherwise in accordance with the law. This standard requires that the agency's factual findings and legal interpretations be given significant deference. Unfortunately, in spite of the panels's mandate, they all too often depart from their directive and fail to ensure that the correct standard of review is applied. 
   The Integrity of the U.S. Courts Act would permit any party to a NAFTA dispute involving a U.S. agency decision to remove appellate jurisdiction from the Extraordinary Challenge Committees (ECC) to the U.S. Court of International Trade. Doing so would resolve some of the constitutional issues raised by the Chapter 19 system, expedite resolution of cases, and ensure conformity with U.S. law. 
   The infirmities of Chapter 19 are real, and have been problematic from the beginning. The Justice Department, the Senate Finance Committee, and other authorities are on record of having expressed serious concern about giving private panelists--sometimes a majority of whom are foreign nationals--the authority to issue decisions about U.S. domestic law that have the binding force of law. These appointed panelists, coming from different legal and cultural disciplines and serving on an ad hoc basis, do not necessarily have the interest that unbiased U.S. courts have in maintaining the efficacy of the laws, as Congress wrote them. 
   One of the most egregious examples of the flaws of Chapter 19 is reflected in a case from early in this process, reviewing a countervailing duty finding that Canadian lumber imports benefits from enormous subsidies. Three Canadian panelists outvoted two leading U.S. legal experts to eliminate the countervailing duty based on patently erroneous interpretations of U.S. law--interpretations that Congress had expressly rejected only months before. Two of the Canadian panelists served despite undisclosed conflicts of interest. The matter was then argued before a Chapter 19 appeals committee, and the two committee members outvoted the one U.S. member to once again insulate the Canadian subsidies from U.S. law.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of my subcommittee for yielding. 
   I say to the Senator from California, her amendment is a perfect example of no good deed goes unpunished. I say that to the Senator from California for this very simple reason. 
   This language has been worked out with all of the parties, and all of the staffs, with the administration, and with the EPA. While they do not like it, they understand their science, and where they are does not justify, at this time, the kind of regulation they are attempting to bring down. 
   From the State of the Senator from California, let me read from the Indian Wells Valley Water District. This is a water district of 10 to 12 wells, wells that, meeting the current standard proposed by EPA, would cost this water district $1 million per year--a 60- to 70-percent cost increase in their operations. 
   What happens when Government goes silly or crazy based on science they  have not substantiated, in highly mineralized areas, where arsenic is present in water supplies, is that they drive up costs, and ultimately they collapse these little water districts and everybody goes out and drills their own wells to supply their own household water and then an even greater problem exists. 
   We are talking about cost per speculative cancer case--cost per speculative cancer case. 
   If the amendment of the Senator from California prevails, that cost per speculative cancer case goes to $5 million per speculative case. 
   I do not think that is good policy. I know the science isn't there yet to justify it because the word ``speculative'' is the word EPA uses in suggesting these dramatic reductions in arsenic levels. 
   I do not want to destroy rural water systems. Neither does this subcommittee. My colleague from Idaho spoke very clearly about the real live impact if this amendment were to prevail. Across this country, small independent water districts cannot nor could not comply without a cost of several hundred dollars more per month added to the cost of a water bill. 
   This is not good policy. I do not even think it is good politics. 
   Let me repeat: No good deed will go unpunished according to this amendment because we have been working collectively together to solve this problem, recognizing the phenomenal importance of the water quality to all citizens in this country. 
   Energy and Water, as an authorizing committee, has acted responsibly. While the ranking member might suggest that staff or they were not consulted, that is simply not true. They were thoroughly involved and consulted on this issue. This is a compromise. It does not shut down the process, as has clearly been spoken to by my colleague from Idaho, Senator CRAPO. So I hope the Senate will recognize that. 
   Let us not rush to judgment, nor let us not get into the speculative business of driving up costs of water and, therefore, allowing people to go out and drill their own wells and even create a more dangerous water structure for small rural communities.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this Congress has taken a historic step to advance the process of self-determination of the American citizens of Puerto Rico by approving an appropriation of $2.5 million as requested by the President for a grant to the Elections Commission of Puerto Rico to be used for voter education and a choice among the island's future status options. As an advocate of that process and the need to resolve the island's political status after 102 years, I am pleased that we have acted. 
   This is historic because it represents the first authorization from Congress for the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to choose the ultimate political status for their island. Presidents since Truman have been seeking such an authorization and each house has passed similar language in the past, but the same language has never passed both houses and been enacted into law. Our approval of this appropriation should be read as Congress' determination to resolve the century-long question of the island's ultimate status and let Puerto Rican Americans choose a fully democratic governing arrangement if they wish to replace the current territorial status. 
   By adopting this provision as part of the unanticipated needs account of the Office of the President, it is Congress' intention that its support for a future vote in Puerto Rico be coordinated with the Administration's efforts to provide realistic options to be included on the ballot in the island's next referendum. In recent months the President has brought Puerto Rico's major political parties together in an unprecedented effort to define the available political status options. Our approval of the $2.5 million request evidences our expectation that the White House will provide realist options upon which to base a future status referendum. It can only responsibly allocate the funds for the consideration of options that are realistic. 
   Mr. President, the ultimate resolution of Puerto Rico's political status will require that Congress and the American citizens of Puerto Rico work together to make a choice based on clearly defined status options that are consistent with the U.S. Constitution. The action we have taken is a major contribution towards that goal.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a couple of moments on an issue that I know is important to many of us and has been addressed by both myself and the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee who has now joined us on the floor, Senator Frank MURKOWSKI of Alaska. 
   Last night, the Vice President stated his belief that global warming is caused by fossil fuel use. The Senator from Alaska and I have both introduced legislation to deal with the question of climate change and global warming. We have looked at this issue extensively over the last several years, and through the eyes of the committee by a resolution, expressed on the floor of the Senate, as it related to the Kyoto Protocol. 
   With all of that, the Vice President said one thing last night. Governor Bush said he was not certain that climate change was a direct result of fossil fuel use. In fact, he said, science would govern environmental decisionmaking in his administration, and he did not believe that science had yet fully resolved that fossil fuel use and the creation of greenhouse gases was, in fact, creating climate change. 
   I happen to agree with the Vice President. I say that because the scientists we have had before us may generally agree that our globe is gaining some heat, with some temperature change, but they do not yet agree that fossil fuel usage and the aftereffects, the greenhouse gases, are in fact the sole cause or are they causing climate change? 
   Which opinion is more supported by the scientists themselves? On Monday, the Washington Post reported, in unusual detail, a new theory of global warming that is being advanced by scientists from Denmark to UCLA. It goes like this: 
   First of all, they say, charged particles from space, better known as cosmic rays, cause cloud formation by changing atmospheric molecules with neutral charges into charged ions. The charged ions cluster, forming dense, low clouds. 
   Now, this may sound like a scientific lecture, but this was the kind of detail that the Washington Post was giving in this article. 
   They said, secondly, the Sun's magnetic field deflects much of the cosmic rays away from the Earth, reducing their ability to trigger cloud formation. 
   With less cloud cover to shade the Earth, the Earth gets warmer. 
   That seems like pretty reasonable logic, doesn't it? 
   It turns out that satellite data over the last 20 years reveal an uncanny correlation between changes in the Sun's magnetic field and cloud cover. Meanwhile, Greenland ice-cores show that cosmic rays have declined over the past century. 
   James Hensen of NASA, once a leading proponent of the human cause theory that the Vice President embraces to the exclusion of all others, now acknowledges in the Post that the Sun has probably been a significant contributor in past climate change. But Hensen would still like to see some convincing evidence. Hensen, by the way, has also published recent work suggesting that methane gases, many of which are emitted naturally, may be as large a contributor to climate change as CO  
   2. 
   How can we find out what is right? Here is what the Post reports: 
   A consortium of more than fifty scientists have petitioned CERN, the European particle physics facility in Geneva, to conduct an experiment that could help settle this theory, this argument, this general issue, as reported by the Washington Post.  
   The researchers want to use one of CERN's particle beams as a source of artificial cosmic rays that would strike a ``cloud chamber'' containing the equivalent of air in the lower atmosphere. If there is a clear link between cosmic rays and cloud formation, the experience should reveal it.  
   The scientists proposing the experiment say:  
   If this link is confirmed, the consequent global warming could be comparable to that presently attributed to greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels.  
   In other words, what the scientists are saying is, if this theory and this test were proven accurate, then cosmic rays and their influence in the atmosphere and the formation of clouds could have equal or greater influence over the Earth's atmosphere and climate change or global warming. 
   How can we in the Senate use this information? If this experiment indicates that changes in solar magnetic fields account for all of the detected warming, then burning fossil fuel might account for none of it. Interrupting our  economic growth by arbitrarily curtailing energy use either by taxing it or regulating it could be a far costlier experiment than the one these scientists have proposed at CERN. And because the human cause/effect is so weak and so few countries are likely to join our self-destructive experiment, useful scientific results may never materialize. 
   Let's do the real science, and do it now. In other words, I believe Gov. George Bush was right last night when he said, I believe there is a field of science we ought to understand and err on before we send this country down the road. He said his administration would make decisions on climate change based on science, not the politics or the popularity of the politics of the day. 
   Let's make science drive the issue. Science has to drive public policy in this area, not vice versa. We dare not let public policy drive science. 
   Meanwhile, let us hold off on dangerous experiments such as Kyoto that place our economy at risk in an attempt to prove one man right in the face of so much doubt. Truly, the kind of taxation the Vice President proposes and proposed but wouldn't own up to last night could certainly turn our economy into a recession and disadvantage our producers against other producers around the world. 
   In other words, what the Washington Post reported in great detail in an article well over a half a page long, on Monday, was exactly what Governor Bush was saying last night. 
   Mr. Vice President, the jury is still out. And the jury is scientists all over the world who have not yet confirmed, nor do they agree, that fossil fuels are the sole cause of a climate growing warmer. 
   Let's err on the side of science and not politics as we make these decisions.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Environment and Public Works Committee's substitute to H.R. 3671, the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000. 
   Chairman YOUNG and others did a tremendous amount of investigative and legislative work to get us to this point, and I want to thank them for all of their efforts. Their original bill passed the House with tremendous bi-partisan approval, garnering just two ``no'' votes. 
   Senator CRAPO and I took the House bill and strengthened it by providing a sensible level for grants for projects that affect more than one state and strengthening the provision to ensure states use a reasonable portion of the Pittman-Robertson money to provide hunter education programs. It was introduced as S. 2609 and garnered 14 cosponsors. 
   Senators SMITH, CRAPO, BAUCUS, and BOXER worked hard on Senate legislation that everyone can agree on. I appreciate their dedication to that work, and we have produced an excellent product that will bring accountability to a program that represents one-third of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's budget, ensure the hunting and fishing community that the money they pay in excise taxes is being used for its intended purpose, and that the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson programs will continue to be this nation's premier wildlife and fisheries conservation programs. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this substitute, and I encourage the President of the United States to sign this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my attention was drawn this morning to an article in the Washington Times where our Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, defends energy policy by saying something that I found fascinating, to the point of absurdity. He says, ``We are not in an energy crisis.'' 
   I am not quite sure how Mr. Richardson defines ``crisis,'' but I do know Mr. Richardson has recognized, at least for 12 months, a problem. Am I to understand that the reason for the absence of an energy policy in the Clinton administration is that we recognize a problem, but we are not going to do anything about it until it becomes a crisis? 
   Home heating oil last year, in the Northeast, began at 80 cents to 90 cents a gallon. It went to nearly $2 before that season was over. It was contracted this summer at $1.19, and it is now selling at $1.40. I call that a crisis if I am low income and I want a warm home this winter. I call it a crisis if I want to travel cross-country and I can't afford to fill my gas tank. I call it a crisis if I am a trucker and I can't up my contracts to absorb my fuel or energy costs and I must turn my truck back in, as thousands are now doing--turning their trucks back in on the lease programs under which they acquired them when they planned to move the commerce of America across this country. 
   Mr. Secretary, earlier this year, you flew numerous times to the Middle East with a tin cup in hand, begging the sheiks of the OPEC nations to turn the valve on just a little bit and let out a little more oil, hopefully dropping the price of crude and therefore lowering the cost at the pump. For a moment in time it worked. Then the price started ratcheting up as the markets began to understand that what had happened was pretty much artificial and pretty much rhetorical in nature and that, in fact, the supplies had not increased to offset the demand. 
   While all of that was going on, underneath the surface of this issue were a few basic facts. We have lost over 30 refineries in the last decade because they couldn't afford to comply with the Clean Air Act; they couldn't retrofit in a profitable way. They were not given tax credits and other tools because it was ``big oil'' and you dare not cause them any benefits that might ultimately make it to the marketplace so the consumer could ultimately benefit. Those refineries went down. 
   Here we are at a time when the price of crude oil peaked and the Vice President ran to the President and said please release SPR, and that has been done, or at least it is now being organized to be done, and it may lower prices. Yet that was a Strategic Petroleum Reserve that was destined to be used only for a crisis. And the Secretary of Energy says no crisis. He himself said yesterday before the National Press Club there is no energy crisis in this country. But there was a crisis last week and the President agreed to release the oil out of SPR. 
   I don't get it. I do not think I am that ignorant. I serve on the Energy Committee. We reviewed this. We have argued for a decade that there is a problem in the making, but this administration will not put down a policy, even though they see a problem, unless the problem becomes a crisis. 
   But now there is not a crisis, so why are we releasing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was designed not only for a crisis but for a national emergency, one that was inflicted upon us by a reduction or a stoppage of the flow of foreign crude coming into our economy that might put our economy at risk. 
   The Secretary says we have a short-term problem and we will work it out in time. 
   Mr. Secretary, what does ``working it out'' mean? Have you proffered or proposed a major energy policy before the Congress of the United States? No, you  have not. Have you suggested an increase in production of domestic resources so we could lower our dependency on foreign oil? No, you have not, Mr. Secretary. 
   So the American public ought to be asking of this administration, the Vice President, the President, and the Secretary of Energy: Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, and Mr. Vice President, if there is no crisis, then why are you tapping the very reserves that we have set aside for a time of crisis? Somehow it doesn't fit. 
   There were political allegations 3 or 4 weeks ago when the Vice President was asking the President to release the petroleum reserve. He was saying there was a crisis, or a near crisis. That got done. And yesterday,  
   In remarks before the National Press Club, [Secretary] Richardson said the ``political campaign'' was behind Gore's accusations against [big] oil companies and that a surge in demand for oil in the United States and abroad is the real reason gasoline, heating-oil and natural-gas prices have soared this year. ``We are not in an energy crisis.''  
   Mr. Secretary, if you are traveling or if you are not wealthy and you have to pick up the 100 percent increased cost in your energy bills and your heating bills, I am going to tell you that is a crisis. But my guess is, it is typical of this administration, a problem is a problem until there is a crisis, and then you find a solution; 8 years without a solution to this problem spells crisis. 
   I am sorry, Mr. Secretary, but your rhetoric doesn't fit the occasion, nor does it rectify the problem. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the U.S. Forest Service has announced its intention to move to gum thickened/sodium ferrocyanide aerially applied fire retardants in the 2004 bid process. The Service is to be commended for this initiative that seeks a more effective and environmentally friendly means to address the wildfires with which we have become so painfully accustomed in the West. Indeed, the Forest Service's own research shows that gum thickened retardants are 25-40 percent more effective than un-thickened retardants. The criteria called for in 2004, though, can be met today. Is it the Committee's view that the U.S. Forest Service should be striving for a more environmentally friendly product and should use such a product as soon as possible?

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, as you know, the after-effects of wildfires are devastating to the landscape. Mother Nature has a way of bringing life back to the land when all appears lost. However, even Mother Nature cannot erase for years the stains on the lands caused by some aerially applied fire retardants. This is especially of concern where historical and archeological resources, national parks, wilderness areas and urban/wilderness areas are concerned. Would you agree that U.S. Forest Service should preserve the option for local foresters to use less staining fugitive retardants where, in their judgment, it is warranted?

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator CONRAD to introduce the ``National Rural Development Partnership Act of 2000''--a bill to codify the National Rural Development Partnership (NRDP or the Partnership) and provide a funding source for the program. I am pleased that Senators BAUCUS, BINGAMAN, BREAUX, BURNS, CRAPO, DASCHLE, ENZI, GORTON, GRAMM, GRAMS, GREGG, HARKIN, HUTCHISON, JEFFORDS, JOHNSON, KENNEDY, KERREY, LEAHY, LUGAR, MIKULSKI, MURRAY, REED, SARBANES, BOB SMITH, THOMAS, and WELLSTONE are joining us as original cosponsors. 
   The Partnership was established under the Bush Administration in 1990, by Executive Order 12720. Although the Partnership has existed for ten years, it has never been formally authorized by Congress. The current basis for the existence of the Partnership is found in the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 and the Rural Development Policy Act of 1980. In addition, the Conference Committee Report on the 1996 federal Farm Bill created specific responsibilities and expectations for the Partnership and state rural development councils (SRDCs). 
   The Partnership is a nonpartisan interagency working group whose mission is to ``contribute to the vitality of the Nation by strengthening the ability of all rural Americans to participate in determining their futures.'' The NRDP and SRDCs do something no other entities do: facilitate collaboration among federal agencies and between federal agencies and state, local, and tribal governments and the private and non-profit sectors to increase coordination of programs and services to rural areas. When successful, these efforts result in more efficient use of limited rural development resources and actually add value to the efforts and dollars of others. 
   On March 8, 2000, the Subcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and Rural Revitalization, which I chair, held an oversight hearing on the operation and accomplishments of the NRDP and SRDCs. The Subcommittee heard from a number of witnesses, including officials of the US Departments of Agriculture, Transportation and Health & Human Services, state agencies, and private sector representatives. The hearing established the need for some legislative foundation and consistent funding. The legislation we are introducing accomplishes this. 
   This legislation formally recognizes the existence and operations of the Partnership, the National Rural Development Council (NRDC), and SRDCs. In addition, the legislation gives specific responsibilities to each component of the Partnership and authorizes it to receive Congressional appropriations. 
   Specifically, the bill formally establishes the NRDP and indicates it is composed of the NRDC and SRDCs. NRDP is established for empowering and building the capacity of rural communities, encouraging participation in flexible and innovative methods of addressing the challenges of rural areas, and encouraging all those involved in the Partnership to be fully engaged and to share equally in decision making. This legislation also identifies the role of the federal government in the Partnership as being that of partner, coach, and facilitator. Federal 
   agencies are called upon to designate senior-level officials to participate in the NRDC and to encourage field staff to participate in SRDCs. Federal agencies are also authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with, and to provide grants and other assistance to, state rural development councils, regardless of the form of legal organization of a state rural development council.  
   The composition of the NRDC is specified as being one representative from each federal agency with rural responsibilities, and governmental and non-governmental for-profit and non-profit organizations that elect to participate in the NRDC. The legislation outlines the duties of the Council as being to provide support to SRDCs; facilitate coordination among federal agencies and between the federal, state, local and tribal governments and private organizations; enhance the effectiveness, responsiveness, and delivery of federal government programs; gather and provide to federal agencies information about the impact of government programs on rural areas; review and comment on policies, regulations, and proposed legislation; provide technical assistance to SRDCs; and develop strategies for eliminating administrative and regulatory impediments. Federal agencies do have the ability to opt out of participation in the Council, but only if they can show how they can more effectively serve rural areas without participating in the Partnership and Council. 
   This legislation provides that states may participate in the Partnership by entering into a memorandum of understanding with USDA to establish an SRDC. SRDCs are required to operate in a nonpartisan and nondiscriminatory manner and to reflect the diversity of the states within which they are organized. The duties of the SRDCs are to facilitate collaboration among government agencies at all levels and the private and non-profit sectors; to enhance the effectiveness, responsiveness, and delivery of federal and state government programs; to gather information about rural areas in its state and share it with the NRDC and other entities; to monitor and report on policies and programs that address, or fail to address, the needs of rural areas; to facilitate the formulation of needs assessments for rural areas and participate in the development of the criteria for the distribution of federal funds to rural areas; to provide comments to the NRDC and others on policies, regulations, and proposed legislation; assist the NRDC in developing strategies for reducing or eliminating impediments; to hire an executive director and support staff; and to fundraise. 
   As I have stated before, this legislation authorizes the Partnership to receive appropriations as well as authorizing and encouraging federal agencies to make grants and provide other forms of assistance to the Partnership and authorizing the Partnership to accept private contributions. The SRDCs are required to provide at least a 25 percent match for funds it receives as a result of its cooperative agreement with the federal government. 
   As you know, too many parts of rural America have not shared in the boom that has brought great prosperity to urban America. We need to do more to ensure that rural citizens will have opportunities similar to those enjoyed by urban areas. To do so, we do not necessarily need new government programs. Instead, we must do a better job of coordinating the many programs available for USDA and other federal agencies that can benefit rural communities. With the passage of this legislation, the NRDP and SRDCs will be better situated to provide that much needed coordination.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I had hoped that I would be able to respond in part while the Senator from Louisiana was on the floor speaking about her concerns about the CARA legislation. She certainly has made every effort to move that legislation, which is important to her State. 
   Both the Senator from Louisiana and I serve on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on which that legislation was formed. She has always been courteous. We have worked closely together on the issue. 
   I could not and do not support CARA as it is currently crafted and as it was voted out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I said very early on to the citizens of my State and to my colleagues on that committee that I would strongly oppose any bill that created a Federal entitlement that allowed the Federal Government to own more of the State of Idaho. The Federal Government already owns nearly 64 percent of my State. And this year you watched Federal forests in my State burn, with tremendous fire and heat, causing the destruction of the environment and resources. My State forests did not burn. The private forests in Idaho did not burn because they were managed. They were thinned. They are healthy, growing, dynamic forests that provide marvelous habitat and quality water to our streams, to our fisheries, and to the life-style of my beautiful State. 
   Two weeks ago, I was in a helicopter flying over the nearly 1.2 million acres of charred national forests in my State--charred almost to a point of nonrecognition. It will take a decade or more for the natural environment to begin to return. That could have been avoided to some degree, if the Forest Service and its management had not become an agency of benign neglect, which had simply turned its back on these living environments, and had helped Mother Nature to improve them in a way that they would not have burned in such a catastrophic fashion. 
   The reason I say that is because many want the Federal Government to own more land. Somehow the Federal Government's ownership has in some people's minds become synonymous with quality environment. That is simply not true today. 
   Nearly 40 million acres of national forest land are in a dead or dying condition--bug-infested, overpopulated with trees, and as a result drought stricken, with the health of the trees declining and the health of the forests faltering. 
   Is that a way to manage lands? No, it isn't. The Senator from Louisiana knows that. She knows my strong opposition to additional ownership of Federal property in my State. She worked with me. She worked with me very closely to try to change that equation, and we simply could not get that done. 
   That is why we did something different in this Interior appropriations bill. It is not CARA and it is not land legacy, but it does recognize the importance of spending money for certain resource values, for certain wildlife habitat values, for certain coastal needs of the kind the Senator from Louisiana has for the general well-being of the environment with moneys coming from offshore oil royalties, many of them generated in the gulf south of her State and out into the ocean beyond Louisiana. On that, she and I do not disagree. But I will continue to be a strong opponent of an attitude or a philosophy and an effort to fund an attitude and a philosophy that somehow if the Federal Government owns the land, it is going to be better protected. In my State of Idaho, because nearly 64 percent is owned by the Federal Government, they also dictate the economy of my State. 
   Today we had a hearing in the Small Business Committee about the impact of forest policies on all of the small communities of my State. I chair the Forestry Subcommittee of this Senate. We have held over 100 hearings since 1996 examining the character of decision-making in the U.S. Forest Service and that they ignore small business today, and they turn their back on small communities that adjoin those forests. 
   Is it any wonder why nearly all of those small communities in Idaho and across the Nation today associated with public forests have 14 and 15 percent unemployment while the rest of our country flourishes because of the high-tech economy? No. It is quite obvious that is what is happening because this Government and this administration have locked the door on the U.S. forested land and turned their back and walked away. With that, thousands of jobs and 45,000 schoolchildren in rural schools across the Nation are deprived of the money that would have come to them by an active management plan of the U.S. Forest Service because of long-term policies that allowed counties and school districts to share in those revenues. 
   I can't stand here as someone representing the State of Idaho and say: Give the Federal Government more money to buy more land in the State of Idaho to make it Federal. I can't do that in good conscience, and I won't. 
   I am joined with my western colleagues to tell the Senator from Louisiana, somehow it has to be done differently. I am not going to suggest what we do in this bill is answer the problems or concerns of the Senator from Louisiana. I think it probably isn't. 
   But I will say it is no longer an entitlement. It is not automatic for 15 years. We do not give this administration or any future administration half a billion worth of cash a year to go out and buy more and more land to turn into forest fires or dying habitat for wildlife because they won't actively manage it and care for it. 
   There is a lot of money in here to help our national parks. There is money for urban parks. There is money for coastal acquisitions. There is a great deal of money--$1.8 billion, nearly $2 billion worth. A chart shows it ratchets it up over the next number of years to nearly $2.4 billion. It is not as originally envisioned by the CARA Coalition, but it is a great deal of what they asked for.

   Mr. CRAIG. I have very limited time. I apologize. 
   I am not in any way--how do I say this--taking offense at what the Senator from Louisiana has said. We have worked very closely on this issue. She and I held fundamental disagreement on one portion of the bill. I made an effort to change that. I made an effort to have no net gain of Federal lands in the States. Willing seller, willing buyer--all of those kinds of things we worked to get. We couldn't get them. 
   So I have fought, as other colleagues have fought, not to allow CARA to come to the floor this year for a vote. 
   Let me talk more about something else before my time is up. I mentioned that nearly 1.2 million acres of Federal land burned in my State this year, beautiful forested land that was in trouble environmentally, and when Mother Nature came along and struck with her violence, it all went up in smoke. 
   There is a lot of money in this bill to begin to deal with those problems, a great deal of money in this bill to pay off the fire expenditures that are natural to do so. A lot of this money is to pay back the expenses that were incurred this year, the millions and millions of dollars spent each day for nearly 60 days across this country during the peak of the fire season when the skies of Idaho were gray to black, as it was true in other States across this Nation. There is a lot of money in this bill for that purpose. 
   There is also additional money in this bill, new language, and new policy, on which Senator DOMENICI of New Mexico and I worked with a lot of others, to try to create an active management scheme that will allow in areas where there are now urban dwellers--we call it the urban wildland interface--which I will come back to. 
   I thank my colleague from Illinois for yielding. This is an important bill. We have addressed a lot of the problems. I hope my colleagues will join in supporting the passage of the Interior appropriations conference report.  
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate two Idaho athletes who have made America proud in the 2000 Olympic Games. 
   Stacy Dragila from Pocatello, Idaho soared to the top of her sport, bringing home the gold medal. She pole vaulted fifteen feet, one inch in Sydney, Australia on September 25th. Stacy deserves recognition because she is more than an athlete. She gives back to her sport by working as an assistant track coach at Idaho State University. 
   Idahoan Charles Burton is another Idaho Olympian. He finished his round of wrestling competition on October first, coming in at fifth place. Charles wrestled at Centennial High School in Boise and Boise State University. He has been called the ``U.S. Olympic Wrestling Team's most hidden gem,'' and I'm proud he represented our gem state in Sydney. 
   The hard work and determination of Idaho's Olympic Athletes is an inspiration to us all. They have demonstrated the best of our State and our Nation, and I am proud to congratulate both Stacy and Charles for their personal achievement and the honor in which each represented Idaho and the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak on this important issue before the Senate and to talk once again to my colleagues about what I believe to be the dark cloud of a national emergency. The American consumer has begun to detect a problem because the price of gasoline at the pump has gone up 25 or 30 percent in the last year. When they begin to pay their home heating bills this winter, I think they will recognize where the problem lies. 
   We have had the President and the Vice President trying to position themselves politically over the last month and a half on energy because of the spike in prices, but frankly they have articulated little. Now just in the last week we have had the Vice President present an energy policy for the country, and we have had Governor George Bush talking about an energy policy that he would propose. 
   Here is why these things are happening. Finally, I hope, the American people are beginning to focus on the very critical state of the availability of energy in this country, to run the economy, to make the country work, turn the lights on, move our cars, and do all that it takes to run an economy based on a heavy use of energy. 
   We are now importing between 56 to 58 percent of our crude oil needs. Some will remember that during the era of the oil embargo of the mid-1970s we were only importing 35 percent of our needs. Even at that time there were gas lines and fighting at the gas pumps because American consumers were frustrated over the cost of gas. What I am saying, America, is we no longer control our energy availability, our energy supplies, our energy needs. 
   Is it any wonder why prices have more than tripled in the last 2 years from a low of about $11 per barrel of crude oil to a high late last month of $38? The reason is somebody else is setting the price by creating either a scarcity of supply or by the appearance that there would be a scarcity of supply. It is not American producers controlling prices and supply, it is foreign producer countries. 
   The items we do control in the marketplace are demand and supplies we might be able to produce from our own resources. Natural was selling for $2 per 1,000 cubic feet last year, just a year ago, and on Friday of last week natural gas was selling for $5.20 for every 1,000 cubic feet. That is better than a doubling of that price. 
   As winter approaches, Americans likely will face the highest energy prices ever. Let me say that again. As the winter approaches, Americans are going to awaken to the highest energy prices they have ever paid. If the winter is colder than usual, energy prices will be even higher. 
   Electricity prices will move right along with gas and oil because many of the electrical-generating facilities of our country are fueled by natural gas. While petroleum and natural gas supplies appear to be adequate, no one can doubt that the supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas, and other energy sources is very tight, resulting in increased prices for these commodities. While many observers believe supplies of oil and natural gas will be sufficient to meet our needs in the coming months, I am concerned these important resources will likely remain in very short supply and, therefore, will be very costly to the American consumer. 
   I believe, and I mean this most sincerely, as a member of the Senate Energy Committee who for the last 10 years has tried to move policy and has seen this administration either say ``no'' by the veto or ``no'' by the budget, I sincerely believe the Clinton-Gore administration, by its failure to produce a national energy policy, is risking a slowdown, perhaps even a downturn, in this economy. 
   Some expect energy prices to remain high throughout the first quarter of 2001, above $30 a barrel for oil and as high as $4 per thousand cubic feet for natural gas. If this is true and that cost ripples through the economy, then they--and by ``they'' I mean the Clinton administration--are truly risking a slowdown in the economy. This means Americans will be paying more than $1.50 per gallon of gas and perhaps twice as much as they paid for residential natural gas use last year. Driving, heating homes, providing services and manufacturing goods will be much, much more expensive under this new high-cost energy economy. 
   It is not only the price at the pump you worry about anymore; it is the plastics; it is the supply of goods; it is everything within our economy that is made of the hydrocarbons that will go up in price. Since energy costs are  factored into the cost of all goods and services, we can expect food, appliances, clothing--essentially everything--to become more expensive. As these costs rise, the amount of capital available for investment automatically begins to decline, pulling the economy down along with it. As we devote more of our money to the daily need for energy, we have less to spend on the goods and services that we need, the goods and services that have fired our economy. As budgets shrink, consumers will be forced to make hard choices. If we have to spend 10 or 15 percent more of our income to fill up the tank or to buy the services and goods that are energy intensive, then, of course, we will have less money to spend elsewhere. 
   We are in this undesirable position not because we are short on energy resources such as oil, natural gas, or coal; we are here because this administration, in my opinion, has deliberately tried to drive us away from these energy sources. Look at their budgets and look at their policy over the last 8 years. AL GORE himself has spoken openly about how much he hates fossil fuels, how he wants to force the U.S. off fossil fuels no matter the cost. He has proposed many times to do so. Twice in the last 8 years the Clinton-Gore administration has tried to drive up the cost of conventional fuels. Isn't that interesting? Just in the last few weeks they have been trying to drive down the costs by releasing crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve into our market, but for the last 8 years it has been quite the opposite. America, are you listening? Are you observing? Why this change of heart? Why this change of personality? 
   First, Clinton and GORE proposed a Btu tax, which the Republican Congress defeated. They had to settle for a 4.3-cent gas tax. The Republicans in every way tried to resolve that and to eliminate it, but that was how they spread it into the market. They took that and said: We are not going to use it for highway transportation as we have historically done. We want it for deficit reduction. 
   During debate on the Btu tax, the administration admitted that its intent was to encourage conservation, or discourage use, and 
   therefore cause us to move more toward renewable energy sources by dramatically increasing the cost of conventional fuels. In other words, tax America away from gasoline and oil. 
   Next, the Clinton-Gore administration designed the Kyoto Protocol. We all know about that. That is the great international agreement that will cool the country, cool the world down because the Administration asserts that the world is warming due to the use of fossil fuels. They said it is necessary that we do it, critically important that we do it. But if implemented, it would substantially penalize the nations that use fossil fuels by forcing reductions in fossil fuel usage. The Vice President has publicly taken credit for negotiating this document. 
   I don't think you hear him talking much about it today. He is a bit of a born-again gas and oil user of in last couple of weeks. But clearly for the last 8 years that is all he has talked about, his Kyoto Protocol, penalizing the user nations to try to get them to use less energy, all in the name of the environment. The protocol could result in a cost of nearly $240 per ton of carbon emissions reduction. 
   What does that mean to the average consumer out there who might be listening? This results in a higher cost of oil and gas and coal. What would it mean? About a 4-percent reduction in the gross domestic product of this country. If we raise the cost of those three items--oil, gas, and coal then we will drive down the economy 4-percent. Simply translated, that means thousands and thousands of U.S. jobs would be lost and our strong economy weakened. Yet the Vice President takes credit for flying to Tokyo and getting directly involved in the negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol. This is AL GORE's document. Yet he talks very little bit about it today. 
   Why is this administration so wholeheartedly committed to forcing us to stop using fossil fuels at almost any cost? Because they buy into the notion that our economic success has been at the expense of the world's environment. I do not buy into that argument. I think quite the opposite is true. I believe our success has benefited the world. Our technology is the technology that the rest of the world wants today to clean up their environment, to make their air cleaner, to make their water more pure. It is not in spite of us; it is because of us that the world has an opportunity today, through the use of our technology, to make the world a cleaner place to live. 
   The challenge now is to ensure we go on in the production of these technologies through the growth and the strength of our economy so we can pass these technologies through to developing nations so they can use them, whether it be for their energy resources or whether it is simply to create greater levels of efficiency, and a cleaner economy for their people. 
   The message to Vice President GORE is don't shut us down. Let us work. Let us develop. Let us use the technologies we have and expand upon them. You don't do that through the absence of energy. You don't do that with 2,300 windmills spread across the Rocky Mountain front. You do that by the use of what you have, to be used wisely and hopefully efficiently at the least cost to provide the greatest amount of energy that you can to the economy. 
   To ensure that we all succeed, we must pay attention to our strengths. The United States has an abundant supply of oil, natural gas, and coal, and we must, if we wish to have an influence on the price of these commodities, develop our own resources in an intelligent, responsible, and environmentally sound way. 
   Were we to produce oil from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we could produce up to 1.5 million barrels of oil a day. Some say that will destroy the refuge. Envision the refuge in your mind as a spot on a map, and compare it to putting a pencil point down on the map of the United States. The impact of that pencil point on the map of the United States is the same impact as drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
   Shame on you, Mr. President, for vetoing that legislation a few years ago. If you had not, we might have 1.5 million barrels of additional crude oil a day flowing into our markets for 30-some years. We would not have to beg at the throne of OPEC. We would not have to go to them with our tin cup, saying: Would you please give us a little more oil? Your high prices are hurting our economy. 
   The President was not listening in 1995 when he vetoed that legislation. Other oil and gas resources can come from production from the Federal Outer Continental Shelf and from onshore Federal lands in the Rocky Mountain front. The abundance of our crude oil and the abundance of our gas is phenomenal. Yet, a year ago, in the northeastern part of the United States in New Hampshire, AL GORE, now a candidate for President of the United States, said he would stop all drilling. He does not want us to drill anywhere, and he would do it in the name of the environment. 
   These resources can be obtained today, under the new technologies we have, with little to no environmental impact. When we have finished, if any damage has occurred, we clean it up, we rehabilitate it, and the footprint that was made at the time of development is hardly noticeable. That is what we can do today. 
   There is no question that the road to less reliance on oil, natural gas, and coal is a responsible one, but it is a long one. You do not shut it off overnight without damaging an economy and frustrating a people. 
   We have these resources, and they are in abundance. We ought to be producing them at relatively inexpensive cost to the American consumer while we are investing in better photovoltaic and solar technologies and biomass, wind, and all of the other things that can help in the total package for energy. 
   The problem is simply this: This administration stopped us from producing additional energy supplies at a time of unprecedented growth in our economy. Of course, that economy has been based on the abundance and relatively low costs of energy. 
   Creating punitive regulatory demands, such as the Btu tax and the Kyoto Protocol, is not the way to go if you want an economy to prosper and you want the opportunities of that economy to be affordable and benefit  all of our citizens. Such policies create--the policies of which I have spoken, Btu tax and Kyoto Protocol--winners and losers. The great tragedy is that the American consumer ultimately becomes the loser. 
   The path to stable energy prices is through a free market that rewards efficiency and productivity and does not punish economies for favoring one form of energy over another. The American consumer will make that decision ultimately if he or she has an adequate number of choices in the marketplace. 
   The Vice President, in his recent speech on energy, simply repeated the tired, old rhetoric of the Carter administration and every Democrat candidate in past presidential elections. Each placed reliance on solar, wind, and other renewables and on energy conservation--all admirable goals that Presidents Reagan and Bush also encouraged, but Presidents Reagan and Bush supported renewables with the clear understanding that renewables could not be relied upon to replace fossil-fuel-fired electrical generating capacity that currently supplies our baseload of electricity. And 
   that baseload demand will continue to rise as our economy grows. 
   Presidents Reagan and Bush also recognized that somehow the automobile was not just going to disappear overnight and that it was not going to be replaced by electric cars within the near future. They understood that. They rewarded production and encouraged production. For 8 years now, domestic oil and gas production has been discouraged and restricted, and the American consumer is paying the price at the pump. This winter the American consumer will also pay a dramatic price as their furnaces turn on. 
   Can it be turned around overnight? Absolutely not. We must begin to invest in the business of producing, whether it be electricity or whether it be oil from domestic reserves or gas. It is there. It awaits us. We simply have to reward the marketplace, and the marketplace will produce. We cannot continue to squeeze it, penalize it, and refuse access to the supplies the American consumer needs. 
   It is a simple message but a complicated one, especially complicated by an administration that says: No, no, no, let the wind and the Sun make up the difference. Probably not in my lifetime or in the lifetime of any of the youngest people listening today can and will that be possible. But a combination of all of those elements of energy coming together--hydro, nuclear, or the production of crude oil and gas from our own reserves, supplies from abroad, and renewables and conservation--will be necessary to carry us through a crisis that clearly could spell a major hit to our economy. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CRAIG. When DOE's Environmental Management budget request for FY 2001 was submitted to Congress earlier this year it continued a restriction on the use of DOE environmental management funds for LDRD purposes carried over from FY 2000. The EM restriction of LDRD was subsequently rescinded by OMB later in the year at strong urging by numerous Senators including myself. Subsequently, the Senate Defense Authorization and the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations bills directed that DOE return LDRD to full scope, to include use of EM funds. The Senate Defense Authorization bill permits use of LDRD up to 6%; and this conference report also permits use of LDRD funds at 6%. Is this the Chairman's understanding?

   Mr. CRAIG. The Senator makes a point that I hope echoes across this country, which is that you cannot honor, recognize, or enhance the concept of breaking the law or acting illegally and therefore be rewarded for it. We are struggling mightily on the floor to address a need in this country; it is called an employment need--H-1B workers primarily for the high-tech industry. 
   The Senator knows I have worked on H-2A, the issue of primarily Hispanic workforces but migrant labor coming to this country to work in agriculture. We have a very real need there, but we are trying to adjust a law so that it accommodates a citizenry, treats them in a humane way, but stays within the law because we have to control our borders. 
   It is critically necessary that as a nation we control our borders. What you are suggesting--and this is my question--if you can make it across the border illegally, and if you can stay here long enough and raise your issue through an interest group long enough, or with a political party, you may be rewarded for having broken the law by getting someone to do something for you.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am going to use some time this afternoon and depart from this immediate debate to talk about an event that occurred last night which I and my colleague from Louisiana had the opportunity to cohost, along with the Freddie Mac Foundation. 
   My colleague, Senator MARY LANDRIEU, and I are cochairs of the Congressional Caucus on Adoption. Both she and I are adoptive parents and very proud of that fact. For the last good number of years, we have worked to organize our colleagues into a caucus to become sensitive to the issues of adoption. We became very active in the transformation of the foster care laws of our country which this Senate passed 5 years ago that have certainly made many children safer and available to individuals, couples who want to form families through adoption to provide permanent loving homes for those children. 
   More importantly, the Senator and I have been active with our colleagues on the House side to literally debate and move nationally the whole issue of adoption, both at the State and the Federal level. Why? For a very simple reason. We know, and many of my colleagues know, that there are literally hundreds of thousands of children who are in search of loving adults and parents who will provide them with a home--not a foster home, not a temporary home, but a permanent home. Why? Because their natural parents either are no longer alive or are dysfunctional in a way that they cannot provide for and love these children. In many instances, they were actually harming these children and, as a result, we have worked in a bipartisan way to make a very real difference. 
   In the course of all of our efforts, the Senator from Louisiana and I a year ago stumbled on an idea that we thought just made all the sense in the world, to lift the visibility of and the general public awareness of adoption: That there are marvelous, beautiful young people who are in search of a home. 
   We began to ask our colleagues in the Senate and the House to recognize individuals who were outstanding in the area of adoption, whether it was individuals, families, or couples who were adopting children, whether it was foster parents, whether it was mentors who were attempting to work in the adoption of children, or volunteers with the court-appointed special advocates, known as CASA, who help family courts by working with children in their homes, support communities, organizations across the country, or just outstanding individuals who stand above it all, whose greatest and most direct interest is in helping kids. 
   Last night, we recognized a number of people who are doing just that. One hundred and twenty nominees flowed from House and Senate Members and from their States to be recognized. At a gathering last night at the Hyatt, over 450 people, hosted by the Freddie Mac Foundation, came together to honor Angels in Adoption. 
   I now turn to my colleague, Senator MARY LANDRIEU, my cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Adoption, to speak to this issue. There is a lot more to be said, and I want her to have a full share of this time as we talk about the most important issue of providing loving, caring homes for children who do not have them and who can have them if we can simply help facilitate the ability of adults to adopt these children.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last night, as we were recognizing these national Angels in Adoption, I had the privilege of introducing Lynette Cole and her parents, Gale and Larry. 
   Lynette is a beautiful young lady whom we have come to know as Miss USA. She is a young lady of color, and her parents are not of color, they are Caucasian. Yet the marvelous chemistry of the family said they were made for each other. They came together, both she and her brother, to be adopted by Larry and Gale Cole and to be raised by them. Never prouder parents did you see than last night when they were standing beside their beautiful daughter on stage--all three--to be recognized as Angels in Adoption. 
   It was so appropriate that we did that. Here is a perfect example of what can happen when all of the right chemistry comes together, but, more importantly, when all of the right law comes together. 
   Here is an adult couple who wanted this child, who could not adopt her. They were not allowed to adopt her. They actually moved out of one jurisdiction into another, where the laws were different, so they could adopt this child and become her permanent parents. 
   The country knows the rest of that story now--not only the story of their unlimited love, but the fact that they raised and helped shape a beautiful young lady who ultimately became the reigning Miss USA 2000. 
   So it was my tremendous privilege last night to be there to honor them and to recognize them as the recipients of our Congressional Caucus on Adoption national award of Angels in Adoption. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me talk just a little more about what the Congressional Caucus on Adoption and the coalition we formed actually does. 
   As you know, coalitions or caucuses here in the Congress are nonpartisan. We are bicameral. We are an alliance of Members of the House and the Senate, now 150 strong, who work very closely together for the purpose that both Senator LANDRIEU and I have talked about. 
   We are from all political stripes: Liberal, moderate, conservative. But we have one goal, and that is to help facilitate and change the laws so young people, in search of loving, permanent homes and families can come together. 
   Just this last week, we were able to see the ``adoption bonuses'' announced. These are the incentive payments that were created by Congress in the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which provides to States, if you will, the carrot and the stick to assure that States help get more children out of that system once they have determined that the natural parents--if they are still living--are unable or unacceptable to parent these children. Then they move them into adoption and into loving homes. These are the incentives we have created in the passage of that law 
   for the reshaping of foster care in our country. 
   I would be remiss if I did not mention the name of the late Senator John Chafee, and Senator MIKE DEWINE, who, with myself, and others--I say to Senator LANDRIEU, I think she was just coming to the Senate at that time--worked to reshape that law. 
   It has become a tremendously valuable change in the law because, tragically enough, for all the right reasons--and for some of the wrong motivations--the foster care system in our country was becoming a warehouse which young people went into and stayed and oftentimes graduated out of at the age of 18, never knowing a permanent home, sometimes living in three or four or five homes during their life. Foster care parents are wonderful, loving, giving people, but those children knew that this was not a permanent environment. They did not have a mom or a dad. 
   We are changing that now, and doing it very quickly, by erring on the side of  the child and making the determination for the child and not for the natural parent, because, by definition of being in foster care, that parent in some way has given up a good many rights or has been found dysfunctional and unable to care for the child they may have brought into this world. 
   Also, last week--and I will let the Senator speak more about this--Senator LANDRIEU, working with Senator HELMS, was very instrumental in bringing about the final clearance of the Hague Treaty that deals with international intercountry adoption, which is so critical as we try to change laws not just in our country, nationally and on a State-by-State basis, to create greater uniformity in State law to accommodate and enhance adoption, but also working internationally. These are very important steps. 
   Let me conclude and yield back to the Senator by saying this to my colleagues. 
   In November, we are not going to be here, hopefully. We are going to be adjourned. All of us will be back in our States and back in our hometowns. 
   November is Adoption Month. That is when our Nation celebrates the institution of adoption. I certainly encourage my colleagues to think about November and look forward and ask the congressional coalition to work with them in giving them material or information so they could prepare to give a speech back in their home State about adoption. Host an adoption party for prospective parents and adoptable children. Most importantly, though, speak publicly about it. Make your citizens in your State more aware or at least give them the opportunity to be more aware of it. 
   You can also do something I did. You can host, with the U.S. Postal Service, a ceremony about the adoption stamp that was just released this year. You can give out those stamps. It is a marvelous activity that the Post Office loves to do, not only to bring attention to adoption but to bring attention to the fact that they are sensitive to these kinds of important issues in our country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, again, a very special thanks to my cochair with the Congressional Coalition on Adoption for the tremendous work she has done. 
   We now are able to have an intern, thanks to a private organization helping facilitate the development of our coalition. 
   Lastly, a marvelous lady in Boise, ID, Jolyn Callen, is my Angel in Adoption. Her advocacy grew out of her own experience adopting her daughter from abroad. She is now a volunteer with a local adoption agency, helping others who are thinking about adopting or going through the adoption process. Even as we work to streamline this process and improve the law and create the tax credits, all of that, it is still a phenomenally daunting process. It takes time. It is a legal approach and necessary, as we make sure that the laws are dealt with appropriately. 
   What we want to make sure is that there are no locked doors, that the doors are there with large signs on them for people to walk through, whether it be State by State or across the Nation or nation to nation, to assure, as Senator LANDRIEU says, that every child in search of a home can find one. 
   Let me close by drawing attention to the map behind Senator LANDRIEU. A good many people will recognize that these are all of the people and their names and locations that we have just placed into the RECORD. For Senators who might be listening or Senators who will read this RECORD, look at the States where there are no Angels yet. That means you haven't done your homework. That means you haven't gone home to check to see who that marvelous individual is in your State who is helping facilitate an adoption or may have 10 or 12 or 15 adopted children of their own. They are all over America, wonderful people, whether it is at the court level, at the family level, at the agency level, advocating for children to be placed in permanent, loving homes. 
   Next year, when the Congressional Coalition on Adoption once again steps forward to name nationally our Angels in Adoption, let's make sure that this map is completely full, not 150 but several hundreds of citizens who are helping us facilitate and work for this very worthy cause across our country. 
   I thank the Senator from Louisiana for the tremendous work she does and yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we will vote later this afternoon on a motion to change the way we proceed here to allow an amendment to come to the floor of the kind the Senator from Minnesota has spoken to. 
   This is an interesting process because the beauty of the process of the Senate that the Senator speaks of is that there are rules and procedures by which we live. Historically, most Americans understand that when they elect a majority to the Congress, they expect that majority, under the Constitution, to form a Congress and to form rules and to be able to manage that Congress. Under that responsibility of management, which this time the Republicans have under the majority leader of TRENT LOTT, there are the rules that each one of us as Senators have a right to enforce and to live by; that is, that we are all equal as our Founding Fathers assured that every State must be. 
   But it also recognized that there are more important procedures and processes that keep us functioning and functioning well. It is the rule of the majority, and in some instances in our Senate it is a supermajority that must move, giving the minority even greater rights to speak out. 
   While the Senator from Minnesota may be frustrated, clearly he has the right to make every effort to enjoy his right. But if a majority or a supermajority says, no, that is not the way we will proceed, and this is what we must do to carry on the business of the Senate and the Government, then while it may collectively have chosen to say to the Senator from Minnesota this is the way we are going to go, it is very difficult to suggest that is an outright denial of his right. 
   We are here to deal with allowing people from other countries to come to this country to work and not only to share in the American dream, to enhance the American dream, but to share in the freedoms and the benefits that all citizens in our country have. 
   While we as a country have always recognized the importance of our existence, we are a conglomerate as a country. We are not one people in the sense of one nationality or one color or one religion. We are all Americans, and we live under this marvelous system. We are brought together by our Constitution, and oneness under that Constitution which is really spelling out the rights and the freedoms of us as citizens. 
   We take seriously allowing others to come. They must come by rule, and they must come by law, or we become a nation quite lawless. Certainly a lawless nation is a nation that loses control of its boundaries, loses control of its borders, and, in fact, could lose control of its institutions--the very institutions of which the Senator from Minnesota and I are so proud. 
   We, as a country, have established laws. We have said this is the way a foreign national can enter our country to enjoy those things that are basically American. Some would choose to enter illegally; in other words, they would choose to violate the process or to violate the law. 
   We have before us today what we consider is waiving the rules of the Senate to consider a bill that basically says it is OK to violate the law; that we will change the law now that you violated it to make you legal. 
   I don't think American citizens with their full faith as it relates to how our institutions of government work are going to be very excited about that idea. They, too, may once have been a foreign national and became a naturalized American citizen. My family was five or six or seven generations ago. I am not sure when. But in the late 1700s, they were once foreigners coming from the great land of Scotland. 
   I have tremendous empathy for and have always voted when it 
   came to changing our immigration laws or adjusting them to accommodate the needs of our country and the needs of our citizenry. But we as an institution and responsible as caretakers under the Constitution cannot reward the breaking of the law by simply changing it and saying it is OK now. It is OK if you can make it across the border into this country. Somehow we will accommodate you and change the law. 
   A sovereign nation is not a nation if it cannot control its borders--if it cannot police its borders and control the process of movement across those borders, both exit and entry. That is what creates a nation. That is what constitutes a nation. That is what identifies us as a nation. We are not one indivisible world. We are one indivisible nation under God. Nations make up a world.  
   There is a fundamental debate going on on the floor today, and it spells a difference. 
   My colleague from Texas talked about the millions and millions of foreign nationals who have applied to become American citizens, or at least legal as foreign nationals in our country. They stand in line. They work the procedure. It is complicated. We want it to be complicated. We do not want all of the world at our doorstep, nor would any other nation of the world. But we have always recognized that the vitality of our country is the uniqueness of our character, and our character is made up of many, many who come here and are not only the beneficiaries of our country but the great contributors to our country. They are many, and they are all different. Once they are here and once they are legal, under the process of law then they become part of that one nation indivisible. 
   There is a very important vote this afternoon that will occur about 4:30. It will be to decide whether we are going to change the law to allow those who came here illegally to all of a sudden be legal and, therefore, send a message to the world that there is no consequence. If you can make it across the border, you are home free. 
   That is not the way you sustain a nation. That is not the way you identify a border. That is not the way you protect the strength of our sovereignty. Diversity is important. We all recognize that because we are all part of this great diversity. We became the melting pot of the world, as so many down through the years have spoken of, but in doing so we did it through process and procedure--orderly with responsibility under the law. That is why this vote this afternoon will be so important. 
   I hope the Senate will not choose to waive our rule or waive our procedures for the purpose of an amendment that would clearly change the character of the law and allow an illegal alien to have benefits from having been the performer of an illegal act. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Arizona in thanking you for your leadership in the work you have done on energy. I remember, several years ago, when the Senator from New Mexico was talking about the state of play of the nuclear industry and that failure to respond to an equitable process to bring about the appropriate handling of waste would ultimately curtail the ability of this industry to grow and provide an environmentally sound and clean source of electrical energy. That is when we were talking about energy when most of our supplies were in some margin of surplus. Today that surplus does not exist. 
   In the past eight years, with no energy policy from the Clinton administration, we are now without surplus. We are now entering what could well be an energy crisis phase for our country and our economy. If that is true--here we stand with the longest peacetime growth economy in the history of our country--could this be the tripwire that brings mighty America down? Because we have a President and a Vice President without an energy policy. In fact, under their administration, we have seen a drop in the energy production of our traditional kind. They even want to knock out big hydrodams out in the West that are now supplying enough electricity for all of the city of Seattle, WA. And they say, in the name of the environment, we would take these down. Shame on them. 
   Why aren't they leading us? Why aren't they providing, as they should, under policy and direction, abundant production and reliable sources? 
   Historically, our economy has been built on that. America has been a beneficiary of it.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, what I thought I might do for a few moments this afternoon is talk about the state of play of where we are as a Senate and as the 106th Congress trying to complete its work and adjourn for the year. 
   I think a good many of us are frustrated at this point. We have tried mightily to produce the appropriations bills, to work with our colleagues, Democrat and Republican. Obviously,  there are differences in how to resolve those differences. We are spending billions and billions of dollars more than we spent a year ago. Yes, we have a surplus. But, yes, the American people are telling us government is as big as it ought to be. There are new national priorities, and we are attempting to address those. 
   But what I think needs to happen, and what has historically happened, at least, is an effort to move the 13 appropriations bills through the process, to vote them up or down, and get them to the President. We tried that last week, to move two of them together: the Legislative Branch appropriations bill and the Treasury-Postal bill. Out of frustration on the floor, and our colleagues on the other side deserting us, those bills failed. 
   I think the average public listening out there says: What's happening here? Why are we almost at the end of the fiscal year and yet a fair amount of the budgetary work needed to be accomplished in the form of appropriations bills to fund the Government for the coming year have not been accomplished? 
   You saw Senator BOB BYRD lament on the floor of the Senate last week, about the Senate working and getting the appropriations bills passed and sent to the President. And I have to lament with him. I agree that this work should go on. He said: There are Senators in this body who have never seen a situation work as it has been meant to work. I think he was denoting the budget process itself and whether it worked and functioned on a timely basis. How well has the appropriations process worked? 
   I began to ask that question of my staff, and we did some research over the weekend. I thought it was important that I come to the floor today to talk a little bit about it because I, too, am concerned. 
   Since 1977, Congress has only twice--in 1994 and in 1988 --passed all of the 13 appropriations bills in time for the President to sign all into law before the October 1 legal fiscal year deadline. Let me repeat that. Only twice since 1977 has Congress passed all of the 13 appropriations bills in time for the President to sign all into law before the October 1st deadline. 
   Now, that either says something about the budget process and the appropriations process itself, or it says how very difficult this is in a two-party system, and how difficult it is to make these substantive compromises to fund the Government of our United States. 
   Most years, the Congress only gets a handful of appropriations bills through all the congressional hurdles by October 1, and so, more often than not, has had to pass some, what we call, a stopgap funding bill before it adjourns for the year. 
   Senator BYRD, on Thursday, said that huge omnibus appropriations bills make a mockery of the legislative process. They certainly don't subscribe to the budget process under the law that we have historically laid out. But, then again, from 1977 until now only twice has that budget process worked effectively. 
   So I could lament with Senator BYRD about huge omnibus bills or I could simply say how difficult it really is. Yet bundling the funding bills has been more the exception than the rule in the last 23 years. In other words, what we were attempting to do on the floor of the Senate last week was not abnormal. 
   We were trying to expedite a process to complete our work and to do the necessary budget efforts. In fact, in 1986 and in 1987, Congress was unable to send even one funding bill to the President by the legal deadline of October 1. That is an interesting statistic. Let me say it again. In 1986 and 1987, by the October first deadline, the President of the United States had not received one funding bill for Government from the Congress of the United States. In 1986, one of those years when Congress passed zero funding conference reports, Senator Robert Dole was the majority leader of the Senate. 
   I am here today to say I agree with Senator BYRD, and I lament the fact that bundling is not a good idea. But in 1987, he took all 13 of the appropriations bills, put them together, and sent them down to the President as one big bill. I think a little bit of history, maybe a little bit of perspective, adds to the value of understanding what the Congress tries to do. That was 1987. All 13 appropriation bills bundled and sent to the President before one separate bill was ever sent to the President. 
   The year 1986 was the first time since 1977. In 1987--I want to be accurate here--was the second time. In 1986 Republicans were in charge. They couldn't get it done. And in 1987, when Senator BYRD was in charge, they couldn't get it done. So here are 2 years, two examples, one party, the other party, 1986 and 1987, that all 13 appropriation bills were bundled into one and sent down for the President's signature. 
   Let's take a closer look at 1987. On October 1, the legal deadline, not a single appropriation bill that passed the Congress had been transmitted to the President. Compare this year, when two have already been signed. That is now, the year 2000, two have already been signed by the President, and we expect to send additional bills to the President before October 1. At least that is our goal. We will work mightily with the other side, whether we deal with them individually or put a couple of them together. In fact, no appropriation bill ever went to the President, I am told by our research, in 1987. Of the 10 funding bills both Houses of Congress passed, none emerged from the Democrat-controlled House and Senate conferees. It was a difficult year. 
   President Reagan was the first to sign an omnibus 13-bill long-term continuing funding bill on December 22 of 1987. Remember, the Congress continued to function late into the year and up until December 22, just days before Christmas, so we could finally complete the work and get it done. Of course, during those years I was not in the Senate. I was in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   Now, all said, during that budget battle in 1987, we passed four short-term CRs. During that time, we kept extending the deadlines necessary and passed four short-term CRs to complete the work of the Congress. President Reagan did not even receive a bill until the morning after the final short-term CR had expired. The CQ Almanac described it as a 10-pound, 1-foot-high, mound of legislation. I remember that well. In fact, I was involved in a debate on the floor of the House that year when I actually helped carry that bill to the floor. 
   All 13 bills were passed and signed twice in 1994 and 1998. Excuse me, 1988; I said 1998. That is an important correction for the RECORD. 
   On October 1, the Senate had passed only four appropriation bills, and this was with a 55-45 majority. Compared to this year, as of September 7, this body had passed nine bills so far. 
   I think it is important to compare. It is not an attempt to criticize. Most importantly, it is an attempt to bring some kind of balance and understanding to this debate. 
   I have been critical in the last several weeks. I have come to the floor to quote minority leader TOM DASCHLE talking about ``dragging their feet and not getting the work done, expecting 
   Republican Senators to cave.'' Well, certainly with those kinds of quotes in the national media and then watching the actions on the floor of this past week, you would expect that maybe that is a part of the strategy. 
   On October 1, only seven bills had been reported to the Senate. This, according to the 1987 CQ Almanac, is because the Appropriations Committee could not even agree how to meet its subcommittee allocations. Compare that to this year. As of September 13, all 13 bills have been reported to the Senate. 
   Well, I think what is recognized here is that while bundling bills is not a good idea--and I see the Senator from West Virginia has come to the floor; he and I agree on that. He and I agree that bundling is not a good process because it does not give Senators an opportunity to debate the bills and to look at them individually and to understand them. 
   At the same time, both sides are guilty. Certainly when Senator BYRD was the majority leader of the United States Senate, that was a practice that had to be used at times when Republicans and Democrats could not agree. That is a practice that we will have to look at again here through this week and into next week as we try to complete our work and try to deal with these kinds of issues. 
   You can argue that some of these bills did not get debated on the floor of  the Senate. That is true now; it was true in 1987. You can argue that they didn't get an opportunity to have individual Senators work their will on them by offering amendments. That is going to be true now; it was clearly true in 1987. 
   The one thing that won't happen this year--I hope, at least--is that 13-bill, 10-pound, 1-foot-high mound of legislation. Clearly, I don't think it should happen, and I will make every effort not to let it happen. That isn't the right way to legislate, and we should not attempt to do that. 
   The leadership, last year, in a bipartisan way, along with the White House, ultimately sat down and negotiated the end game as it related to the budget. Many of our colleagues were very upset with that. They had a right to be because they didn't have an opportunity to participate in the process. 
   The reason I come to the floor this afternoon to talk briefly about this is that, clearly, if we can gain the cooperation necessary and the unanimous consents that must be agreed to, that very limited amendments should be applied to these appropriation bills, then we can work them through. I am certainly one who would be willing to work long hours to allow that to happen. But to bring one bill to the floor with 10 or 12 or 13 amendments with 60 percent of them political by nature, grabbing for a 30-second television spot in the upcoming election really does not make much sense this late in the game. We are just a few days from the need to bring this Congress to a conclusion, to complete the work of the 106th Congress and, hopefully, to adjourn having balanced the budget and having addressed some of the major and necessary needs of the American people. It is important that we do that. 
   I am confident we can do that with full cooperation and the balance, the give-and-take that is necessary in a bipartisan way to complete the work at hand. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. In no way do I intend to speak behind your back. It is an important issue that you and I are concerned about. 
   I think it was important to demonstrate what the real record of performance here is in the Senate under both Democrat and Republican leadership--how difficult it is to bring about the final processes of the appropriations. You and I would probably agree that maybe we need to look at the process because it hasn't worked very well. We have not been able to complete our work in a timely fashion, and it does take bipartisan cooperation. 
   I have been frustrated in the last couple of weeks by quotes such as the one on this chart, which would suggest if the other side does absolutely nothing, somehow we would cave. Last week appeared--I know you had a different argument, and I 
   agreed with you--not to debate an appropriations bill on the floor separate from another. That is not good for the process, not good for the legitimacy of getting our work done. But it did seem to purport and confirm the quote on this chart. 
   Again, if I have in some way wronged you, I apologize openly before the Senate. But you and I both know that that which we say on the record is public domain. But I did not offer you the courtesy of calling you, and for that I apologize.

   Mr. CRAIG. I have made statistical statements. When I prepared this today, I double-checked them, to make sure I was accurate, with the Congressional Quarterly Almanac so the RECORD would be replete. If I am not accurate, or if I have misspoken in some of these statements, again, I stand to be corrected. I was simply comparing the years of 1986, a Republican-controlled Senate, and 1987, a Democrat-controlled Senate, when you were the majority leader--recognizing that in both of those years major budget battles ensued and we bundled tremendously in those years individual appropriations bills--in fact, in a considerably worse way than we are actually doing this year. I thought that was a reasonable thing to discuss on the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. What I quoted was the Congressional Almanac--the CQ Almanac--that said since 1977 only twice, in 1994 and in 1998, has the Congress passed all 13 appropriations bills in time for the President to sign them into law before the October 1 deadline.

   Mr. CRAIG. The State of West Virginia and my State of Idaho are very similar. Both are small, rural States. Both the Senator from West Virginia and I are very proud of the fact that we have equal power in the Senate. Our Founding Fathers assured that. That is what created this marvelous balance. Both the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Idaho serve on the Appropriations Committee. Obviously, the Senator from West Virginia has tremendous seniority and is former chairman of that committee. I am still pretty much a freshman. We appreciate that debate process. There is no question about it. 
   At the same time, I am one of those Senators who, before the August recess, turned to my majority leader and said something he didn't want to hear. I said: You know, I am going to start researching the need for a lame duck session because we are not going to get our work done. We have not been allowed to move bills to the floor without 100 amendments or 50 amendments. The Senator from West Virginia can certainly characterize those amendments the way he wants. I will characterize them by saying at least 50 percent of them are political. They come from both sides. 
   I cannot say that the other side is any more guilty than we are for making a public political statement on an amendment that never passes. We are all frustrated by that. But when you subject a bill to full debate on the floor without being able to get a unanimous consent agreement to govern the time, then we could go on for days and sometimes an entire week on the floor on a single bill. 
   Is that necessary?

   Mr. CRAIG. I made this comment, and the Senator made a corresponding comment that appears to suggest that my comment is in conflict with his and they may not be. I want to correct this for the record. 
   The Congressional Quarterly Almanac says that only seven appropriations bills had passed the Senate on October 1 of 1987. But we did not provide for the President an omnibus bill with 13 in it until December 22, 1987. 
   I am not suggesting by this statement that the Senate didn't go on to debate those individual bills on the floor 
   between October 1 and December 22; I didn't draw that conclusion.

   Mr. CRAIG. I don't recall what President Reagan did or did not want. I know what the record shows he got. 
   I guess the question I ask the Senator from West Virginia, from October 1 to until December 22, did the Senate debate and pass out the remainder of the appropriations bills that had not been completed by October 1, which would have been a total of six, I believe, if the Congressional Quarterly Almanac is correct, and we only worked up seven prior to the deadline?

   And by your observation, I was accurate in the sense that five were debated and passed or voted on after the October deadline of 1987.

   Mr. CRAIG. I have one last question because you have got your ledger there, which is very valuable, making sure that statements are accurate, because I focused on 1987, the year of your majority leadership. 
   We talked about the bills. I think we confirmed one thing. The Congressional Quarterly Almanac also goes on to say that foreign ops, Agriculture, and Defense were never voted on on the floor and never debated, that they were incorporated in the omnibus bill. So, in fact, the practice you and I are frustrated by was incorporated that year into that large 13-bill omnibus process; is that accurate?

   But if we are going to incorporate in them entire appropriations bills that have not yet been debated--and that was my point here with bringing that up; they were in CRs but they were not brought to the floor individually and debated. There was an opportunity--you are not suggesting, you are saying--and it is true--that there was an opportunity at some point in the process for them to be amended.

   Mr. CRAIG. If we are attempting to complete our work on a bill-by-bill basis and we extend our time to do that with a clean CR, simply extending the processes of Government and the financing of Government for another week or two while we debate individual bills--that is what I am suggesting. 
   If we are going to incorporate other bills, appropriations bills, in the CR, I am not objecting to amendments. I am saying that if we are going to deal with them individually on the floor, as you and I would wish we could and should, then the CR that extends us the time to do so, in my opinion, should be clean in going to the President so he will not argue or attempt to veto something because we would stick an amendment on it with which he might disagree.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise to welcome Mr. C.J. Chen as the new Representative at the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO). Mr. C.J. Chen, former foreign minister of Taiwan, has recently replaced Mr. Stephen Chen as Taiwan's top diplomat in the United States. Mr. C.J. Chen is certainly qualified to speak for his government and to brief us on all the issues affecting the good relations between the United States and Taiwan. 
   Representative Chen was born in China and educated in Taiwan and Great Britain. He received a law degree at the University of Cambridge and was a resident fellow at the University of Madrid. Following his training in Europe, he returned to Taipei and served in many key positions. Most notably he was senior deputy in Taiwan's Washington office in the 1980's; later he was a vice foreign minister, a senator in the Parliament, and a government spokesman. Prior to June of this year, he was the Foreign Minister for the Republic of China. 
   Representative Chen's appointment as Taiwan's chief diplomat in the United States is a strong indication of the importance his government attaches to Taiwan-United States relations. He will have a unique opportunity to keep us abreast of the new administration's peace initiatives for the region. 
   Representative Chen has already made a great start on Capitol Hill. I trust that he will have a very successful stay in Washington and on Capitol Hill. He is a very talented and respected representative for TECRO.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the course of the last hour and a half, I have been both in committee and in my office. While in my office, I watched a good deal of the discussion going on here on the floor by some of my colleagues on the other side--Senator GRAHAM from Florida, Senator BOXER from California, Senator DURBIN from Illinois, and Senator DORGAN from North Dakota--talking about the issue of prescription drugs. 
   There isn't a Senator here who does not recognize the importance of this issue primarily with the senior community in America today--primarily with the poorer of that community who cannot afford some of the new drugs that are on the market that are clearly improving their lifestyle, extending their health, and allowing many of our citizens to live better and longer. 
   That is why some of us, if not all of us, for the last couple of years have recognized the need to respond to the prescription drug issue within Medicare as a primary health provider in this country for our seniors. When that belief first came about, it came about in the context of the reform of Medicare. I think it is important to give a little history. 
   With a health care program in this country that is 30 years old, we began to recognize that it was in trouble; that it was continuing to pay for health care needs that were sometimes no longer needed and costs continued to go up. We were constantly working to adjust it. 
   In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we made adjustments. Some of those were right; some of those were wrong. Some of those were interpreted by the Federal health care administrators in a way that Congress didn't intend, and we are going to make some of those corrections this year for nursing homes and hospitals. 
   The fundamental question is and should be, Was Medicare providing the necessary health care needs of our seniors? 
   Out of that grew the prescription drug issue. No question about it, as the President knows, these new designer drugs that are out on the market that are a result of our science, our technology, are doing wonderful things. They are not included. They are not a part of the old Medicare model that we created 30-plus years ago. That is why in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 this Congress and this Senate said: Let's create the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Let's reform it to fit the 21st century and the needs of the seniors of America in the 21st century, and let's do that in the context of shaping it differently, making sure prescription drugs are a piece of it. That will be the new health care paradigm. 
   The President appointed people. We appointed people. We worked. They studied. We brought in the best health care experts in the country and they brought about a report. Something happened along the way. We were getting closer and closer to an election cycle, and it appeared tragically enough that the other side saw this much more as a political issue than a need for substantive reform. As a result, that commission reported it lacked the one vote necessary for a majority to report back to Congress its findings and its proposal for the Congress to act. 
   Interestingly enough, the two Democrats from the Senate, Senator BREAUX and Senator KERREY, who served on that committee, voted for the report. They saw it as a major step in the right direction and, of course, the President's appointees were advised to vote against the report, or so we understand. They voted against it. Eleven votes were needed to approve the commission's recommendation; 10 of the 17 commissioners voted yes. We needed one more and we simply did not get it. 
   Before the vote ever took place, President Clinton announced the commission had failed and that his own advisers would draft a plan to serve the Medicare program. I think what he was saying was that his own advisors would draft a political plan to serve the next Presidential election. 
   The politics of Mediscare and prescription drugs moves now into the political arena. That announcement occurred in March of 1999. It literally was the sounding of a trumpet, the sounding of the fact that prescription drugs and Medicare without reform would become a part of the political mantra of the day; every Senator, Democrat and Republican, recognizing that we had to deal with prescription drugs. In fact, it was interesting to me that Senator BREAUX said: We are not going to fix Medicare; we are going to be looking for issues to beat each other over the head with once again. 
   That is what he said in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of March of 1999--a Democrat, referring to the commission and a failure of the commission and a failure of this President to stand up and be counted for at a time when we had a chance, a window of opportunity to make major national reform in  Medicare and to include prescription drugs in it. We would not be here today voting or debating this issue had that report come forward, been crafted into law, in bill form, and been debated. We would have debated it. With that kind of bipartisan support it could have and it would have happened. But it didn't happen. And tragically enough, it is not going to happen this year. 
   We are engaged in a national debate over which side can provide the best form of prescription drug program for the 
   seniors of America. The debate in the field today between candidate George W. Bush and candidate Vice President AL GORE has now moved to the floor of the Senate. Prior to that debate, the Congress, in its budget resolution, said: Let's put $200 million in there to deal with prescription drugs this year so that seniors who are in true need, the truly neediest of the senior community who are making those choices between food and prescription drugs could be cared for. I hope we can still get them. 
   While we have the national debate ongoing today between Governor Bush and Vice President GORE--and it is an appropriate debate to have--the Vice President, I don't believe, deserves another bite at the apple. He has had 8 years and he had a chance to go to this President and say: Let's do Medicare reform. Let's do it now in a bipartisan way. Let's take this issue off the table. 
   That isn't what happened. It is just too ripe for politics. It is just too tasty an issue to engage in a national debate about it. That is what we are about today. It is now on the floor of the Senate. Vice President GORE has his prescription drug plan out; George W. Bush has proposed his; we will attempt to deal with ours. 
   I have the privilege of now serving on the Finance Committee. The Finance chairman has brought about a bill and we hope to have it on the floor and we hope it will comply with the amount of money necessary in the budget to fund this in the short term to deal with the problem in the immediate sense. Governor Bush says: Let's deal with it now and let's give truly needy seniors the solution to the problem now. 
   And AL GORE says: No, no, no; let's work on this--18 months, 2 years; We will have a better plan; we will have an all-inclusive plan. 
   There are very real differences in what is proposed. Our Vice President says an all-Government plan, Government control, Government managed, universal for everyone. We are saying, no, no, we like the one in the model that the Governor from Texas has put up, with greater flexibility, more choice for seniors. It is very similar to what I have, and very similar to what the Presiding Officer has, under insurance, allowed to be provided for Federal employees by private providers. There is flexibility to make choices. 
   I don't think I want a Federal warehouse in Boise, ID, distributing drugs to seniors 500 miles away at the other end of the State. I want the local pharmacy allowing the local senior to make the choice with his or her doctor as to what their true needs are and for those needs to be covered in Medicare. That is what the seniors of America want. They don't want the Government saying yes or the Government saying no. 
   There are very real and fundamental debates. I suspect we are going to hear Senators such as the Senator from Florida now on the floor--and this is an important issue in a State with so many seniors, as has the State of Florida, and I don't dispute that. But it is important that we engage in this debate and that the American public stop and say, gee, is there a free lunch and are there free drugs? The answer is no. It will cost someone, and it will cost $200 or $300 or $400 or $500 million, or $12 billion a year to do a universal program, or a lot more than that. We know it will be very costly. Therefore, it is right and proper to decide who can afford to pay and who can't afford to pay. 
   How about those seniors who have their own health care program now that pays? Why would AL GORE want to wipe out those insurance programs and go to a Government program? I don't think any seniors who study the program and understand that are going to like that idea. They are going to want their own health care program that they paid for and that maybe is a condition of their retirement coming down from the company they had worked for all their lives. And they ought to have it. That is the kind of flexibility and the dynamics we ought to have in the marketplace. 
   This Congress, in a bipartisan way, will ultimately solve this problem. We can do it this year a little bit of the way to help the truly needy. That is what we ought to do. I hope we can resolve that in a bipartisan fashion. Then we will allow the national debate to go on. We will ask every senior to compare the score charts, the Governor Bush plan versus the Al Gore plan--a Government plan versus a plan of choice, versus a plan of individualism; a relationship between a doctor and his or her patient versus a relationship with a Government provider. 
   That choice is going to be very simple for Americans when they are given it in a clear, understandable way. That is why I am on the floor today. Let's back away from the clutter and the finger pointing. Let's compare the plans--they are both out there now--on a point-by-point basis, and let us do what we can do here this year. 
   We have $200 million built into the budget. We did it in advance, knowing we ought to deal with this issue. We ought to deal with it now for the truly needy seniors of America, those who make the horrible choice of food versus prescription, heat versus prescription. Not in America. Never in America should that be allowed to happen. 
   I hope the politician will step back for a moment from the restrictions or complications of that issue and solve that problem now for our truly needy seniors while we allow the national debate to go on as to what America and American citizens wish to choose as a part of their overall health care needs. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I know we are at or near the close of business of today's session of the Senate. I thought it important that we end up the week with a bit of an analysis of where we are and where we have to get in the next several weeks to complete the business of Government, to fund the necessary agencies, and to be responsible to the American people as it relates to the expenditure of their tax dollars. 
   As most all Americans understand, we are now, fortunately, living with a balanced budget at our Federal Government level; that is, current operating budgets. Many of us in Congress for decades fought to get this budget balanced. It became balanced during a period of unprecedented economic growth in our country. I believe that a balanced budget contributed dramatically to that growth. 
   At the same time as we worked to continue to balance that budget, many of us had wanted to now take some of the unprecedented surpluses of tax dollars that are coming into us and return them to the American taxpayer. We tried to do that this year in two forms: In the reduction or the elimination of the marriage tax penalty, about $1,400 per married couple; and in the near elimination of the death tax; in other words, the taxing of citizens of their wealth or their estates upon the incident of death. Those are two items extremely popular with the American people. 
   Yet in trying to do that, we were told by this administration and by many of my colleagues on the other side that it would wipe out this surplus tax dollar amount--many statements such as that that couldn't be any further from the truth. The reality is that for those two tax packages that were passed by Congress and now vetoed by the President, we are talking of about a dime, one dime out of every surplus dollar, your surplus tax dollar, to be projected to come in to our Government over the next decade. 
   Be that as it may, that is a problem we face. So here we are now working to finalize the work of the Government in the next 3 weeks, and we have an inordinate amount of work to get done. One of my frustrations as a leader on this side in trying to move the process along is that, for the last 6 months, we have heard the rumor, and we have watched the actions of the minority leader and the folks on the other side, which would indicate there was a stalling tactic going on, that somehow they didn't want to get the work done in a timely fashion, that they constantly objected to unanimous consents, and they asked for votes time after time on issues we had already voted on and had been thoroughly debated on the floor of the Senate, from which the political answers had come flowing forth on the debate. 
   Let me give a couple of examples. I am one of those who always comes to the floor when there is a gun debate. Somehow, the other side is saying we have to have more votes on gun issues. Well, I will say this: We have already had 13 votes this session on the gun issue. I am not quite sure how many more we need, or will need, to express to the American people the intent of Republicans versus Democrats versus individual Senators as it comes to this issue. 
   We have had rollcall votes on amendments 403 times; Democrats have proposed 231 and Republicans have proposed 172. Many of these amendments never would make it into policy and had been refused by the authorizing committees but were here either for time taken or for political expressions being made--not for substantive policy reform because we knew it would not happen. 
   On the issue of ``Kennedy Care,'' or health care, we have already had eight votes; and we still are being asked to take more votes on the prescription  drug issue, a Government-run proposal on the part of some. We have had seven votes on that. How many votes does it take to express to the American people the intent of this Congress or this Senate when it comes to a given issue? A once-a-week vote? A once-a-day vote? How about one thorough debate and one vote up or down? That clearly expresses the will and the intent of individual Senators. 
   This last week we have had a very significant debate on the normalization of trade relations with China, known as PNTR, permanent normal trade relations. It is a very important debate and it was handled very well. Most of the amendments have been constructive. But while we have been trying to do this, recognizing our work schedule we have been trying to do a couple of other things. For example, we have been trying to offer up additional amendments, or appropriations bills, or conference reports that will finalize the work of Congress. This is what has happened. It confirms what many expected was true and that was an attempt to slow-roll us or stall us so we could not get our work done. 
   Here is a quote from the USA Today of Friday, September 8. It says:  
   Senator Minority Leader Tom Daschle has a simple strategy for winning the final negotiations over spending bills. Of course, those are the key items that we must finish to finish the work of the Congress so we can adjourn. What is it?  
   He said:  
   Stall until the Republicans have to cave in because they can't wait any longer to recess and get out on the campaign trail.  
   Of course, the logic is simple if you are an insider and 
   you know the workings of the Senate and you know how many are up for reelection.  
   That is because 18 of the 29 Senators seeking reelection are Republicans and 11 are Democrats. There are a lot of vulnerable Republican Senators. I know they want to go home badly.  
   So what is the tactic? Stall, object. One Senator can come to the floor and all he or she has to do is say: Mr. President, I object. That simple action in itself can either take hours or days of debate and break down the process. It can be called a filibuster, or gaining cloture on a vote; but ultimately, and without question, it is a stalling tactic--especially now in light of what the minority leader says. 
   Finally, TOM DASCHLE has come clean. He has openly and publicly said their tactic is to stall. What does stalling really get us? To some who believe in big government, it could probably get them tens of billions dollars more in money to spend on Government programs and, in some instances, more Government control, more Government mandates and, frankly, more Government in your back pocket. 
   People of my thinking would suggest that is bad policy. But the dollars we are talking about, the surplus dollars that we tried to get back to the American people in the form of tax relief, which was vetoed this year by the President, is the kind of money they now want to spend. Oh, these Republicans, if we just stall on them, they are so anxious to go home that they will buy their way out of it in the final hours of the 106th Congress. 
   Senator DASCHLE, Democrats, listen to me, please. We are not going to buy our way out of it. I don't want to buy our way out of it. The American taxpayers don't want us to buy our way out of it. They want good, sound policy, recognizing important programs. But they also know we are increasing Government spending at a near record rate now and, at the same time, we truly do have a surplus that ought to go home to the American taxpayer from whence it came. It is not our money; it is the taxpayers' money. 
   That is why Senator LOTT, the majority leader of the Senate, and Congressman DENNIS HASTERT, the Speaker of the House, in a meeting with President, said: Mr. President, let's take 90 percent of the surplus, if you are not going to let us give it back in taxes, and let's use it to pay down the debt; 90 percent of the surplus could go against the debt. That leaves 10 percent of the surplus to spend on programs. 
   Well, they can't even agree with that on the other side, when the American people are clearly saying: Give us tax relief. But if you can't do that, pay down the debt. 
   For gosh sakes, don't spend that money. Get Americans debt free. Buy down that nearly $6 trillion debt in a way that is manageable, responsible to the economy--but, most importantly, in a way that is responsible to our young people and to their futures. It is a debt they will, obviously, have to assume. 
   Mr. Daschle's answer is to stall. How do you stall? This is how you do it. When the leader comes to the floor and asks unanimous consent that H.R. 3615, the Rural Local Broadcast Signal Act--simple but important, and it is called the rural satellite bill--is ready to go, somebody from the other side stands up and says, ``I object.'' Senator LEAHY did that for Senator DASCHLE. 
   Stalling tactic? You bet. I call that stall No. 1. Here is stall No. 2: H.R. 1776, the national manufactured housing construction bill. It has 32 cosponsors, including Democrats such as Senators BRYAN, CLELAND, and HOLLINGS. The Leader requested, on September 8, to go to a conference to solve our problems. This is for safety requirements for manufactured housing. Senator LEAHY, for Senator DASCHLE, said, ``I object.'' Stall No. 2. 
   Stall No. 3, H.R. 1259, Social Security and Medicare Safety Deposit Act, the lockbox: Democrats and the President are trying to take credit for that right now. They fought us for a year on it. Senator ASHCROFT of Missouri was the one who came up with the idea. News stories are replete about Republicans talking about that idea for the last year and a half. And now, of course, because some folks on the other side of the aisle want credit when we proposed bringing that up to debate it, to have it, and to truly protect Social Security revenues, oops, stall No. 3. 
   This time Senator DASCHLE himself came out and objected to reaffirm what he said to USA Today on September 8. They won't even let that go. 
   Here is stall tactic No. 4, four district judges: We have been criticized all year because we won't confirm the judges the President has sent up. Majority Leader TRENT LOTT brings the judge bill to the floor, judges the Democrats want, judges the Republicans want, but, most importantly, judges that this President sent up. He brought the judges to the floor. Let's see. He brought a judge for Senator DURBIN; he brought a judge for Arizona, and everybody agreed on these judges; DASCHLE himself objected, stall tactic No. 4. 
   These are just functionary, important kinds of necessarily ``get done if you can'' kinds of things. We have time to do it. It doesn't require lots of debate. But it clearly appears to me that no action goes forth. And if we can stop that action, surely those Republicans in time will cave. 
   Here is stall tactic No. 5, intelligence authorization: A request to go to the conference with Democrat amendments submitted to DASCHLE through a staff channel on September 7--no response from DASCHLE or others--with an indication that Democrats are preparing additional amendments, stall tactic No. 5. 
   My goodness, aren't we going to get these authorizations done? They are very important. 
   Here are four nominations to the U.S. Institute for Peace. I am not going to stand here and suggest the Democrats aren't for peace. We are all for peace. But at least they objected to moving nominations on the Institute for Peace; stall No. 6. 
   A document that made stall No. 7 happen on the 13th of this month was a major report coming out of our Federal Government saying that violence in the media, violence in video games, violence on television, and violence in the movies is truly producing a culture of violence that could and appears to be translating into violent youth of America with young people witnessing over 100,000 acts of violence, actually watching on television, although acted and cast--8,000 murders during their young lifetime. Somehow that is important. We have been talking about it for years as being darned important. 
   Senator JOE LIEBERMAN, now Vice-Presidential candidate, proposed what is known as the ``Media Violence Labeling and Advertising Act of 2000.'' Senator JOHN MCCAIN supported him. It is bipartisan with Democrats and Republicans, and now a national issue made true by studies and analyses of our Federal Government as to the impact on young people. We brought it to the floor. That is S. 2497, bipartisan  legislation, and there was objection to the unanimous consent to move it forward. 
   For the week, that is stall tactic No. 7. 
   What will next week hold? We are going to conclude PNTR on a vote on Tuesday, I believe. We have numerous appropriations 
   bills that ought to be dealt with. Hopefully, we can and will deal with them and in doing so pick up the pace around here and get our work done so that we can adjourn--so that we can send a very clear message to the American people of the intent of this Congress to balance the budget; to hold sacred the Social Security surplus; to make sure that we deal with health care in a responsible way for our citizens; hopefully that we could give back a few of these surplus tax dollars, but if we can't do that, at least dedicate a large portion of it to debt buy-down so that young people in their lifetime won't have to finance the debt structure of the generation before them. 
   Those are responsible and right things to do, and I hope we can do them. But I will be back next week to talk probably about stall tactic No. 8, No. 9, No. 10, and No. 11. At least I am going to until the minority leader comes to the floor and he recants and says that he didn't say this or that this isn't a strategy because if it is a strategy, it is bad politics, and it is darned bad government to simply say, no, we are not going to work until we get the right to spend billions and billions of dollars of more money. That is not bipartisan. Most importantly, that is bad policy. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, while I came to the floor to speak on another issue, before I do that, I want to respond to the remarks of the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   There is a very real difference between what Vice President GORE is talking about and Gov. George Bush is talking about. Senator KENNEDY has effectively outlined it today. Senator KENNEDY said let the Government run your health care; let the Government make your choices; let the Government control the process. 
   The seniors of America do want choice. They want the same kind of health program Senator KENNEDY has and this Senator has. They want choice, and they want flexibility in the marketplace. That is the kind of program we are talking about offering them. 
   I cannot imagine we would want another federalized health care program where the Government tells the senior community of our country what kind of prescription drug they will get and where they will get it. 
   Those are very real differences that I am afraid were avoided in the comments this morning.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about a significant date in this Nation's fight against terrorism. This week marks the Clinton-Gore administration's decision to jeopardize American lives by surrendering to one of the most violent terrorist groups ever to operate on this country's soil. 
   One year ago this week, President Clinton opened the jailhouse doors for 11 members of a terrorist group known as the FALN, which is dedicated to the violent pursuit of Puerto Rican independence. The FALN has claimed responsibility for some 130 bombings at civilian, political, and military sites in the United States. In all, the group murdered six Americans and maimed, often permanently, 84 others, including law enforcement officers. 
   On one occasion, members attacked a Navy bus in Puerto Rico killing two sailors and wounding nine others. As a result, 16 members of this violent terrorist group were convicted of dozens of felonies against the United States, and as soon as these 16 were in prison, the bombings stopped. 
   I note that these violent terrorists were convicted of at least 36 counts of violating Federal firearms control laws. So at the same time the Clinton-Gore administration was demanding more gun control--and we have heard it for hours and hours on end on 
   the floor of the Senate and certainly the White House has spoken openly for gun control over the last number of years--not only were they failing to enforce current gun laws already on the books, but when those laws are enforced, they brush aside felony convictions as a political favor to their friends.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. He so clearly spells out the frustration Americans have when we are going to be tough against terrorism and then see a President offering clemency. 
   In 1982, the FALN detonated four powerful bombs in New York's financial district and demanded better treatment for 11 of their jailed comrades and members. One year ago this week, President Clinton freed 8 of those 11, shredding the longstanding policy of the United States of not granting concessions to terrorists. 
   Any reasonable American has to ask, Why would the President do it? What is he doing setting violent terrorists free to once again roam the streets of America? None of these terrorists contested the evidence brought against them at trial. None of these terrorists apologized to their victims. In fact, at least one of the freed terrorists stated that he felt no remorse whatsoever for his crimes. None of these terrorists were ever asked to be let out of prison. The FBI asked the President not to do it. The Federal Bureau of Prisons asked the President not to do it. 
   Had he bothered to ask the victims of the FALN and their families, they would have begged him not to do it. He did it anyway, and we are not quite sure why. 
   Internal White House documents tell us, ``The Vice President's Puerto Rican position would be helped,'' clearly demonstrating an impulse to jeopardize public safety for political gain. Political gain by setting terrorists loose. 
   A former political adviser to President Clinton put it this way:  
   Anyone who doesn't believe the timing, and the likely substance of [President Clinton's] decision was linked to the [First Lady's] courtship of New York's large Puerto Rican [community] is too naive for politics.  
   If there is one thing this administration has accomplished in its 8 years, it is to shatter my naivete or my trust that when the President stands up and speaks, that there is not some political or clandestine motive behind his very actions. 
   One year later, what do we have? Eleven violent terrorists at large on our streets; two more to be released this coming year. True, there have not been any killings that we can link to the terrorists since that time, but they are loose on the streets of America demonstrating at least that this President has violated a cardinal rule in our country: the United States does not make concessions to terrorists. 
   For that action, one year ago today, Democrats and Republicans stood on this floor and condemned this deplorable act. Interestingly, when I began to look into this, I saw that AL GORE's running mate Senator JOE LIEBERMAN stood up to the President and condemned his actions. Even the First Lady stood up to the President and condemned his actions. Just about the only politician in Washington who has yet to stand up to Bill Clinton is Vice President AL GORE. 
   As Vice President of the United States, AL GORE could have intervened. He could have talked to the President, said that this is madness to let terrorists loose after they have been convicted, to shred gun control laws. But AL GORE did not lift a finger to protect the FALN's next victims. All he said was, quote:  
   I'm not going to stand in judgment of his decision.  
   Not going to stand in judgment? When a madman killed 168 people in a single bombing in Oklahoma City, AL GORE said, and I quote:  
   [T]o those of you who doubt our resolve in America, listen closely. If you plot terror or act on those designs, within our borders or without, against American citizens, we will hunt you down and stop you cold.  
   I guess what he is saying is: Bomb innocent Americans, and AL GORE will stop you cold. But if you use small bombs, and you only kill a few Americans, and you fit our political needs, then we will release you. 
   Mr. Vice President, maybe it is time you stand up and clarify for America what you really believe. 
   Mr. Vice President, how hard is it to say: ``Violent terrorists belong in jail''? How hard is it to say: ``I will not reward terrorism''? How hard is it to tell the American people: ``I will not release violent terrorists from prison for political gain''?

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in conjunction with the administration, and  the members of the Budget Committee, we have made a series of technical changes to S. 1608 as it was reported by the committee. These changes are designed to: (1) respond to the concerns of some members with the bill as reported; (2) address some additional issues raised by the Administration; (3) rectify technical problems with the bill; as well as (4) bring the bill's costs in line with the amount provided in fiscal year 2001 budget resolution. Let me briefly describe the most important changes for the benefit of the Senate. We have modified the formula used to calculate the ``full payment amount'' to which states are entitled from the Forest Service under this bill. Rather than having this payment calculated on the average of the three highest 25 percent payments for each eligible county within each state, the calculations will be based upon the average of the three highest 25 percent payments for each state during the fiscal years of the eligible years period. We also reduced the annual adjustment for inflation. These changes will reduce the cost of the bill as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office from $1.46 billion over a 5-year period to around $1.1 billion over the same period. 
   In section 102(a) and section 103(a), we clarify that the duration of the bill will be fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2006. It is the manager's intent that this bill be sunsetted after six years. This language, and new language in section 209 and section 303 added by the manager's amendment emphasizes this for the purpose of clarity. We made a minor change to clarify that eligible counties that receive less than $100,000 in payments for fiscal year 2001 may elect to expend all of this money for schools and roads, whether or not the payment increases slightly in out-years as a result of the inflation adjustment. This change will assist counties with small revenue distributions. 
   In section 202, we clarify that projects funded under this bill can be conducted on public or private lands as long as there is a benefit to federally managed resources. The committee bill was not sufficiently precise in this regard. In section 203(b)(6), we added language to more fully describe the kind of monitoring plans that we would like to see associated with projects approved under the bill. In section 204(e)(3), we elected to put some quantitative targets on the pilot projects that the bill authorizes for merchantable materials, with an out-year adjustment based upon the results of a GAO audit. We are hopeful that the administration will move aggressively to implement this pilot project, and report on its progress promptly and thoroughly to Congress. In section 401, we clarified that the bill authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 2001 through 2006. This is to emphasize that this is a six-year bill. 
   In section 402(b), we specify that any revenues generated by projected funded by monies authorized under this bill should be returned to the Treasury, except in the single case where a project is jointly funded by both project and non-federal revenues. The portion of revenues associated with funds provided by this bill would be retained by the appropriate Secretary. The proportion of revenues associated with funds provided by non-federal sources would be shared with those sources. This change is designed to address the concern that allowing revenues generated by projects to be retained by federal agencies would create an unwelcome incentive to focus exclusively on revenue-generating projects. Our amendment addresses this concern in an equitable fashion. 
   With regard to the projects funded under this bill, we added language in section 204 to assure that projects will improve the maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement stewardship objectives that enhance forest ecosystems, or restore and improve land health and water quality. We also specify that fifty percent of the project money shall be used for projects that involve road maintenance or obliteration, or the restoration of streams and watersheds. These changes are designed to encourage the development of projects that foster resource stewardship. To provide the counties that elect to participate in projects a wider range of choices, we have added a title III to the bill. Under the provisions of title III, counties may choose to invest their project money in a list of authorized uses including: (1) search, rescue, and emergency services; (2) community service work camps; (3) easement purchases from willing sellers to provide access to public lands; 94) forest related educational programs; (5) local fire prevention and fire risk reduction planning activities; and (6) community forestry projects. These projects would still be developed and recommended through the local resource advisory committees established in title II of the bill. They will function much as they do in title II, except that the projects will not require the approval of the Secretary, as would title II projects. Also, under the specific terms of section 102(d)(1)(B) and section 102(c)(1)(B) counties could split their project funds between titles II and III as they choose. 
   We have also added a new title V to the bill to remedy a serious problem caused by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 involving the sharing with the states of onshore mineral revenues and revenues from geothermal steam. Prior to the 1993 act the federal government and the states split these revenues on a fifty-fifty basis. The 1993 act requires that the federal government deduct its previous years expenses for administering these programs from the receipts before the fifty-fifty split is made. This requirement has proven very difficult to implement due to general sloppiness of federal accounting systems. The federal agencies and the states have become involved in numerous disputes over the federal government's calculation of its administrative expenses. In light of these problems, with the advice and the assistance of Senators DOMENICI and BINGAMAN, we propose to return to the pre-1993 system of calculating shared receipts. 
   Finally, we have added a conforming amendment in section 4 of the bill. This amendment specifies that payments required by this bill would be included in the calculation of the payment in lieu of taxes (PILT) payments that each state receives. This change will result in payments under this act being treated in the same fashion as other natural resource payments to the states. 
   I appreciate the cooperation of several of my colleagues in developing the changes that went into the manager's amendment. I particularly want to thank Senator DOMENICI and Senator BINGAMAN and their staffs for their assistance in putting together the manager's amendment.

   Mr. CRAIG. Yes it is our intent that the Secretary would select an individual from each example group in each of the three categories of community interests listed in section 205(d) when representatives of that group are interested in the management of the public lands overseen by a particular advisory committee.

   Mr. CRAIG. The plain language of these sections provides such flexibility. I agree with some who have stated that would be the best policy, and the language would provide such an opportunity. I will leave it to the implementing agencies to decide how to best express the flexibility provided by these sections of statute.

   Mr. CRAIG. The bill language in titles II and III provides that they will function in much the same way, with a few differences. First, they are advisory to the Secretary in title II and to the relevant county in title III. In neither case do they actually approve projects, but their recommendation is required. If there is no recommendation under title II the money will ultimately be returned to Treasury under the terms of section 209. If there is no recommendation under title III, the counties can ultimately spend the money on title III projects under the terms of section 303. It is my expectation that the authority of neither of these sections will be required. I believe that the resource advisory committees will find consensus in developing and recommending title II and title III projects with the respective Secretaries or counties as the case may be.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will briefly respond to my colleague from Oregon in relation to the legislation about which he has just spoken. I certainly agree with him. He and I, working together--I as chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee, he as the ranking member--saw and recognized a crisis in the rural communities of America that were once named timber dependent because they had derived a share of their revenue to fund their schools, roads, and bridge funds from the revenue of timber receipts which have faded dramatically. We began to work together on a resolution of the problem, and tonight we have brought that to the floor. 
   I certainly agree with Senator WYDEN. It was contentious at times, but we saw the need to respond to what literally had become a national crisis in rural resource-dependent communities across our country. 
   Well over 4,000 school districts and nearly 50,000 children were victimized by actions or policies that failed to recognize that we had to adjust law and/or change policy or we were simply going to find these school districts beyond their capacities not only to fund but to educate. It was also true with counties' roads and bridge funds. 
   The legislation that has just passed the Senate tonight sets us in a direction of resolving that problem and bringing about a resolution through a collaborative process at the local level between so many stakeholders who have legitimate concerns and interests as to how the natural resources of our public lands be managed. 
   I am so pleased that we could work toward an end that we have arrived at tonight that is embodied in S. 1608. We still have work to do in adjusting our public policies to bring about the kind of balance we need. 
   As the Presiding Officer well understands, rural America, be it agricultural policy or resource policy, finds itself with very real problems today. It is going to be incumbent upon some of us in this body to try to address those problems, both in the adjustment of policy and certainly in the recognition of the necessary resources to help these communities. Tonight, in part, we will have responded to that need.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, soon the Senate will take up S. 1938, the Cabin User Fee Fairness Act of 1999. It is designed to set a new course for the Forest Service in determining fees for forest lots on which families and individuals have been authorized to build cabins for seasonal recreation since the early part of this century. 
   In 1915, under the Term Permit Act, Congress set up a program to give families the opportunity to recreate on our public lands through the so-called recreation residence program. Today, 15,000 of these forest cabins remain, providing generation after generation of families and their friends a respite from urban living and an opportunity to use our public lands. 
   These cabins stand in sharp contrast to many aspects of modern outdoor recreation, yet are an important aspect of the mix of recreation opportunities for the American public. While many of us enjoy fast, off-road machines and watercraft or hiking to the backcountry with high-tech gear, others enjoy a relaxing weekend at their cabin in the woods with their family and friends. 
   The recreation residence programs allows families all across the country an opportunity to use our national forests. This quiet, somewhat uneventful program continues to produce close bonds and remarkable memories for hundreds of thousands of Americans, but in order to secure the future of the cabin program, this Congress needs to reexamine the basis on which fees are now being determined. 
   Roughly twenty years ago, the Forest Service saw the need to modernize the regulations under which the cabin program is administered. Acknowledging that the competition for access and use of forest resources has increased dramatically since 1915, both the cabin owners and the agency wanted a formal understanding about the rights and obligations of using and maintaining these structures. 
   New rules that resulted nearly a decade later reaffirmed the cabins as a valid recreational use of forest land. At the same time, the new policy reflected numerous limitations on use that are felt to be appropriate in order keep areas of the forest where cabins are located open for recreational use by other forest visitors. Commercial use of the cabins is prohibited, as is year-round occupancy by the owner. Owners are restricted in the size, shape, paint color and presence of other structures or installations on the cabin lot. The only portion of a lot that is controlled by the cabin owner is that portion of the lot that directly underlies the footprint of the cabin itself. 
   At some locations, the agency has determined a need to remove cabins for a variety of reasons related to ``higher public purposes,'' and cabin owners wanted to be certain in the writing of new regulations that a fair process would guide any future decisions about cabin removal. At other locations, some cabins have been destroyed by fire, avalanche or falling trees, and a more reliable process of determining whether such cabins might be rebuilt or relocated was needed. It was determined, therefore, that this recreational program would be tied more closely to the forest planning process. 
   The question of an appropriate fee to be paid for the opportunity of constructing and maintaining a cabin in the woods was also addressed at that time. Although the agency's 
   policies for administration of the cabin program have, overall, held up well over time, the portion dealing with periodic redetermination of fees proved in the last few years to be a failure. 
   A base fee was determined twenty years ago by an appraisal of sales of ``comparable'' undeveloped lots in the real estate market adjacent to the national forest where a cabin was located. The new policy called for reappraisal of the value of the lot twenty years later--a trigger that led to initiation of the reappraisal process in 1995. 
   In the meantime, according to the policy, annual adjustments to the base fee would be tracked by the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD), which proved to be a faulty mechanism for this purpose.  Annual adjustments to the fee based on movements of the IPD failed entirely to keep track of the booming land values associated with recreation development. 
   As the results of actual reappraisals on the ground began reaching my office in 1997, it became clear that far more than the inoperative IPD was out of alignment in determining fees for the cabin owners. 
   At the Pettit Lake tract in Idaho's Sawtooth National Recreation Area, the new base fees skyrocketed into alarming five-digit amounts--so high that a single annual fee was nearly enough money to buy raw land outside the forest and construct a cabin. Meanwhile, the agency's appraisal methodology was resulting in new base fees in South Dakota, in Florida, and in some locations in Colorado that were actually lower than the previous fee. 
   At the request of the chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture in 1998, the cabin owners named a coalition of leaders of their various national and state cabin owner associations to examine the methodology being used by the Forest Service to determine fees. It became obvious to these laymen that analysis of appraisal methodology and the determination of fees was beyond their grasp, and a respected consulting appraiser was retained to guide the cabin owners through their task. The report and recommendations of the coalition's consulting appraiser is available from my office for those who might wish to examine the details. This legislation reflects the coalition's consulting appraiser's report and comments from the Administration and the appraiser they hired to review their appraisal process. 
   This is highly technical legislation. Its purpose is to send a clear set of instructions to appraisers in the field and a clear set of instructions to forest managers to respect the results of appraisals undertaken to place value on the raw land being offered cabin owners. Additionally, the purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the cabin program continues long into the future, that it provides a fair return to the taxpayers, and continues to generate a profit for the Treasury. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis for S. 1938 be entered into the RECORD following this statement.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to call attention to some unfinished business from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In this landmark legislation, Congress directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine to study medical nutrition therapy as a potential benefit to the Medicare program. 
   In December of last year, the Institute of Medicine released their study. They found that nutrition therapy has been shown to be effective in the management and the treatment of many chronic conditions which affect Medicare beneficiaries, including high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart failure, diabetes, and kidney disease. They also found that Medicare beneficiaries undergoing cancer treatment may benefit from nutrition therapy aimed at controlling side effects or improving food intake. They recommended that medical nutrition therapy--with physician referral--be covered as a benefit under the Medicare program. 
   I have been working with my friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN, for the last several years on medical nutrition therapy legislation. The bill we introduced establishes a new Medicare outpatient benefit that would allow our senior citizens to work with a registered dietitian or nutrition professional to learn how to manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. 
   This legislation, S. 660, has been cosponsored by 35 of our colleagues. Its House companion, sponsored by Representative NANCY JOHNSON, has been supported by two-thirds of the House Members. 
   As Congress considers additional refinements to the Balanced Budget Act, we must be certain that we keep our focus on the beneficiary. In addition to providing health care providers with needed relief, we must seize the opportunity to give our Nation's seniors access to medical nutrition therapy. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with Senator BINGAMAN and I to take care of this unfinished business before this Congress ends. We must make certain that action on medical nutrition therapy coverage occurs this year. 
   I hope my colleagues will join with me on this issue. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, first of all, for being on the floor this morning to discuss what I think is a very important issue. For any of us who were listening to the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Massachusetts, let me see if I can get this together. 
   If you are for the Gore prescription drug health plan, then you are going to have a major premium increase, and you may get the plan in 8 years. It will be a Government plan, and it will be a major Government takeover of health care for the seniors in this country. And it will be limited to no choice. 
   If you accept what Governor Bush is proposing, then you have a substantially greater choice. The plan is back to the States, where doctors and nurses and local health care delivery systems deliver it, and you do not move toward a major federalization of health care. 
   We had this debate in 1992 and 1993. About 70 percent of the citizens of the country said: We don't want the Federal Government as the deliverer of health care and health care components, including prescription drugs. 
   Is there a difference in the debate today? Not at all. Do the seniors of America want the Federal Government to control their health care or do they want to control it themselves with optimum choices, similar to what we as employees of the Federal Government have today? The Federal Government doesn't control our health care. We choose. We pay some premium, obviously, to offset the costs, and we have choice in the marketplace. 
   I think as the debate goes on through September and October, the clear differences will come out, and they will be very simple. I think it is important that we think of it that way. It is called ``Gore and the Federal Government and health care,'' or ``George W. Bush and you and your choice at the local level delivering health care for yourselves with optimum choices and flexibility.''

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have to respond to something that was in today's USA Today paper, September 8. I know the Presiding Officer is a member of our leadership. Let me, for a few moments, tell you what he and I are going to expect in the final month of this Congress. I am quoting now an article about Senate minority leader TOM DASCHLE. It is reported here that they have a simple strategy; the Democrats have a simple strategy for winning the final negotiations over spending. 
   In other words, they want to spend more of your money than we are proposing to be spent by some billions of dollars. Here is their strategy, and he admitted it: Stall until the Republicans have to cave in because they can't wait any longer to recess. That means shut the Congress down and get out on the campaign trail. Why? Well, because 18 of the 29 Senators seeking reelection are Republicans this year and 11 are Democrats, and there are a lot of vulnerable Republicans, according to Senator DASCHLE. He says, ``We only have one vulnerable Democrat, and he happens to be just across the river.'' I think he was probably referring to Senator CHUCK ROBB. 
   Well, if that is the strategy of the Democrats, let me repeat it because that is what they have been doing for 3 long months: Stall, stall, stall. Yet they turn around and tell our friends in the press it is a ``do-nothing Congress.'' I don't see how the press can mix that one up as much as they have. You have the minority leader of the Senate admitting that their strategy for the balance of September will be to stall until the Republicans cave. 
   Thank you, Mr. DASCHLE, for telling us your plan. We will attempt to offset those by working as hard as we can. It probably means we will be working late into the night so that we can get the work of the Congress done, get our appropriations bills finished, deal with the most important trade issue that is on the floor--PNTR--and that is, of course, permanent normal trade relation status for China.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for a few moments this morning, before we get on with the debate on PNTR, I want to deal with an issue happening in New York City right now. Our President is up there at the United Nations Millennium Summit. Mr. President, there is something going on on the side. In a back room, the President of the United States has been sitting down with a Saudi Arabian sheik. Here is why: He is begging. The President of the United States is begging a Saudi sheik to reach over and turn their oil spigot on a little more and increase their output of oil by about 700,000 barrels a day. Why? Because in the last few days, crude prices have spiked to an all-time high of $35.39 a barrel. 
   Why has that happened? Because the market has analyzed that there isn't enough oil and the demand is ever increasing, and there is no strategy in  this country to solve it. In May and June of this year, the President tried to cover his tracks by sending the Secretary of Energy to Saudi Arabia to beg, tin cup in hand. At that time, I think the press called it the ``tin cup energy policy'' of this administration. Well, today in New York City, behind closed doors, the President of the United States--this great and all-powerful country--is begging a small country in the Middle East for just a little more oil. 
   Here is what the market analysts are saying. They have said that they fear that even the 700,000-barrel increase will not be enough to curb the jump in prices for crude oil contracts in the futures market. I mentioned yesterday they jumped to $35.39 a barrel. That is a phenomenal spike. This price is the highest since, of course, the battles of the Persian Gulf war of 1990. Why is this happening? Well, many of us stood on the floor in May and June and July and discussed the energy of our country and our energy needs. We were very frustrated at that time because we had 8 years of no energy policy. You know, AL GORE has been OPEC's best friend. There is no question about that. This administration and Vice President GORE, during their tenure in office, have allowed domestic oil production to drop by 17 percent and oil imports to go up by at least 14, and maybe as high as 20 percent. Oil imports averaged about 56 percent of all of our consumption, and now they are predicted to be well over 64 percent in the year 2020. 
   Of course, there is a simple reason for that: For 8 long years, this administration has had no policy. Let me tell you what Vice President AL GORE has said. He says he wants to increase the use of natural gas, although it has nearly quadrupled in price. Yet he wants to cancel existing leases. Here is his quote:  
   I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no new drilling, even in areas already leased by previous administrations.  
   Here is a man asking to be President of the United States; yet he is out in the field today campaigning and saying: I guarantee you there will be no more increased production in this country, while his President, behind closed doors in New York, is begging a foreign nation to open its valves and increase production. Does it make any sense for this great Nation to be on its knees begging Arab sheiks of the OPEC nations to increase production while we go around saying we are going to decrease production? 
   During the Clinton-Gore administration, there has been no energy policy, no domestic oil or gas exploration or production--in 8 long years. No new oil refineries. In fact, because of a lack of policy and compliance with the Clean Air Act in this country, in the last 8 years, we have closed 36 oil refineries. That is a staggering amount. We have closed 36 oil refineries in the past 8 years. There is no new use of coal. EPA has tried to shut down coal fired plants and are now suing some in the East because they don't think they are in compliance with certain standards. There is no new nuclear power. In fact, quite the opposite has happened. We have tried here to solve the gridlock over the production of energy and electricity by nuclear power, only to have items vetoed time and again by the President. 
   Now, yesterday, the President said oil prices are too high. Gee whiz, Bill, where have you been all summer? You're darn right they are too high. You have done nothing about it nor has your Vice President, except to say we will shut down production. He even went on to say that it will impact not just America but it could result in a world impact, and it could result in the specter of a recession here or abroad if oil-producing countries do not raise production to bring down soaring crude prices. 
   Well, what about production in our country? What are you doing here, Vice President GORE? I will tell you what you are doing here. You are saying: I am not going to allow new drilling; I am going to shut off the areas where you can drill. I don't want to see more production in this country. 
   That doesn't make a lot of sense. 
   Here is GORE's new energy plan: 
   Don't develop proven domestic energy; 
   Give $75 billion in new subsidies for new renewables and new technology. 
   OK. Homeowner in the Northeast: You are just about to see your costs for heat this winter go up 35, or 40, or 50 percent. The message to you, homeowner, in the Northeast is: Vice President GORE is going to invest $75 billion in subsidies and in new renewables, and in 10 or 15 years you can put a solar cell up or we can put a wind machine out on the Adirondacks, and somehow we will generate this new abundance of energy. 
   That is the answer for the problem today. That is the answer you are being given. That will not work tomorrow. It will not work a week from now. 
   I support renewables. We ought to clearly drive ourselves in that direction as best we can. But my guess is when what is going on today translates into the price of gas at the pump, and when the oil truck backs up to your home in New York or Connecticut this winter and sticks the hose in the oil barrel and starts cranking in the fuel oil that will heat your home, and it is going to double or triple your fuel oil costs, if it is available, who are you going to blame? Who are you going to blame because of this dramatic increase? 
   My suggestion is that fingers deserve to be pointed to an administration that has had no energy policy, has worked to shut down all increased production, and, in fact, in a rather swaggering way has suggested we will not drill anymore. We will not produce anymore. It is somehow environmentally wrong to produce oil and energy in this country. That is a fundamentally critical thing with which we have to deal. 
   We have attempted to deal with it in the Senate. We have dealt with these issues on a regular basis. We have introduced legislation to bring about that increased production. We have suggested that these great oil reserves we still have remaining in our country be allowed to be drilled, and in an environmentally safe and sound way, that we bring our production back on line. 
   In the nonlarge oil producing segment of our country, a segment called stripper wells, oftentimes owned by farmers and ranchers through the Southeast, the South, and the upper Midwest--if we, by tax incentives alone, would guarantee them a margin, we could see a million barrels a day come back on line--our oil; money that stays in our country and doesn't go to Saudi Arabia to buy the limousines or the G-4 jet airplanes of the OPEC sheiks. 
   What is wrong with that policy, Mr. President? What is wrong with that policy, Mr. GORE? Is it wrong to support domestic production at home? I think not. 
   This is an issue we will spend a good deal more time with in the coming days. But I thought with this press release coming out of New York today, and we know the President has been talking with the Arab sheiks yesterday, Mr. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, quit begging. Don't beg these nations to produce. Turn our producers loose. Let us produce. Let us become the great producing country again. Let us be the masters of our own destiny. Don't apologize. And don't suggest to somebody this winter when their heating bill goes up that it is some Arab sheik's problem, that they shut the oil off. No. In the last 8 years, you have shut the oil off, Mr. GORE. You have shut the 
   oil off, Mr. Clinton, because your policies have denied production and brought production down at a time when we were increasing consumption and were the beneficiaries of that consumption by an ever increased standard of living in our country. 
   I am not ashamed, nor will I apologize for the citizens of my State because they want to be consumers. But I will be angry about a government that denies the kind of production that keeps the strong economy. And that is exactly what is going on. In our great country today, the only energy policy that exists in the Clinton/Gore administration is a policy of begging, begging the producing nations of this world to please turn on the valves and give us a few more barrels of oil in hopes that it will drive the price down. The analysts say it won't. 
   This winter, as we grow increasingly cold, I am very fearful the citizens of the Northeast and in other cold areas, especially those who still use heating oil for their space heat, will find the price tag getting even higher, and my colleagues will be on the floor asking that we offset that with Federal tax  dollars. I will not blame them for asking that. 
   But once again I will ask: Where was Mr. GORE? Where was Mr. Clinton for these 8 long years when they knew the day would come that there would be no oil to burn and we would have to beg to get oil? 
   I yield the floor. I see the principals are on the floor to continue the debate on PNTR with China. I hope we can move that expeditiously today. Thank you.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing, along with my colleague, Senator CRAPO a bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the Bureau of Reclamation's interests in portions of the Ridenbaugh Canal system of the Boise River to the Nampa Meridian Irrigation District. The public comment period for the National Environmental Policy Act process has not been completed, and it is my intent to request a Committee hearing to discuss any issues concerning this transfer. Thus, any parties interested in this matter will have ample opportunity to express their concerns related to title transfer. 
   The transfer of title is not a new idea. Authority to transfer title to the All American Canal is contained in section 7 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928. General authority is contained in the 1955 Distribution Systems Loan Act. Recently, Congress passed legislation dealing with a transfer to the Minidoka Irrigation Project and the Burley Irrigation District. 
   The Nampa Meridian Irrigation District diverts water from the Boise River into a system of canals and laterals known as the Ridenbaugh Canal system for delivery to lands in the district and provides drainage for district lands. Since 1878 when the Ridenbaugh Canal was first constructed, Nampa Meridian Irrigation District has been responsible for operating and maintaining the delivery and drainage system, and all project costs have been paid to the federal government. 
   Reclamation's interests consist of only five percent (5%) of the canals, laterals and drains and associated fee title and easements in their delivery and drainage systems. These segments were constructed for the delivery and drainage of irrigation water. The purposes and uses of Reclamation's interests in these segments are to access, operate, maintain, and repair Nampa Meridian Irrigation District's irrigation and drainage systems. Reclamation has never operated or maintained any portion of the Nampa Meridian Irrigation District's delivery or drainage systems. 
   This project is a perfect example of the federal government maintaining only a bare title, and that title should now be transferred to the project recipients who have paid for the facilities and interests of the Nampa Meridian Irrigation District.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, one of the Power Marketing Administrations, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is working with other transmission-owning electric utilities to file a document with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in October evidencing an intent to form a regional transmission organization in the Northwest. It is my understanding that this language would give BPA the authority to engage in the activities necessary to making that filing. Is that correct?

It is also my understanding that the Department of Energy is currently of the opinion that no further legislation would be needed in order for BPA to actually participate in a Northwest regional transmission organization. However, issues may  arise as a result of the October filing, or otherwise, that would necessitate further legislation before BPA participates in the Northwest regional transmission organization. If such legislation is necessary, would the Chairman and the Senator from Washington be willing to work with me to enact it expeditiously, so as to not delay the actual operation of the Northwest regional transmission organization?

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate this afternoon to discuss a motion to proceed on what many of us believe to be a very important issue, and that is Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for China. 
   While this issue has been a long time in coming to the floor of the Senate, its time has come. Our Nation, for a good number of years, has pursued a relationship with mainland China to improve the trade and commerce flows that are critical to this country. The agreement that we are here to ultimately get to final debate and passage on, is an agreement that allows an unprecedented access to the China market. 
   I support PNTR for China because it will seal the deal on the U.S.-China Bilateral Agreement and finally allow U.S. business and farmers the access to Chinese markets that the Chinese have to our market. In other words, America has had a relatively open market to China while China's market has been, for all intents and purposes, closed--except by category and by definition. Passage of PNTR will help pave the way for China's eventual membership in the World Trade Organization. 
   I think, as you would probably agree, all of these are critical in our relationship to this very large country and the role that it will inevitably play in our future world. This deal cuts the barriers to trade that U.S. farmers and businesses have unfairly encountered for decades. It serves Idaho because it slashes tariffs on exports critical to Idaho's economy. 
   Let me give a couple of examples. On U.S. priority industry products, tariffs will fall to 7.1 percent. Tariffs will fall on several products that are critical to my State, including wood and paper, which are critical to my State; chemicals, a growing industry in my State; and capital and medical equipment. In information technology--now a very important part of Idaho's economy--the tariff on products, such as computers, semiconductors, and all Internet-related equipment will fall from an average of 13 percent to zero by the year 2005. 
   On U.S. priority agricultural products, tariffs will be reduced from an average of 35.1 percent to 14 percent by January of 
   2004, at the latest. It will also expand market access for U.S. corn, cotton, wheat, rice, barley, soybeans, meat, and other products. 
   I think we all know the current state of the agricultural economy, and while we will set policy, to hopefully help production agriculture, we have always known that knocking down trade barriers and expanding the world marketplace for our producers in agricultural products remains critical. We have long since passed the day when we are the consumers of all that we produce. Now, well over 50 percent of everything a farmer or rancher produces on his or her property has to be sold in world markets to maintain current economies and to improve the profitability of those individual operations. 
   China, without question, is struggling today to determine what it will do in agriculture. Without question, it will want to feed itself and to continue to do so. Any nation worth its own gravity wants to provide food and fiber for its own citizens. But as that economy improves--and it is improving--the ability of disposable income in the hands of the mainland Chinese means that they will want to buy more of a variety of products that our tremendous agricultural economy produces. This is merely a step, and that is why I say dropping tariffs from 31.5 percent to 14.5 percent by the year 2004 is significant. As we work with them, those  tariffs could actually drop more rapidly in that area with additional agreements. There is no question that future Administrations in this country will continue to pressure the Chinese to move in the direction of even lower tariffs, but that significant drop of over 15 percent will rapidly enhance agricultural opportunities for sales to China. 
   The United States needs this deal. We are the strongest economy in the world and, as a Senator, would I stand here and say we need this deal? Yes, because we do. The U.S. trade deficit with China is large and continuing to widen. The deficit surged from $6.2 billion in 1989 to nearly $57 billion in 1998. And it continues to rise. 
   That statement alone is proof that our economy has been a largely open economy and theirs has been a relatively closed economy. This agreement, however, rapidly moves them toward a much more open economy and, therefore, spells in very simple language an opportunity for American business and industry and America's working men and women to expand the products they produce to sell into the Chinese markets. 
   In addition to reducing barriers to trade, it will also force China to play by the rules. 
   There is, I guess, a bit of a saying that when you deal with the Chinese on the mainland, you sign the contract, and then you begin to negotiate. In this country, when you sign the contract, you have made the agreement. The negotiation is complete. That is why bringing them on line with PNTR and into WTO means that not only will they have to ultimately play by the rules, but there will be a learning process for them as well. In working with the dispute mechanisms of the WTO they will obviously learn that as they move more aggressively into world markets, there is a rule of law that we have all trading nations of the world play by; that is, a rule of fair trade based on the standards established and negotiated within the agreements. 
   Let me give you an example of the problems we face today. 
   Idaho is known for its beautiful orchards. Of course, the State of Washington--our neighbor--is known for more orchards and that fine red apple that many of us see on the shelves of the produce markets and supermarkets of our country. Today, many of those orchards that produce those marvelous apples in Idaho and Washington are being pulled out and replaced by other crops. Why? Because the Chinese have flooded the United States market with concentrated apple juice--that when you buy apple juice in the marketplace, the apple juice could well be produced from a Chinese concentrate shipped into our markets, then processed and bottled and sold into the American market. 
   The only way we can control the Chinese flow of concentrated apple juice into our market today would be to either openly threaten or close down our markets--close down our borders to the Chinese. That makes very little sense when you are working to expand markets because they then would counter by closing down access to another portion of their markets only to hurt another segment of our agriculture. 
   If they were in the WTO--if we accept this agreement--then they come under entirely new standards so that they have to regulate the flow of their concentrated apple juice into our markets, and without question, substantially improve the overall economy of the fresh fruit industry of this Nation and of the State of Idaho, and the State of Washington. 
   PNTR also means better opportunity for Idaho business-people and for the Idaho workforce. 
   For several years now Idaho has exported to China on a growing basis. We are 1.2 million strong in the State of Idaho. We are not a large State--at least population-wise. 
   In 1993, my State exported just about $2 million worth of goods and services to China. But by just 2 years ago, in 1998, that number had grown to $25 million. That is a 1,000-percent increase in the flow of goods and services leaving Idaho and going to mainland China, which just shows you the tremendous expansiveness in the marketplace that still remains relatively closed. This agreement rapidly opens that market and allows us greater access. 
   This last year, in December of 1999, I had the opportunity to lead an Idaho trade mission to China. I asked 13 different businesses and industries to go along with me and my wife, Suzanne, and some of our staff. Representatives from agricultural companies and building material companies and the high-tech community went along with us. We were all united, not only in our recognition of the importance of China's entry into the WTO, but all of these companies that went along went to look for opportunities to expand the marketplace of products built in Idaho for expanding the economy of my State and expanding the workforce and the job opportunities that exist in my State. 
   While we were there, we had the distinct privilege of meeting with President Jiang Zemin. President Jiang gave us the courtesy 
   of nearly an hour of his time in a direct discussion with myself and the trade delegation. During that time, he talked about China's future and he expressed it this way. He said China is serious about a transition to a more market-based economy, although the President made it very clear that China was not going to fall for the Russian model. In other words, they weren't going to throw out the old and assume that the new would just naturally take its place. 
   What they recognized and what they are doing at this moment is a progressive step-by-step approach for greater access in the marketplace, greater flexibility in the marketplace, without collapsing their economy, and without destroying the job base they currently have. There is no question that China is eager to gain the economic benefit and the political prestige of a WTO membership. 
   During that tour, we also went to an area and a province to the coastal city of Xiamen. There you can see firsthand what happens when an economy that was once guarded, protected, and limited by state-owned companies and by political control is turned, relatively, loose to join the world economy. Xiamen is one of six free-trade zones in China that was created by Premier Deng Xiaoping a good number of years ago. Their gross domestic product is phenomenal with average GDP of 20 percent, and job creation of the kind that is tremendously significant in giving the workforce of China the kind of upward mobility that all of us seek for all peoples of the world. 
   While we were there, we toured a brand new Kodak plant that was built on about 19 acres of ground. It was once a rice paddy for water buffalo and cobra snake. In just 19 months, this rice paddy was transformed into a very modern company that met all of the building codes, standards, and safety requirements as if they were built in my backyard, or in your backyard, or anywhere in this Nation. It was the home of thousands of workers, working for a much higher wage given the kind of power that a higher wage gives, and even given the opportunity to buy and own their own apartment. 
   If we really want to see China change, we must help give their workforce this kind of an economy, give them more money in their pockets, a chance to own private property, and then we will watch, over the years, a political change that will take place. 
   PNTR for China will improve the standard of living for many Chinese who have endured very poor standards of living. 
   PNTR isn't just a good deal for the farmers of Idaho, or the business men and women of Idaho. It is a good deal for the Chinese people who have suffered poverty beyond compare, and who are now beginning to experience through the marketplace, the opportunity of upward mobility, and the opportunity of private property ownership that truly begins to transform the political base and the landscape of a country. 
   Over the last year, as this issue developed and certainly over the last 6 months as we have known and as the Nation has known that we would ultimately debate the issue of permanent trade status for China and debate their entry into the WTO, I have received a multitude of letters from Idaho from all kinds of constituents who for one reason or another see the issue of permanent trade status the same way I do. While we agree that some of the human rights issues in China, and some of the other kind of concerns that we have are important, we also agree that our  Nation must be continually engaged with the Chinese to change the world and to change their role in the world. Building a wall or turning our backs on this huge population base is no way to gain those kinds of ultimate changes or benefits. 
   These letters, and letters from my Governor, Dirk Kempthorne, I think note, at least for the moment, that I share them with you. Let me give you a couple of examples.

   Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I asked for time in our schedule today so that I might be joined with other Western Senators and those Senators concerned about the catastrophic fires that have been sweeping across public lands in the West for the last month and a half. 
   Coincidentally, today is the first day of school across our Nation. Many of our children in elementary schools are going to be asked by their teachers: What did you do during your summer vacation? For the next few moments, I will suggest to you that this is my opening speech following my summer vacation. Let me tell you what I did during my summer vacation. 
   I went home to my beautiful State of Idaho and watched it burn--hundreds of thousands of acres of timberland, grassland, wild habitat, and environmentally sensitive land burned with catastrophic fires that were too dangerous, too hot, and too powerful to put firefighters in the face of to try to stop them and protect these beautiful natural resources. 
   In fact, I never thought I would return to Washington, DC, in search of clean air. But it is true. The air is cleaner over our Nation's Capital today than it is in my beautiful State of Idaho, or Montana, or those Great Basin States of the West that are known for spaciousness, vistas, and clean air. 
   This year's fire season may well prove to be the worst in half a century. All of our 11 Western States, as well as Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, are reporting very high and extreme fire danger levels today. 
   As I speak, large fires are actively burning in California, Colorado, Florida--a little less so in Idaho today because it rained during the night, and it rained over the weekend. But it is true in Louisiana and Mississippi--a little less true in Montana because of that same rainstorm--Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. 
   The map I have to my left demonstrates the character and the widespread nature of these fires. It isn't coincidental, nor is it unique, that most of these fires would be found on public lands--land managed by Federal land management agencies of this Government. 
   As of last week, the National Interagency Fire Center reports that 81 large fires are burning presently, covering nearly 1.7 million acres of land. The acres burned year to date exceed 6.5 million acres nationwide. That is over twice the 10-year average to date. 
   The reason I keep using the word ``to date'' is because we are now in the early days of September, and normal fire seasons will run late into September--and even later into October in California and other places down toward and including the Southwest. 
   The total number of fires on public lands has surpassed 74,000. Let me repeat that: 74,000 fires on public lands. That is almost 13,000 fires higher than the 10-year average. 
   Nationally, wildfires this year have burned an area larger than our neighboring State to the District, Maryland. In other words, envision the entire State of Maryland charred by fire. That is how many acres have been consumed by fire in our Nation this year. 
   There are roughly 26,000 firefighters battling wildfires. We have run out of trained firefighters and are preparing 550 new Army troops to assist fire crews. This is in addition to over 2,000 soldiers already deployed to fire crews nationwide, as well as firefighters from 3 different foreign countries--Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. All of the personnel fighting fires deserve our heartfelt thanks for their efforts and their dedication. And yes, we have also lost lives of firefighters. 
   Current estimates suggest that nearly $120 million was spent in August alone fighting wildfires. The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise reports it is spending $18 million a day on fire suppression and related efforts. Last week, the Federal Government reported that it has spent $626 million so  far on suppression costs this year. The Forest Service budget director estimates that wildfire costs this year will exceed $1 billion in total. This estimate assumes that the fire season ends in the normal framework I have discussed. However, the fires that are currently burning probably will not be extinguishable by man. They will have to wait for the snow to fall this winter or late fall or for major storms to move in the normal winter cycle. 
   It is hard to believe that to be a true statement, but it is a true statement that in the heartlands of our wilderness, our public lands where these fires will continue to smolder, to flare up during the hot days of the late fall, it will take a snowstorm in the heart of Idaho to put out these kinds of fires. 
   On Wednesday, August 30, President Clinton granted Montana Governor Marc Racicot's request that Montana be declared a Federal disaster area. On Thursday of last week, my Governor, Dirk Kempthorne, asked President Clinton to declare Idaho a disaster area, and he has. And I expect likely declarations coming soon from others. 
   In a fire season as bad as the one we are now experiencing, it is undeniable we would be seeing a significant area burn. Indeed, the General Accounting Office has warned in a series of reports that there are 39 million acres of Federal lands at risk right now of uncontrolled catastrophic wildfire. Therefore, the severity of this season should not have been a surprise to anyone, nor should we have stood by saying this is a natural situation. 
   Ten years ago, a group of foresters and renowned national silviculturists met in Sun Valley, ID, to study the character of the forests of the Great Basin of the West. They said at that time that those forests were in severe need of active management because they were nearly dead or dying from disease and bug kill and that if we didn't pursue an active management policy, these forests would be at risk of catastrophic fire. 
   That was 10 years ago. Since that time, I and others have asked the General Accounting Office to study the state of our forests, only to be reminded that what has happened this year would happen if we were not actively involved. However, over the last 3 weeks we have heard a series of news stories that call into question whether the Federal firefighting agencies have been adequately funded, staffed, and prepared to deal with the fire risk that we all knew existed and that will still exist after this year. Notwithstanding differences in land management policy--and there are differences between this administration and me and other Members of the Congress--there is no disagreement that the Federal land management agencies should be prepared to deal with fires when they occur. 
   Nevertheless, 3 weeks ago, USA Today reported that the Bureau of Land Management fire preparedness budget request was reduced first by the Department of the Interior and then by the Office of Management and Budget. Current and former Bureau of Land Management employees complained in writing that the effect of these budget reductions would be to reduce fire preparedness dramatically. 
   That story was followed by a Washington Times investigative piece that reported that the money taken from the fire preparedness budget was used to acquire new Federal lands as a part of this administration's current land legacy initiative. I am sure that at the time the President had money taken from these fire budgets he didn't understand that his land legacy would be millions of acres of charred trees and lost wildlife habitat. Mr. President, that is the permanent flame that you may well have as your legacy. 
   At the same time, United Press International filed a story that the Forest Service fire preparedness budget was similarly reduced either at the Department of Agriculture or the Office of Management and Budget, or both. United Press International quoted representatives of the Forest Service Employees Union complaining that, in downsizing, the administration disproportionately reduced the number of lower grade GS 5's and 9's and put the money with GS 14's. What does that equate to? It said that it reduces people on the ground and puts them in the Washington, DC, office. Folks on the ground fight fires. People in the Washington office do not. Yet that is the kind of transition about which even the Forest Service Employees Union was talking. Those are amongst a lot of things that this Congress will have to deal with in the coming days. 
   Last week, I had a good conversation with Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck. We agreed on a series of steps for the agency and the Congress to take over the next few weeks to address the situation currently at hand. We are not going to see major policy shifts this year, but we clearly ought to outline in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD why we are where we are today and why 6.5 or 7 million acres of our public lands have been charred. 
   Clearly, it is important that we develop an emergency budget not only to pay the bills of firefighting that we have incurred, but also the kind of environmental restoration that is critical now so we will not see continued catastrophic events occurring as a result of these fires, the kind that could destroy wildlife habitat and watersheds, because we were not able to move quickly in the kind of environmental restoration that is very necessary. We also have private lands at risk and private property owners who deserve to be compensated because of the way the Forest Service managed these fires in certain instances, or the character in which these fires burned. 
   I will be working with my colleagues in the coming days to do just that. First, we will hold hearings in the coming weeks regarding: Was the Forest Service prepared this season to fight these fires? If they were not, why were they not? Then we will begin to examine the current policy and its impact on these 30-plus million acres at risk. I hope to take colleagues with me, as chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee, to my State of Idaho and into Montana and the Great Basin area of the West in the next few weeks as we talk to the citizens on the ground who have experienced firsthand the risk of losing their homes, their property, and, yes, even their communities. 
   We have already dealt with the urban wildland interface as a result of the catastrophic fires in Los Alamos. But even with that, we have not yet done enough. I hope the administration will bring forth a package in the coming days to work with us to develop a program of active management to try to save these environmentally sensitive areas, to improve the ability of these areas to deal with fire, and, most importantly, to improve the ability of our Federal lands management agencies to deal with fire in coming years. If we are truly in the kind of environment that I believe we are in, or if we are at a time and place of La Nina versus El Nino and ocean oscillations and seasonal changes in the environment, then next year could be every bit as great a fire year as this year. 
   It is clearly important that we prepare now to do so. 
   I have had several of my colleagues join me on the floor who wish to speak to this issue. Madam President, I ask how much time is left of the hour that I requested?

We have had thousands of men and women out there on the fire lines risking their lives over the last month and a half. Clearly, a special thanks is needed to them for the work they have done. I think that is most appropriate as we assess now where we are and what we might be able to do, both short term and long term, in the packages that are put together and the policy changes that are made. The administration has said they will be coming forth with some proposals. We will take a very serious look at them as they come, to work with them in the immediate sense as we look at long term. 
   Now, let me yield 10 minutes to the other Senator from Wyoming, Mr.  MIKE ENZI. I am pleased he joins us today to discuss this critical situation in the West.

   Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his comments. He has made a very critical statement as it relates to some of the initiatives that are before us today, as it relates to roadless initiatives, roadless areas, accessibility to these areas, and the risk of catastrophic fire. 
   Last week, I sent to the President a letter indicating we had discovered that the administration, in their roadless area initiative, was not using the current reports on catastrophic fire as it related to their initiative. We would ask them to go back and review that before they attempted, by regulation, to lock up another 10, 15, 20, 30 million acres of land. It ought to be examined against the current fuel-loading on that land and the risk of catastrophic fire. 
   Now I will yield to the Senator from New Mexico who has just gone through a catastrophic fire in his State that nearly wiped out one of our great National Laboratories. It certainly wiped out a beautiful area in the mountains of New Mexico near Los Alamos where it took hundreds of homes and may well end up costing the taxpayers of this country over $1 billion to repair bad policy and bad decisionmaking coming together that created the Los Alamos fire. 
   I yield to my colleague from New Mexico.

   Mr. CRAIG. Before I yield to the Senator from Arizona, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his most appropriate statement. He experienced this firsthand earlier in the year before Idaho and Montana experienced it--the kind and the character of truly intensive and catastrophic fires, burning thousands of degrees hotter than a normal fire in a normal forest setting. 
   He is right. Over the course of the next several weeks, as chairman of the authorizing subcommittee, I am going to work very hard to come up with figures and amounts that we can build into an emergency package and hopefully include it in the Interior appropriations bill, which would fit the kind of environmental restoration necessary on the acres that have already burned, but also the kind of urban interface stewardship programs that will bring about the fuel reduction that our colleague from Arizona will speak to in a moment. He and people in his State have done some very interesting and extremely valuable pioneering work on the Ponderosa Forest of northern Arizona, which is important for this Congress, and hopefully this administration, to take into consideration as a part of the way we deal with these forest lands that now have literally tens of thousands of gallons of gasoline-equivalent fuel on the ground, which burns explosively under the right circumstances, as we have just experienced. 
   Let me yield to my colleague from Arizona, Senator JOHN KYL, to speak to this issue and the experiments going on in his State.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator KYL for what I think is a very clear explanation of what happens when you have this massive fuel-loading that has occurred on the floors of our public land forests in the Nation. When he talks about active management, he is not talking about wilderness areas. He is not talking about wildlife preserves. He is talking about the millions and millions of acres of land that we call multiple-use lands or lands that are classified within this roadless area that this administration is currently examining and is considering keeping roadless and undisturbed. 
   The question becomes very clear. Can you do this kind of active management by righting the wrongs of past actions we have taken on our public lands to restore forest health and to allow fire then to be a participant in the ecosystem in a way that is not catastrophic or stand altering or wildlife destroying? Those are very real changes with which all of us have to grapple. We ought to start. I will start with hearings in the next few days that will deal with that. Some of our 
   environmental friends recognize this. One of them happens to be from New Mexico. The Forest Guardian Group is  quoted as saying that wildfires are getting bigger, burning hotter, and the effects are more devastating. 
   It is clear that we will have to take mechanical steps to thin forests before we can use fire to restore these forests to their natural regimes.

   Mr. CRAIG. Let me conclude because the chairman of the Finance Committee has just brought a very critical issue to the floor. I appreciate the opportunity to kind of sandwich ourselves in between the opening remarks of the chairman and the opening remarks of the ranking member of the Finance Committee as it relates to China and PNTR, which is the most important issue before this Senate. But it is important that Senators be given an opportunity to hear the concerns that are now out there about our public lands and some remedial action that we can take in the short term as we look at long-term policies working with this administration and future administrations to resolve this kind of critical issue. 
   I thank you very much for the time and the time my colleagues have used in joining me to bring out some of the necessary and important facts about the events that are occurring out there as we go through this most devastating fire season. 
   Let me conclude once again with this thought. Six and one-half million acres of public land have now burned. For those who might be listening and who do not understand what 1 acre of land represents, or 1 square mile of land, let me suggest that it is the entire State of Maryland charred to the ground, with piles of ash, with snags of timber, standing dead trees, nothing left, with the risk of siltation and soot and ash moving into the watershed, into the streams, and into the valuable aquatic habitat. No wildlife can live there. Much of the wildlife having been destroyed, no trees can provide the productiveness to build a home and provide fiber for our country except in charred snags. An area the size of the State of Maryland has now burned. 
   Thousands and thousands of acres continue to burn. I believe that is a national crisis. It is a crisis on which all Members must focus. If it had been a hurricane that just wiped out the State of Maryland, we would all be rushing to save that State. 
   Fire, too, is a part of Mother Nature's disaster or catastrophic scheme. I hope our colleagues will work with us and that the Nation will begin to understand that active management on these timbered public lands in the appropriate and designated areas is not only critical; it is necessary to save our forests. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the MCCAIN amendment today. I certainly will not rise to the challenge the Senator from Arizona has placed. I never rise to the challenge of the editorial board of the New York Times or the tabloid test of NBC's ``Fleecing of America.'' I did that once with the ``Fleecing of America.'' I did because they were wrong. They had misused their facts, as they are misusing them now, and the Senator from Arizona has brought in those facts. 
   The reality is, I stand on the floor today to defend about 1,000 farmers in my State of Idaho, and I think you will hear from others today who defend American agriculture and its productive power and its ability to sustain itself within a world market and our willingness to put up reasonable safeguards to assure that sustainability at the local level. In my case, in Idaho, with nearly 1,000 sugar beet farmers, it is necessary and appropriate. I stand, not to apologize whatsoever, but to strongly support what I think is a necessary and appropriate program. 
   As with other commodities, those of us from agricultural States know that many in agriculture today are in crisis. They are at or below break even by a substantial amount. There is no difference between the potato farmer of Idaho or the sugar beet farmer of Idaho or the corn farmer of Iowa today. 
   In the case of sugar, prices this year compared to last summer are down by about 26 percent, and as a result of that, the Government has responded aggressively and appropriately to the crisis in rural America, making approximately $70 billion of total expenditures since 1966 to America's agricultural producers. 
   I am not going to apologize for that, and here is why: Banks are not going under; farms are not going under; America's food supply on the shelf is more abundant, safer, and of a higher quality than ever, at a lower price. The American consumer today spends less of his or her consumer dollar for American food, including sugar, than any other consumer in the world. 
   Should we apologize for that? I think not. What we have tried to do--and I think we have been reasonably successful--is balance out a domestic program with foreign competition while consistently working to open up foreign markets and clearly to liberalize the whole of the agricultural programs of this country. 
   USDA recently did purchase sugar. The Senator from Arizona has spoken to that. The reason they did was to try to stabilize the market and stabilize the price. There is no question that thousands of jobs in rural America depend on that action. I defended that action and I do now with no apology. 
   Sugar policy has run at largely no cost to the U.S. Government since 1985. I say that because what the Senator from Arizona failed to talk about was the amount of money directly contributed by the industry itself. In fact, it has been a revenue raiser. Since 1991, $279 million have been placed in the Treasury by a special marketing tax paid directly by the sugar producers. Did the Senator from Arizona mention that? Oops, I guess the Wall Street Journal did not mention it, nor did the New York Times mention it, nor did the ``Fleecing of America'' mention it. Of course, if they did not mention it, it ``ain't'' worth mentioning. 
   The probable net cost of the announced purchase and removal of sugar has been more than covered by the revenues of the sugar policy. As I helped other Members of this Senate design that policy, that is exactly what we tried to do: to balance it out so the industry itself was self-financing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. Since 1991, the marketing assessment has raised $279 million. That was my quote. That is a fact the Senator cannot dispute. This 132,000-ton purchase is a step toward  preventing the forfeiture of a much larger amount of sugar. USDA has estimated that 600,000 tons could be forfeited at a much higher cost to the Government--the Senator from Arizona is correct--based on current programs and current forfeitures. Pulling that sugar from the market now costs substantially less. The purchase saves the Government money and promotes the stopping of this kind of effort based on forfeiture, and that does save the American taxpayer money. 
   The purchase would not have been necessary and there would be no threat of forfeiture if sugar producers were not required, under the WTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement, to import about 15 percent of our consumption. I happen to have voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement because I felt this was a loophole that would potentially cost the producers of the State of Idaho their crops and maybe their farms. Now, of course, reality begins to bear itself out. 
   Further compounding the problem has been extensive import quota circumvention by a term that is now well known by those of us who are interested in agriculture. It is known as stuffed molasses. Low prices for other crops driving producers to beet and cane sugar production and extremely favorable weather conditions for the last 2 years have all contributed to the oversupply of sugar and the need for Government intervention. 
   Stuffed molasses, as my colleagues know, is a way of circumventing the law by loading up molasses with sugar, moving it through import into this country, then pulling it in and refining the sugar out of it. It is kind of like covering up, violating the law, if you will, in a legal way. It certainly violates the spirit of the trade agreement. 
   Allowing sugar prices to continue to fall will put more sugar farmers out of business, but it will not help consumers one bit. There is a general assumption on the part of those who oppose the sugar program that once you drop the price of sugar to the world price, all of a sudden candy bars get cheaper, soda pop gets cheaper, confectionery foods get cheaper, and we know that is not the fact. It has never been the fact. We might transfer a little profitability from the sugar farmer to the candy maker or to the soft drink producer, or to those who generally supply confectionery goods to the consumers of this country. 
   Does it translate through to the farmer? No, it does not, and it never has. 
   While the price food manufacturers and makers of candy--cereal, ice cream, cookies, and cakes--pay for sugar--they will always pay that amount. That is the character of the way the industry works. They simply either make a little more or make a little less, based on the margins in which they buy. 
   The truth of the matter is that in the U.S., the sugar program has saved the consumer money by stabilizing the price across the board and, therefore, consistency. I remember long before I served in the Senate, without this sugar program, there were dramatic fluctuations in the marketplace. People were going in and out of business. Confectionery producers and soft drink suppliers were arguing at one point that sugar was so dramatically high that they had to raise their prices, and then sugar fell dramatically, but those prices did not come down. U.S. consumers pay about 20 percent less for sugar than does a consumer in other developed countries of the world. 
   It is strange that I could use that figure--and it is a figure of fact, well established in the marketplace. Why don't other developed countries' consumers pay what we do? They buy on the world market. They buy, as the Senator from Arizona suggests, at a much cheaper price. The reason is the stability we have offered and, therefore, the averages that are very important to look at when you are looking at an overall price of the issue. 
   Do I support the program? Yes, I do. Am I apologetic for it? No, I am not. The reason is very simple. Over the years, we have worked to craft a program that balances itself out and, in large part, has paid for itself. As we work to create a more open market and phase these kinds of programs out, I will support those efforts, too. 
    It is very important for the whole of this country that I think we create that kind of stability. I hope we can do so. 
   At the appropriate time, I, or the chairman of the subcommittee, will move to table the amendment of the Senator from Arizona for the simple reason that we think it would destabilize the markets of this country. It certainly would have a dramatic impact on my State and the 1,000-plus farmers who make up the sugar portion of Idaho's agriculture production. 
   With that, I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President. I want to thank the Senator from Mississippi, for drafting an excellent FY2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill that will help meet the needs of our nation's farmers and agricultural communities. I especially want to thank him for working closely with me to ensure that issues affecting the Idaho agriculture are addressed in the bill. 
   I know that the Senator from Mississippi works hard with limited resources to fund worthwhile and fiscally responsible agricultural research programs. One important area of agriculture research involves increasing the shelf life of our food, while maintaining its quality, and one of the most promising methods is irradiation. In Idaho, Idaho State University is home to the Idaho Accelerator Center (IAC) which is proposing a research program to investigate the effects of small amounts of irradiation--as compared to conventional food irradiation--on the behavior of potatoes. IAC and several Idaho-based partners have been studying the positive effects of low doses of x-ray and electron beam irradiation on the storage properties and shelf life of potatoes. Significant improvement in shelf life has been demonstrated over the entire range of standard storage conditions, with virtually no decline in quality. The results indicate that long term storage losses can be reduced to very low levels and that shelf life during transport, storage by vendors and by consumers is extended indefinitely. It is believed that these findings will also hold true for other commodities such as onions, sugar beets, etc. These results are achieved without chemicals, radioactive materials or other environmentally harmful processes. The irradiation is provided by the electron beams produced from compact, portable high-energy electron-linear accelerators. 
   While I know that the project is not funded in the Senate bill, I want to ask the Chairman to consider the IAC proposal during Conference on the bill. This is a worthy project and one that I am confident will lead to real results that will benefit our farmers and consumers.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to ask the Chairman about a small provision in report language, under the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The report encourages the agency to interface with a consortium of universities on developing carbon dioxide emissions trading credit models. I am just seeking clarification on the academic nature of the efforts described and the intent of the Committee. 
   In numerous appropriations bills and reports, the Committee and the Senate have reiterated the position, consistent with the unanimously-passed Byrd-Hagel resolution, that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change and control of greenhouse gases has not been approved by the Senate and must not be implemented by the Administration through the regulatory backdoor. Every year, language to this effect has been included in a growing number of appropriations laws, including the Agriculture Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2000. 
   My question arises because emissions trading is inextricably, and most visibly, linked to the limits envisioned in the Kyoto Protocol. I assume there is no intention in the report language to be inconsistent with our longstanding position on Kyoto and no implied endorsement of emissions trading. I  would read the report as simply encouraging the agency in giving technical assistance to an academic research project relevant to agriculture.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with all of my fellow Senators today to express our feeling and mourn the death of our colleague, Senator PAUL COVERDELL. 
   I always find these kinds of circumstances difficult to speak to, to find the appropriate words to reflect my emotions or to in some way express my love for a man such as PAUL COVERDELL and the way he worked for all of us and for his country. 
   I grew up in a ranching environment in the State of Idaho. Oftentimes I think back to those experiences when I am caught in emotion or when I cause myself to sit down and contemplate how to deal with an issue or a situation. My experience with PAUL was largely a part of our time in the Senate, 
   a leadership time. 
   I was one of four Senators elected by the Republican majority to lead them in the 106th Congress; PAUL COVERDELL was a part of that leadership team. He was secretary of what we call our Republican conference, or all Members on the Republican side. It was through that relationship that I grew to know PAUL and to appreciate the tremendous talents that he had. We all know he was an activist on the floor on many occasions, in pursuit of what the leadership team and ultimately the Republican conference decided was a direction we ought to head in or an issue we ought to debate. He did it with phenomenal energy and talent. 
   When I think of that relationship, I can only come to this analysis; I think it so well fits PAUL: A team approach, as in a western ranching environment. We all remember the great cattle drives that used to come out of the Southwest into the plains of the West to graze, thousands of head of renegade cattle moving all in one direction. The reason they were moving in one direction was because there was a trail boss who headed up this drive. There were a group of wranglers on horseback who were out there working day to day to keep that drive shaped and headed in the direction in which the trail boss wanted them to head. 
   There is no question that in the Senate TRENT LOTT is our trail boss. He decides the direction with the consent of the herd, if you will, and head Members. There is a group who are the wranglers, who work with that herd, to help shape it and keep it moving. PAUL COVERDELL was one of those wranglers and probably the best among us. He was constantly out there from daylight until dark and, if it were on the range, we would say in all kinds of weather because he was doing what he was asked to do but more importantly because he believed in what he was doing and he was very passionate about it. 
   All of us are here for a reason; some of us for larger reasons than others. Clearly, to be here with the kind of passion and energy that PAUL COVERDELL from the State of Georgia came here with is unique. As a result, he was selected to be one of those wranglers, to follow the leadership, to follow the directions of the trail boss, to make sure that we all stayed headed in the right direction. 
   I will miss him. I will miss his talents as a wrangler. He was a great American and history will record that. He has made his mark. But never once in the business of making that mark, or leading, shaping the herd, or wrangling the herd, did he ever do it for PAUL. He did it for his country and for what he believed was the right cause and the right belief. 
   PAUL, I think God has called you to a different trail herd. He obviously needed a hell of a good wrangler, and He's got one. We will miss you. We love you. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern over this egregious and unjustified action by the Department of the Interior that will have severe negative economic consequences on citizens and communities in Idaho and many other states around the country. The Department has announced that it intends to ban recreational snowmobile use in virtually every national park that now allows them, although snowmobiles have been an established use in these parks for more than four decades. This announcement was made by Interior Assistant Secretary Don Barry on April 27th in an orchestrated press conference that amounted to a public lynching of the snowmobile community. This new policy was made without consultation with Congress, the snowmobile manufacturers, the nearly four million snowmobile users, or with the many gateway communities to the national parks that are dependent on business generated by snowmobile visitors. Although Assistant Secretary Barry claimed that this ban is necessary because of air pollution, noise and wildlife disturbance caused by snowmobiles, the truth is that there is simply no evidence that snowmobiles cause such harm. In fact, in a shocking admission before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Mr. Barry conceded that snowmobiles had never been found in violation of any environmental standard in any national park. I understand Mr. Barry has since left the Department to be employed by the Wilderness Society, an organization that has actively advocated the exclusion of snowmobiles from national parks. 
   The major snowmobile manufacturers have made great progress in producing machines that are cleaner and quieter than ever before. The manufacturers, the snowmobile users and the gateway communities are willing to work with the Department of the Interior to develop reasonable plans and programs to achieve agreed to environmental goals. I believe this is the best course for the Department to follow. 
   I bow to no one in my love for our majestic national parks. I fully support reasonable and reasoned efforts to protect and preserve them. But to ban  snowmobiles completely in the national parks is totally unnecessary. It is an abuse of bureaucratic power, and it is the duty of Congress to uphold the law and prevent this from taking place.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, certainly, KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, our colleague from Texas, has led us on the issue of the marriage penalty tax. I think probably she has sensitized all of us to it as only a woman can. I mean that in the sense of understanding the true balance that ought to be in this Tax Code that isn't in the Tax Code. She has  been persistent with the Congress and with this Senate to assure that we develop a sense of equity and balance in the Tax Code that our marriage penalty tax relief legislation will offer. 
   Who pays the marriage penalty? In our country, about 22 million married couples do. They are not wealthy. They are modest- and middle-income families. In my State of Idaho, that is 129,710 families. 
   To really bring this home, if, from the time a couple marries, they were to put away, with interest, the difference in the disparity of taxes between $1,000 and $1,400 per year, on the average, for their first child, they could afford to pay 3 years of his or her education at a State institution in my State of Idaho. So it is significant. It is important. There is no question it would help, and can help, the American family. 
   The usual suspects out there who are opposed to this, I think, are using the most tired and sad arguments against tax relief. They simply are arguing from a position of the wrong facts. We have heard them whining about tax cuts and saying the tax cuts are for the rich and somehow you ought not give the rich any opportunity. Of course, in this instance they have simply missed the mark, and they know it. They know they are on the wrong side of this issue. 
   Tax relief, in the area of the marriage penalty tax, helps working families. It ends discrimination against married couples. It reduces the Tax Code's antifamily bias that no tax code should have in it. We have always said that the very foundation of our culture and our country is the family, and yet we take advantage of that union in the Tax Code by causing them to pay more in taxes. 
   Low- and middle-income married couples are the ones who truly are hurt by this penalty. On average, a married couple hit by the marriage penalty will pay about $1,400 more a year in taxes than two single persons at the same combined income. That is where the penalty rests. 
   In total, the marriage penalty overcharges couples in this country $32 billion a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office--that is right, $32 billion a year--that could stay out there with those young couples. 
   I use the example in my State of Idaho that if they simply put it in a bank, with interest, by the time their first child is old enough to go to college, they can afford his first or her first 3 years at a State institution in my State. 
   I think those who oppose marriage tax penalty relief oppose, frankly, all tax relief. The more they can get to spend on Government programs and Government solutions--and go home to their constituents and talk about what wonderful things Government is doing for them--somehow they think that most of our citizens are either undertaxed, and not giving enough to Government for all those wonderful solutions to their problems, or the current Tax Code is fair. 
   They are not worried about a Tax Code that charges a family an extra $1,400 or more, when a family certainly needs that additional income as they become a family unit. They are opposed to all tax relief. If you pay taxes, somehow, in this argument, you are rich; and the rich do not need the relief. 
   How many times have we heard that? At least I have heard it in the good number of years I have been in the Senate. Every time we talk about tax relief, somebody over there on the other side of the aisle says: Gee, those darn Republicans want to give that money back to the rich, and the rich don't need tax relief. 
   Low- and middle-income families do need tax relief. So the opposition on the other side always ponies up some kind of what I call tax-relief ``lite'' amendments to offer, so they can show some degree of compassion. Yet at the same time they offer nothing 
   except a new Government program. 
   Let me break it down into the three most significant ways that the Tax Code extracts the marriage penalty for us to understand. 
   First of all, it is discrimination in the standard deduction area. About two-thirds of the taxpayers take the standard deduction. For a married couple, the standard deduction this year is $7,200. For two single taxpayers with the same combined income, it is $8,600. This is the first $392 of the marriage penalty. Lower and middle-income taxpayers are more likely to take the standard deduction than upper-income persons. Many middle-income families who itemize are still hurt by standard deduction discrimination because the amount of the standard deduction determines whether they itemize. In other words, one element triggers the other element in our Tax Code. 
   The Senate bill would provide relief to 25 million couples by making the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly equal to the standard deduction for two singles with the same combined income. That is a little complicated, but it is easy to understand that for those who take the standard deduction--and those tend to be the lower and middle-income families--the benefit is immediate and, as we have said, is approximately $1,400 a year. 
   The second area deals with discrimination in the earned-income tax credit area, the EITC. We are all familiar with the EITC. It is supposed to reward work, ease income tax and other tax burdens, and supplement incomes for low-income working families with children. It is astonishing, in a program designed to help lower income families, the phaseout schedule for EITC benefits again imposes an antimarriage, antifamily penalty. This is the very program Congress designed to help low-income families. Yet when we look inside the code, the way the IRS has interpreted it and administers it, there is an antimarriage, antifamily penalty. The Senate bill would begin addressing marriage penalty inequity in the EITC by first increasing the maximum credit by $526, starting the phaseout range $2,500 higher than it was at an income level just above $15,000. 
   The third area of discrimination is in the tax brackets. For the average couple paying a marriage penalty, bracket discrimination charges them another $1,000. Bracket discrimination usually takes the lower income earned by one spouse, which would be taxed in the 15-percent bracket if he or she were single, and taxes it at the other spouse's 28-percent rate. This devalues the spouse and the spouse's work that provides the second income for the family. Of course, in some instances, both spouses are professional and choose to seek their profession in the marketplace. In other marriages, one spouse simply wants to supplement the overall family income to broaden the ability of that family to earn, to save, to invest, and to provide for its children. In this instance, this particular structure of the Tax Code actually devalues the value of the income of that spouse who goes into the marketplace to earn additional income for the family. 
   For folks with modest means, this adds what we could easily call insult to the very injury that the Tax Code levees to the taxpayer. Time after time on this floor, we hear how many families are forced to earn a second income to make ends meet. Currently, the heavy hand of Government has the first claim on the second income. For anybody who would choose to vote against 
   this particular provision, shame on them. Especially shame on them if they then turn around and argue that circumstances are so tough out there that every family needs two incomes. Let us work today to lessen that burden, to make it less tough, to give that family unit greater choices as to whether they both want to work in the marketplace or one would choose to stay home. 
   The Senate bill provides help for 21 million couples, including 3 million senior citizens, by expanding the 15-to-28 percent bracket for one couple to a range equal to that for two singles. In addition, this bill preserves the full effect of the family tax credits enacted in the 1997 Taxpayers Relief Act. We now find that particular provision taking effect. More and more middle-income families are slipping into the alternative minimum tax or the AMT. In fact, even some EITC families are now being affected by this. The AMT is already a dubious tax. It requires thousands of taxpayers to figure their returns according to two different tax systems. I don't think anyone really intended the AMT to apply and wipe out the family tax credits we enacted in 1997, including the $500-per-child tax credit, the HOPE education credit, the lifetime earnings credit, and the ongoing dependency care credit. It is time to cut back on the antifamily AMT, and that is exactly what this provision will do.  
   In conclusion, we want a Government that is truly profamily. Certainly all of us--and in a sincere way--want to make sure our laws are profamily. Yet those who will vote against the marriage tax penalty are talking about two different systems. They are being very inconsistent with honesty and integrity in debating this kind of an issue. You cannot talk profamily on one side of the issue and turn around and vote against this provision that we will be voting on on the floor this evening. 
   Our Tax Code says, unless we change it tonight, don't get married. And if you do, you are going to pay higher taxes. We say it is time we create equity in this equation. Our Tax Code says you will pay a penalty if both spouses work and you will be the most heavily taxed if your incomes are about equal. We say the best antipoverty program is a family and a job in America, or two jobs in America taxable at a lower rate, leaving more money inside the family unit to provide for that family and those portions of the American dream they seek to secure. We encourage our citizens to dream a better dream, of a fairer and freer society. Our Tax Code has a great deal to say about the size and the scope of their dreams. 
   I hope we will vote tonight to strike a blow for a profamily, pro-American, American-dream approach, not have the Tax Code constantly confusing the message and sending a negative signal. We are going to pass it, I do believe, and seize the opportunity. 
   In closing, I say to the President: Come on. Quit playing the political games you are playing right now. You have to have this new spending program and this new spending program with a multitrillion-dollar surplus. Give the highest taxed generation in history just a little break. When this bill gets to your desk, sign it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand in support of my colleague from Wyoming on his amendment. 
   I was quite surprised when Senator REID of Nevada spoke on the floor about this issue because I heard what he was saying before. It was given in testimony before the Subcommittee on Parks, chaired by the Senator from Wyoming, by the national environmental groups. He was following their script. Their script says: Get all of the snowmobiles out of the park. For some reason that impacts the parks. I have ridden snowmobiles in Yellowstone. I am not sure the Senator from Nevada has. I am not sure many Senators have. I don't dispute the need to manage the number of snowmobiles and the entry of snowmobiles where they travel. 
   But arbitrarily and without justification, Assistant Secretary Barry--who has now fled to the Wilderness Society once he tried to accomplish his damage here in this administration with the Park Service--came before the committee and emphatically said they had to go. In a press conference a few days prior to that hearing in almost a defiant, arrogant way, he said he was going to take all of them out of the parks, finish the rulemaking in Yellowstone, and so be it--failing to recognize the industries that have built up around snowmobiling at both entrances to Yellowstone Park; failing to deal with them in a responsible, cooperative way--so that he could ensure the mantra of the Clinton administration, and that public lands generate economies in recreation and tourism. 
   Here quite the opposite was going on--no economy, everything for the environment, even though the facts bear out that you can still have an economy, meaning people on snowmobiles in Yellowstone in the wintertime, and still protect the environment. 
   How do you accomplish that? You work with the industry. What do you do with the industry? You ask them to redesign their sleds so they make little to no noise and very little pollution --if there is any of consequence that would damage the environment to begin with. 
   What does the industry say? They can do it. In fact, last winter they were operating in Yellowstone with a prototype put out by one of the snowmobile manufacturers. It was a four-cycle instead of a two-cycle engine. The Senator from Nevada was bemoaning the pollution of the two-cycle. We now know they can produce a four-cycle that will be certainly less environmentally damaging. They are willing to do that. 
   The moment the industry said to the Park Service we can supply you with a new sled that meets these standards, the Park Service says: Oh, well, it wasn't air pollution, it wasn't noise pollution, it was wildlife harassment. 
   Somehow the wildlife of Yellowstone is going through some emotional problem as a result of snowmobiles trafficking by recreationists on a daily basis. I am not quite sure they have had any examples of these wildlife species in therapy. But somehow they seem to know a great deal about it. 
   The bottom line is simply this: The environmentalists have told this administration they want snowmobiles out of the parks. 
   I suggest to the National Park Service that they have a real problem on their hands in management. In other words, they are denying public access to parks that were designed to protect the environment and also allow public access. They have a crisis in management. 
   They don't have an environmental problem in Yellowstone, they have a management problem, a failure on the part of this administration, and certainly this President, to recognize the cooperative balance between the environment and the public and how one benefits from creating this kind of balance for all to benefit from.

   Mr. CRAIG. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for giving an evaluation of the time remaining on the amendments that must be dealt with. I know the chairman has been struggling since around 3:15 to get Senators to debate the amendments, and now all of a sudden they appear on the floor in the last minutes. 
   I conclude my debate. The Senator from Montana, I know, wants to speak to this issue. It impacts his State and the economy of his State. Once again I say to the administration, shame on you for taking people out of the environment, all in the name of the environment. It doesn't seem a very good solution to me, if you are going to tout tourism and recreation to us western States as an alternative to the elimination of the extractive resource industries that have provided economies to our States for the last 100-plus years.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have been listening with great interest for the last several minutes as the Senator from Nevada made his presentation in relation to an amendment to take $30 million out of the timber program. He has given the reason that we have a catastrophic situation in the West today--some 39 million acres of our public timbered lands are in a critical situation as it relates to stand-altering fires, and we ought to do better planning. Therefore, we ought to take the money out to do better planning so we could circumvent this situation. And, oh, by the way, logging exacerbates that problem by leaving some slash on the ground. 
   The argument of the Senator might have some modicum of validity if we had not done what we did last week. Last week, we passed Senator PETE DOMENICI's bill for which the Senator from Nevada voted. We put $240 million, not $30 million--$240 million in a fuel reduction program. In fact, the Forest Service says it funds entirely, Senator BRYAN, all that they can do. It even provides additional money for planning. So, really, the fire issue should be set aside in your debate, based on the actions of the Senate last week. I think what the Senate did last week is responsible, to put that kind of money into fuel reduction, especially in the urban interface and in those areas of the kind we saw at Los Alamos, in New Mexico, where we saw hundreds of homes go up in smoke as a result of bad policy and bad management on the part of this administration coming together. 
   What are we talking about, then, if the fire issue has been dealt with appropriately by this Senate? If what we are talking about is the existing timber program that obviously the Senator from Nevada opposes, as do many environmental groups that he finds himself here on the floor today representing, then the fire issue I think is relatively moot. So let's talk about the timber sale program. 
   What the Senator from Nevada is doing when he talks about it being a money loser is he is taking money out of a program from a portion of the program that really is the money maker. So he is fulfilling a prophesy of argument that somehow this will continue to be a money loser, and most assuredly it will be if you take money from that kind of program. 
   Let me talk about the program for a few moments, where it is as a part of an overall forest policy in our Nation, and why it is important we keep some approach to a timber program, whether it is for green sales to supply dimensional timber to the housing industry of our Nation, or whether it is for the purpose of thinning and reducing the overall burden of the number of trees within a stand of timber, therefore increasing the viability of forest health in our Nation's forests. 
   Those 39 million acres of timberland that are in critical condition today across our Nation are, in fact, a result of the overstocking of these acreages. Some 400-plus trees per acre now exist on land that 100 years ago, long before man was out there logging them, had only 60 trees per acre. 
   As a result, we need a concentrated program of management for fuels reduction for fire, but I also think we can reasonably argue that we can take some of those trees out for timber, logging, home building, purposes for the Nation's economy. 
   Let me give an example of where we are with the industry at this moment and why I think it is important we discuss it. 
   On this first chart, it shows in 1989 there were about 150,000 jobs in the timber industry nationwide. In 1997, that had been reduced to about 55,000 timber jobs, almost a two-thirds reduction in overall employment that is in direct correspondence, in part, to the amount of logging that goes on. 
   Since the Clinton administration has come to Washington, its timber policies have reduced logging on our national forests by over 80 percent nationwide--an 80-percent reduction nationwide in overall logging. 
   What does that mean on a State-by-State basis? Let me give an example of what it means in at least three States. It does not mean much in the State of Nevada. They do not have trees to log, except in very limited ways. This is what it means in the State of Washington from 1989 to present: It means 55 mills closed and 3,285 primary mill jobs. That is what that kind of policy means. In my State of Idaho, 13 mills closed, 1,083 people. In the State of Oregon, 111 mills closed and 11,600 people. That is even after the President's new plan. 
   Remember, when he came to office, he held a big timber summit in Oregon: Save the trees and save the jobs. They have not been able to produce the jobs. In fact, they had to backtrack and even back away from their own policy because of the pressure from environmental groups. They were unwilling to support their own policy. The Senator from Nevada is now on the floor trying to argue for a major reduction in that policy. 
   In the State of California, 46 mills and 4,427 jobs. It will not affect Nevada. They do not cut trees there, or cut very few. 
   I have worked with the Senator from Nevada on an area that I think is tremendously important. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources just reported out S. 1925, the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. The Senator from Nevada and his colleague have been extremely concerned about the health of the forest in the Greater Tahoe Basin, and he should be. That forest is an overmature, climax forest. In other words, it is beyond the point of healthy adulthood. Trees are dying; trees are too thick. There is an urban interface with beautiful big recreational homes built amongst the stands of timber. They have a silviculture problem with the potential of massive wildfires in the Tahoe Basin, losing those beautiful homes, and creating a catastrophic environmental situation that could badly damage the beautiful Lake Tahoe itself. 
   The Senator from Nevada has a problem. He has a bill that authorizes work to be done in the basin, but he has no money. What he is doing tonight is cutting out of one of the budgets of the Forest Service, some of the very money that will go to restore Lake Tahoe and the Tahoe Basin. I am not quite sure he can get it both ways. 
   I have worked with the Senator from Nevada to try to assure the Tahoe Basin restoration program will go forward and that we will have adequate moneys to begin to do the kinds of  silviculture programs, the thinnings and the necessary efforts, that will create a higher level of forest health in the Tahoe Basin. We cannot do it tonight because the Senator from Nevada is cutting $30 million to the detriment of his own program. 
   I suggest when he was approached by the environmental groups to do this amendment that was not a factor, but what is a factor is that the Senator from Nevada has not had money appropriated for his project. He will hand it over to the Forest Service at large. It is a bill that will authorize the Forest Service to move in that area, and he is even cutting the budgets of the Forest Service, or attempting to as we speak. 
   That is frustrating. It is extremely frustrating to this Senator who has worked very closely with the Senator from Nevada to assure that his Tahoe Basin project is authorized because it is necessary and it is appropriate. 
   Last week, the Senator from Nevada joined with us to put over $240 million into a fire reduction program and a program to allow the Forest Service to study even greater amounts of fire suppression by reduction of the fuel loading on our national forest floors. 
   Yet today he comes back with that argument. Let me suggest this argument is for one purpose and one purpose only, and his amendment will serve for one purpose and one purpose only. We find it right here in a letter from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. This labor union--men and women who work for the forest products industries--says:  
   The Bryan amendment places thousands of forest product jobs at risk and jeopardizes the social and economic stability of rural communities.  
   You are darned right it does. In the rural communities of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington that still have mill jobs, that still ought to be cutting trees. We have 13 and 14 percent unemployment, and this will drive the unemployment up even further. 
   No, those communities are not reaping the benefit of the current full employment economy. The mills on the eastern side of Washington are not reaping the benefit of the high-tech jobs of western Washington. The mills in north Idaho are not reaping the benefits of the high-tech jobs of south Idaho, and so on. 
   What we have attempted to do with reasonably consistent and environmentally sound policy is to ensure a balance. The Senator from Nevada denies us that balance by refusing to allow the Forest Service to have the very tools necessary to properly manage the current timber program. 
   This is not about new roads. There is a road moratorium. The Senator from Nevada knows that. The environmental community last week claimed a major victory with the President's new roadless area initiative. The Senator knows there is not going to be any new roads built. So roads are not the argument, not now and not for the near future. 
   What is at stake is the very jobs that produce the dimensional lumber that comes to the markets that builds the homes of America. It is right and reasonable to assume that some of it ought to come from the forests of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and California. 
   I hope the Senator, recognizing that this whole issue has shifted pretty dramatically in the last 72 hours, will recognize that his amendment no longer has carrying with it the validity that his argument might have had just last week. 
   Mr. President, $240 million later, this Congress, in a responsible fashion, has addressed the catastrophic fire situation that might now exist in our public lands and are willing to deal with it. Those are the issues at hand that are so very important to all of us. 
   Lastly, the very money the Senator will eliminate from the projects and from the programs--here is a letter from the Society of American Foresters saying that the fire in Los Alamos that cost us 235 homes clearly demonstrates that if we had been allowed to have used the stewardship timber sales programs that, in part, the Senator's amendment will now deny us, we could have reduced the fuel loading and, in many instances, we might have saved those homes. That is exactly what we are trying to deal with here. 
   I hope my colleagues will vote with me in voting down the Bryan amendment. There is no basis for the arguments that are placed today that relate to the amendment itself. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for the leadership he has taken in this area. It is so critically important. 
   About a month and a half ago, I got a call from the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, who said: I am headed to Idaho. I am going to look at the Craters of the Moon National Monument. I might want to expand it. 
   ``I might want to expand it,'' was what he said. It is currently 54,000 acres. He has recommended that it be expanded to 754,000 acres. He doesn't take into consideration grazing. He wants to overlay Park Service and BLM management into a confusing new kind of configuration. 
   Most importantly--this is the point the Senator from Oklahoma has just made--there have been no public hearings, no local input. He went around and held some meetings with some affected or potentially affected parties. 
   If the Congress were handling this, we would have the full NEPA process. We would have an EIS. We would incorporate our county governments. We would look at the kind of impact this designation would have. The Senator is right, he and I might ultimately agree with it, but what about the county roads that go through it and some of the private roads that go through it and the elimination or the blockage of those roads. Those are the kinds of issues this President and this Secretary have totally ignored in the name of the Clinton legacy. 
   I hope this amendment will pass. It is time we halt this action and bring this through the Congress to an appropriate public process to sort out all these difficulties. That is what the committee on which the Senator from Oklahoma and I serve has the responsibility of doing: refining and crafting public policy. 
   I thank the Senator.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. First, allow me to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for their hard work on the Fiscal year 2001 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. Despite scarce resources and tough choices, they came up with a fiscally responsible bill that meets important priorities, which I support. 
   There are some important projects to be funded in this bill that I would like to work with the Chairman on. 
   We are proud to be the home of Lake Coeur d'Alene in North Idaho. It has become a world-class destination for all sorts of outdoor activities--from golf to water sports to mountain biking. This tourism is important to the local economy and the ability to partake in these activities is vital to the local residents' quality of life. I know the Chairman is very familiar with the area, since it is a short distance from Spokane, Washington and is a popular recreation destination for many of his constituents. 
   The problem we have encountered is a lack of public boat launching facilities. Most of the lake front land around the lake is privately owned, so land for public launch facilities is scarce. However, the Bureau of Land Management has purchased land for a boat launch facility and has completed all of the appropriate studies and planning; they are simply lacking the funds to build the facility. The local community, including many residents of Washington State, tenaciously support the project and are willing to provide about $700,000 toward the project. 
   In the same part of the great State of Idaho, mining has been and, hopefully, will continue to be a substantial part of the local economy--providng the minerals we all need. The University of Idaho and Washington State University want to work with the U.S. Geological Survey to develop new high-tech methods of modeling geology, to be tested in North Idaho, but eventually applied world-wide, to provide better exploration and modeling techniques to find groundwater, minerals, etc. 
   In the Southern part of Idaho, we are very concerned about the proposed listing of the Sage Grouse as an endangered species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been petitioned to list the species, which would have a dramatic impact on the lives of the people of Southern Idaho, as well as future BLM and Forest Service operations. It becomes readily apparent when you visit Southern Idaho that the entire region is habitat for Sage Grouse. 
   Local working groups have been formed across Southern Idaho to find local, collaborative projects to restore Sage Grouse habitat and the species which would make a listing under the Endangered Species Act unnecessary. To be successful, this effort appropriately requires some federal support. 
   Finally, also in Southern Idaho, there is an urgent need to re-open the BLM's air tanker resupply base at the Twin Falls airport. This base was closed in 1998, after an internal inspection indicated unsafe conditions. This is the only such base within 100 miles of most of the Idaho-Nevada border, which uniquely suits it to provide the fastest possible response and turnaround times in this area during the fire season. In this vast expanse of vulnerable landscape, in the dry season, a small accident rapidly could become a major fire disaster. We've seen that happen in other parts of the country and we should take steps here to prevent it. The community has worked diligently with the local BLM office to re-open the base as soon as possible. However, in the national office, this project has been slipped back from year to year and down the priority list. Everyone agrees this base must be replaced. Our concern is simply that it should be done now, rather than be subject to further postponement. 
   I hope the chairman will work with me when this bill goes to conference to find funds for all of these important and fiscally responsible projects.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine, and I want to recognize her leadership in this area. 
   In the last couple of years, I have begun to focus my attention on childhood type 1 diabetes. What the Senator from Maine is offering today is clearly moving us well in advance. 
   I ask the Senator to allow me to be a sponsor of her legislation. 
   The Senator's effort struck a particularly loud chord with me, because it was exactly one year ago today that the Senate and I lost a friend and colleague, Ken Foss, related to his diabetes. 
   This Senate and this Congress should focus on diabetes, as we have cancer and other health areas in our country, to move more quickly toward a cure. 
   The Senator is so right in recognizing we have already moved a long way and there is a great deal known. My rather limited reading suggests that the great push forward might well break us into those areas of remedy, at least for type 1, and there is a great deal of work going on. My congratulations to the Senator for her leadership in that area. I stand to help in any way I can.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, during debate of H.R. 8, the question has been raised: Does the death tax really impact family-owned farms and businesses? 
   The answer is an emphatic ``Yes!'' 
   According to the book, ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' self-employed individuals are four times as likely to accumulate $1 million in assets over their lifetime than those people who work for someone else. Moreover, while self-employed individuals make up only 20 percent of the workforce, they comprise two-thirds of those Americans whose estates are worth more than $1 million. As a tax on accumulated wealth, the estate tax is a direct attack on these individuals. 
   Meanwhile, the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy estimates that seven out of ten family-owned businesses fail to survive from one generation to the next. While this failure rate can be attributed to many factors, the federal estate tax is cited by family business owners as a major obstacle blocking a successful transition. For example, a report by the Family Enterprise Institute found that 60 percent of black business owners believe the estate tax makes the survival of their business significantly more difficult or impossible. 
   Finally, the estate tax hampers the ability of family-owned businesses to compete against larger corporations. In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, a lumberyard owner from New Jersey spoke of incurring up to $1 million in costs associated with preserving the family business pending the death of his grandmother. At the same time the family was incurring these costs, the business was also competing against a new Home Depot store that had moved into the area. Home Depot is not subject to the estate tax. 
   Mr. President, death tax repeal is also pro-jobs. A survey of 365 businesses in upstate New York found an estimated 14 jobs per business were lost in direct consequence of the costs associated with estate tax planning and payment. That amounts to more than 5,000 jobs lost in a limited geographical area. Nationally, the Wall Street Journal reported that an estimated 200,000 jobs would be created or preserved if the estate tax were eliminated. 
   Mr. President, a false argument made by the opposition is that the tax code already protects family-owned businesses from the death tax. While the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act included provisions to protect family-owned businesses from the death tax, these provisions have proven so complicated and cumbersome that few family businesses choose to use them. 
   For example, in order to qualify for the Family Business Exclusion, an heir has to have worked in the family business for at least five of the eight years leading up to the death of the owner. Following the death of the owner, the family must continue to participate in the business for at least five out of eight years. 
   Both these restrictions create significant problems for family members. How does a son or daughter know when the eight-year ``clock'' starts ticking. If their parents are elderly, do they sacrifice going to college in order to begin working in the business? Moreover, once the business is transferred, the tax deferred by receiving the Qualified Family Business designation hangs over the business for at least eight years, affecting the ability of the business to attain credit or attract investors. 
   Similar difficulties have been realized from other carve-outs. For example, Section 2032A allows closely-held farms and businesses to receive a valuation based upon the property's current use--say farming--rather than its ``highest and best'' use--say commercial development. 
   In order to qualify for the lower valuation, however, the estate and heirs must meet qualifications similar to those required for the Family Business Exclusion. Despite the obvious benefits, only a small fraction--less than one percent in 1992--of taxable estates elect to use it. The provision is simply too complicated for widespread use. 
   With regard to the death tax, it is proving very difficult to protect one set of assets while taxing another. A good-faith attempt was made to protect family-owned businesses from the death tax three years ago, but by most accounts that attempt has largely failed. The best way to protect family farms and businesses from the death tax is to repeal it.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, repealing the estate tax is one of the more populist tax cuts considered by Congress this session. Not only do studies show the estate tax has a dramatic impact on the ability of family-owned farms and businesses to survive and create job opportunities, survey after survey has revealed that 70 to 80 percent of Americans in general are critical of the tax and supportive of its repeal. This broad-based support is evident in the number of states that have acted to repeal their state-level estate taxes. Since 1980, more than 20 states have elected to repeal their estate taxes. 
   Mr. President, there is no excuse for continuing a tax that confiscates capital from our most productive citizens. It's anti-growth. It's anti-jobs. It's anti-American. 
   Mr. President, it's time to bury the death tax.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Harkin amendment. 
   The Harkin amendment would make changes to Social Security benefits. It would: increase benefits to widows; and increase benefits for stay-at-home parents by attributing earnings to them while they stay home. 
   Mr. President, everyone wants to help moms and widows, especially during election years, but Social Security is exactly the wrong tool for the job. 
   The Harkin amendment would fail to provide meaningful assistance to the people they are targeted to aid. 
   Worse, it would increase Social Security's unfunded liabilities by almost a third, reduce Social Security trust fund balances by hundreds of billions, and accelerate the system cash-flow crisis. 
   Social Security is one of the few federal programs that already takes stay-at-home parents into account. 
   Under the current system, married spouses generally receive about the same Social Security benefit regardless of whether they worked full-time, part-time, took a break for child-rearing, or did not work at all. 
   For example, in 1996 women who receive Social Security benefits based upon their own work record received an average benefit of $657, while women whose benefits are based upon their husband's work record received $596, just a 10-percent difference [Social Security Administration]. 
   In other words, there is no motherhood penalty in Social Security. 
   If Senator HARKIN wants to help mothers, why doesn't he embrace tax relief like the Senate Marriage Tax Relief Act, which would allow parents to keep more of their income before it gets sent to Washington? 
   Instead, his proposal would take a program already under financial distress and make it go broke faster. 
   Moreover, under the Harkin amendment, years after you've incurred the expense and raised your children, you get a few more benefits from the Federal Government. Who pays for those benefits? You guessed it, your children. Not much of a deal. 
   The Harkin amendment is exactly the wrong solution to help stay-home parents. 
   Senator HARKIN estimates this proposal would cost just a few billion over the next 10 years. That is a gross underestimate. 
   While the Social Security Administration has not estimated the ``motherhood'' proposal, economist Henry Aaron offered a ``seat-of-the-pants'' estimate in Slate Magazine [4/5/00] of .25 percent of taxable wages. 
   That's about $150 billion over 10 years. 
   Meanwhile, Senator HARKIN's proposal to increase widow's benefits would cost about .32 percent of taxable wages [Report of the 1994-1996 Advisory Council on Social Security, Volume I: Findings and Recommendations, January 1997]. 
   That translates into $166 billion over the next 10 years. Now the Senator has put a limit on his benefit, so it won't cost quite that much, but it is still substantial. 
   The Harkin amendment claims to pay for these new benefits by transferring money from general funds to the Social Security trust fund. 
   The amount of the suggested transfers is staggering. Including interest, it literally amounts to over 60 trillion dollars over the life of the transfers--over sixty trillion dollars! 
   What do general fund transfers accomplish to help ease the burden taxpayers face in coming years? Nothing. 
   What do the experts have to say about general fund transfers? President Clinton's Budget: ``These [trust fund] balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures but only in a bookkeeping sense. These funds are not set up to be pension funds, like the funds of private pension plans. They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.'' 
   Congressional Budget Office: ``The Administration's proposals would create transactions between government accounts, but such intra-governmental transfers do not by themselves increase the resources available to the government.'' 
   Dan Crippen--Director of the Congressional Budget Office: ``Too many of us--from the President to members of Congress to my high school classmates--believe the current balances in the Social Security trust funds will help ease the burden on the children of the baby boomers. That is, unfortunately, not true.'' 
   Henry Aaron--Brookings Institute: ``The president proposes to deposit government bonds to defray part of this unfunded liability, thereby putting a call on future general revenues--personal and corporation income taxes--to pay for this unfunded liability,'' according to testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, 2/2/99. 
   Mr. President, Senator HARKIN's trust fund transfers are a fraud. 
   Whether the system is financed through payroll taxes or from general funds, the Social Security system is poised to claim an increasing share of future worker income. By 2075, that share is one-fifth of taxable payroll--20 cents of every dollar a worker earns. 
   That 20 cents is taken before the other income taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes are collected to pay for national defense, policing the streets, educating children, and other government services. 
   It also is assessed before the worker can purchase housing, clothing, food, education, and transportation. All for a program that--in many cases--offers the worker less money than he or she contributed. 
   Meanwhile, expanding Social Security benefits when the program is already going broke is wholly irresponsible. 
   As Robert Reischauer, former Congressional Budget Office Director, observed about similar proposals. ``We still have a program that is going to face difficulties. Compounding those difficulties is not responsible policy.'' 
   The Harkin amendment is the worst sort of pandering. It pits one generation against another. Younger workers against older retirees. It should be defeated.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, amendment No. 3795 to the Interior appropriations bill deals with the U.S. Forest Service's proposed roadless initiative. My amendment would earmark $1 million from the Forest Service's timber sales account and direct the Secretary of Agriculture to charter an advisory committee, under the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, to review the proposed rules and the accompanying draft environmental impact statement for the roadless area initiative. The advisory committee would be charged to provide the Secretary with advice on improving the proposed rule and the draft environmental impact statement. 
   My amendment would further prohibit the Secretary from spending any additional appropriations under this or any other act on the further development of the roadless area rule until the Secretary has received the report of the advisory committee. 
   Let me tell you why I am offering such an amendment. To date, the subcommittee that I chair, the Forests and Public Land Management Subcommittee, has held three oversight hearings on the roadless area initiative launched by our President last fall. I can tell the members of this committee unequivocally that this is the most slipshod rulemaking effort I have seen--the worst example--in over 20 years as a federally elected official. 
   Let me note an example we have found in an examination of the communiques with the White House. For example, this is a letter to Raymond Mosley, Director of the Federal Register. This comes from an officer within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
   She says:  
   Would you please correct our mistakes. In our haste to get the notice to the Register as quickly as possible, we failed to notice that the document heading was missing.  
   There has been such a phenomenal rush to judgment on this effort to fulfill the President's political agenda with this issue that all of the people have made mistakes and have had to go to the Federal Register's office to amend them. It is not unlike what we saw Katie McGinty do just this week with TMDL rules, where this Senate, 2 weeks ago, spoke to the fact that this rule ought to be delayed. The President withheld his signature of the MILCON appropriations bill, allowing the EPA to accelerate. 
   I suspect when we begin to examine the rules that have come out of EPA, signed by Katie McGinty yesterday, we will find the same kind of mistakes were made only because of a quick political rush to judgment to try to either circumvent the acts of Congress or to deny the public the kind of input that is important and justifiable in these kinds of procedures. 
   Among the numerous procedural violations of the Federal statute, I think the most egregious is the willful violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, an act that this administration has had trouble complying with many times. I could cite examples where other courts have ruled after the fact of the rulemaking that, yes, this administration had been in violation of FACA. Our oversight record and the executive branch's documents obtained during the oversight process provided a clear record of these violations. 
   Between May and July last year, a small group of environmental activists met with the White House, the Department of Agriculture, and Forest Service officials to develop what eventually became the proposed rule about which we are talking. All of these meetings were held behind closed doors with no notification provided to the public. Advice and materials were solicited from the environmentalists by executive branch officials in the form of legal memoranda, technical documents, polling data, media relations material, and paid advertising in support of the proposal. Here is an example: George Frampton, head of CEQ, from Mike Francis at the Wilderness Society. Through all of these processes, what they are suggesting is that we submit to you the necessary materials from which you can move to deal with this issue. 
   I think it is fascinating we find Mike Francis saying: I attach a draft of the ``letter to the chief'' concept that Charles, Mike, and I have worked on as an idea to provide historical linkage to the President. 
   Ironically, the very letter that George Frampton then sends to the Secretary of Agriculture proposing this rulemaking was a parallel letter, almost identical, word for word. Mr. Frampton, before our committee, did make reference to the fact that, yes, they were very similar, if not alike. That letter came from the Wilderness Society itself. 
   In many cases, these materials were used by executive branch officials in charge of developing the proposed rule. For example, the polling data was used by lower level officials to brief their superiors. In another instance, there was direct consultation between the outside groups and the administration to coordinate paid and earned media efforts.  
   Let me repeat that. Government officials sat down with outside groups prior to the rulemaking process and determined 
   that they would launch a paid media campaign. There was even dialog within these memoranda that we gathered that suggested dates and times and the kinds of media markets we are talking about. Of course, I have referenced the letter to the Secretary from George Frampton, which is a mirror image of the letter that was proposed by staff at the Wilderness Society. 
   In response to the questions before my subcommittee, administration officials conceded that the issue of compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act was never raised in their meetings or deliberations, and counsel was never consulted on the matter. 
   This group of environmental advisers was in every way but one an advisory committee to the Federal Government. The one exception was that the committee was never chartered under the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Had they been chartered, the composition of the committee would have had to have been balanced or at least more balanced than it was, and their meetings would have had to have been published and open to the media and to the public. In other words, the process of sunshine and public participation would have had to have been involved in this very process. 
   Those are citing just a few of the differences and what I believe are substantial violations. Left to its own devices, the administration will not correct the legal violations. They have been cited and examples have been given, both in my committee and at a comparable committee in the House. Lawsuits have been filed. Yet they will not respond. They are simply charging ahead to a pre-November deadline so that all of this fits into the political context that they chose to bring it into by the very announcement of the President last October. 
   I think, therefore, it is up to Congress to correct these violations and the resulting inequities. We must, unfortunately, intervene if we want to see the rule of law followed and direct the Secretary to follow the law and charter an advisory committee legally under FACA. Then a broader range of interests will have the opportunity afforded to a selected few with connections to high-level administration officials as insiders and friends. The advice they will offer to improve the proposed rule will be offered in the sunlight of public disclosure and ultimately cause the reaction, as it should, of public opinion. It will not be offered in secret, and it will not be offered behind closed doors as it was. This would restore the rule of law and sunshine in Government. 
   The reason I offer this is the magnitude and the significance of the issue. Some who are from States that are not impacted by large public landownerships or some who oftentimes think that environmental votes are just easy and free to make because they have little or no consequence to their constituency ought to react to this by saying that the administration stepped beyond the rule of law, clearly outside of the intent of what Congress designed in the Federal Advisory Committee Act. 
   This is the magnitude, the significance of what I am talking about. This chart is significant only as a visual. These red areas represent approximately 42 million acres of existing Forest Service wilderness. Every acre of this 42 million was heard before a House and Senate committee. It was a give and take between the delegates of the State and other Senators and Representatives. It was debated on the floor of the House and the Senate, and it was ultimately passed, all 42 million acres of existing Federal Forest Service designated wilderness. In other words, the public process was full. 
   What the President announced in October and what has been going on behind closed doors--with now a few public hearings--is the yellow or nearly 60 million acres of public lands now up for redesignation by this President. 
   What does that represent? It represents the whole State of Massachusetts and the whole State of Rhode Island and the whole State of Connecticut and the whole State of New Jersey and the whole State of Delaware and the whole State of Pennsylvania and the whole State of Maryland and the whole State of West Virginia. Sixty million acres of land are being decided by this President and a few of his administrators with Congress not speaking a word. Never before in the history of this country has an action of this magnitude been taken without full public process and without action and participation on the part of the Congress itself. 
   What I am suggesting by my amendment is meager in relation to the impact of what is going on behind the doors of the White House and USDA and the Forest Service. I am asking for $1 million out of the forest road fund. 
   I am asking that the Secretary inform an advisory committee of independent people, and that they advise us on the fact that FACA was or was not violated. I think the significance here is, if the President had operated under the law, or we believed that he did, I may not be here on the floor; although, I probably would be because I am dedicated to a public process. I believe that what my colleagues did in the sixties--the Democratic Party--in causing all meetings to be open and public and registered, and being the primary authors of the act, I think that is the right thing to do because I think the public ought to be involved. That is why we are here today--to involve the public in something that represents all of these States, 60 million acres of the public's land and the ultimate future of how that land will be managed. That is what is important about this amendment.

So instead of listing page after page of documentation, I am simply saying that the Secretary will constitute a committee under FACA to make determinations as to whether the appropriate actions have been taken.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will take a few moments to clarify where we are because I think some of our colleagues are slightly confused as to the amendment I offered dealing with the roadless area review and the FACA committee process, and the amendment our colleague from New Mexico has offered, and the Senator from California has just spoken to, dealing with fuel reduction in our forests. 
   There is no doubt, what I was attempting to do dealt specifically with the roadless area rule specific to whether there had been a violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. I was asking the Secretary to formulate an advisory committee to review that. 
   I had visited with Senator DOMENICI and several things came together that I think are important for us to deal with in the immediate. First of all, there have already been two lawsuits filed against this administration on the Federal Advisory Committee Act process as it relates to the roadless area review process. We believe a judge will make a decision on those two lawsuits, as to their validity and their ripeness, by mid-August. What is important here is for the courts to clarify whether FACA, as a law, is either real or dead letter. 
   Let me explain that. This administration has been accused and found in violation of FACA on several occasions. But the problem is, once the court has made that determination, the rule was already on the ground. So it is like they violated the law, but so what. The process is over with. 
   What the court will decide this time is, Is FACA a law that should intervene prior to a final rule and cause an administrative agency to change its course of direction or action prior to a final rule? That is what will happen in August. 
   I have decided it is important we do not get in front of that ruling by the courts. I think it is very important for this Congress to know whether the law it crafted, known as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, is a dead letter or if it is operative. Right now, based on findings, it is a Catch-22: Yes, they violated the law but so what; the rule is already in place. 
   That is not the intent of Congress. The intent of Congress is to cause a cause of action change in a rulemaking process if the Federal Advisory Committee Act has been violated. 
   Then enters the Los Alamos fire and Senator BINGAMAN and Senator DOMENICI trying to resolve that particular crisis of bad policy and bad decisionmaking coming together to not only create a catastrophic environmental situation but also ultimately to cost the taxpayers of this country $1 billion, or somewhere near that. That is the tip of an iceberg of a current forest health problem to which the Senator from California has spoken so clearly. 
   What the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from California saw, witnessed, experienced, with hundreds of lives and hundreds of families and lives displaced----

   Mr. CRAIG. Is the nature of a catastrophic event that is in the nature of forest health. 
   We now have 22 million acres of our forested lands in crisis because of the fuel loading that has been talked about because of a management style of the last 50 years. Yet there seems to be no desire to deal with this on a constructive, environmentally positive basis that begins to remove that fuel. 
   The amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, of which I am now a cosponsor, which is a substitute offered to my amendment, goes at this problem in a very real and direct way. That is why I think it is so important that we move forward. I have been advised--and I agree--we should allow the courts to act on the Federal Advisory Committee Act. We will find out whether we have a real law or whether we have a false law; whether it works or it does not work. We will know that by mid-August. If they rule otherwise, we have either to come in and revise it or I think the Congress should act and intervene against the President in his rulemaking process, outside the public policymaking process of the Congress itself. But in the meantime, there is no question in my mind, with my activities, looking at the U.S. forest-managed lands--last week I was in Great Falls, MN. Last year, on July 4, they had a 472,000-acre blowdown. There are fuel loading problems in that State and every other State in the Nation that has public forested lands, that are phenomenal in their nature. 
   Let me explain. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, talked about literally having barrels of gasoline on the ground, in equivalent Btus of fire capability. It is believed that in  these areas, 22 million acres, at least at the top of the stack, that fuel loading equivalency is nearly 10,000 gallons of gasoline per acre in equivalent Btu or firepower. 
   Yet our Forest Service and this administration choose not to do anything about it. If we are good stewards of the land, we will not allow the stand-altering, environmentally crazy policy of catastrophic fire of the kind in the forests of New Mexico and the kind that are burning across the West today to be the policy of the management of our forests. 
   I would be the first to tell you we ought to reenter fire as a management tool of the ecosystems of our forests, but fire ought not enter an acre of land that has 10,000 gallons of gasoline stored in the form of slash and dead and dying timber in equivalent Btu's. That we cannot tolerate, or it will truly destroy the land as we know it, the environment as we know it, the riparian areas as we know them, and certainly habitat for any wildlife, let alone any kind of constructive management that would provide the needed fiber for our public in home building, paper, and so many materials we have wisely used our forests for over the years. 
   I support Senator DOMENICI, Senator BINGAMAN, and Senator FEINSTEIN as a cosponsor of this substitute. It is critically important. 
   In closing, in the substitute there is an important analysis, and it is an analysis that deals with the roadless problem. If the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico becomes law, it will cause the Forest Service to develop a cohesive strategy for protecting people and sustaining resources in fire-adaptive ecosystems; in other words, a fire strategy to deal with these kinds of fuel loadings. It would then have to place that strategy against the other rulemaking processes that are underway. 
   One of those rulemaking processes is the roadless area review or the roadless area protection proposal, to see whether that proposal denies the Forest Service the ability to manage these lands to protect them from catastrophic fire. I find that an important test and a necessary analysis of where we are going and how we want to manage these lands. 
   It also causes them to look at the areas of concern of the Senator from California--the Sierra Nevada framework and the Sierra Nevada draft plan environmental impact statements. All of those deserve to be examined in light of the fire situation we have on these public lands at this moment. We cannot idly sit by and watch hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of acres a year burn in wildfires, destroying wildlife habitat, destroying fiber that could be constructively used and, most important, dramatically altering the ecosystems of those areas that embody these catastrophic fires. 
   I support the substitute. It is important we stay in focus on the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The courts will rule in August, and then Congress will be able to act according to that ruling if, in fact, the courts have decided the Federal Advisory Committee Act is a dead letter in public law. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in a few moments we may be voting on a motion to strike section 116 of this appropriations bill. That is the amendment offered by our colleague from Illinois. I hope Senators will join with us, as they did last year, in opposing this kind of striking of language. 
   The Senator from New Mexico has said it so clearly, as have the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Wyoming. They have caused all of us to understand where we are in the process of reexamining the grazing permits of western livestock grazers. 
   I don't think we have put it in the context we ought to for the Senator from Illinois. If we had, maybe he would be less inclined to come to the floor with this issue in hopes of gaining another environmental certificate this year from the Sierra Club for his charging, dynamic rhetoric on behalf of the environment. 
   Let me for a moment, if I may, deal with this in a hypothetical way. What if there had been a lawsuit in Rosemont, IL, that suggested the air traffic coming into O'Hare Airport was causing air congestion within that air shed and that air quality could not be arrived at there without changing the character of the management of the O'Hare Airport by reducing its flights by 50 percent? 
   Of course, the Senator from Illinois and I know--he lives in that region; I fly in and out of that region--if you do that, O'Hare Airport is out of business. Thousands and thousands of people would be laid off, if that were to become a Federal rule or a restriction against that activity. More importantly, this is a hypothetical case. 
   There is a lawsuit that the air traffic coming in and out of O'Hare has created a situation that disallowed that area from gaining its air quality standards. So EPA is in there examining it and establishing a rule to see whether O'Hare can continue to manage its air flights in and out in a way as to sustain its viability and meet the air quality standards. But the rule hasn't been made at a time that the judge has said: Either get it done or I will enforce a reduction in air traffic by 50 percent. 
   The Senator from Idaho likes that idea, so I come to the floor on the appropriations bill for the Department of Transportation and say: I want to strike an amendment the Senator from Illinois has in there. Let's extend this period of time and allow EPA to complete its rulemaking process so that we can keep O'Hare alive. 
   I think it is important that we put all of these kinds of things in context. Illinois is not a public grazing State. Idaho is, New Mexico is, Arizona is, Montana is, and so is Wyoming. What the Senator from New Mexico has said is that under today's environmental laws, and yesterday's environmental laws, these grazers will be allowed to graze during that period of time in which the permit process, through an examination by BLM or the Forest Service, is ongoing to reassess their permit and to adjust and change it in concert with current environmental law. I don't know why he would want to stop that. Obviously, he tried last year and the Council on Environmental Quality agreed with us, we defeated that amendment, and the environment is better today because of it. 
   I hope our colleagues will stand with the Senator from New Mexico, as they did last year, and say to the Senator from Illinois that we are not going to put ranchers out of business. We live with environmental law, we are sensitive to it, and we believe in it. We are not going to arbitrarily do as I suggested in my hypothetical case with O'Hare Airport, which is an area that is not of my interest, but it is an interest of the Senator from Illinois because it is in his State. I don't know much about it, but in my example I want to come in and arbitrarily change the name of the game. Of course, he would work to disallow that, and this Senator would respect the Senator from Illinois for saying that is not my business; that is the business of the Federal Aviation Administration and the State of Illinois, the city of Rosemont, and the Senator from Illinois--not the Senator from Idaho. I think that is the issue here. 
   In 1878, the diaries of a cavalry officer in charge of the cavalry in eastern Oregon, northern Nevada, and southern Idaho reflected the following:  
   I believe the grazing lands of this region to be 50 to 60 percent depleted.  
   That was in 1878. Why? No BLM management. No Federal land management. No standards. Large grazing herds out of the Southwest swept through that country and their history, of course, has filled our history books with the nostalgia of the great trail drives. But there was a young man who was used to the land, and at that time he made an observation that the grazing in the region he used to ranch in and that these Senators are concerned about had already been depleted by over 50 percent--in 1878. 
   I can say to the Senator from Illinois, because of the standards established by the grazing industry, the environmental community, the Federal Government, U.S. Forest Service, and BLM, many of those lands are much better today than they have ever been. In fact, everyone who knows the western grazing lands and the riparian zones the Senator so eloquently spoke of know that they are hundreds of percent better than just a few decades ago. In fact, let us not forget that when the Secretary of the Interior, at the beginning of his tenure back a few years ago, wanted to go out and find some bad grazing examples that he could talk about to change his grazing land policy, his staff came back and said: Mr. 
   Secretary, we can't find any. We can't find the kind of examples you want to bad mouth the grazing industry and management policies of the Forest Service and BLM because grazing has substantially improved and is continuing to improve. 
   That is what the Domenici provision, section 116, is all about--continuing that relationship of progressive improvement, environmentally, for the benefit of our country and for the benefit of the wildlife, but also for the benefit of the grazing industry. 
   Improved grazing and better grass in our country means fatter cattle. By the way, we sell them by the pound. I am not at all embarrassed for saying that. That is the way the industry works, in a balanced and necessary way. I thought it was important to bring this debate into context to the Senator from Illinois, who knows more about the subject I proposed hypothetically than I do. I suggest that I probably know a great deal more about public land grazing than he does. I and my family have used public lands for grazing for over 100 years. I have walked on them, I know the changes, and I have helped to get improved standards. We are doing it right on the public lands of the West today, and a great deal better than we used to do it. I think it is important that we recognize grass as an asset and a natural resource that can be used for a multitude of reasons. One of those reasons is to produce red meat protein for the American consumer. That is what the issue is about. I hope my colleagues will join with me in denying the Senator from Illinois his motion to strike. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak for a few moments. Senator DORGAN was on the floor talking about the character of his State and the character of this issue of estate tax or death tax, whatever we wish to call it. I call it that which destroys the American dream. 
   I have always been amazed that anyone who serves in public life can justify the revenue they spend for the sake of Government as somehow destroying someone else's life or property. Yet over the years, clearly, the estate tax provision of our national Tax Code has done just that. 
   The Presiding Officer is from the State of Wyoming. I am from Idaho. Much of our States are made up of farmers, ranchers, and small business people. Really, the character of the business and industry of our States is made up of small businesses. 
   Some of us strive all of our lives in a small business to create a little estate that we then want to hand to our children, if they choose to carry on that which we have developed. Yet in nearly every instance today, under current law, to be able to carry on that small Main Street business or that farm or that ranch, you have to re-buy it. You have to sell it to get the revenue to pay off the Federal Government, and then you spend the rest of your life, as the person who is the inheritor, paying for the business. 
   That is not the American dream. That is not what built the basis of wealth in our country which has generated this tremendous economy, which employs the men and women who make up the workforce of our economy. That is why I and others have consistently argued that, clearly, we needed to either eliminate the estate tax or do it in a way that recognizes those small- 
   and medium-size proprietorships and businesses that are not held in stock or in corporations. That is exactly what we are attempting to do. 
   I am always amazed that the other side will come to the floor and say: Well, this is a great idea, but then again we ought to consider this or that, and maybe we ought not to do that, and that somehow it is wrong to generate wealth in our society and to want to be able to pass it on to our children and grandchildren. 
   Shame on those who want to deny the American dream. Shame on those who want to deny the energy and the spirit that has created this country and made it the greatest country ever known on the face of the Earth--a country great for its ability to allow individual citizens to grow and generate wealth in business. That is what this debate is fundamentally about. So anybody who wants to come to the floor and deny us as a Congress, as a people, the right to deal with this issue in a fair and equitable way simply denies the average citizen of this country the American dream. 
   Let us not get lost in the words. Let us not get lost in the phraseology about a little bit here and a little bit there, and we have to have all this money to spend in Government. This is the time of the greatest prosperity in the history of this country. There are articles out there saying that the surplus is going to double and triple into the trillions of dollars; yet we still have in the law a situation that says: If you die, you lose. If you die, the Government gets your work. If you die, all of the lifetime you have spent building a little business, a farm, or a ranch is somehow no longer yours. 
   I am sorry, but I am not going to get fouled up in the rhetoric, and I am going to continue to come to the floor to try to cut through the silly philosophy that somehow the Government has a right to all your money. What we have here is a responsible and legitimate piece of legislation to change the tax law of this country to gradually move us out of the situation that says if you die, you sell your business and the Government gets the money. What is wrong with medium- and small-size businesses that are not large corporations or stock-held businesses? What is wrong with allowing your children to have them, if they want them to continue that business and continue that legacy?  
   That is the issue that is before us. That is what is embodied in H.R. 8. 
   I suggest that anybody who would want to say something different--whether it is on the minor side, or whether they want to use the politics of the day to deny this to the average American--shame on you. I don't see any good politics in that kind of bad politics.

   Mr. CRAIG. I am concerned about the funding level for Medicare contractors. The Senate committee mark reduces the FY 2001 funding level by $57 million below the President's Budget recommendation. I believe that this funding reduction will adversely impact fee-for-service claims processing activities and the ability of contractors to provide critical beneficiary and providers services. 
   In the recent past, we have seen the effect inadequate funding levels can have on services. In 1998 payments were slowed down, and beneficiaries and providers were forced to deal with more voice mail rather than human beings when they called their contractors with questions about claims. We need to fund this program adequately to ensure beneficiaries get the service they deserve.

   Mr. CRAIG. I thank Senator DOMENICI for spelling out so clearly the crisis on the Nation's public lands today. 
   Yesterday, I held a hearing and I had two regional foresters: A regional forester that largely is in charge of all the forests in Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington; the other forester in charge of all the forests along the Sierra Nevada in California. They admitted yesterday that this President's roadless policy is going to jeopardize 21 million acres of forested lands that are now at high risk to catastrophic wildfires, the very thing the Senator is talking about. Yet this President's policy is to lock it up, walk away, and hope it doesn't burn. 
   We are talking, as the Senator so clearly spelled out, about thinning and  cleaning--not extensive logging--but clearly changing the environment in a way that fire would not be as destructive as it has been at Los Alamos. 
   I cannot forget the picture on television, the DA Cat rolling along the fire line in the forests of New Mexico, rolling along the dirt, right down through a riparian area. Why? To put out the fire. 
   Now, if the proper action had happened the way the Senator spelled it out, that would never have occurred at Los Alamos, with 21 million acres now at risk of catastrophic wildfires as a result of this President's policy.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Judge Learned Hand once observed: ``The successful competitor, having been urged  to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins.'' 
   For Microsoft and the rest of our domestic high-tech industry, it may be too late to heed Judge Hand's warning. 
   Whatever justification the Justice Department used for its actions against Microsoft, the real measure of success in the Microsoft case is how it affects American consumers and the American economy. 
   From their perspective, the verdict is clear: The Justice Department's suit against Microsoft is bad for consumers, bad for high-tech markets, and bad for the country. 
   Mr. President, our anti-trust laws are unlike health and safety regulations. Their purpose isn't to protect the physical well being of citizens, but rather their pocketbooks. 
   Like other forms of economic regulation, a successful effort requires two conditions. First, there must exist a market failure. Second, the government must be in a position to fix that market failure. 
   The case against Microsoft fails both conditions. Our domestic computer markets are working just fine. For thirty years, they have been characterized by falling prices, rising performance, and increased choice: 
   According to the Commerce Department, quality-adjusted prices for computer memory chips have declined 20 percent per year since 1985; 
   A chip that sold for $1778 in 1974 cost just 47 cents in 1996; and according to the CBO, software prices have been falling between 3 and 15 percent per year on average. 
   Meanwhile, new products are being introduced every day. There are currently over 25,000 applications designed to run on Windows, yet the fastest growing segment of the market includes so-called ``Microsoft-Free'' applications. 
   Mr. President, I am one of the most computer illiterate members of the United States Senate, but I can pull airline flight information off the internet faster than anybody here. I use my Palm Pilot to do it. The Palm Pilot doesn't have any Microsoft products in it. You can browse the internet with your cell phone too. Again, no Microsoft. 
   And just recently, Linux-based software writer Red Hat announced a partnership with Dell Computer to accelerate the commercial adoption of the Linux operating system. This new system would compete directly with Windows-based computers. 
   Lower prices, better performance, increased choice--Mr. President, there is no market failure in our domestic computer industry. To suggest otherwise doesn't pass the laugh test. 
   Nor does the suggestion that consumers are better off following Judge Jackson's ruling. All the evidence suggests just the opposite. 
   One unique aspect of today's economy is that America's consumers are also America's owners. Fully one-half of American families own stock in American companies. Those families have been hurt by the Microsoft case. 
   On April 3, Judge Jackson issued his finding of law. That day, the Nasdaq stock index crashed. It fell a record 349 points. That's a loss to Americans of about $450 billion--or about 5 percent of our national income. 
   Gone, in one day. 
   Mr. President, a basic premise of anti-trust action is to defend consumers. We want to protect competition, not competitors. 
   Yet, in the Microsoft case, it was the competition that pointed the finger. Actual consumers were notably absent. So how did the markets treat Microsoft's competition following Judge Jackson's ruling? Poorly. 
   Of the companies that testified against Microsoft--Intel, IBM, Compaq, Oracle, AOL, Sun Microsystems, Intuit, Apple, and Gateway--only one saw its stock rise in the month following the Judge's ruling. Every other stock had dropped, some by as much as 30 percent. 
   This decline is no coincidence. According to a study recently published in the Journal of Financial Economics, whenever the government's antitrust suit has scored a victory against Microsoft, an index of non-Microsoft computer stocks falls. When Microsoft wins a round, those computer stocks rise. 
   Judge Jackson may have ruled against Microsoft, but the markets have ruled against government interference in the New Economy. 
   Mr. President, the only monopoly consumers need to worry about in the Microsoft case is the monopoly government regulation has over private industry. 
   Having stood on the sidelines while American's high-tech community led the American economy into the twenty-first century, the government is now stepping in and telling those same corporations how to run their business. 
   Economic regulation used to be popular in Washington, DC. At one point in the late 1970s, the federal government controlled the pricing and market access of all our transportation industries--trucking, airlines, rail, and pipeline--as well as the energy industry. 
   Today, those regulations are gone, and we are all better off. The last twenty years of economic growth and prosperity demonstrates that those regulations did the economy more harm than good. 
   In many ways, our anti-trust laws are the last toe-hold of economic regulation in the federal code. 
   Unfortunately, it's a growing toe-hold. The number of investigations by the Justice Department under our anti-trust laws has exploded in recent years, rising from 134 in 1995 to 276 in 1997. 
   Which begs the question, who's next? 
   Now that the Justice Department has been turned loose, who are the other innovative companies that might want to ensure that their lawyer's retainers are fully paid? 
   Intel: With a market share of 80 percent, Intel is by far the leader in sales of the microprocessor market for PCs. While this lead seems reasonable, since Intel invented the first microprocessor in 1971, innovation isn't a defense in anti-trust law. Intel's profit margins have exceeded 20 percent for the past five years. 
   AOL: With almost 25 million online subscribers, AOL is the clear worldwide leader in online services. Investor Research says: ``The service has continued to make significant gains in the number of customers, despite charging a monthly fee of $21.95 that is higher than the industry's standard fee of $19.95.'' Do higher fees indicate monopoly rents? 
   Cisco: Cisco Systems is the world's largest supplier of high performance computer internetworking systems. It supplies the majority of networking gear used for the internet. According to Investor Research: ``Demand for switches is being driven by a need for greater bandwidth by corporate users: Cisco dominates this market.'' Mr. President, the term dominates is bad in the anti-trust world. 
   EBAY: EBAY operates the world's largest person-to-person online trading community, with more than 10 million registered users and 3 million items listed for sale. You can purchase antiques, coins, collectibles, computers, memorabilia, stamps, and toys on EBAY from other individuals. Profit Margins: 70 percent plus. Seven Zero. 
   One irony in the Microsoft case is that Netscape, the frequently cited ``victim'' in the case against Microsoft, was in 1996 clearly a monopoly player in its own right, with over 80 percent of the browser market. Now, Netscape is owned by AOL, another monopoly-sized player. 
   America's high tech community used to shun government interference. They would be smart to continue to do so. The companies that encouraged the Microsoft lawsuit made a Faustian bargain. Now that the government has focused on this industry, it may be difficult to turn its attention elsewhere. 
   That's too bad. The case against Microsoft has hurt the high tech community where it counts--in its pocketbook. But the full cost of this ill-advised attack remains to be seen. Right now, America stands alone atop the New Economy. Increased government intervention is a good way to ensure that dominance doesn't last.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, earlier this week the Administration released, with much media fanfare, a draft document known as the climate change ``National Assessment'' that purports to assess ``the potential consequences of climate variability and change'' in the United States. I have received several media requests for comments on this document. 
   The document is of considerable length, Mr. President--approximately 600 pages. Frankly, because of its length and the short time I've had to review it, I have been able to give it only a quick review. 
   My preliminary conclusion is that the National Assessment could provide a useful contribution to the climate change debate if it stimulates more serious national interest in advancing climate science. 
   What is clear to me, even after only a quick read, is that the National Assessment was produced in a style and method that is somewhat akin to writing good science fiction. The authors begin with a few baseline assumption, then apply a vivid imagination to extrapolate outcomes based on those assumptions. 
   The literary application of science concepts makes the story intriguing to read, especially for readers with a scientific bent. 
   But the National Assessment is not the only current document that talks about climate change science. The ``Pathways Report'' published last Fall by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, is also a stimulating read. But it takes an entirely different approach. 
   One way you can tell that the National Assessment and Pathways Report are different in style is from the selection of punctuation. The National Assessment uses lots of exclamation points. Perhaps, that is one of the reasons why this document has gotten pretty good media attention already. The Pathways Report uses mostly question marks. 
   The National Assessment takes a single, linear approach to the climate change question. It simply extrapolates continued worldwide growth in carbon dioxide emissions throughout the 21st century, and assumes that growth will correlate to steadily rising temperatures around the world. The implications of those increases in temperature and carbon dioxide concentrations supply the creative images that the National Assessment's authors offer up. 
   The Pathways Report is dry by comparison. It is short on creative literature and long on technical issue framing--not particularly suitable for catchy media headlines, which may explain why many newspapers showed little interest in its existence or import. 
   But its critical and thorough scientific analysis of the current states of our climate change knowledge is what makes the Pathways Report so important to policy makers. 
   Now, if you are like me and you find out that America's National Research Council has just published the most comprehensive report in history on the state of climate science--you don't want to read all 550 pages! You want to cut to the chase and read the report's bottom line conclusion! And the last thing you want is a report that provides more questions than answers. 
   But the Pathways Report authors are brutally honest. To best explain the current state of climate science they had no choice but to lay out a whole series of potentially show-stopping questions. Now, none of these questions asks ``Is global warming for real?'' No, in fact, once you begin to ponder the Pathway questions you realize that the climate change issue cannot be resolved with any simple thumbs up or thumbs down. 
   Here are some of the scientific questions that the Pathways Report focuses on: 
   How much do we know about the earth's capacity to assimilate natural and man-made greenhouse gas emissions? Do we need to learn more? What, in particular, do we know about the oceans' capacity to absorb carbon dioxide? How much of this absorption occurs naturally? What can be done to increase ocean assimilation of carbon dioxide? 
   And these are just the opening round of questions. 
   What is the effect of the oceans on our climate? What is the state of our understanding of ocean cycles and of other changes in ocean temperature and salinity, and of how those changes, in turn, affect climate? How do we evaluate the natural variability of the climate, including such phenomena as El Nin 6o and the North Atlantic oscillation? Can we improve our understanding here? 
   Mr. President, let me stop for a moment and reflect on a recent trip I made to Woods Hole, Massachusetts with the Senator from New Hampshire, BOB SMITH, and our colleague from Rhode Island, LINCOLN CHAFEE. We spent a day at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute exploring these questions with over 30 scientists. It was a real eye-opening experience. 
   Dr. Berrrien Moore, who coordinated the publication of the Pathways Report, helped lead a discussion on where  science and public policy intersect. Dr. Bob Weller and Dr. Ray Schmitt along with several other prominent ocean scientists of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, gave us progress reports and fascinating explanations of their work and its relevance to climate science. 
   For example, Mr. President, did you realize that for each one degree change in the temperature of just the top three meters of ocean water, there is a corresponding one degree change in the temperature of the atmosphere above the surface of that water all the way to outer space? Did you know, Mr. President, that 80 percent or more of our climate variation is influenced by the oceans? 
   Two themes came through clearly in those discussions, Mr. President: 
   There are significant gaps in scientific understanding of the way oceans and the atmosphere interact to affect climate; and 
   Scientists need more data, especially from the oceans to better understand and predict possible changes. 
   Mr. President, it was humbling to get a glimpse of how much we don't know. 
   Now let me continue with the rest of the questions the Pathways Report urges us to consider. 
   How accurately can we predict climate trends whose recurrences are measured in years? In decades? In centuries? In millennia? Are we capable of plotting the effects, and counter effects, of these complexly interwoven trends on each other? Do we even have the capability to observe these trends and counter-trends accurately? Do we have the computational ability to integrate all these trends and counter trends into one big equation? 
   How much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere emanates from the oceans? Does this amount vary from place to place and time to time? Does such variation matter? 
   Those are just some of the questions that we policymakers cannot answer ourselves. But we need answers--and to get them, we will have to support the scientists on a more serious level than we have to date. 
   But there are more questions, Mr. President. These next ones we should be thinking about ourselves and discussing with scientists and with all of our concerned constituents. 
   Should U.S. policymaking on climate change rely primarily upon climate modeling performed by others outside the U.S.? Or should the U.S. have the capability to marshal data and scientific conclusions independent of foreign countries who may or may not share our domestic policy concerns? 
   Again, Mr. President, let me pause for a moment and refer to the recent National Research Council's Climate Research Committee's report entitled ``Capacity of U.S. Climate Modeling to Support Climate Change Assessment Activities.'' 
   First, let me thank Dr. Maurice Blackmon from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, for his patience with me and my staff. He has helped us have a balanced appreciation for these issues. That report provides valuable guidance on this subject. On page 5 of that report, the NRC's Climate Research Committee states:  
   Although collaboration and free and open information and data exchange with foreign modeling centers are critical, it is inappropriate for the United States to rely heavily upon foreign centers to provide high-end modeling capabilities. There are a number of reasons for this including the following: * * * * * 
   2. Decisions that might substantially affect the U.S. economy might be made based upon ..... simulations ..... produced by countries with different priorities than those of the United States.  
   Mr. President, the National Assessment depended on the use of foreign computer models only. The authors of that document are completely up-front about that fact, and I commend them for their honesty. However, for the reasons contained in the NRC's modeling report, I am uncomfortable relying on the conclusions in the National Assessment. 
   The pace of science is dynamic and unpredictable. For example, just last month Science magazine reported on some intriguing experiments undertaken in the Indian Ocean. Those experiments raised the prospect that certain assumptions about aerosols incorporated in the Canadian and British climate models that underlie the National Assessment were fundamentally flawed. This means that the warming predictions from even these models are probably way too high. 
   Dr. Neal Lane, a White House spokesman, acknowledged this at Senator MCCAIN'S hearing on May 17 and feels it may be several years before this can be resolved. Unfortunately, the National Assessment's vivid scenarios were sent to the printer before this new discovery became public. 
   This seems to give us as policymakers only two choices: Either disregard the National Assessment and all the hard work that went into it, or re-do it with the assumptions corrected, this time using U.S. models. 
   Mr. President, when we make tough, historic policy decisions around here on everything from multilateral defense strategies, to global trade, to international farm output, we use our own intelligence and analysis, we don't simply rely on the technical work of other countries which may not see the world through the American prism. 
   With continued regard to America's climate modeling capability, Mr. President, I must ask--What are our national objectives? Do we have a national strategy in place to achieve those objectives? Is the strategy integrated and coordinated across all relevant agenices? Are NASA and DOE and NOAA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, all building the same model using a common blueprint? 
   Do we have adequate computational resources to fully exploit our evolving modeling capability? Do we have enough human talent dedicated to these tasks? 
   What is our confidence level in the integrity of all observational data used to validate climate models? Are our measurements ``close enough for government work''? 
   How can we be sure that the scientists are even measuring the right climate variables? Are there any important climate variables that are inadequately measured, or not measured at all? 
   Do we build climate observing requirements into existing, ongoing operational programs? At sea? In the atmosphere? In space? Should we do more? How many ships at sea are measuring water temperature and salinity? How many weather balloons and satellites are measuring and transmitting data? 
   Oceanographers I've visited tell me that they don't know the temperature or salinity of the ocean in most spots around the world today, much less ten or a hundred or a thousand years ago. 
   Do we need a discretely funded activity for the development and implementation of climate-specific observational programs? Where are we on the technology to monitor relevant national and global data? Is it developed? Is it fully deployed? Will other countries fully support this? 
   Have we assessed the capability and potential of U.S. and North American carbon sequestration, includng carbon sequestration through crops, forests, soils, oceans, and wetlands? 
   How do we ensure that the science that informs U.S. policy making is objective and complete? Do scientists have unfettered access to each other's completed work, especially when that work is funded by the government? Is the process of peer review adequate to assure all viewpoints are examined? 
   Regardless of politics, we in Congress share one tough job with our friends at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Science must drive policy and not vice versa. I don't know how else to make sure that happens other than to guarantee that the science gets put out on the table and is subject to public discussion and public scrutiny. 
   The American people have never been afraid of the truth. We'll deal with that. What we can't hack is being kept in the dark or being lied to by our own government. 
   The National Research Council's Pathways and Climate Modeling Reports raise some profoundly important questions. Our best policy decisions could turn on the answers to any of them. We owe to our constituents and to future generations to seek answers and not hide from whatever turns up. 
   The United States with its abundant resources, technological superiority, and economic power is in a unique position to provide leadership in scientific research that can lead to a more complete understanding of the natural and human influences currently at work in our oceans and atmosphere.  
   What is needed, Mr. President, is a national commitment embodied in a government framework that provides a ``blue print'' for responsible action based on consensus. Chairman MURKOWSKI and I have been working on that legislative ``blue print.'' 
   Taken together, our bills provide that ``blue print'' for consensus. While S. 882, Chairman MURKOWSKI's bill, appropriately focuses on our nation's enormous technological abilities, S. 1776, the bill I introduced last October constructs a complementary framework that ensures: 
   A critical analysis, evaluation, and integration of all scientific, technological, and economic facts; 
   A ``blue print'' for coordinated action that is both practical and conscientious so that the government will not neglect an issue or back us into less than optimum policy choices; 
   The advancement of climate science by integrating and focusing it on core questions; 
   Immediate actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in ways we will appreciate; 
   The encouragement of technology development; 
   No unnecessary burdens on citizens that can be caused by the government prematurely picking winners and losers; and 
   Process for consensus for future government actions. 
   Without consensus, Mr. President, our nation will languish in political stalemate, causing us to fall behind other nations in key technological areas. 
   Some insist that we sharply reduce our reliance on carbon as an energy source. Again, cost impact estimates vary widely--from little economic impact to belief that such action will mortally wound our economy. Yet, there has been no serious effort to systematically and critically analyze this issue by our government. 
   The National Assessment does not provide it. S. 1776 does. 
   Another area of concern expressed in National Research Council Reports, and mentioned prominently in recent NAS testimony before the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is the lack of governmental structure with the primary mission of coordinating climate programs.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I, too, was attending the joint committee hearing this morning on the situation at the laboratories at Los Alamos that FRANK MURKOWSKI chaired, along with RICHARD SHELBY. 
   I must tell you that it was shocking and angering to watch an administration that recognized a problem and failed to do anything about it--or very little--and then to ignore a Congress that recognized the problem after extensive hearings and which passed legislation last year into law; and we have a Secretary of Energy who ignored it and openly denied that he would do it. And then for the Secretary not to show up this morning at a hearing--I am not sure how we respond to it. 
   But I will tell you how the American people ought to respond to it. They ought to say: Mr. Secretary, you have failed and you have failed us in the security of our country. We ask that we find someone better to serve in that capacity. 
   That is what the American people ought to be saying. And I hope they will.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have come to the floor for the next few minutes to talk about something that is  very important to our country. Last week, I rose in defense of the second amendment to our Constitution. Why? Because it is under relentless attack at this moment by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is under relentless attack by the White House and has been now for nearly 8 solid years. They want to deny that there is a second amendment, or that there are legitimate rights under that amendment, and they simply want to control or shape what many Americans believe to be their constitutional right under the second amendment, and that is the right to own a firearm in this Nation. 
   The second amendment reads:  
   A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 
   It is a simple amendment, but, oh, what a powerful force it brings; and, oh, what important emotions it engenders in our country. 
   The enemies of the right to keep and bear arms tell us that because the word ``militia'' is present, the second amendment only protects the right of the Government to keep and bear arms. 
   If anyone in this body is a student of American history and understands the thinking of our Founding Fathers, they recognize their hostility toward a central government and their willingness to control a central government and give the citizens the greater expression of freedom but, most importantly, power over that central government. 
   Somehow, our colleague would like to ignore those thoughts and the mind set and the belief of the framers of our Constitution. But let me tell you that our framers knew what they were talking about. They said, ``A well regulated Militia'' means, in the words of George Mason, ``the whole people''--``the whole people'' was the regulation militia--``except a few public officers.'' 
   So never mind their restrictive reading of the Constitution. I think our scholars of history have widely recognized and rejected the idea that there is a narrow interpretation. 
   They tell us the second amendment only protects hunting and sport shooting. Read the Constitution. It is so very clear. It doesn't even mention the words ``hunting and sport shooting.'' I don't believe the term ``sport shooting'' was something used in those days. Hunting certainly was perceived to be a right, and even a responsibility, and a necessary tool of many families to put food on the table. 
   They cite Supreme Court cases--such as United States v. Miller--that state the second amendment protects private ownership of military-style weapons; then they try to ban private ownership of military-style weapons. How can you use the argument to argue its purpose and then turn and try to do quite the opposite? 
   I will simply point out for a few brief moments this afternoon the real inconsistencies in the argument that is presented by my colleagues on the other side and the blatant ignoring of our Constitution by the White House. But then those of us who are observers of the White House are not terribly surprised by that. 
   Am I being harsh? I don't think so, Mr. President. I think I am being very clear in what I say. 
   Senate gun controllers have said they do not want to confiscate the guns of Americans. But then other leaders in other countries--including Great Britain, Nazi Germany, Cambodia, Australia, Cuba, and Soviet Georgia--have said the same, and they would only license and register, and not confiscate. And, of course, they did license, they did register, and then they confiscated. 
   With my time remaining, let me point to a few examples as to why our Government said there was a right and why our Founding Fathers said under our Constitution there is a right. 
   Every 13 seconds, the stories I am about to tell you are repeated across this Nation. Every 13 seconds in America, someone uses a gun--not to kill someone else, but to stop a crime, to protect their property, to protect their life. Every 13 seconds across America, our citizens do what our Founding Fathers knew they must do as a free citizen; that is, protect 
   themselves in the right of self-defense. That is so much what our second amendment is about. 
   Let me tell you about this lady, whom I show here on the chart, from Spring Hill, FL, May 24 of this year. It says: ``A pistol-packing grandmother with a license to carry calmly approached a man with a knife who was scuffling with employees at a Wal-Mart and ordered him to drop'' the knife. He dropped the knife. She held him at bay. They called the cops, and the cops arrested him. 
   Thank you, grandma, for being willing to defend your rights and the integrity of others. 
   Let me talk about someone who invaded the home of one of our citizens in Benton Harbor in Berrien County.  
   Prosecutor Jim Cherry announced Thursday he will not file homicide charges against a man who shot and killed Rodney Lee Moore last month at a Benton Harbor housing complex.  
   Why? Because this man was defending his life and defending the life of his family. He had been attacked. He had been injured. And yet, he struggled, he found his gun, and he protected his person by taking the intruder's life. 
   That is the right of a free citizen in a free society--to defend oneself and one's property. 
   One more example. I know there are other colleagues on the floor who wish to speak on other issues. But it is an important example. 
   It was the night of January 31 of this year in Apache Junction, AR, 25 miles from Phoenix. It began when a woman was getting into her SUV in a Wal-Mart parking lot in nearby Chandler. She was approached by a man riding a bicycle. He pulled out a gun, forced her into her SUV, and made her drive to an isolated area 15 miles away. He raped her. Then he abandoned her in the desert. 
   According to the Chandler Police Department sergeant, Ken Phillips, ``He left her in a desert area and starts to drive away, but turns around, comes back, and he shoots her twice.'' The woman, suffering from bullet wounds in her face, her chest, and her arm, was miraculously able to walk a quarter of a mile for help. 
   This dangerous criminal then drove his victim's SUV to the home of his former boss, Jeff Tribble. In that home, Mr. Tribble, his 28-year-old wife Bricie, and their 9-year-old nephew resided. The criminal broke into their house. What happened? Sergeant Phillips said that this gentleman's wife, Mr. Tribble's wife, got her gun and shot the criminal twice--once in the face and once in the chest--and he dropped dead. Then she called 911 to report the shooting of an intruder who had just hours before raped and shot another person. 
   Those are the stories that are not being told to America today. And they happen every 13 seconds across our Nation. Two and one-half million Americans annually use the second amendment right to protect themselves, their property, their children, and their spouses. That is the right of a free citizen. That is why the second amendment is in the Constitution. 
   I do not in any way by these statements fail to recognize the tragedies that occur when a gun is misused in our society. It is misused much too often. But it is time we speak out. 
   I have said several times to those who may be listening or who might read my statement to call me or write me. Tell me about your story. Tell me about what happened in your community. Literally, citizens are now doing that. Tell me about the right of the free citizen to protect themselves and their property. 
   It is very simple. It is, LARRY CRAIG, U.S. Senator, Washington, DC, 20510. 
   I would like to hear from you. I think it is time America is heard, about how other Americans use their sacred right of the second amendment to protect themselves and their loved ones. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business, as the Chair has mentioned, until 12:30 p.m., with Senator DURBIN and Senator THOMAS in control of 1 hour each. 
   Following morning business, the Senate will recess for the weekly party conferences. As a reminder, the official Senate picture will be taken at 2:15 p.m. today. I encourage my colleagues to be prompt in an attempt to complete the photo in a timely manner. 
   When the Senate reconvenes, it is hoped the Senate can begin consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. Senators who intend to offer amendments to this important legislation are encouraged to keep their amendments germane in an effort to complete action on the bill prior to the end of the week. 
   I thank my colleagues.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I certainly concur with my colleague that I hope we can move forward on these critical issues. We are now working hard at accomplishing some of those efforts. As he mentioned, the conference on the Patients' Bill of Rights is at work. We hope we can build a bipartisan compromise as necessary to produce that kind of program and law and protection for the American consumers of health care. 
   There is a great deal of work to be done. I hope we can come together in a united and bipartisan way to resolve some of these issues, to move the appropriations bills forward, to make sure we complete our business in a timely manner. 
   Of course, I understand, as I think my colleague from Nevada understands, that is going to take cooperation from both sides. Tragically, and sadly, we got into a bit of a nonproductive period prior to the Memorial Day recess. I hope the recess has cleared the air and we can come back in a productive way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appear on the floor to speak about a provision of the Constitution of our country that has been under nearly constant attack for 8 years. In fact, we heard on the floor this morning two Senators speak about provisions in law that would alter a constitutional right. 
   The provision I am talking about is part of our Bill of Rights--the first 10 amendments to our Constitution--which protect our most basic rights from being stripped away by an overly zealous government, including rights that all Americans hold dear: 
   The freedom to worship according to one's conscience; 
   The freedom to speak or to write whatever we might think; 
   The freedom to criticize our Government; 
   And, the freedom to assemble peacefully. 
   Among the safeguards of these fundamental rights, we find the Second Amendment. Let me read it clearly:  
   A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of  the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.  
   I want to repeat that. 
   The second amendment of our Constitution says very clearly that ``A well regulated Militia'' is ``necessary'' for the ``security of a free State,'' and that ``the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' 
   What we heard this morning was an effort to infringe upon that right. 
   Some--even of my colleagues--will read what I have just quoted from our Constitution quite differently. They might read ``A well regulated Militia,'' and stop there and declare that ``the right of the people to keep and bear Arms'' actually means that it is a right of our Government to keep and bear arms because they associate the militia with the government. Yet, under this standard, the Bill of Rights would protect only the right of a government to speak, or the right of a government to criticize itself, if you were taking that same argument and transposing it over the first amendment. In fact, the Bill of Rights protects the rights of people from being infringed upon by Government--not the other way around. 
   Of course, we know that our Founding Fathers in their effort to ratify the Constitution could not convince the citizens to accept it until the Bill of Rights was established to assure the citizenry that we were protecting the citizens from Government instead of government from the citizens. 
   Others say that the Second Amendment merely protects hunting and sport shooting. They see shooting competitions and hunting for food as the only legitimate uses of guns, and, therefore, conclude that the Second Amendment is no impediment to restricting gun use to those purposes. 
   You can hear it in the way President Clinton assures hunters that his gun control proposals that will not trample on recreation--though his proposals certainly walk all over their rights. 
   In fact, the Second Amendment does not merely protect sport shooting and hunting, though it certainly does that. 
   Nor does the second amendment exist to protect the government's right to bear arms. 
   The framers of our Constitution wrote the Second Amendment with a greater purpose. 
   They made the Second Amendment the law of the land because it has something very particular to say about the rights of every man and every woman, and about the relationship of every man and every woman to his or her Government. 
   That is: The first right of every human being, the right of self-defense. 
   Let me repeat that: The first right of every human being is the right of self-defense. Without that right, all other rights are meaningless. The right of self-defense is not something the government bestows upon its citizens. It is an inalienable right, older than the Constitution itself. It existed prior to government and prior to the social contract of our Constitution. It is the right that government did not create and therefore it is a right that under our Constitution the government simply cannot take away. The framers of our Constitution understood this clearly. Therefore, they did not merely acknowledge that the right exists. They denied Congress the power to infringe upon that right. 
   Under the social contract that is the Constitution of the United States, the American people have told Congress explicitly that we do not have the authority to abolish the American people's right to defend themselves. Further, the framers said not only does the Congress not have the power to abolish that right, but Congress may not even infringe upon that right. That is what our Constitution says. That is what the Second Amendment clearly lays out. Our Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment to tell us that a free state cannot exist if the people are denied the right or the means to defend themselves. 
   Let me repeat that because it is so fundamental to our freedom. A free state cannot exist, our free state of the United States collectively, cannot exist without the right of the people to defend themselves. This is the meaning of the Second Amendment. Over the years a lot of our citizens and many politicians have tried to nudge that definition around. But contrary to what the media and the President say, the right to keep and bear arms is as important today as it was 200 years ago. 
   Every day in this country thousands of peaceful, law-abiding Americans use guns to defend themselves, their families, and their property. Oftentimes, complete strangers are protected by that citizen who steps up and stops the thief or the stalker or the rapist or the murderer from going at that citizen. 
   According to the FBI, criminals used guns in 1998 380,000 times across America. Yet research indicates that peaceful, law-abiding Americans, using their constitutional right, used a gun to prevent 2.5 million crimes in America that year and nearly every year. In fact, I believe the benefits of protecting the people's right to keep and bear arms far outweighs the destruction wrought by criminals and firearms accidents. The Centers for Disease Control report 32,000 Americans died from firearm injuries in 1997; under any estimate, that is a tragedy. Unfortunately, the Centers for Disease Control do not keep data on the number of lives that were saved when guns were used in a defensive manner. 
   Yet if we were to survey the public every year, we would find 400,000 Americans report they used a gun in a way that almost certainly saved either their life or someone else's. Is that estimate too high? Perhaps. I hope it is, because every time a life is saved from violence, that means that someone was threatening a life with violence. But that number would have to be over 13 times too high for our opponents to be correct when they say that guns are used to kill more often than they are used to protect. What they have been saying here and across America simply isn't true and the facts bear that out. 
   We are not debating the tragedy. We are debating facts at this moment. They cannot come up with 2.5 million gun crimes. But clearly, through surveys, we can come up with 2.5 million crimes thwarted every year when someone used a gun in defense of themselves or their property. In many cases, armed citizens not only thwarted crime, but they held the suspect until the authorities arrived and placed that person in custody. 
   Stories of people defending themselves with guns do not make 
   the nightly news. It just simply isn't news in America. It isn't hot. It isn't exciting. It is American. Sometimes when people act in an American way, it simply isn't reportable in our country anymore. So the national news media doesn't follow it. 
   Yet two of the school shootings that have brought gun issues to the forefront in the last year, in Pearl, MS, and Edinboro, PA, were stopped by peaceful gun owners using their weapons to subdue the killer until the police arrived. How did that get missed in the story? It was mentioned once, in passing, and then ignored as people ran to the floor of the Senate to talk about the tragedy of the killing. Of course the killing was a tragedy, but it was also heroic that someone used their constitutional right to save lives in the process. 
   A third school shooting in Springfield, OR, was stopped because some parents took time to teach their child the wise use of guns. So when that young man heard a particular sound coming from the gun, he was able to rush the shooter, because he knew that gun had run out of ammunition. He was used to guns. He was around them. He subdued the shooter and saved potentially many other lives. We have recognized him nationally for that heroic act, that young high school student of Springfield, OR. 
   For some reason, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle never want to tell these stories. They only want to say, after a crisis such as this, ``Pass a new gun control law and call 9-1-1.'' Yet these stories are essential to our understanding of the right of people to keep and bear arms. 
   I will share a few of these stories right now. Shawnra Pence, a 29-year-old mother from Sequim, WA, home alone with one of her children, heard an intruder break into the house. She took her .9 mm, took her child to the bedroom, and when the 18-year-old criminal broke into the bedroom, she said, ``Get out of my house, I have a gun, get out now.'' He left and the police caught him. She saved her life and her child's life. It made one brief story in the Peninsula Daily news in Sequim, WA.  
   We have to talk about these stories because it is time America heard the other side of this debate. There are 2.5 million Americans out there defending themselves and their property by the use of their constitutional right. 
   In Cumberland, TN, a 28-year-old Jason McCulley broke into the home of Stanley Horn and his wife, tied up the couple at knife-point, and demanded to know where the couple kept some cash. While Mrs. Horn was directing the robber, Mr. Horn wriggled free from his restraints, retrieved his handgun, shot the intruder, and then called the police. The intruder, Jason McCulley, subsequently died. If some Senators on the other side of the aisle had their way, perhaps the Horns would have been killed and Jason McCulley would have walked away. 
   Earlier today, we heard the Senator from Illinios and the Senator from California read the names people killed by guns in America. Some day they may read the name Jason McCulley. I doubt they will tell you how he died, however, because it doesn't advance their goal of destroying the Second Amendment. But As Paul Harvey might say: Now you know the rest of the story. 
   Every 13 seconds this story is repeated across America. Every 13 seconds in America someone uses a gun to stop a crime. Why do our opponents never tell these stories? Why do the enemies of the right to keep and bear arms ignore this reality that is relived by 2.5 million Americans every year? Why is it that all we hear from them is, ``Pass a new gun control law, and, by the way, call 9-1-1.'' 
   I encourage all listening today, if you have heard of someone using their Second Amendment rights to prevent a crime, to save a life, to protect another life, then send us your story. There are people here who desperately need to hear this in Washington, right here on Capitol Hill. This is a story that should be played out every day in the press but isn't. 
   So let's play it out, right here on the floor of the Senate. Send me those stories from your local newspapers about that law-abiding citizen who used his constitutional right of self-defense. Send that story to me, Senator LARRY CRAIG, Washington, DC, 20510, or send it to your own Senator. Let him or her know the rest of the story of America's constitutional rights. 
   I ask unanimous consent to proceed for one more moment.

   Mr. CRAIG. Having said all of this, let there be no mistake. Guns are not for everyone. We restrict children's access to guns and we restrict criminals' access to guns, but we must not tolerate politicians who tell us that the Second Amendment only protects the right to hunt. We must not tolerate politicians who infringe upon our right to defend ourselves from thieves and stalkers and rapists and murderers. And we must not tolerate the politician who simply says: ``Pass another gun control law and call 9-1-1.'' 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator WELLSTONE for his consideration. I do appreciate that very much. 
   Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon, as most of us do, to speak about the crop insurance conference report that is now before us and to thank those conferees--the chairman of the full committee, Senator LUGAR, Senator ROBERTS, and others on our side, certainly, who were engaged, as they should be, to produce this conference report, and thank them for the hard work they have rendered in bringing about crop insurance reform. 
   It is a challenging process at best. They have done an excellent job in balancing the interests we have in agriculture, and to have crop insurance that reflects the diversity of agriculture itself. 
   With the passage of the farm bill, Congress--we--promised crop insurance that would work. I am pleased to see that we now are living up to that promise by passing sweeping legislation to bring some normalcy back to our Nation's farm economy and to expand the risk management tools available to our farmers and ranchers. 
   The crop insurance conference report addresses several concerns farmers from my State and I have about the current Crop Insurance Program. The conference report provides increased subsidies for greater buy-up of crop insurance, funding for research and development of specialty crop insurance, and the removal of the NAP area trigger, just to name a few of the improvements. 
   This legislation is a very balanced approach, containing meaningful and sweeping reforms that all of us would admit are long overdue. 
   As we all know, the agricultural economy has been in a dramatic slump for the last good number of years. USDA reports that overall conditions in the economy in early 2000 are largely a replay of last year. Agriculture is a part of the world economy, and farmers across the board are facing very difficult times. 
   For the past 2 years, though, we here in Congress have tried to respond to the agricultural crisis by providing over $15 billion in emergency economic aid. I do not stand back from that. I think it was appropriate and necessary to keep our agriculture economy out of bankruptcy. 
   The need this year is not much different than last. I am pleased that there is $7.1 billion in economic farm aid in this conference report. This funding includes $5.5 billion additional AMTA payments, or market loss payments; $200 million for specialty crops; $500 million for oilseed payments; $11 million for wool and mohair maintenance; loans for producers who were affected by the AgriBioTech bankruptcy that impacted my State and other States dramatically, including Oregon, Washington, Montana, some 30-plus States that were involved in both grass clover and alfalfa seeds. 
   I have worked for and supported the funding because I believe it is what our farmers need to stay in business in the short term. We must help them deal with this if we can; and I think we are. USDA reports that global economies are now improving. Of course, we know that many of our products sell openly in the world market. 
   As that economy improves, so does the demand for agricultural commodities from this country and the improvement of price. 
   The conference report also includes the Plant Protection Act, a bill I have been working on for nearly 2 years. What is it? It is a weeds program. That is what it is all about. I think those of us who are familiar with agriculture recognize that we have not been good at dealing with weeds. Those of us who live near large tracts of public land recognize that our public land neighbors have been less than good stewards of their land by allowing major increases in noxious weed populations on our public lands. This is a major step in the direction of improving that. It follows the President's initiative that was taken a couple of years ago with the legislation Senator AKAKA and I have worked on for some time. I hope we can meet the other needs that Senator AKAKA has, and I will work with him in the agricultural appropriations that will follow to see if we can make that happen. 
   This legislation will organize and expand the function of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. APHIS currently gets its authority from 10 different statutes, some of which are outmoded and conflicting and complicated. As a result, it simply has not provided us with the kind of consistency we need to deal with commercializing technologies and the use of biocontrols in the area of weeds.

   Again, I commend the conferees on both sides of the aisle for the hard work they have undertaken in producing this conference report in a way that will produce reform in crop insurance that I think is now functional, workable, and becomes the kind of risk  management tool we promised American agriculture some years ago. With that is the supplemental program for emergency purposes that will go a long way toward stabilizing the agricultural economy as we move through this year and into next. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, I want to briefly raise an issue that is of the utmost importance to produce growers and shippers throughout every region in the United States and of great concern to me and several other of my colleagues in both the House and Senate. 
   On October 27, 1999, eight Department of Agriculture (USDA) fruit and vegetable inspectors stationed at the Hunts Point Terminal Market in the Bronx, NY, were arrested and charged with accepting bribes for downgrading loads of produce so that receivers could negotiate lower prices with shippers. This week, I understand those inspectors were sentenced for their illegal  and fraudulent scam at the Hunts Point Terminal Market in the Bronx, New York. 
   While these guilty inspectors are being held accountable through our legal system for their actions, the economic damages to the produce industry remain unaddressed. Moreover, to my knowledge, those individuals with direct oversight responsibility within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have not acknowledged to the Congress how their oversight activities failed, why the Department discounted complaints by the industry over the past several years, the number of inspections that are connected with the guilty USDA produce inspectors or even an estimate of the damages incurred by produce growers and shippers. This is unacceptable and USDA must act expeditiously to restore confidence and integrity in the federal inspection system for the produce industry. 
   If injured parties are not justly compensated through the legal process, we must ensure that every appropriate action is taken by the Congress to ensure the losses that occurred as a result of this scam are returned to injured parties. Based on similar cases where fines paid by guilty parties have gone directly to the federal Treasury, it is very doubtful that growers or shippers injured will see any of the funding owed to them as a result of this unfortunate scam. I am certainly committed to working with the industry on this critical issue and urge both the Senate and House Agriculture Committees to take immediate action as soon as possible to move forward with a full investigation of this matter.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise to bid farewell to Taiwan Representative Stephen Chen. Representative Chen has been an effective envoy  for Taiwan in the United States. One of his more remarkable accomplishments has been his ability to promote and strengthen improved relationships between Taiwan and the United States. Over the last two years, he has secured important contacts for Taiwan. 
   Assisted by Mr. Leonard Chao, his chief aide in congressional relations, Representative Stephen Chen has kept us informed of developments within Taiwan, including trading relationships, advances in human rights, moves toward a complete and open democracy, and the peaceful transition of power from the Nationalist Party to the Democratic Progressive Party on May 20th. 
   Representative Stephen Chen and his wife, Rosa, have been cordial hosts at Twin Oaks. They have gracefully entertained their guests with stories and anecdotes from their many diplomatic postings throughout the world. A master of seven languages, Representative Chen's ability to interpret language nuances has invariably impressed his guests. He is also known for his unique calligraphic capacity of scripting English with a Chinese writing brush. Along with these skills, Representative Chen's foremost gift is his diplomatic courtesy--ever so subtly, he makes his guests want to understand more about his family, his country, and our world through his views. 
   After nearly fifty years of dedicated diplomatic service to Taiwan, Representative Stephen Chen and Mrs. Rosa Chen, will retire from public service and return to Taiwan. They can be duly proud of their many accomplishments. They will be missed by all who were acquainted with them here in Washington, and we send them off to Taiwan with our best wishes and appreciation.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation along with my colleague from Idaho, Senator CRAPO, that will eliminate government waste, conserve wildlife, and provide hunter safety opportunities. 
   We are all familiar with the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson funds which impose an excise tax on firearms, archery equipment, and fishing equipment to conserve wildlife and provide funds to states for hunter safety programs. These funds were created decades ago with the support of both the sportsmen who pay the tax and the states who administer the projects. 
   The federal government collects the tax, which amounts to around half-a-billion dollars a year, and is authorized to withhold a percentage of the funds for administration of the program. This is how it should be. However, thanks to the thorough oversight of the program by Mr. YOUNG of Alaska, Chairman of the House Committee on Resources, it was uncovered that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency charged with administering the program, abused the vagueness of the law in exactly what constituted an administrative expense. 
   Under current law, the Service is authorized to withhold approximately $32 million a year to administer the program and, quite frankly, the law leaves it up to the Service as to what is an appropriate administrative expense. Mr. YOUNG discovered that the Service was spending this money on expenses that were outside the spirit of the law. These tax dollars paid by hunters and fishermen were being used for everything from foreign travel to grants to anti-hunting groups to endangered species programs that work against the interests of hunters. In addition, they created unauthorized grant programs, some of which have merit and are authorized in our bill, but all of which were created outside of the law. 
   Mr. President, I am not going to rehash all of the hearings that were held in the House on this issue. What I will say is that it was an embarrassment to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and, not until all but two members of the House supported legislation to fix the problems did the Service begin cooperating with Congress and admitting there were actions at the Service which they are not proud of. 
   In response to the waste, fraud, and abuse uncovered by his Committee, Mr. YOUNG introduced legislation to fix the problems. His legislation caps the administrative expenses at around half of the currently authorized level, sets in stone what is an authorized administrative expense, provides some specific money for hunter safety, authorizes a multi-state grant program, and creates a position of Assistant Director for Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs. His bill, H.R. 3671, passed the House on April 5th with an overwhelming vote of 423-2. 
   Mr. President, Senator CRAPO and I have taken the lead of the House by using their bill as a model and simply strengthened it for the sportsmen who pay the excise tax. By providing more money, $15 million per year, for hunter safety programs and providing a total of $7 million per year, $2 million more than the House, for the Multi-State Conservation Grant Program, this bill ensures that the money that sportsmen pay for wildlife conservation and hunter safety is actually used for those purposes. 
   Mr. President, this is a win-win for everyone--for wildlife and for tax payers--and I urge my colleagues to support it and work for its quick enactment.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I was sitting in my office watching the floor on C-SPAN and I heard my colleague from Wyoming speak out about some of his concerns as they relate to conduct of priority business on the floor of the Senate. I am pleased he would come this early afternoon to discuss what I think is really a very important and necessary issue for all of us to understand but, more importantly, for the public that pays close attention to what we do to understand. 
   During debate last week, after the vote concerning the Byrd-Warner amendment on the President's open-ended mission in Kosovo, several things were said by the minority leader that I feel need to be corrected. If you were to take the minority leader at face value last week, I think you would have gotten a distorted view of what we did in the Senate and what was an appropriate and necessary approach. 
   The day before the vote on the Byrd-Warner amendment, the Senate passed a rule that said only germane amendments could be offered to appropriations bills. ``Germane'' is a technical term for relevant. The following day, the minority leader stated before us:  
   No majority leader has ever come to the floor to say that, before we take up a bill, we have to limit the entire Senate to relevant amendments.  
   Those are the minority leader's words, straight out of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. When I heard that, I was surprised, and I began to think about past Senates, past Congresses. I began to do some research. I must tell you I was surprised that the minority leader would, in fact, make that statement. The minority leader also said that he would defy anybody to come to 
   the floor and challenge the statement. I am here today, I did my research over the weekend, and I challenge the statement of the minority leader. I think it is time the American people understand exactly what he meant and why he meant it. 
   We have important and critical legislation that needs to be passed in a timely manner to deal with all that is important for the millions and millions of Americans whose lives are impacted by what we do here. 
   In the appropriations bills there is money for education, health services, agriculture, for the environment, for national defense, and for other essential Government services on which so many people rely. I want to take a few minutes to explain what the majority leader said last week and, more importantly, I want to spend more time saying why what the minority leader said last week was wrong. 
   The majority leader was clearly trying to expedite the activities of the Senate when he asked those of us on each side of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, to agree to unanimous consent requests that would cause the Senate to move along in a timely fashion. When the minority leader came to the floor and suggested that irrelevant amendments should be debated in full and this was an inappropriate thing and had never been done before, then what he was saying simply was not an accurate statement. 
   The rules of the Senate are very easy to understand and fairly straightforward. For instance, a cloture vote, as far as its dictionary definition, is a petition to limit debate. The petition must be signed by 16 Senators. It is then voted on by the entire Senate, and it takes 60 votes to invoke cloture; in other words, to move on. Cloture is a formal way of ending a filibuster, or ending intentional debate that prolongs the proceedings of the Senate. A filibuster, of course, is a time-delaying tactic, a strategy used to extend debate, as I just mentioned, and ultimately to prevent a vote from being taken by Senators. 
   By the way, the term ``filibuster'' comes from the early 19th century Spanish or Portuguese pirates' term ``filibusteros,'' meaning those who held ships hostage for ransom. Therefore, in order to stop a filibuster, a tactic used to hold the Senate hostage, a cloture motion must be filed. It is the formal beginning of the process to end a filibuster. 
   Let me go back to what the minority leader said last week. He said that ``No majority leader has ever come to the floor to say that''--meaning we ought to limit debate and move to the relevant issues of the day. He said that--``before we take up a bill, we will have to limit the entire Senate to relevant amendments.'' In other words, shaping the debate, moving it along in a timely fashion. 
   That statement caused me to take a short walk down memory lane. Let me take us all back to the 103d Congress. The Senate was controlled by Democrats, not Republicans, under the watchful eye of the majority leader, George Mitchell. During the same Congress, almost 300 legislative measures were enacted into law. Of those 300 measures, Senator Mitchell considered 15 of them to be the object of a filibuster. In other words, Senator Mitchell feared that there would be a filibuster on a particular piece of legislation. Senator Mitchell's response to this imaginary threat was to file 43 cloture motions on these 15 measures. 
   Let me repeat: Senator Mitchell filed 43 cloture motions on 15 legislative measures he thought might be filibustered. Of these 43 cloture motions, 21 of them--almost half--were filed on the same day the Senate actually began debating a bill. In his attempt to break a filibuster, he filed cloture on bills 21 times before debate had even begun. 
   If there was any intent to intentionally limit debate--and once you have a cloture motion in place, and once you have proceeded to the bill postcloture, then only relevant amendments should apply--then, of course, George Mitchell was doing exactly what he intended to do as majority leader, Democrat majority leader of the Senate: Limit debate, shape debate to the particular bill involved. 
   Did Senator Mitchell say before a bill was even offered that the Senate would be limited to relevant amendments? He did not have to say it. His actions said it, and they were very clear, loud actions. He did 21 filings of cloture the same day the Senate actually debated a bill. He took a procedural step that would make the threat a reality. In other words, he did not come to the floor to suggest he might have to do something to limit debate to relevant amendments; he just did it. And that is the prerogative of a majority leader. 
   Clearly, Senator Mitchell went much further than the rule we passed last week. As the minority leader well knows, Senator Mitchell perfected the art of confrontational legislating. Not only would Senator Mitchell not allow nonrelevant amendments, he filed cloture on bills 43 times in the 103d Congress. 
   That is the record. That is setting the record straight. I say to Minority Leader DASCHLE, I took up your challenge. I did my research. I believe those are the facts. But Senator Mitchell's tactics of the past pale in comparison to the strategy of the minority leader in the Senate today. Again last week, the minority leader said on the floor in reference to an appropriations bill that:  
   Constitutionally, appropriations bills must begin in the House of Representatives. We are, in a sense, circumventing the rules of the Congress by allowing these bills to be debated and considered prior to the time the bill comes before the Senate.  
   I did some simple research, such as picking up a copy of the U.S. Constitution and turning to article I, section 7, clause 1, and reading it, just reading it:  
   All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.  
   Let me also turn to another provision, ``Riddick's Senate Procedure, Precedents and Practices.'' This is, of course, one of the procedural booklets we follow:  
   Bills originate in the House: 
   In 1935, the Chair ruled that there is no Constitutional limitation upon the Senate to initiate an appropriation bill.  
   Obviously, the intent of what I am suggesting is that we can initiate appropriations bills, and we have, and we have held them at the desk. As the House sends its appropriations bills across, we attach a House number or we move through that process in a way that accommodates. 
   Why would the minority leader propose such an idea? I think it is really quite clear. It is to obstruct the action and the movement of the Senate. 
   Maybe there is another reason. Maybe there is a reason that is subliminal, that is not so clear. Maybe the reason was talked about this morning in the Washington Times: ``CBO now predicts a $40 billion surplus''--even a greater surplus of monies than the kind that was predicted earlier that the Budget Committee analyzed when it proposed its budget resolution. 
   Maybe it is why he wants to drag the feet of the Senate through June, July, August, and into September, so at the very end, a lame duck President, with his veto, can hold a Senate hostage and gain the spending of billions more dollars than were proposed in this present budget when he proposed total discretionary appropriations of about $223 billion where our budget discretionary spending is around $600 billion. Maybe he 
   really wants to make good on not giving American citizens some tax relief by returning some of these surplus dollars to them. Maybe he really wants to make good on the idea that expanding Government and spending more money is really the mantra, the very foundation and the basics of the Democratic Party that he represents. 
   I am not sure, but what I am sure of is that what the minority leader said on the floor of the Senate last week does not ring true to past Senate actions practiced by Democrat and Republican majorities. 
   We operate on the rules of the Senate. We operate on past precedent. We also operate on a consistency that assures a motion of activity here that produces 13 appropriations bills in a timely fashion to fund our Government in a way that I think our American citizens and taxpayers expect us to perform. 
   What the minority leader said last week was we would not perform; he was going to draw a line and stop us, and he drew that line in the sand. He said, for example: We do not need to deal with the same bill twice; let's wait until the House gets its bill here. Yet he was saying that in the backdrop of a gun debate that had been dealt with numerous times on the floor of the Senate over the last year; in fact, a debate in which his side had won and passed legislation that moved to the House, and the House rejected it. 
   I am not quite sure I understand even that argument because it not only is inconsistent with the very actions that were taking place at the time, and that was, we were redebating for the fourth or fifth time an idea or a piece of legislation in which the Senate itself had been involved throughout the 106th Congress. 
   The reason I have come to the floor this early afternoon is to set the record straight. I think it is important for the Senate and for the United States as a whole to understand how we operate and that what we were doing and what we were proposing were clearly consistent within the rules. No rules had been bent. There was not a rules committee of a single individual but the action of a Congress and a Senate operating under unanimous consent and doing so in an appropriate and responsible way. 
   If there was a bad precedent set last week, it was not bad in the sense that it was one majority leader simply following the actions of another majority leader some sessions ago, recognizing the timely need to move legislation along and to be able to do so by limiting certain types of amendments that were irrelevant to the fundamental debate and the consideration of a given appropriations bill. 
   I hope this clears the air. I hope what we experienced last week was but a thunderstorm, and now the clouds have cleared and the air is a bit fresher. I hope we can move on in a timely fashion, as we must, because if that does not happen, I and others will be coming to the floor on a very regular basis and I will not mind pointing a finger at those who object and those who obstruct. 
   We have a responsibility to cause our Senate to operate in an appropriate fashion, and certainly debate on one and all issues is important and can happen, but I do believe the citizens of this country expect us to get our work done; they expect us to balance our budget; they expect us to be fiscally responsible; and, most importantly, they expect and anticipate a limited Government that does the right things for its citizenry. That is what we are intent upon accomplishing. I hope we can move forward, and I hope we can do so in a timely fashion. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President I have sat quietly by through the hours of last evening and listened to my colleagues debate a sense-of-the-Senate resolution with great passion, and I respect them for their passion. I think all of us enter issues wanting to believe in them and trust they are the right thing to do. We saw an awful lot of moms on The Mall this weekend marching because they thought it was the right thing to do. They marched against violence, I trust. 
   Some of them have had violence ravaged against them and their families, and they were here to speak out about that. Interestingly enough, underlying the march was a premise of gun registration and gun control. I think most Americans recognize while that is an important issue with violence, that does not solve the violence that takes away so many of our young people. That is why we are on the floor today. 
   It is strange we find ourselves with such passion about something that will not count. A sense-of-the-Senate resolution is like walking outside and saying: It's pretty nice today, and tomorrow it will probably be better. But, of course, the Presiding Officer knows tomorrow it may not be better; it may be worse, weatherwise. 
   In other words, just saying it does not make it so. 
   A sense-of-the-Senate resolution is in itself a political point, a political expression. It is not substantive law. It is not intended to be. It is intended to make a political point. 
   So what is the fuss about? The fuss is that we have already dealt with this issue, and the House rejected it. Somehow my colleagues on the other side of the aisle cannot accept the idea that the Congress of the United States has rejected something about which they feel so passionate. 
   So they have stopped the process in the Senate. They have chosen a tactic that most of us would choose not to use to stop the process in a nonsubstantive  way. I do not dispute their passion, but I do question their motives. 
   Here we are dealing with a piece of legislation that has to pass this year to make our Government run. I serve on the subcommittee of appropriations that deals with military construction. The Senator from Washington serves on that committee. She was there at that committee making sure her bases in Washington and my base in Idaho got treated fairly. But we are stalled out right now. We have lost 8 hours of critical time in a very short legislative year, not out of substantive debate but a political point. 
   I know that may spell some degree of importance, but passing the Daschle resolution today does not the world change. Passing the Lautenberg amendment last year might have changed the world if the House had not said no to the Senate's approach. So here we are today in politics and not in legislation. 
   Of course, the other side wants to be reflective of what those women said on The Mall. So do I. I cannot tell you I feel their pain because I have not lost a loved one to violence. But I think I can understand just a little bit of it. You see, there were other moms marching there, too, but they did not get much attention. They, too, had lost loved ones to violence. But they also recognized that they have a right in this country; and the right is to self-defense to protect themselves and their families when law enforcement cannot make it there in time. Moms want to do that. They will put themselves in harm's way to protect their children. 
   Tragically enough, the other moms are saying: Let the Government do it. The Government can fix this problem. And the Government can fix this problem if it will only pass a law. 
   Oh, my goodness. What a hoax. What a false premise, to tell those moms, who came from all over the country, with dedicated concerns, that we will just pass a law and the world will be a better place. It has not happened. 
   This Congress, year after year, struggles with violence in our country; and we reshape the structure of our laws to deal with it. Yet we have not found an answer to it. We have not found an answer to it because our culture has changed dramatically over the years. 
   The family unit is different than it used to be. Children are reared differently than they used to be. The violence in our juvenile culture today is alarming. We all appreciate it. We are all frustrated by it and angered by it. Yet you were led to believe that all kids die because of a gun. It ``ain't'' so. It just ``ain't'' so. 
   In 1997, 1,700 kids died because of motor vehicles. They were killed in a car crash, a violent car crash. Sixteen hundred were killed in traffic accidents. That is violence, 
   perpetrated on somebody 10 years of age or younger. 
   Mr. President, 750 died by drowning. We know we cannot outlaw drowning. Now, we can teach kids to swim, and we can teach water safety, and we can lessen the risk, but, God knows, we cannot legislate here to stop drowning because if we could, we would. But we know we cannot. 
   Mr. President, 575 died of suffocation--rolled over on their pillow, rolled over on a plastic mattress, got a sack over their head--some very dramatic--and, in the end, a violent act. 
   Residential fires, 570; struck by or on something, 89; falls, 87; cycling, 78; poisoning, 58. 
   Now, this is 1997. But yet on The Mall on Saturday, it was: 5,000 kids die because of guns. They were not telling the truth. That is the problem. Because the bulk of those kids were 15 to 19 years of age, and they were caught in the crossfire of a drug war on the streets of America. 
   That is violence and that is tragic and that is horrible. And we are going to try to fight a war on drugs. But in 1997, only 48 kids age 10 years or younger were killed by the misuse of a firearm. And the number is less today. 
   Those are the facts. Those are the facts that come from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. And doggone it, we ought to set the record straight, and we ought to be honest with those moms. That is what we ought to be. Yet today we are not. 
   Today, the rhetoric is not about the violence in America against America's young people; it is about a false premise of passing a law and the world will be better and the Sun will come up tomorrow. I do not think we can do that. I would like to be able to do it. I am not at all convinced we can. 
   Firearms, misused, killing young people, 10 years of age or younger, is 10th or 11th on the list of how young kids die 10 years of age or younger. Those are the facts. It is important we talk about them. 
   So we are stalled out on a critically important piece of legislation that ought to move. I hope it will move. 
   We dealt with guns last year, and the Congress rejected what we did. I did not support it. I voted against it. I thought it had gone too far. Pass a law; fix it; it is all over with; we have made the world a safer place. 
   And 20,000 gun laws that we currently have, with few of them being enforced--and most of them not, in many instances--and we pass another law and turn to the American people with a straight face, and say: The world will now be safe? I think not. And guess what. The American people understand it. 
   On Saturday of this past week, a candidate for President stood up and said: I am going to buy a lot of safety locks, and I am going to make them available to people who want to use them. Somebody said: That is a silly idea. I say that is a great idea. Why aren't we doing this with Government here? Why don't we voluntarily get involved in making the world safer and educating people and training them? 
   The Senator from Nebraska said: Kids who are trained in the use of firearms do not hurt themselves. And they know better because they know a firearm is a dangerous object misused. Kids who are not trained, kids who are not educated, are the kids who hurt themselves. Yet this Government is not involved in an educational program. 
   So when a candidate for President steps up and says, ``Let's make the world safer, on a voluntary basis,'' somebody says, ``Make it mandatory.'' We are going to set up a cop system to go into every house to check to see if every gun has a trigger lock on it? I do not think we are going to do that. Yet that is kind of what the other side is suggesting: Make it mandatory, and enforce it. 
   How do you enforce a law such as that? The practicality is, you don't. You don't enter every home in America to prove it; that is, unless you have licensed the gun and you know the gun is there. Then do you do random checks on private property? I don't think we get there, either. I think our Constitution, somewhere else in its text, would deny the Government of this country the right to enter that private property, for whatever reason, unless there was just cause and a court order. Those are some of the real issues. 
   I am frustrated--I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are, too--that we cannot reach out and solve these critical problems, that somehow the passion that we feel about the violence that is wrought against the young people in this country cannot be fixed by this august and powerful body called the Senate. 
   We know we can't fix it, so let's try to politic it. Boy, have we tried. 
   The other side couldn't gain traction because the American people said: Something is wrong besides just laws. Something is wrong in the culture of our country. Something is wrong with all of the violence our children see, and it transfers into their minds. Somehow they begin to understand that they can act violently, and there is no consequence for that action or there is less consequence. Yes, they watch a lot of violent activities on television and, yes, they play a lot of violent games and, yes, it has an impact. Well, let's fix Hollywood. 
   Do you think this side of the aisle would do that? I doubt that. We are not going to fix them because that is first amendment rights. Nobody over here is saying we have to restrict first amendment rights. It is only the second amendment we fix. 
   That is why we are here today, stalled out, for the political point the opposition is trying to make on this issue. It is raw politics. It is not substance, and they know it, because it is a sense of the Senate. Last year, when we debated the Lautenberg amendment, that was substance. That could have become law if the Congress of the United States had agreed. But they didn't.  
   We are here today stalled out for the politics of the issue, not the substance of the issue. We want to say to the Million Mom March and the hundreds of thousands who were gathered on The Mall, we care, we hear you. That is what we keep hearing from some of our Senators. Well, we all heard them, and you are darned right, we care. 
   The issue is violence in America--all violence, not just guns. That is a minority part of the violence. It is sometimes the most visible and the most publicized, but this is the beginning of spring and into summer. This is the swimming season. Nobody today is standing on the floor suggesting hundreds of kids will drown this year from improper training and improper supervision of their parents and we ought to pass a law to save all those kids. No, we are not doing that. Why? Because we can't. That is why. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Before I yield to my colleague from Wyoming, it hardly seems important, but it is. I joined with the Senator from New Jersey to right the spousal abuse provision, and I voted for it. He didn't say that on the floor; he should have. We had some disagreements. We worked out those differences so that those who are adjudicated spousal abusers can't buy a gun. But those who were only accused but not proven can still hold their rights. Those are the facts. The Senator from New Jersey knows it; he failed to say it. 
   I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, somehow today, if you do not believe what I believe, you are not caring nor are you compassionate. Let me suggest to anyone listening, and certainly to all Senators, no one on this side of the aisle--and I know no one on that side of the aisle--is saying that. We listen, too. Many even participated in the Million Mom March in this Nation's Capital last Saturday. I cannot tell you we felt their pain, but we heard it spoken because unless you have experienced the kind of loss that some of those mothers experienced, I doubt that you can feel it. But you can empathize with it, and all of us do. 
   Is that why we are bound up on the floor with this issue today? No, it is not. We have been on this floor before, for the last year, on the issue of guns, long before the Million Mom March. The reason we have been on the floor is because what some have wanted to do, the rest of the Congress has not wanted to do--largely because the American people are tremendously frustrated at this moment about violence and about laws and laws not enforced and laws that are enforced and the lack of safety or the sense of security and the obvious real violence that goes on in America today. 
   No, those moms, at least many of them, were sincere. Others, I am quite confident, had a political agenda. There were second amendment moms who were there. They had a political agenda. They are also sincere because they really do believe that passing gun laws does not a safer world make. It does not take the criminal who perpetrates the vast majority of the crimes off the street--who, by the way, very seldom walks into a gun shop and buys a gun but of course acquires his or her gun off the street in an illegal fashion. 
   ``We want commonsense gun laws,'' is what we have heard. Yet the underlying mantra of the Million Mom March is not commonsense gun laws; it is registration and licensing. Even some of the most liberal, who believe in gun control, openly admit you cannot get there. You cannot pass licensing and registration because the Congress will not pass it and the public would not accept it, largely because it just would not work. 
   Cars are licensed? Yes, cars are licensed, but you don't have to have a license to own a car. You don't have to have a license to drive a car if you drive it on your private property. A car is not a right in this country, guaranteed by the Constitution. You have to have a license to drive a car if you drive on public roads. Licenses for cars did not start for safety arguments; they started as a way to tax an owner of a vehicle to gain revenue for vehicular purposes in States. 
   So there is that quick jump to logic: You have to have a license to own a car. Wrong. You do not need a license to own a car. It is not a right; it is a privilege. There is a very real difference. 
   It is important that a few of us cut through the fog of the emotion and the rhetoric here. I do believe there are constitutional rights in this country. I think we ought to be terribly careful about how we infringe upon them. That is part of the debate we are involved in today, and that is the most important part as far as I am concerned. 
   One of the other issues I think is most important is the question of ownership--250 million guns in this country and 
   somehow we ought to take them all down or take a lot of them down, or register or license to deal with them. 
   I do not find this humorous, but I find it practical. Holland is a nation in Europe--we all know about it: dikes and tulips, a beautiful country, wonderful people. Guns are outlawed in Holland. It is against the law to own a gun, except under unique circumstances. Guns are outlawed in Holland. Now the Dutch authorities are trying to come to grips with a rash of stabbings in Amsterdam. Last year they began a ``turn in your knife'' campaign, to try to stop the violence in Amsterdam, ravaged upon fellow citizens of Holland by knives. In other words, violence is the issue, not guns, not knives. Now they are thinking in Holland about a ``buy up the knife'' campaign, something like we have done in this country, or even suggesting they prohibit knives in Holland. Politicians ought to pass a law, some are suggesting. 
   Is it a reflection of the weapon or is it a reflection of a human problem that is called violence? I think it is the violence issue we are here about today. I know the Senator from California wants to deal with that issue. So do I. But I do not think we all understand how to deal with violence. I believe most of the moms who marched on  Sunday were expressing their frustration about the violence that their children experience. 
   I yield to the Senator from Idaho such time as he may consume.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, when the Senator from Michigan speaks I always listen because we work very closely together on issues that deal with kids. Most of the time, we agree. All of the time that we work together, we are very sincere. 
   I do not question the sincerity of the Senator from Michigan in the statement he made. I am not surprised he was on the Mall last Sunday. He is somebody who feels very deeply about the issues in which he becomes involved. 
   We have worked very closely on issues dealing with young people, such as in making sure that we could streamline adoptions so young people without loving families could find those families and become a member of those families. So I listen very closely when that Senator speaks. 
   I also listened to those at the Million Mom March over the weekend. I went to their web site. I looked at their issues. I studied their premise. I do not question their sincerity, but some of their issues do not fit common sense and will not work in America. 
   Here is their No. 1 issue shown on this chart, No. 1 on their web page: ``License Handgun Owners and Register All Handguns.'' It also happens to be the No. 1 gun issue in a certain Presidential candidate's portfolio this year. Coincidence? Maybe not. 
   But the reality of licensing gun owners and registering firearms is something that almost all Americans have viewed as an anathema for a long while. Why? Because they really do believe that a gun, once acquired as private property, is no business of the Government that they should know about. 
   I supported background checks. In fact, I am probably one of the few Senators who insisted that the ATF come to the Hill years ago and work on the aggressive implementation of instant background checks. I wanted that to happen. It is now happening today. I brought appropriations bills to the floor to fund ATF to make it happen. There was great resistance downtown. They just did not want to make it work. I am not sure why. 
   We can instant anything today in our computers. We can instant our credit. We can instant any idea we want, in rapid response, through the tremendous telecommunications ability of our country. But somehow we just could not get this online. And the reason we could not, there was a bias. The bias was waiting periods, resistance to the acquisition of firearms. 
   Today we have an instant check. By the way, as we know, last weekend it malfunctioned; it went down. Gun shops, that are law-abiding gun shops, that are federally licensed gun shops, had to quit dealing for a time, quit selling, because they could not do instant background checks. 
   We are not opposed to background checks. We are not opposed to background checks at gun shows. Sorry to dispel the myth. What we are opposed to is unnecessary regulation, recordkeeping, the kind of thing that would create an ability of the Government to follow back and check on what most of our private citizens and 65 million law-abiding gun owners feel is a constitutional right and none of their Government's business. 
   The folks in Australia, Bermuda, Cuba, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Jamaica, and Soviet Georgia were worried about gun licensing and registration, 
   because they were fearful it would result in gun confiscation. They were right. It did. Citizens in those countries today don't own firearms. They were confiscated by their government once their government could find where they were. Is it wrong for American citizens to be concerned? I think not. 
   There are, certainly, issues that those moms were marching on about which all of us are concerned: safety locks on handguns, yes, that manufacturers are producing. Should the Federal Government require them? I don't believe it should, but I would certainly have them on my handguns if I owned handguns. 
   If I were a single person living in a dangerous neighborhood and I bought that handgun for self-protection, I might not want a safety lock on that gun in the dark of night when my door is being crashed in by an intruder. I wouldn't want to fumble in the darkness to take the safety lock off. I would want the instant protection that the gun I acquired offered me in my right of self-protection. But because I didn't have the lock on, by what some are arguing on the other side, I would be in violation of a Federal law. Instinctively, none of us want that. None of us want to voluntarily feel we force ourselves to be in violation of a law in defense of our person and in defense of our property. 
   Those are some of the kinds of practical nuances that argue not against common sense but against some of what is being tried here today. 
   So if it doesn't work, politicize it. If you can't get your way around here, politicize it. Some got their way in the Senate a year ago. They passed the Lautenberg provisions in the juvenile justice bill. I didn't support them. I thought they had gone too far. I think the gun community of America thought they had gone too far, the law-abiding gun community of America. Criminals didn't care. They recognized what some of my colleagues in the Senate don't recognize, that by definition, they don't play by the rules so they don't care what we do. They break laws. That is why they are called criminals. But somehow we write these laws and everybody will march in step with what their Government demands. Law-abiding citizens will do so. 
   Anyway, we passed the Lautenberg law. The House rejected it. Somehow our colleagues on the other side can't accept that fact and won't accept it. So here we are today, holding up a very important piece of appropriations legislation, all for the sake of making a nonbinding political point. Well, it is a political body. They certainly have that right. But it is nongermane, and it doesn't fit. We ought to do something that does fit. 
   Most importantly, we ought not perpetrate a hoax on the millions of mothers who expressed their frustration  over violent acts in this society last Sunday. I think most were sincere. I think some were very high-level organizers of certain political interests. I think their web page demonstrates that. 
   That is really not the issue. The issue is, can we pass laws that work and can we pass laws that are enforceable and that the American public will accept? That is the crux of this debate. That is the point of the politics. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

I think it is important for us to let Americans know there is a group of their national leaders who are focused on developing a national energy policy for this country. You have heard the majority leader of the Senate speak for just a few moments. He touched on some very critical questions that I think Americans are asking when they go to the gas pump and they find, as they have found for the last good many months, that their energy costs are going up dramatically. But high oil prices are doing more than raise the price of gasoline. With spikes in electrical production during this last heat spell on the east coast, we are going to find that when the power bill gets to that consumer, his or her power bill has gone up substantially. 
   As a result of sustained high oil prices, several weeks ago the majority leader convened a task force in the Senate, led by Senator FRANK MURKOWSKI, who is chairman of the full Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I, as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, served with that task force and today our work product has been introduced. But this is a work product that resulted not by just a group of us coming together to decide what was a better idea, it is a product of a good many hearings held by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to explore the effects of the cost of energy now and in the future on the American consumer. 
   As a result of that, S. 2557 has been introduced today. That is better known as the National Energy Security Act for 2000. The legislation is designed to do a number of things, but its overall objective is to reduce our dependence on imported crude oil below 50 percent. Crude oil and gas prices shot up earlier this year. At the time we were importing about 55 percent of our crude oil needs. Now, according to the latest Energy Information Administration figures, U.S. dependency on foreign crude oil as of May 5, is just over 60 percent. We are getting about 9.2 million-barrels-a-day from somewhere else in the world. The U.S. is now importing about a million barrels a day more than we were importing in January of 1999. 
   In addition, the U.S. is importing more finished petroleum products. That is a rather new phenomenon. We have seen the tearing down of many of our refineries during the last good number of years for failure to retrofit to meet Clean Air Act requirements because there was no cost incentive to do so. In fact, there has not been a major refinery permitted in the U.S. since 1975. Now we are importing more finished product. 
   In January of 1999, our daily import level of motor gasoline, for example, was about 441,000 barrels per day. During the week ending May 5, according to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. imported an average of 562,000 barrels a day of motor gasoline. 
   In other words, if the average consumer were looking at a chart graphed along with these increases we have just talked about, the price of gasoline would be going up and so is our reliance on imports. We are no longer the masters of our own destiny. We no longer control the future of energy in this country. That is a sad day for Americans, when that reality is in front of us. It is something I think this country has to deal with. 
   The Energy Information Administration estimates our dependency on imports could rise to more than 65 percent by the year 2020. At the rate we are going, my guess is we will be there long before that. 
   For the last nearly 8 years, the Clinton-Gore administration has refused to develop an effective national energy policy. The administration has published national energy plans and, I will be blunt, I do not think they are worth the paper on which they are printed. Here is exactly why. Their plans pay only lip service to 
   the need to increase domestic oil and gas production. They have consistently underfunded research into more efficient and clean use of coal for electric generation. Yet the U.S. has an abundance of coal that we ought to be using in an effective and environmentally sound way. They have underfunded research into how we can improve the efficiency and safety of our nuclear generating stations. And they have refused to recognize hydropower as a renewable resource. 
   The Presiding Officer and I come from an area of the country where hydropower is king. Many of our rivers are dammed to produce an abundance  of electrical energy, and our electrical energy costs to consumers are the lowest in the Nation, while our environment is generally very clean. Yet as the chairman of the Energy Committee said just a few moments ago, this administration has, as a policy, not recognized hydroelectricity as a renewable resource. Quite the opposite: It proposes that we ought to start removing dams from our rivers for environmental reasons and without regard for existing economic uses. 
   Instead of strong producing policies for our country and incentives for producers to produce more energy, the Clinton-Gore administration has focused its attention on solar energy and wind power and energy from biomass, and demanded significant increases in Federal money to encourage more use of these resources. There is nothing wrong with supporting renewables. I support renewables. I think most in the U.S. Congress do. We have been subsidizing solar and wind now for more than 25 years, but they meet only about 3 percent of our total energy demand. I think renewables, including hydropower, must play a role in meeting the needs of the U.S., but the real solution lies in boosting oil and natural gas production and finding cleaner, more efficient ways to use coal. That is where our research dollar ought to be going because that is the only way we will be able to meet the demands of the marketplace. 
   The bill Senator LOTT has just introduced is the product of several months of discussion and analysis that I have already outlined. The committee was chaired by Senator FRANK MURKOWSKI. Let me take just a few more minutes and explain a the major steps the bill takes to improve our energy future. 
   The bill would require the Secretary to report annually on progress toward limiting our dependence on foreign oil down to no greater than 50-percent. The Secretary must lay out legislative and administrative steps to meet that goal and recommend alternatives for reducing crude oil imports. To increase our use of natural gas, the bill creates an interagency working group to design a policy and strategy for greater use of natural gas. 
   The bill extends authority to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and prevents drawdown of the reserve until the President and the Secretary of Defense agree that a drawdown will not threaten our national security. 
   Our bill contains a title to protect consumers and low-income families, and to encourage energy efficiency. It expands eligibility for residential weatherization programs, creates a program to educate consumers to help them avoid seasonal price fluctuations, and also establishes a heating oil reserve to help the Northeast deal with shortages and severe price fluctuations. 
   Our bill also contains a title addressing increased use of other domestic energy sources like coal and more efficient use of our nuclear and hydro resources. It also requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to report on how costs for relicensing hydroelectric facilities can be lowered. 
   The bill also authorizes a Federal oil and gas leasing program for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, one of the remaining great potential sources of crude oil in this country, with estimated yields of well over 16 billion barrels, the kind of production that could come in at about 1.5 million barrels a day and do that for nearly 20 years or more. Despite that potential the Clinton-Gore administration opposes going there to explore for oil. 
   The amount of additional domestic production would, if added to today's domestic production, reduce our 60-percent dependency below the 50-percent mark that our legislation seeks. I think 50 percent is a responsible goal, not only one demanded by the public but demanded by the Congress and that should be supported by this administration and future administrations. 
   The bill also contains provisions to streamline and reduce the costs associated with gas and oil leasing on Federal lands to enhance domestic production and to encourage small oil producers to keep low-volume wells operating during harsh economic times. 
   Finally, we have included in the legislation tax credits for wind and biomass energy and electrical production from steel-making facilities and tax incentives for residential solar use. In other words, we want to encourage all kinds of energy. We do not want to pick and choose and decide that some do not fit our policy or our lifestyle. What this public wants is a market basket full of reasonable energy sources at reasonable costs. It is to our benefit, it is to our economy's benefit, and it is to the world's benefit that we drive these technologies as well as conventional forms of energy production. 
   What is the policy of the Clinton-Gore Administration? My colleagues have seen it in action. We saw our Secretary of Energy walking around the Middle East with a tin cup: Oh, sheik, oh, sheik, if you are from the Middle East or if you are from Venezuela or if you are from Mexico, please, turn on your valves and give us a little oil. Please, please, it may hurt our lifestyle. 
   How sad it is that our great country has been reduced to that kind of policy. The legislation Senators LOTT and MURKOWSKI have introduced today can help us regain control of our energy destiny from the Middle East and OPEC. 
   The news today reported there is a huge new discovery of oil in the Caspian Sea which is years away from production, and if it comes online, it will be in a politically unstable place in the world over which we have little or no control. 
   Does the average consumer going to the gas pump every day want to have to turn to the East and ask a sheik to turn on a valve so that he or she can get to work at a reasonable cost? I doubt that, and that is what this legislation is about. That is why Senator MURKOWSKI, Senator LOTT, I, and others have joined together to offer up this legislation as a national energy policy for this country, not only to direct this Congress, but to direct this administration and future administrations to an achievable goal of reducing foreign crude oil imports below the 50-percent level and recognizing the great creativity in this country to produce energy in abundance, at low cost, and through a variety of resources. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wanted to respond to the senior Senator from New Mexico and his colleagues who have just spoken. All of us have watched with great concern as this fire has caused such devastation in the mountains of New Mexico and around Los Alamos. 
   I chair the Subcommittee on Forestry and Public Lands. For the last decade we have known as a country that our forests are rapidly growing unhealthy, largely because we have not managed them as skillfully as we should. In areas that are natural and left to be natural, we understand not touching them. But where we have forests in what we call urban interface today, where houses are built amongst the trees, there ought to be an aggressive effort to keep fuel loading down and to disperse trees in such a way as to disallow these kinds of crises from developing. It is happening now in New Mexico because of a major error on the part of a Federal agency. 
   We literally have millions and millions of acres of forested public lands around this country in an unsatisfactory condition, as in the mountains of the great State of New Mexico, and one spark, one lightning strike, or one human match could cost millions of dollars, lose thousands of homes, and the land that it touches, it destroys for a generation. 
   Oftentimes much greater environmental damage is done trying to put out these fires than an organized manner of managing the land, to control fuel loading, and those types of things that are now evident in New Mexico. 
   We will work with the Senators from New Mexico. Those hearings will be timely. There should be a report out by this Thursday that will give us some indication of cause. 
   The Senator from New Mexico is absolutely right: There should be extensive hearings on how and why it happened. Are there other areas where this could happen across these United States? 
   I thank the Senator for his comments.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to address once again the education of our children. This week we have been debating S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act. More importantly, we have been debating a difference in philosophy between Democrats and Republicans. 
   The Democrats have stood before us and proclaimed that Republicans want to weaken the Federal stranglehold on our education system. 
   The Democrats have stood before us and accused us of wanting to turn power from the beltway to parents and teachers. 
   Well, Mr. President, I plead guilty. 
   In fact, let us examine exactly what Republicans want to do. 
   We want to reduce overhead costs to put more money into the classroom, make States and local districts more accountable, and provide greater flexibility for teachers and parents to make the decisions which affect their children. 
   Anyone who has itemized taxes, applied for an FAH loan, been in the military, or just dealt with the Federal Government knows how stifling the paperwork can be. People all across this country make a fine living helping people deal with Federal bureaucracy. 
   So, it is easy to imagine how a school district can devote half of its administrative staff to administer the 7 percent of its budget that comes from the Federal Government. 
   Just imagine how much paperwork you have to do to send money to the Federal Government. 
   Now imagine how much that would increase if they were giving you money--and then imagine if you were receiving millions of dollars a year. 
   It is easy to see how money and staff can be siphoned off to administer Federal funds--money and staff that could go to teaching our children. 
   Our bill reduces Federal paperwork in order to put more money into the classroom. 
   Every student knows that grades--a measure of your accomplishment--are important. Every day parents and teachers hold them accountable for their grades. 
   These same students may find it surprising that school districts and States are not held accountable for their achievements with the billions of Federal tax dollars they receive. 
   Our bill says enough is enough. It is time to hold States accountable for student achievement. 
   Our bill offers an opportunity for 15 willing States to consolidate up to 12 Federal grant programs and free themselves from Federal redtape. However, the States must use that flexibility to boost student achievement--which they will be held accountable for. A noble concept. 
   The pillar of our public school system is to allow everyone free and open access to a high quality education. And, generally, it works. 
   Unfortunately, there are schools out there that are denying our students the basic education they need. And, students who can't afford private education, are stuck in the schools where they live. 
   That should not be the case. Our bill says that if a school that generally reaches disadvantaged students is designated as failing for 2 years, the district would be required to offer any child enrolled in the failing school the option to transfer to a higher performing public school. 
   If a school continues to fail for another 2 years, the district would also have to cover the students' transportation costs. 
   If all public schools within a district were identified as failing, then the district would be directed to form a cooperative agreement with another district to allow students to transfer. 
   And, finally, students attending these schools who either have been a victim of a violent crime on school grounds or whose school has been designated unsafe may also transfer to another public school. 
   This puts many decisions about a students education in the hands of their parents, forces schools to be accountable for their achievement, and allows all students access to a quality education. 
   Mr. President, as I close today I want to ask every parent out there one question. Do you know better than a Federal bureaucrat in Washington what is best for your child? If the answer is yes, you should support our bill. 
   I also want to ask every school administrator and teacher out there one question. Do you know better than a Federal bureaucrat in Washington what is best for your students? If the answer is yes, you should support our bill. 
   After all, it is all about increased accountability, greater local and parental control, and more money in the classroom.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thought it was important for my colleague, the senior Senator from the State of Washington, to make those statements because, as we are here today on the floor talking about nuclear waste, I must tell my colleague from the State of Nevada it is an important issue. I am sorry he and his colleagues haven't gained traction on the issue of guns, but America is wise to that. Try as you may, second amendment rights prevail in our country. 
   What we are here to talk about today is the absence of this administration's energy policy. Now, brownouts and blackouts and escalating fuel prices seem to take second or third place on the list of priorities about which the Senator from Nevada would like to talk. I think the American consumer and that elderly person whose air-conditioning may go out this summer at the peak of a heat spell would say this issue is a mighty important issue for this Senate to be considering. 
   So as it relates to priorities, while I am going to say that some of what the Senator from Nevada suggested is important for the Senate to address, but this issue is among them in priority. But, of course, my colleagues on the other side have been running for cover for months because they know that Bill Clinton has no energy strategy, never has had one, and doesn't propose one. He simply runs around Nevada sticking his head in the sand and talking about the politics of the issue instead of the substance of the issue. 
   Well, the veto we are here to attempt to override today is the fundamental difference between politics and substance. You heard the Senator from Alaska, Mr. MURKOWSKI, in great detail talking about the practicality of needing a national nuclear waste policy implemented in this country to be able to sustain our nuclear energy as we now have it, but, most importantly, to move forward into the future. 
   For a few moments today, let me talk about where we get our electricity. Somehow, it just comes when you throw on a switch. The bulbs light up, the heater turns on, the air-conditioner turns on, and we don't stop to think about the long-term strategy and policy that this country has been engaged in for decades to assure that the light does come on, that the air-conditioner does turn on, and that we have abundant energy. 
   Sixty percent of our electricity comes from coal. Given the concern of the other side about climate change, we aren't building new coal plants, we are not pushing forward on the technology of clean coal--the kind of technology that we ought to be pushing and giving priority to. The Clinton-Gore administration wants to make this situation dramatically worse by tying our hands and tying U.S. power companies to a Kyoto treaty, while allowing our economic competitors in developing nations to pollute at will. 
   Shame on you, Bill Clinton and AL GORE, for that kind of silly environmental policy. Climate change is a serious issue, but it isn't addressed in a helpful manner when you walk away from the negotiating table with an agreement that lets China and India and other major developing nations pollute at will, penalizing our economy, and doing so by trying to develop an anti-fossil-fuel bias in this country, along with the anti-nuclear-energy bias on which the President based his veto. 
   We get 20 percent of our electricity from nuclear power. That is why we are having this debate today. We have to sustain at least 20 percent of our energy base coming from nuclear if we are ever going to have clean air and gain the standards in the nonattainment areas that we want to set. Any right-thinking scientist and right-thinking politician today knows that fact. They can't argue otherwise. We won't get to the clean air levels this country wants without at least a 20-percent blend in our energy base coming from nuclear. 
   We have about 10 percent of our electricity coming from 
   hydropower, and the Presiding Officer and I know how silly this has become in the Pacific Northwest. We have a President, a Vice President, and a Secretary of the Interior who want to take dams down--all in the name of what? Environmental radicals who want to roll back to a history of a century ago and try to reestablish ourselves without the kind of very clean power that our hydro base provides for us. It is not a large base; it is 10 percent of our base, though. Again, it is part of that 10 percent, 60 percent, 20 percent that has built the stability of an integrated power system for our country over the years that has brought us the best electrical service of any nation in the history of the world. 
   What we are talking about today is sustaining that capability. We are not talking about tearing dams down. We are talking about finding a safe repository for nuclear waste so we can complete the cycle of nuclear energy and allow it to go forward. 
   We get a small percentage of our electricity from solar and wind and biomass. Let me be perfectly clear about my support for these technologies because I do support them and I am willing to continue to allow taxpayer dollars to go into the investment of the technology as it relates to solar and wind and biomass. I am also willing to invest in fuel cells and fusion energy and other kinds of new technology that may someday supplant the kind of technology about which we are talking. 
   But let's have a reality check because if the Senator from Nevada is going to talk about the importance, or the lack thereof, of what we debate today, let's talk about this President and this administration's energy budget and where they want to spend money. They want to spend a lot of money on wind. They have even said that it is their goal to have 5 percent of our electricity generated by wind by the year 2020. It just so happens that the States of Nevada and Idaho have a little wind. It doesn't all come from politicians. It is kind of natural, and it flows through the Rocky Mountains out of Canada. It is the way Mother Nature created the natural environment which creates a wind opportunity out there. 
   But let me talk to you for a moment about a recent report in analyzing the 5 percent wind blend by the year 2020 that this President wants. 
   If you calculate what is needed to meet the goal of 5 percent of our electricity coming from wind energy that would require 133,000 windmills. The current wind turbines generate about 750 kilowatts of electricity each. Some of these 750 kilowatt wind turbines have been installed in Iowa. They are impressive and huge in size. They are on towers 213 feet tall. In addition to that, they have blades with a sweep of 164 feet in diameter. What is something comparable in height? Well, that is about the height of the Capitol dome in the building in which we are standing today. 
   Can't you just see all of those spread across the State of Nevada and Idaho? What are the environmentalists going to say again about vistas, visions, and horizons? You know and I know what they are going to say--``no windmills.'' But that is what this administration wants to talk about because they have this illusion that somehow that is environmentally sensitive. 
   Have you ever caught an eagle in a 164-foot blade? It is referred to as ``avian mortality''--eagles, condors, flying into the turbines and being killed. Yes. Those machines aren't very environmentally sensitive, and they make a great sound across the countryside. They are probably the loudest producer of electricity of any technology we have today. 
   One-hundred and thirty-plus thousand windmills is the answer to no nuclear waste policy? I don't think so. I don't think America thinks so. When they are faced with those realities, I think they will turn on this administration and say, Why aren't you being responsible? Why create a problem when you can solve a problem with a single location in a permanent, deep, geologic repository that is environmentally safe and sound for all under the most stringent of laws and the best technology available? 
   That is what we are talking about. That is a right and responsible choice for the American people to contemplate and for this Senate to debate. 
   There is going to be debate on guns. There is going to be debate on health care. There is going to be debate on prescription drugs. But, in my opinion, a well founded, well orchestrated energy policy for this country is every bit  as valuable and important for us to be involved in as any one of those issues. 
   A veto override that this President offered and gave, in my opinion, is not an environmental vote. Voting for a sound and sane policy for nuclear waste is the No. 1 environmental vote all of us will be making. Let's not try to hide it and walk away from it. Let's deal with it up front and in a way that is right and responsible to recognize. 
   As I thought about what I would say here today that might convince my colleagues to vote for a Presidential override, because for some it is a tough vote and it is a partisan vote, tragically enough, good national energy policy has in this instance become an issue of politics. 
   There is a letter from J.V. Parrish of Energy Northwest based in Richland, WA. He writes about the importance of this legislation. I found his words compelling. I want to read them to you. He says:  
   Because the Federal Government has not had an effective program to receive spent fuel from this country's commercial power reactors, most of these reactors will have to spend several millions of dollars of ratepayer dollars to provide temporary storage. My own company will spend in excess of $25 million. This is money that could be better spent by the households and businesses in the region on things that would improve their futures.  
   What is he talking about? He is talking about utility companies having to charge their ratepayers more because this administration failed to be responsible in their energy policy. 
   I think as time goes on we will find a lot of other things in 
   which our President failed to be responsible, and history will record him differently. I hope the absence of a nuclear waste policy is one of them because that is the way it deserves to be remembered. 
   All I would say to President Clinton is: In vetoing this bill, you have failed, once again, to do the right thing for the country but my colleagues and I don't have to be a party to your failure. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote to override the President's mistake and override this veto. 
   Mr. President, I yield my time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about education. It appears that we will spend most of our time this week talking about the importance of our public education system to America's children and to our Nation's future. 
   Long ago, the United States recognized the value of an educational system that is available and accessible to everyone. We knew the tremendous sophistication of a democracy or a representative republic, and that to sustain it we would have to have a well-educated populace--not only to understand it and to believe in it but to further it. That was part of the genesis of the public school system in our country, along with the tremendous value to our citizenry, to be able to say they were educated. That was our goal. 
   As we start a debate on the Educational Opportunities Act this week, that will continue to be the ultimate goal of the Republicans--the assurance of a strong, growing, reliable, and capable public school system to provide the very best education and the very best educational system to all of our citizens and to all of their children. Though it appears this is the number  one issue in the minds of the American people--and everywhere you poll, you find education is--I am saddened that at least here on the floor this week it will become a decidedly partisan issue. 
   Accusations will fly from the Democrats' side; they will claim that the Clinton-Gore administration has done its job in the promotion of its policies, and that they care more about children than we do. But I think the debate this week, if listened to, will become very clear. Every Senator, either Democrat or Republican, should have the same goal in mind, and that is to provide to our children the very best education possible. The very foundation for that is our public education system. What this debate this week is really about, though, if you listen closely is a difference in philosophies about how we get to the best system in the world. Or how do we improve what is already good and make it better? 
   The Democrats are going to tell you they want more of your tax dollars to stay in Washington to pay for another Federal bureaucrat to do another study, to construct a one-size-fits-all national policy, or to ensure that only 65 cents out of every dollar actually gets to the classroom in America. That is what this debate is going to be about, in part. They will defend the status quo in an ever-increasing Washington, DC, involvement in our children's education. They will defend the increasingly intrusive Federal involvement in State and local educational systems. 
   We, at the Federal level, have always believed the responsibility of educating was at the State level. That is why every State has a department of education or an educational system. It has only been in the last few years that we have increasingly begun to put more Federal dollars into the public school system. Even as we have done that by the billions of dollars over the last decade, still only about 7.5 cents to 8 cents out of every Federal dollar are spent in the classroom. So even with our increased involvement, we still historically have erred on the side of the local community and the State government to be the primary providers of public education. 
   The same system I talk about now, is the system in which the Clinton-Gore regime has denied many students the basic education they deserve by stifling some of our creativity. 
   Republicans say it is time for a change, and we are taking action. 
   This week, on the floor of the Senate, we will be considering S. 2, the Educational Opportunity Act, which does just that. It 
   offers a fundamental change in the way the Federal Government involves itself in public education. Republicans say it is time to put decisions back in the hands of parents and back in the hands of teachers. Our bill includes provisions that give States and school districts more flexibility in how they spend their Federal tax dollars. If you go to a principal's office or superintendent's office today and ask what the Federal tax dollar means to them, while they say it is important, they will say: Look around you; 45 to 50 percent of our staff is here to fill out the Federal forms to get the 7.5 cents out of every dollar we get. 
   That is part of the bureaucracy that has been allowed to build, that the Clinton-Gore administration has aggressively perpetuated over the last eight years. 
   Republicans say every school is different and has different needs, and Washington, DC, should not decide how to spend the money in Midvale, Idaho. I happened to pick Midvale because that is the small rural school from which I graduated. While I graduated 37 years ago, and there were only 10 in my high school graduating class, there aren't many more than that today. In fact, the public school I grew up in has fewer students in the whole school than in one grade level at one Washington, DC, school. It is a small, rural school. That school does not need money to reduce its class sizes. That school needs money to connect itself to the Internet or to buy books, to improve its library, to improve the ability of students to research in a much broader arena than modern technology allows today. We don't need more teachers, and we don't need smaller class sizes. Yet that is the single loudest mantra you have heard coming from the lips of AL GORE or Bill Clinton. 
   Our bill doesn't do that. Our bill allows school districts with fewer than 600 students to combine funds to improve student achievement. Republicans believe it is wrong to let even one child slip through the cracks, be it an urban crack or a rural countryside crack. That is why our bill gives schools and teachers increased authority to meet the needs of the disadvantaged students while requiring accountability. 
   Republicans believe our children deserve the best qualified teachers available. Our bill helps school districts hire and retain the best qualified teachers and empower those teachers to continue to learn and improve so they can increasingly become better educators. 
   Republicans believe schools should be among the most safe places in the United States. Our bill strengthens the Safe and Drug Free School Program. Why should our schools not be a sanctuary and a haven in which all students can feel safety and trust? I think they will not learn well unless they see their schools in that light. 
   Republicans recognize the value of speaking multiple languages and the importance of being fluent in English. Our bill gives a helping hand to those whose first language is not English. Republicans recognize the presence of the Federal Government is a drain on the local infrastructure. Our bill fortifies programs designed to meet part of the Federal Government's responsibility to local communities. 
   Republicans believe we have a special commitment to native students, whether they are in the lower 48 or Alaska or Hawaii. Our bill gives these students a helping hand to help them compete in our modern world. 
   Again, the real debate this week is not who cares most about educating our children. It is a fundamental, philosophical debate about the best ways to allow our children to achieve. It talks about the stark contrast of a large Federal bureaucracy and new Federal ideas being thrust upon the States and local communities because Washington knows every child, and Washington knows better. I am afraid Democrats are going to continue to preach about the failed policies of the Clinton-Gore administration by keeping tax dollars within the beltway, saying that is the way you educate a child in Midvale, Idaho. 
   This week we will say enough is enough. It will be a debate about a different approach: returning the money to the local school districts and to the States and empowering them to make those choices. 
   Let's get that hard-earned tax dollar out of the beltway, out of the hands of the bureaucrat, and into the hands of the well-meaning teachers and parents. Let's tie the money to the child so the parent and the child can seek out and find the very best education that child deserves. 
   Those are the differences I think will be a part of the baseline of the debate this week on the floor of the Senate. 
   I hope America listens, because we need the best public school system in the world. It is a good one, but it is not the best. To make something good better or best is to empower people at local levels to make decisions for their children--the kinds of decisions that parents instinctively know, but bureaucrats in Washington somehow have never understood. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, at the end of the day, we are going to be adjourning for the Easter recess, or at least that is what is anticipated at this time. This Easter recess is going to be a special time for me because I am going home to Idaho to see a new grandbaby I have not yet seen, except by pictures that have been transmitted through the Internet. 
   His grandmother has already been out there to hold him in her arms. Both Suzanne and I are extremely excited that our son Mike and his wife Stephanie have provided us with a beautiful new grandbaby called Aidan Michael Craig. 
   We have already enjoyed the excitement of grandmother and grandfatherhood, and now we have one more extension of that. This coming week, I am going to have that unique privilege that only comes with being a grandparent; that is, to hold that grandbaby in your arms. This Easter recess is a special time for me. I wanted to share with all of my colleagues in the Senate that it will be a joyous time for both me and my wife Suzanne.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this couple are about the same ages as my own children. I say to everyone of my generation, they are a lot like all of our children and we want to see them succeed. They are like many young couples ready to start a new life together, as we have seen generation after generation. 
   They originally planned their wedding date for late this autumn this year, but then friends actually started asking them, ``What about taxes?'' So they did an interesting thing; they sat  down and computed their marriage penalty. Guess what. They found out their combined incomes together as a married couple would cause them to have to pay out of their pockets an additional $1,400 more than they are currently paying as single people working on our two staffs. 
   We are talking about average earners. In fact, the marriage penalty for our young Idaho-Minnesota couple is just about exactly the average-sized marriage penalty American couples are paying across the country, about $1,400. That could be the cost of a honeymoon or a wedding gown or part of a college education, if properly saved and invested for children who might come as a result of this union. 
   It is critically important we deal with this issue. Yes, they have delayed their wedding only a few weeks, but I asked my friend from Minnesota, does the Federal Government have any business forcing any kind of a decision such as this on families and couples?

   Mr. CRAIG. I, too, thank the Senator from Louisiana for her leadership on this issue. We are fortunate enough to work together on this marvelous issue of adoption, chairing the adoption coalition here on the Senate side. 
   Both Senator LANDRIEU and I this week have helped host two delightful young ladies who are on the hill, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, both adopted, both coming from adoptive families. They were in my office this morning speaking about the wonderful families they were allowed to be a part of who have granted them all of this charm and talent that can only come from a loving environment, that has allowed them to become national leaders, as they now are, as Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. 
   I say thank you to the Senator for her leadership on this issue. It is critically important to America and America's families.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the last number of minutes I have listened with great interest to the comments of my good friend from Alaska describing the energy crisis in which our Nation now finds itself. I use the word ``crisis'' with some reservation because my guess is most Americans don't think we are in a crisis. They have good jobs, they probably got raises this year, they feel their jobs are secure, they have plenty of spendable income, and while they may be paying 30 or 40 cents or even 50 cents a gallon more for gas this year than last year, at least the gas is still there and the pump does not say ``no fuel available,'' they don't sense a crisis. 
   I traveled home to my State of Idaho this weekend. I drove in out to Dulles Airport. I got on a Boeing 777 that burns tens of thousands of gallons of fuel in the course of a day and I paid $70 or $80 more for each one of my tickets because of the cost of jet fuel. 
   As I traveled across the country I found the airports full, of Americans and foreign travelers. Yet no sense of urgency or crisis did they appear to feel. 
   When I got home to my home State of Idaho and began to travel across the northern end of the State, I saw that spring is breaking out very quickly in the marvelous wheat belt of northern Idaho that spreads into Washington and Oregon over to Pendleton and Wala Wala. It is a highly productive area that oftentimes yields 100 to 110 bushels of wheat per acre annually without benefit of irrigation. 
   What was out on those rolling wheat fields this weekend? Large 4-wheel-drive tractors, oftentimes pulling 40- and 50-foot spreads of harrows and springtooths, beginning to till the soil, all of them with a 250- or 400-horse diesel engine under the hood of that tractor, burning hundreds of gallons of diesel fuel each day. 
   This year those farmers will be paying another 50 or 60 cents a gallon for that fuel. Yet this is just the beginning of the growing season in our Nation. We are now tilling and planting. We will spend the summer cultivating and spraying to protect our crops from weeds and insects. Then in the fall, huge combines will roll out on the fields, once again driven by diesel fuel--a source of energy that has historically been so abundant in our country and so relatively inexpensive. 
   Today, a river conservation group announced that some rivers in our country are endangered because they have been dammed. In the past America has placed large dams across some rivers and put large turbines in the dams to generate electricity. In a relatively cavalier way, this group said that my river, my Snake River of Idaho, is the most endangered. Why? Because of dams. They want the dams removed. Yet those dams produce hundreds of thousands of kilowatts a year to light the cities of Portland and Seattle, Boise and many other cities and towns. And somehow, all in the name of the environment, they cavalierly suggest we start taking down relatively modern structures that produce large amounts of inexpensive electricity without burning fossil fuels. 
   The reason I draw these verbal pictures today is that no one senses a crisis. This administration, for the last 8 years, has not proposed a single policy initiative that would produce 1 gallon more domestic crude oil for our Nation. In fact, the Clinton/Gore administration has done quite the opposite. They, through punitive environmental policies, have suggested continually that we close more and more federal land to any further oil and gas exploration and production. They have even proposed to take down some of the hydro dams I have talked about, once again all in the name of the environment. 
   Now, the Clinton/Gore administration has an energy policy of sorts. They have talked a lot about solar and biomass which is not a bad idea as long as we don't kid ourselves into believing they will solve all of our problems. They have also talked about developing more powerful wind energy technology to produce more power--not a bad idea either. 
   But the myth of that kind of technology is that to replace the dams on the lower Snake River with photovoltaic cells or windmills, the entire State of Idaho would have to be covered with solar cells just to offset the difference. My guess is there would be a Vice President who would reject such an idea because the result would be unsightly. It would destroy the vistas that are so beautiful in my State right now. It would be uncomely to the American environmental eye. And I would agree with him. 
   But I would not agree with this Vice President, when he stands and says that he will not tolerate drilling offshore California, offshore Florida, offshore our East coast, or in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Clinton/Gore administration has an energy policy of sorts and the Vice President's desire to take down dams, prevent new oil and gas exploration, and instead cover my State of Idaho, or Arizona, or California, with solar cells and 
   wind farms is its hallmark. 
   The reason I mention these frustrations I have, and I think some Americans share, is that for a good long while now we have not had a consistent energy policy for our country that is a combination of all these things: Research for new technology, conservation so we use less and gain more from it, while at the same time producing as much of our own fossil fuel resources as possible. 
   In just a decade or so, we have increased our electrical generation by some 200 percent by the use of coal, but we have reduced the sulfur oxide emissions from coal during that same time by over 20 percent. Through technology, we are using more fossil fuels more efficiently and more cleanly and more of our electricity is generated with such fuels. That is the way you do it. You do not take those kinds of sources off line; you say those are the sources that can generate the abundance of power that drives our industries and heats and cools our homes. 
   So let's be wiser and smarter with our technology than just saying to a certain political interest, I am with you, we will just take that all out of production and off line, because it does not fit somebody's environmental agenda. 
   Among all the things the rivers conservation group said today, about taking dams out on the Snake River, there is something they did not say. They did not say the removal of those dams would destroy the barge traffic on the Snake-Columbia River system. All of the grain and timber and paper and coal that now travels the river in barges would have to move in 18-wheel trucks over the highways of the Pacific Northwest. Tens of thousands more trucks would have to be employed to haul the freight and replace the slack water transportation system that would be destroyed were the dams removed. 
   Is that an environmentally sound thing to do, to employ thousands and thousands more trucks, burning hundreds of gallons of diesel fuel a day? I think not. But, of course, that is not a headline. That does not make the kind of press they thought they could make by their release today, all in the name of the environment, all in the name of saving fish. 
   We will probably debate, on this floor in the next decade, the removal of dams, whether in my State or somewhere else, as it relates to energy policy and protection of the environment and valuable fish. I hope at that time the American people can be given all the facts. I think, when given all the facts and when allowed to view all the alternatives of technology and retrofitting dams, Americans will understand that abundant, inexpensive hydro power energy, can be had along with a clean environment and strong salmon runs. 
   They will also understand the extent to which farmers and ranchers need abundant, relatively inexpensive supplies of energy to produce the food and fiber our Nation needs. Those commodities were being planted in the soils of north Idaho this weekend by the large  4-wheel-drive diesel tractors pulling 50-foot spreads of equipment I talked about at the beginning of my statement. They had to use energy to accomplish it. 
   I will also discuss legislation, with which we will deal in the near future, to alleviate some of the concerns about energy policy in the short term and the cost to the consumer while Congress struggles to develop a long-term policy to increase energy production in our country. 
   I do support legislation that will give us a temporary Federal tax holiday from energy taxes of the kind thrust upon this country by the Clinton-Gore administration several years ago when they argued it was necessary to tax fuel consumption to reduce the deficit structure and the debt structure of our country. 
   I did not support the tax then, and several years later I was one of those who changed the tax from going into the general fund to reduce the deficit to going into the trust funds of transportation, because up until this President came to town, we had never taxed the American people at the gas pump to fund the general fund expenditures of our Government. We had taxed them only to put it in the transportation trust funds that build the roads, bridges, and infrastructure all of us expect and enjoy and the infrastructure on which our economy runs--goods and services that traffic across America on a daily basis. 
   One way to give some short-term relief to the American consumer, as these energy prices have gone up, is to reduce for a short term the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax; take it off the pump; take it away from the consumer and allow that tax to stay in the consumer's pocket. The reason is, what does it mean with the current runup in fuel prices? Matt Lauer said the other day on the ``Today'' show: The energy crisis may be over in the short term. Meaning the Secretary had been to the Middle East, he begged and cajoled the producers in the Middle East to turn the valve on a little bit. Then as the spokesperson for energy policy in this country, the Secretary announced to the American people that gas prices were going to come down some maybe. The ``some maybe'' is that maybe they will come down a little bit, but they are still going to be 40 to 50 cents a gallon higher than they were a year ago. There is some belief in the marketplace, depending on whom you study and whom you believe and who has the right information, that the supply the OPEC nations promised may not be as large as promised and, therefore, by late summer we could see an average of $2 prices across this country. 
   We are going to have to wait and watch for that one. None of us know what the price of gas will be in July or August, but it is going to be a lot higher than it was a year ago. It will, in many ways, determine how the American consumer utilizes his or her free time this year as they think about a vacation, whether it is in the family car, the van, or the SUV, or whether it is booking airline tickets to travel across this country. In all instances, the cost of that leisure time Americans so enjoy will be substantially more expensive than it was a year ago. 
   I am talking about leisure time. I am not talking about the weekly commute, the daily commute. I am not talking about the goods and services that traffic on America's trucks across our Nation on a daily basis or the food we buy at the local supermarket, all having been transported by trucks that are paying substantially more for fuel. 
   How much more are truckers now paying and how much will they have to pass through to the consumer as these prices go up? 
   Diesel fuel costs exceeded $2.10 a gallon in the Northeast this spring. That is a doubling of cost in about a year. The average nationwide was about $1.50 a gallon. To the driver of an 18-wheeler freight truck that traffics America's highways hauling our goods and services, it will mean an additional $150 to $200 to fill his or her tank on a daily basis or a 24-hour transportation period. If they are to stay alive as a business, they have to pass that cost directly through to the consumer: a little here on food prices; a little there on the cost of a piece of carpet; a little somewhere else on any of the goods and services that ultimately the 
   American consumer buys. 
   Of course, that is the same cost the American farmer is experiencing when he or she cannot pass it on, because they cannot set the price of the commodity they will be selling this fall by an extra 10 cents or 15 cents a hundredweight to offset the cost of the diesel fuel and all of the petrochemicals they will use this year in the production of America's food sources. 
   To the consumer--that is you and me--who is commuting to work or considering a family vacation, another 60, 70, or 80 cents a gallon could well mean another $10.50 a tankful every time we pull into the service station. Did they put that in the family budget in January? Did they really plan to pay $300 or $400 more this year, including their trips and all of their other expenses? I do not think so. I do not think anyone considered that. Yet that is what one ought to have considered if they have a true and honest budget. 
   That is why, when recently polled, the American people are beginning to figure out that maybe a 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax reduction for the short term is a good idea to offset at least some of these new costs in energy. Eighty percent of them said the Congress of the United States ought to reduce that tax, at least for the short term, to help compensate for this runup in energy prices we have seen. 
   I am talking about short-term policy. It does not produce a gallon more of domestic crude oil. It does not in any way provide the reliable sources our country has grown to expect over time in a nation that has experienced relatively inexpensive energy. 
   Many of our conservation and environmental friends are saying we ought to be paying as much as Europe pays or as much as the rest of the world pays. That is another $1, $2 a gallon, in some instances, and, therefore, we would rely less upon our vehicles and change our lifestyles. Some day we might have to do that, but all of those costs would have to be spread across an economy, and the general cost of living in this country will go up dramatically. 
   Mr. President, you and I, as consumers in this economy, will have to make choices about how we spend our disposable income and how we spend our income for goods and services. We will have to live a different lifestyle than the one we currently have, if our attitude is only to drive up the cost of energy instead of finding conservation sources and alternative sources and maintaining at least a substantial level of production of crude oil from our own domestic sources. 
   Last week, this Senate, by 1 vote, recognized the importance of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a potential producer of 16 billion barrels of crude oil, production that will be done in a fragile area of our country but can be done in an environmentally sound way based on new technologies. 
   We listen to a Department of Energy that says energy dependence on foreign sources will go up to 65 percent by the year 2010 if we continue the same policy, so says Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson. What he did not say is that to be 65-percent dependent upon foreign sources will require an estimated 12,000 more huge oil tanker dockings each year in the United States. Will that be done safely? In most instances, it will. Will there be a risk with thousands and thousands of more of these supertankers on our open oceans? Will there be some kind of environmental problem? You bet there will. In fact, that is the weak link in the whole process. We have a Vice President who says no drilling offshore because of environmental fragility, and yet by saying that, he is advocating thousands of more supertankers on the open ocean. 
   Go back and look at the record over the last decade. We have not had environmental problems with offshore drilling. But every so often, one of these big tankers runs ashore and spills crude into very fragile environmental areas. 
   So, Mr. Vice President, get honest with the American people. Look at a total package of energy policy that produces onshore in safe environmental ways, and that looks at some of the alternatives you are proposing for wind and solar. I do not deny that any of those has certain value. 
   I suggest that our energy basket, as a nation, be full of all kinds of alternatives but at the same time recognize the base: the conventional forms of energy that drives our agriculture, that  drives our industry, and that provides us with the kind of lifestyle Americans expect, and ought to expect, from a free, powerful nation such as ours. 
   Let me close with these thoughts because we do not often talk about national security. We talk about ourselves, our personal security, our family's security, our food security. Those are the things I have been talking about for the last 10 or 15 minutes. Those are the things that come to our minds immediately when we think we have to spend more of our income on them. Is the food going to be there? Can we live the lifestyle we have had if energy reasonably available? 
   Here is what Commerce Secretary Daley recently reported to our President. In all honesty, this report was on the President's desk, but he wasn't saying anything about it until Senator FRANK MURKOWSKI, the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, stood up and said: Mr. President, you have a report on your desk. You ought to talk about it a little bit. You ought to tell the American people what your own Commerce Secretary is telling you. 
   The President wrote to the Secretary that he concurred with the Secretary's findings and that current policies should aid in dealing with our dependence on imported oil. Secretary Daley said in his report that ``..... imports of crude oil threaten to impair the national security of this country.'' 
   What does the Secretary mean? He means we are not as stable as we were, as strong as we were. We are dependent upon foreign sources for a lot of our energy. We did not send Secretary Richardson to Houston to talk to the oil producers of Texas or to Anchorage to talk to the oil producers of Alaska. We sent him to the most unstable political area in the world, the Middle East. We begged the sheiks, the producers: Please, please, give us just a little oil. We fought a war for you. We saved you. We saved your palaces. We saved your airplanes and your lifestyles and your limousines. Oh, it cost us 140 American lives, but we saved you. So would you please give us a little oil? Because you are really cramping our lifestyle. What you are doing may damage our economy and put hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work. 
   I do not think Mr. Richardson said it quite like that, but that is what he, in essence, was saying. He was admitting that we are vulnerable. That is why Secretary Daley told the President we are becoming more dependent on foreign sources, our national security is at risk. 
   What did the President say? He said: I accept your recommendation that existing policies to enhance conservation and limit dependency on foreign oil ought to be continued. But not one energy proposal has come forth from this administration, except the current budget which has large increases in solar cell and wind technology budgets and hardly any increases for nuclear or hydro technology, hardly any increase in clean coal technology research that could help the large, coal-fired, electrical-energy-producing plants of our Nation. 
   The President was warned this year by the Secretary of Commerce. In 1995, the President was also warned by the Secretary of Commerce that ``..... The Nation's growing reliance on imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products threatens the Nation's 
   security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to oil supply interruption.'' That was in 1995. 
   In late 1998, the OPEC nations were scratching their heads. They weren't making any mont with oil prices at $10-a-barrel. So, t decided to reduce production and drive up prices. 
   They did just that. We saw crude oil prices, in less than a year, go from $10 a barrel to $34 a barrel. That is why I am on the floor today. That is why House Members and Senate Members have been talking about energy policy in the last several months. 
   We have known it was coming. We have warned the administration for years. Six months ago, our colleagues from the Northeast warned of a runup in home heating fuel prices and what that would do to their constituents. But has this administration done anything about it? No, not anything of consequence. 
   The Vice President has been outspoken about no new offshore drilling. 
   He has been outspoken about needing higher taxes for fossil fuels so we would become less reliant upon the internal combustion engine. But nowhere has he suggested increased domestic oil and gas production. 
   We will debate this week, and I hope we will pass, a temporary Federal tax holiday that will allow the American consumer just a little relief in a time when our Nation's energy policy has failed the American consume. At the same time Congress will look at both short-term and long-term policy in an attempt to create more stability in price and supply. 
   This is an important issue. We will hear a great deal more about it in days to come if prices at the pump average $2 a gallon at the height of the summer driving season. 
   When I began these comments, I talked about an energy crisis. The scenario I tried to describe over the last several minutes is that there is, in fact, a crisis going on in our country. It is relatively quiet at the moment. But it is a crisis. We aren't producing enough oil and gas. The White House has no will to build an effective energy policy and will not tell the American people truth about its failures in this regard. We need to find ways to increase oil and gas production, to deal boldly with our neighbors in the Middle East on matters of their physical security and our energy security. The administration has not been very firm with our allies. We are there providing security today, yet we have to beg for our energy. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my amendment to the Johnson amendment is the exact amendment that Senator JOHNSON put on the budget resolution last year. It increases veterans spending the same amount that the Johnson amendment does, by $500 million a year, but instead of blocking our ability to give tax cuts, as his would do, mine is spread across a 5-year discretionary pattern. 
   American citizens, along with veterans, deserve to be treated equally. We ought to recognize our veterans and do as Senator JOHNSON has proposed. At the same time, we ought to recognize American families who are now taxed at the highest level in our Nation's history and give them an opportunity for some tax relief. My amendment grants us that option. I urge consideration of the second-degree amendment.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will send a second-degree amendment to the desk to the amendment of the Senator from Illinois. The Senator from New York and I and most of us agree we need more money and effective law enforcement against gun violence. The amendment I will offer uses the same amount of money the Senator from Illinois has proposed. It does not take it out of the tax cut pool; it takes it out of the 902 fund. It directs it to hire Federal prosecutors, U.S. attorneys in Project Exile, puts them on the ground, gives State grants for gun violence reduction, and causes States also to put their mental adjudicant into the background check program. That is exactly what it does. 
   It also does not prohibit this Congress from offering up a reasonable tax cut to the American citizens. I believe it is the kind of legislation we are expecting and want. But it also addresses the very issue my colleagues from Illinois and New York wish to address.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, all of us are concerned about law enforcement and making sure those who misuse firearms are appropriately prosecuted. The Senator from Illinois and the Senator from New York have that same concern. I choose to get the money from the 920 account and not take it out of tax cuts. I direct it at the hiring of Federal prosecutors. 
   I also direct it to the States for grants in law enforcement because the States continue to put into the background check program those who are legally mental adjudicants. We direct it to law enforcement, which is what the American people say we should do, on the ground where the criminal activity is occurring. The $283 million increases the intensity of effort against gun violence.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to be brief, but I think it is important to respond for the record because we have had a Senator stand up and suggest we ought to instruct the judiciary committees that are in conference now over juvenile justice--and he is doing it based on guns and guns alone. So for a few moments let me talk about what is in the juvenile justice bill that has been covered up by the debate that has produced no results for this country and, most importantly, should not. 
   I know the Senator has not talked about the alcohol prevention for minors that is in the bill or the cultural violence issues or the gangs or the juvenile Brady bill and the gun safety provisions that were already in a bill before Columbine and before Senators came to the floor and began to muck up the process of a very well thought out juvenile crime bill. There are provisions for juvenile offenders to allow the U.S. attorney to prosecute juveniles as adults for violent felonies and serious drug offenses. It treats Federal delinquency records for serious crimes such as murder and rape and armed robbery and assault similar to records of adults and other offenders. 
   Why are we stymied? Why has the Congress not rushed to judgment on gun laws? More gun laws--adding more to the 35,000 gun laws that are already on the books of America's cities, counties, State, and Federal Government. Let me tell you why. 
   In a recent poll by Zogby, recognized by most as a very creditable pollster, here was the question asked of the American citizens: Which of the following is the best way to solve the gun violence in America? Mr. President, 52 percent said 
   prosecuting criminals who use a gun in the commission of a crime--well over a majority of the American people are saying no more laws; Attorney General Janet Reno, go after the criminal who misuses his or her rights under the Constitution. 
   Then 15 percent said having parents and schools teach self-control. Now we are up to 67 percent of the American people who, when asked the question, are saying: Don't pass more laws; enforce the ones you have. Work on the cultural problems that America has. Only 2 percent of the American people say Congress should legislate more gun laws--only 2 percent. 
   So when the Senator from California brought this amendment to the floor some time ago, and it was defeated, that was the reason it was defeated. Now the Senator from Connecticut comes forward with the identical amendment and is going to ask the Senate to repeat the action. A political ``gotcha'' is what they think it is. 
   America is very aware of what we are doing here. It is not what we are not doing here. They know we are not passing more gun laws. They know the reason is because that does not work. Only 2 percent of the American public are willing to suggest that somehow the Congress can miraculously change the culture of our society or the violence in America. The juvenile justice bill itself, absent what was put on it by this Senate, will go a great deal further in curbing juvenile crime than anything else. 
   The Senate will vote its will on this issue, and it should. That is appropriate. But it will not be voting the will of America, an America that is saying to this Justice Department: Get busy and enforce the law; saying to the parents of school-age children of America: Get involved in the lives of your children. Work with them in developing self-control. Work with your schools and your communities. That is not passing a law. That is changing your schedule as a parent. That is taking time out of your busy lives to get involved with your kids. 
   That was the tragedy of Columbine and that is the tragedy of America today. Somehow we have become so busy we cannot give our children time. When violence erupts in America as a result of a juvenile offender and a misdirected child, we run to the Congress of the United States and say: Fix it. 
   We cannot fix these kinds of things, and the American people innately know it. That is why they so clearly said to the Senator from California or to the Senator from Connecticut or to other Senators: Stacking up laws and stacking up law books does not a safer world make. That is why the Senate has rejected it. That is why the House has rejected it. That is why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle gain absolutely no value and political traction on this issue--because the American people have it figured out. 
   I am not surprised. The American people are collectively much brighter than most of us. I ask the Senate to reject this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National Student Employment Week. I would like to show appreciation for the good work that the past and present interns in my office have done, and say a few words about the mutual benefits of a congressional student internship program. 
   These days, as people turn to government more frequently for answers, it is especially important for young people to learn about government. If is crucial that they know how it affects their lives and the lives of others and what they can do to improve it. There is no better way for a student to discover how government works than by participating in the legislative process. Real-world experience helps a student develop optimistic, practical expectations of government. 
   An internship is often a student's first brush with the professional world. The congressional office gives them an opportunity to develop their professional skills. Each year, after working on Capitol Hill or in a state or district office, thousands of former student interns commit themselves to public service or choose a career path in the private sector. These young people bring the high standards with which they were trained to their first job. 
   Internships also allow students to gain experience specific to jobs in a congressional office. They allow students to try out different tasks, which gives them the chance to discover jobs they are well suited for and would not know about without hands-on office experience. 
   Many of us who hold office today credit a student internship as the inspiration for our commitment to public service. In fact, I believe that right now there are many young people who are planning to devote part of their careers to public service because of their student internships. Although not all former interns pursue a public service career, these young people are usually left with an ongoing interest in politics. The result of a student intership, is at the very least, an informed and thoughtful citizen. 
   I have the great fortune to work with some of the sharpest and most eager minds to come out of our colleges and universities. Among them this spring are Melissa Simpson of Blackfoot and Boise State University, Richard Andrus of Rexburg and Utah State University, Sarah Bonzer of Boise and Boise State University, Laura Atchely of Ashton and the University of Idaho, Melynda Topelian of Herndon High, Herndon, Virginia, and Holly Sonneland of Hailey and The Community School in Sun Valley, in my personal office in Washington, DC. The interns in my Republican Policy Committee office include Elisha Tiplett from Woodbridge, Virginia, and James Madison University, Nathan Johnson of Lewiston, Maine, and Brigham Young University, Carolyn Laird of Edmonton, Alberta Canada and the University of Alberta. The interns in my state offices are: Jose Melendez, a student from Northwest Nazarene University in the Boise office; Angela Nyland of Idaho State University and Mark H. Liedtke of Century High School in the Pocatello office; Kjersta Baum of Ricks College and Kristina Pack of Skyline High School in the Idaho Falls office. Past interns in the Idaho Falls office whom I would like to recognize include Pricilla Giddings of Salmon River, Jr./Sr. High School and Jared Lords of Idaho State University. 
   These interns are a welcome addition to my Idaho and Washington, DC, offices. They have brought their energy and scholastic ability with them and helped make my office more responsive to constituents at home. 
   In return for their effort, these students gain the satisfaction of helping their fellow citizens, the reward of being a well-trained worker, and the opportunity to make lifelong political contacts. Some have incorporated their study into their curriculum and will receive academic credit for their endeavors. 
   For these reasons, I will continue to provide internship opportunities to Idaho students. Student internship programs are an excellent example that student employment is pivotal in the continuation of a well-trained work force. 
   I commend my colleagues who have done their part by opening their offices to interns. I hope that they have seen, as I have, that student internships offer numerous benefits to both the congressional office and the student. 
   I thank the students who have participated in an internship. Their time as interns has made them knowledgeable citizens on the subject of government, and their participation has enriched our nation's legislative process.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thought I would come to the floor today to speak again about energy and the current energy cost crisis in which this Nation finds itself. 
   Many of us have been to the floor numerous times over the last several weeks comparing our current situation and the tremendous runup in gas prices with this administration's lack of an energy policy and how they correlate--or if they relate. 
   I have said, most critically, over the last several weeks, the only policy in town is the ``tin cup'' policy: Give our Secretary of Energy a tin cup, and send him to foreign oil-producing nations to beg for a little crude. 
   He has been begging. He wanted a lot more. He begged for 2 million barrels a day in additional production. He got considerably less than that. I think it is now a wait-and-see: How does this level out? What do the markets say? What is the consumer going to pay at the gas pump in July? My guess is, the consumer is going to be paying near $2 a gallon for regular gasoline, depending on where they are in the country. 
   The reason for this situation is what I would like to talk about this afternoon. Congress can respond in some ways. But we cannot increase oil production in the short term because, largely, we have had a policy of reducing oil production in this country for the last two decades, and it takes time to bring that production back on line. A great many people out there are opposed to increasing domestic production--all in the name of the environment or all in opposition to using hydrocarbons or some other issue that has helped shape the Clinton/Gore energy policy over the last 8 years. 
   When the Clinton-Gore administration came to town in 1993, its announced intention was to drastically alter the way the Nation used energy, especially fossil fuels. The President and the Vice President determined that a broad-based Btu tax would force us away from coal and oil and natural gas to renewable energies, such as solar and wind and biomass. That objective has remained the hallmark of this administration's energy policy--until now; that is, until the day before yesterday, when the President was blaming the Congress, saying we had failed to reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--the salt domes in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have stored about 570 million barrels of crude oil. 
   The President promised his Btu tax would raise nearly $72 billion over 5 years, from 1994 to 1998, and marketed it as fair, helpful to the environment, that it would force down our dependence on foreign oil, and that it would have trivial impacts on consumers. 
   Congress did not pass the Btu tax because we thought it would be damaging to the consumer. And over the years we have become increasingly more dependent upon foreign oil. I doubt the President can declare a victory because he was unable to suck $72 billion out of the back pockets of Americans while at the same time he advanced policies that slowed down crude oil production in our country. 
   In fact, the Btu tax would have unfairly punished energy-intensive States and industries. Estimates by the American Petroleum Institute and the National Association of Manufacturers predicted the tax would hurt exports, reduce GDP by $38 billion, and destroy 700,000 American jobs. 
   That is why the Congress finally refused to pass the tax, over the President's and the Vice President's objection. Vice President GORE and President Clinton claimed the tax was needed to balance the budget and fund large new spending programs to offset the negative impact of the tax. They also claimed that use of crude oil imports would be reduced by 400,000 barrels a day. 
   At that time, DOE's own projections predicted--this is the 
   President's own Department of Energy--that the tax would shave oil import growth by less than one-tenth in 10 years. DOE also predicted that by the year 2000, Americans would depend on foreign oil for three-fifths of their total crude oil requirements. 
   So quite the opposite was going on inside the administration. The President was talking politics, and his own Department of Energy was analyzing the matter and coming up with some very interesting facts. 
   The American Petroleum Institute, in testimony, said:  
   ..... even if imports were to fall by the full 400,000 barrels a day claimed by the Administration, the cost of $34 billion in lost GDP is excessive relative to other alternatives for improving energy security. Using the Administration's optimistic predictions, the cost of the Btu tax works out to about $230 per barrel. 
   Of course, that would have been devastating to an economy that is highly dependent upon fossil fuels that not only make our cars and trucks go, but feed the whole petrochemical industry which manufactures carpeting, herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, and plastics, all of those things that make up our very large, integrated economy--therefore, the 700,000 estimated jobs lost if we were to raise the price of crude oil to $230 a barrel. 
   In the end, Congress did the right thing; we refused the President's and the Vice President's policy and said it would simply create havoc in our economy. Congress did agree to raise taxes on transportation fuels by 4.3 cents--the first time the Congress has actually put a tax on fuel--and then put it into the general fund of the Treasury. Of course, it was argued to be a deficit reduction tax. 
   A couple of years ago, we finally pulled that tax out of the general fund and put it back in the surface transportation fund, where all highway fuels taxes have gone historically, to fund the construction of roads, highways, and bridges. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration's obsession with fossil fuel use reduction has actually put us in the position we find ourselves today. The President, on March 7, 2000, at the White House said:   
   Americans should not want them [oil prices] to drop to $12 or $10 a barrel again because that.....takes our mind off our business, which should be alternative fuels, energy conservation, reducing the impact of all this on global warming.  
   He is referring again to the cost of fuel. He simply said it would move us away from a desire for alternative fuels if we were to see low gasoline and fuel prices. 
   Isn't that terrible? The alternative fuels were synthetics, highly subsidized by as much as $25 to $30 a barrel by tax money and, of course, alternative energy and electricity by solar voltaic cells and by wind machines. 
   The only problem is, I have not yet seen a car, or a truck for that matter, going down the road with a solar cell on the top of it. I don't think they run very well that way. Somehow the President and the Vice President, in their hatred of fossil fuels, have forgotten that point. 
   That is kind of an overview of 1993 to the present. What has happened during this administration? Domestic oil production is down 17 percent, and our crude oil consumption is up 14 percent. Dependence on foreign sources of crude oil has risen to 56 percent of our total crude requirements. In 1973, during the Arab oil embargo, our dependency was only 36 percent. I can remember that time. 
   I am sure some listening this afternoon will remember the gas lines, the frustration and even the violence that occurred when Americans found out for the first time there wasn't an abundance of energy. There was a shortage. They couldn't get what they needed for their commuting or the running of their businesses. 
   Since that time, while this country has struggled to put a policy together, other policies of our Government, largely environmental policies--some for the right reason--have progressively reduced our overall ability to produce and use domestic energy sources. That, coupled with the fixation of this administration on eliminating fossil fuels, now brings us to that point where we are now over 56-percent dependent. 
   We all remember in the early 1990s we were fighting a war in the Middle East. Why? Well, to help some of our allies. Those allies were large producers of crude oil, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. We were fighting Iraq because the Iraqis had crossed the border and started the war. In the end, as they retreated and we were victorious, they set fire to many oil wells in Kuwait. We remember that phenomenal picture from the Middle East of black clouds of smoke as those oil wells burned. Many of our oil field workers went in and put the fires out for our neighbors. 
   Now, what is the irony of that? Today, the very enemy we fought is selling over 700,000 barrels of crude oil each day to the United States. Something is wrong about that. Something is wrong about an absence of foreign policy that has allowed that to happen. That is the reality of where we are. 
   Americans grow angry when they understand this administration only has excuses and solar cells and windmills for an energy policy. They understand that the Clinton/Gore foreign policy, working hand in glove with its non-energy policy, now tolerates that we buy Iraqi oil. 
   Of course, we are not sure where that money goes and what it is used for. Is Saddam Hussein being allowed to build another war machine with the millions of dollars a day that pour out of the pockets of our consumers into the treasury of Iraq? The Clinton-Gore administration, while making much of increased appliance efficiency, greater use of renewables from biomass and other ideas, ignores a very fundamental fact. A large part of our energy use cannot be addressed by these measures. 
   I am not suggesting we not pursue new technologies and alternatives. Where a solar cell fits, put one up; where wind farms work, we ought to have them. We ought to be striving to build the efficiencies of the new wind turbines. At the same time, those will not fuel a nation that produces the kind of growth we produce and builds its efficiencies based on flexible transportation and the ability to send our people and our products in an integrated way around the Nation and around the world. 
   The administration's failure to encourage domestic oil production and production of coal and natural gas has led us to 
   this point of near crisis. This Congress will engage in the very near future in debating the issue to see what we can do in the short term to help solve the pressure being placed on our consumers, but we also will be looking at long-term policy to see if we can't begin to produce more of our own resources again. 
   For example, if we have the right tax incentives and if we were able and willing to build a floor for the small 15-barrel-or-less producer, we are not talking about the major oil companies. We are talking farmers and ranchers and private property owners spread all across the mid to lower south central part of our country and southwest that are known as stripper well producers. Their break even is about $17 a barrel. When gas oil crude prices went to $10 a barrel last year, many of those wells were shut in. If we would help encourage that production once again, we could produce well over a million barrels of oil back into our economy that is not producing today. 
   I think that is tremendously good policy, if the tradeoff is putting money in Saddam Hussein's hand to build a new war machine versus helping subsidize or provide incentives for the small producer across this country to bring back on line a million barrels a day of domestic crude oil. 
   The administration has refused to acknowledge the vast oil reserves and gas reserves we have offshore and in ANWR, the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. We know we can explore and produce in these areas in an environmentally sound way. ANWR is an area about the size of Dulles Airport relative to the whole State of Virginia. Those opposed to exploring ANWR would have you believe that if we drilled inside Dulles Airport that it would pollute the whole State of Virginia. 
   How foolish can some of these people get who make those kinds of arguments? The President listened. The Vice President listened. They have refused to promote a policy that would allow safe and sound drilling to provide the energy for our country. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration recently announced a ban on future exploration for most of the Federal Outer Continental Shelf through the year 2012. That is where the real big oil reserves are left in this country, offshore. I know we all remember the oil spills of 20 years ago on the coast of California. What no one is talking about is the tremendous new technology that has been applied to the gulf and other areas where drilling goes on, where wells don't leak today and blowouts don't happen. If they do occur accidentally, they are immediately shut down. All of those technologies are in existence. I think anyone who has looked at the record of drilling in the Gulf of Mexico recognizes that it is clean and it is sound. It is extracting the resource and is having almost a zero impact on the environment of the gulf area and its coast lines. 
   In 1996, the administration resorted to the little used 1906 Antiquities Act. The President argued it was a major emergency and he had to lock up these millions of acres in Utah. What he was really locking up, for fear that it might be mined, was 23 billion tons of low-sulfur, high-value coal that could have been used to generate electricity in our country today and well into the future. 
   All of these areas that would have been mined--and they were a very small part of the over 1 million acres that the President locked up in the Grand Starcase/Escalante National Monument--would have been reclaimed in a natural way because that is part of the environmental policy of our country today. If you are going to disturb the land, once you have done so, you must put it back in as near a natural way as is possible. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration has vetoed legislation that would have opened the Coastal Plain of the remote Alaskan national wildlife reserve. It is estimated that there are 15 billion barrels of domestic crude oil up there. 
   The administration also has ignored a report prepared by the National Petroleum Council, requested by the Energy Secretary, explaining how the Nation can increase production and use of domestic natural gas resources from about 22 trillion cubic feet per year to more than 30 trillion cubic feet per  year over the next 10 to 12 years. In other words, we could add nearly 10 trillion cubic feet of new domestic gas to our energy mix. 
   That would allow the Northeast, which is tremendously dependent upon oil for space heat, to convert to a much cleaner fuel, a much more efficient fuel, a fuel of natural gas, and bring down their dependency on oil fuel for home heat and space heat. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration has shown little interest in solving our domestic energy problems until now, as the foreign oil producers have forced crude up to over $30 a barrel last month. Gasoline prices, last week, were $2 a gallon in San Francisco. 
   Mr. President, I argue that the Clinton-Gore administration has acted in other ways designed to force us away from the use of a reliable, available, relatively inexpensive fossil fuel, and the only argument the President had this weekend during his radio address was: Congress, you are to blame. 
   Yet I have listed numerous vetoes or efforts to block our administrative and rulemaking processes that have actually blocked production in our country. That is why many of us have suggested to this President that he needs to step back and work with Congress to define a national energy policy that promotes increased domestic crude oil and natural gas production, while looking at all of the other alternatives we have and the new technologies, especially clean coal technology. Nothing should be done in isolation of the other. It ought to well be a total package that we would want to work on. 
   My distinguished friend from West Virginia, Senator ROBERT BYRD, spoke eloquently last week on the subject. I want to add a few thoughts to his comments. The U.S. has the world's largest demonstrated coal reserve base and more than 90 percent of our total fossil fuel energy reserves are in coal. Yet this administration has downplayed new coal-burning and clean coal technologies--the very kind of thing we ought to want to bring online as much of our electricity is generated by coal, and as we define and refine the science of global warming and attempt to understand the cause or causes and how to respond. At present rates of consumption our coal will last for up to 270 years. In other words, we blessed with huge coal reserves. Yet this administration's lack of policy has forced us into near crisis. Coal is used to generate 56 percent of our electrical supply and about 88 percent of the Midwest's electrical needs. Coal use for electrical power has risen more than 250 percent since 1970, while sulfur dioxide emissions has decreased by 21 percent due to technology and, in part, due to some of the money we put into research sponsored here that has moved that kind of technology. 
   Now, as my colleagues think about all of this, here is a quote I found by the President over the weekend. Remember, I was talking about coal. I was talking about our tremendous need for production of electricity. Here is what the President was saying over the weekend:  
   I think to a much greater degree, then, we have a commitment to the notion that we can improve the environment while we grow the economy--  
   None of us disagrees with that. But he goes on,  
   ..... that is what the whole global warming issue is about. All over the world, there are people who just don't believe that you can get rich unless you put more stuff in the air that heats up the earth. They think you have got to burn more coal and oil in the digital economy. That is not true. 
   Mr. President, what you have said isn't true. What runs the digital economy of our country? What turns on the computer? What fires up the Internet? A solar cell? A wind mill? I don't think so, Mr. President. It is the abundance of electrical power. 
   Let me repeat: Coal use for electrical power has risen more than 250 percent since 1970, and the sulfur dioxide emissions during that time have actually decreased by 21 percent. Furthermore, the gas the Clinton/Gore administration blames for 
   global warming, carbon dioxide, isn't a poisonous gas and isn't regulated under the Clean Air Act. 
   The point I am making is simply this: An abundant economy--the kind we are experiencing today that has us at or near full employment--is a direct result of an abundance of relatively inexpensive energy. The history of our country has been based on the availability of energy. That is why we are the wealthy Nation we are today. Look at the rest of the countries of the world; as they strive to grow and provide an economy for their people, they develop their energy base. 
   My wife and I and a group of business people from Idaho were in China in December. The skies were so dark there in Beijing that you could hardly see because they don't have the clean coal technology we have. Yet they are growing very rapidly and they need an abundant source of energy. They are building dams and nuclear reactors, and they are searching for a cleaner way to burn their coal because they know if they are to grow and provide their country and their citizens with opportunity, they are going to have to use coal to generate electric energy. President Clinton, I don't think you really get it. Do you think this new hi-tech, digital economy happens out there on its own? It is, in fact, a product of a nation who has an abundant energy base. In November of 1999, the EPA sued several coal-burning utilities, claiming they had made major modifications in their facilities without applying for new resource review permits. Utilities maintained that these were modifications made during routine maintenance. They were still providing high-quality energy with less emissions. Why is EPA out there suing at this moment, at a time when there is a deficiency of energy in this country and we ought to be promoting more? Certainly, we ought to be promoting it with all of the newest technology. But you don't do that by suing; you do that with policies that encourage people to do the right thing. 
   Lastly--and this is the irony of this administration which likes to think it has an energy policy--this morning, Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt is out looking for a dam to tear down. Eight years ago, he said he would like to knock down a really big dam while he is Secretary of Interior. Really big dams produce a lot of big power, Mr. Secretary, or haven't you figured that out? Big renewable power, hydropower. It doesn't have emissions; it is very clean. Yes, our fathers and forefathers chose to dam some rivers to generate electricity. Those were efficient ways to do it then, and they are finding out they are environmentally sound ways to do it now. Yet Mr. Babbitt wants to tear down one, two, or three dams, or I guess as many as he can get his hands on, or find a policies that make it difficult to keep these dams running. 
   Why don't we simply work to improve those dams? Why don't we make them more efficient by adding new technology to the dams, putting new turbines in them that are friendly and more efficient. It is beginning to happen nationwide. Why should we deny our country 20 percent of its energy base, or bad mouth that energy source, or attempt to tear it down? No, what I am trying to say this afternoon in this collection of thoughts is, Mr. President, I don't think you get away by just pointing a finger at a single action of the Congress and saying you didn't give me emergency authority over the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, so therefore our energy crisis is your fault, Congress. 
   I think I have named 15 or 20 issues on which this administration has taken a strong anti-energy, anti-production approach toward dealing with energy policy in this country. Mr. President, we can solve our energy problems. We are a marvelously creative Nation. But we don't do it by simply saying no. We do it by producing where we can produce, by creating less dependency on foreign sources, while at the same time building the kind of science and technology that allows us ever increasing 
   energy efficiency and environmental improvement. I think in the coming years we are going to debate the global climate change issue. Getting rid of hydrocarbons isn't the answer. Getting rid of fossil fuels isn't the answer. It is finding better and more efficient ways to use them, and then allowing our technology to be sold and transferred to the world at large. If our clean coal technology were at use in China today, China would be a healthier, more environmentally clean place to live. 
   Someday they will be able to afford that technology, and they will want it. It is our businesses and our companies that develop it that ought to be encouraged to sell it to them. That is  called leadership. It simply isn't crawling into a cave and getting a candle to light your way and heat your space. It is building an efficient system recognizing that all sources of energy ought to be at play at this moment so that we can truly develop an abundant energy package for ourselves and our Nation's future. Thank you Mr. President.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join in this debate with mixed feelings. 
   On one hand, I am very frustrated we are here yet again, as we have been year after year for so long, trying to secure approval for this very important amendment so that it can be sent to the states for ratification. Time after time, we have come within just a few votes of success. But, for whatever reason, those few votes have eluded us, and we have had to go back to square one and begin the legislative process again. 
   So I cannot approach this debate without a good measure of frustration. 
   But on the other hand, the very fact that we are here again debating this measure is reassuring. It is proof positive of the American people's continuing belief in the importance of flag protection. 
   Imagine that. In spite of all the editorials about the erosion of ideals, in spite of all the speeches, some on this very Senate floor, about the loss of values in America, in spite of the dire predictions about moral decline--in spite of all that, there is a strong and growing grassroots movement demanding protection of our Nation's most important symbol: our flag. 
   Why would we even hesitate to answer that call? 
   Millions of our fellow citizens are telling us that the sight or mention of our flag still has the power to awaken the spirit of the American patriot. State legislatures are clamoring for the opportunity to protect the symbol of our national aspirations and values. 
   To those of my colleagues who are searching for signs of spring in a winter of moral decay, let me say: look no further. Here is the sign. This is the call. Now is the time to take a stand and support this amendment. 
   I do not minimize the fears of those on the other side of this debate. However, it is worth remembering that the U.S. Supreme Court has not hesitated to draw constitutional lines around the kinds of speech that are protected or not protected by the First Amendment. They have found that in some cases, certain interests may outweigh the citizen's right to free expression. As a result, laws may be enacted to restrict those kinds of speech, such as ``fighting words'' or obscenity. 
   The Court chose not to exempt the behavior that came under scrutiny in the flag case. Frankly, I think they could have, and should have, reached a different result. But my point is that the Congress need not shrink from applying its own judgment to balancing the interests involved. In my opinion, flag protection serves a number of compelling interests but would not prevent the expression of a single idea or message. I do not think the First Amendment must be or would be compromised by protecting the flag from desecration. 
   Even so, it is also worth noting that what we do here today is only the first step in a long process. This amendment must be ratified by the states, and only after that will Congress fashion an actual flag protection statute. Even if some of my colleagues are uncertain about how to go about crafting legislation to protect the flag, I hope they will all agree that it is appropriate to pass this resolution and give the American people the 
   opportunity they have demanded to consider this issue in the legislatures and town halls and across the kitchen tables of this great country. 
   Yesterday morning, I had the honor of addressing our Nation's veterans. As I stood before them, I thought of the long line of patriots throughout our history who have defended our flag--some with the supreme sacrifice. Suddenly, the legal hairsplitting and fear-mongering over this issue seemed both trivial and insulting. 
   Millions of Americans understand, as these veterans do, that the flag is more than a scrap of cloth. It weaves people of diverse cultures together to form our Nation, just as surely as its threads are woven into a pattern that stands for freedom throughout the world. It deserves protection and can be protected without endangering any of the fundamental ideals it symbolizes. 
   Today, we can send a signal that we understand, that we agree, that we honor the values that the American people have attached to our flag. I hope all our colleagues will join in voting in favor of this resolution and moving the flag protection constitutional amendment to the states for ratification.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to join my colleague from Wyoming who has so clearly outlined in the last few moments part of the problems our country faces at this time in our history relating to energy policy, or a lack thereof. 
   As I speak on the floor, as my colleague has just completed his comments, all eyes are turned on Vienna. That is not Vienna, NY, that is Vienna, Austria, where the OPEC nation members are meeting to decide whether they will be generous enough to turn their valves on a little more and increase crude oil production to a million or a million and a half barrels a day so that our gas prices will come down at the pump. 
   How can a great nation such as ours now find itself so dependent upon a group of nations, almost all of them quite small but all of them very rich in crude oil? How do we find ourselves dependent on their thinking? What is the reason we find ourselves dependent? This is part of what my colleague from Wyoming was talking about. It is the loss of production units and the drop in number of rigs out exploring, and that is all our fault, our fault collectively as a nation, for having failed over the last several decades to put in place an energy policy that had, as its first criterion, relative independence from other nations of the world as suppliers of our fundamental energy-based need for crude oil, crude oil production for our petrochemical industry. 
   I have been to the floor several times in the last couple of weeks to speak about this because the price at the pump today is not an aberration. It is not something that was just quick in coming. We, as a country, have known for some time this day would be at hand. Several years ago, we asked our Government to investigate whether a lack of domestic production would put us at some form of vulnerability as to our ability to defend ourselves. The answer was yes. Those studies were placed on the desk of our President, Bill Clinton. Nothing was done. A year ago similar studies were done, and they reside on the President's desk as we speak. They have been there since last November, and nothing has been done. 
   Only in the last month has the President sent his Secretary of Energy out and about the world, with his tin cup in hand, begging--begging producing nations to turn their valves on a little bit. 
   What is the consequence of turning your valve on at the pump? The consequence is a reduction in the overall world spot price of crude oil. When you do that, the cash-flow pouring out of this country to the OPEC nations of the world declines; oil production goes up, cash-flow declines. Why would they want to do that? Out of the generosity of their hearts? 
   For the last year-and-a-half or 2, they have been in political disarray. During that time, they were largely pumping at will into the world market. A year ago, we saw crude oil prices at $10 a barrel on the world market. Today, they are over $30. Now $10 a barrel is probably too low, but $30 is a huge and bountiful cash-flow to the treasuries of these countries--Saddam Hussein's country, the man whose country we fought against to free Kuwait and the Kuwaiti oil fields less than a decade ago. 
   In fact, it was Northeastern Senators who, some months ago, wrote a letter to our President asking him to become sensitive to this issue because they were aware, with the run-up in oil prices--and we knew it was coming the minute the OPEC nations got their act together--the Northeastern Senators would see their States hit by heavy home heating oil costs. Sure enough, that is what happened. It happened because of the run-up in price. It also happened because of a loss of refinery capacity that has been going on for some time. 
   What was going on in the Northeast, 2 and 3 months ago, is now going on across America. I come from the West, where energy prices are extremely high and the impact on goods and services, and our citizens, can be dramatic. So even if the OPEC oil countries decide to raise crude oil output, my guess is it will be just a little bit. It may sound like a lot to the average listener--a million, million-and-a-half barrels a day--and 
   it could bring crude oil prices down a little bit. But the OPEC nations' goal is to keep crude oil prices above $20 a barrel and therefore keep regular gas at the pumps at somewhere in the $1.40 to $1.50 range. That is still a dramatic increase, nearly doubling east coast prices. It will be even higher on the west coast. 
   The failure of the Clinton-Gore administration to recognize it, to understand it, and therefore to deal with it, is one of the great domestic and foreign policy tragedies of the decade. I say that from an economic point of view, but it is true also from a defense point of view--our ability to defend ourselves and stand as an independent nation in a community of nations around the world. 
   Here are some statistics. Probably everyone's eyes glaze over a little bit when you use statistics, but it is important for the record. U.S. crude oil production is down by 17 percent since 1992. We have actually had wells shut off and shut in. What does that mean? The price of oil got so low, they could not afford to pump them. It cost money to produce. So they turn the well off and they shut the well in, meaning it no longer has the capability of producing. 
   U.S. crude oil consumption during that same period of time went up 14 percent: 17 percent down in production, 14 percent up in consumption. It sounds like a ready-made situation for a crisis, and that is exactly where we find ourselves today. The United States is 55-percent dependent upon those nations that are meeting in Vienna at this moment; 55-percent dependent for so much of what we do. That is dramatically up from just a couple of decades ago when we were in the mid-30s, relating to dependency. 
   While all of this is going on and nothing is being done by this administration, and most of what we are trying to do here has either been denied or vetoed or blocked by this administration, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates we will have a 65-percent dependency on foreign producers by the year 2020. Some would say that is good because we will not have the environmental risks in this country; we will not be drilling and we will not be refining as much, and therefore the environmental risks will be gone. 
   What they did not tell you is, it puts hundreds of new supertankers out there on the open ocean on a daily basis--even if our foreign neighbors will produce and even if they will sell to us, hundreds more of those huge supertankers out there in the open ocean,  coming into our ports, offloading. Let me tell you, there are greater environmental consequences for that than the use of today's technology on our land or out in our oceans, drilling, finding, and shipping to our refineries. 
   The United States is spending $300 million a day on imported crude oil. That is $100 billion a year flowing out of this country to the coffers of the OPEC nations. That is big money, huge money, in any sense of the words. We sit here and wring our hands over a balance of payments, yet we do nothing to bring that production back to our shores and to be able to control our own destiny in the production of crude oil. 
   As I mentioned, the world oil price reached over $30, about $34 a barrel on March 7. It is down a little bit now on speculation that the OPEC nations today will make decisions that will increase production. But, of course, we already know energy prices on the west coast are at nearly $2 a gallon at the pump and are certainly extremely high here. More than half of all crude oil we use, about 18 million barrels per day, goes directly into home heating oil, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, and other transportation fuels. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration has failed to do one single thing to develop more of our Nation's crude oil reserves, of which we have an abundance. In fact, I was watching CNN a few moments ago. Some people in the oil industry would suggest only about half of the crude oil capability of this Nation has been used since we first discovered crude oil. 
   Only about half of it has been used. The rest of it is under the ground. It is more difficult to find, more expensive to produce, but it is still there, and the great tragedy is we are not producing it. In fact, we are doing quite the opposite. 
   Since this administration has come to town, there has been an anti-oil attitude from a standpoint of domestic production. From the very beginning, they pushed through a 4.3 percent gas tax increase. They argued it was for deficit reduction. But when one listens to the soundings of the Vice President when he talks about crude oil and combustion engines and how negative they are to the environment and we ought to tax them out of existence--and he has said all of those things; I am paraphrasing, but it is not new; he has been replete in those expressions over the years--it is not unexpected that he cast the single vote that broke the tie between Democrats and Republicans on this floor that put the gas tax in place. 
   We now are looking to try to take that gas tax off in the very near future, at least roll it back a ways, and give our consumers some flexibility. We are going to balance the budget this year and have surpluses. Why not use some of that surplus money to offset the runup in expenses that consumers are now feeling at the gas pump at this moment and that certainly our transportation industry is feeling? It ought to be something we do. 
   I argue that we hold the highway trust fund fully offset. That is the trust fund that funds the pouring of concrete for our roads and our bridges and creates hundreds of thousands of jobs a year in the building and rebuilding of our infrastructure. Those need to be funded. I do not argue they should not be. But here we are dealing with a surplus, fighting with our Democrat colleagues over whether we should give tax relief to the taxpayers this year. What better way to give some of it back than to reduce the cost at the pumps? Most Americans today who drive cars find themselves paying increasingly higher fuel bills. 
   For the next few moments, I will talk about rural America. I come from a rural State. Many of us do. While runups in energy costs are dramatically impacting urban America, it is even greater in rural America. Why? It is quite simple. Many of my friends in Idaho drive 50, 60, 70 miles a day to just get their kids to school or just to shop at the local grocery store. That is not unusual in rural America. 
   All of the goods and services that flow to our farms and from our farms travel on the backs of 18-wheeler trucks, all consuming diesel oil. 
   Diesel oil is now being acquired by farmers across the Nation as they enter our fields for the spring farming season. All of that is going to drive up the overall cost of the farmers this year. In agriculture, farmers have experienced a 4-year run of very low commodity prices and have found most of their farms and ranches below break even. Now, because of an absence of a national energy policy, they find their cost of production could double, at least in the energy field. Many of the tools they use--the insecticides, the pesticides, and the herbicides that are made up of oil bases--are going to go up dramatically in cost. 
   In my State of Idaho, farming and ranching, logging and mining are also an important part of the rural economy. All of them very energy intensive. Those industries have found themselves nearly on their backs from the last few years at a 
   time when we see energy costs ready to double or triple. 
   We have heard it from the homeowner and the apartment dweller in the Northeast for the last several months, that their fuel costs have doubled, their heating bills have doubled. Some are having to choose food over warmth or warmth over food. Many are senior citizens on fixed incomes. 
   While we have tried to offset that some with help from Washington, we have not been able to do it all. And in the next month and a half, we are going to hear it from the farmers and the ranchers as their fuel bills skyrocket. 
   We have already heard from the truckers. They have been to town several times, and many of our independent truckers are literally driving their trucks into their driveways, shutting them down, and not turning them back on, therefore, risking bankruptcy and the loss of that income-making property because they cannot afford to pay the fuel bills. 
   Why? It is time we ask why, as a country, and it is time Congress dealt with at least some short-term provisions while we look at and strive for some long-term energy policy. 
   I do not think one can expect the Clinton-Gore administration to be very helpful, except begging at the doorsteps of the palaces of the sheiks of the OPEC nations, because that is their only energy policy. 
   Those are the kinds of things we are going to look at and abide by. I think this Congress will attempt to respond and respond in a positive way for the short-term provisions while we look at long-term policy to increase production of crude oil inside the 50 States of our Nation in a way that we can control it, we can shape our energy future without a group of energy nations meeting in Vienna having a choke hold around our very neck. 
   Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt is talking about taking down valuable hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest--the administration does not consider hydropower a renewable resource. Electricity from hydro meets about 10 to 12 percent of U.S. needs. 
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner is trying to shut down coal fired electric generating plants in the midwest--which depends on those plants for 88 percent of its electricity. The U.S. depends on coal for 55 percent of its electricity needs. 
   While the Clinton-Gore administration tried to kill off the use of coal fired electricity it is doing nothing to increase the availability of domestic natural gas which is the fuel generators will use if they cannot use coal. To replace coal the U.S. must increase its use of natural gas by about 10 trillion cubic feet per year. 
   Federal land in the Rocky Mountain West could contain as much as 137 billion cubic feet of natural gas but the Clinton-Gore administration refuses to allow any oil and gas exploration on those lands. 
   Last week the President announced his plans for dealing with our current energy problem. Once again, his emphasis focused on conservation and renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biomass. We cannot put windmills on trucks or solar panels on trains or barges. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration has refused to even consider allowing exploration in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge which could contain up to 16 billion barrels of domestic crude oil which could easily be moved to refineries in the lower 48 through the Alaska pipeline. 
   The Vice President has vowed to prohibit any future exploration for oil and natural gas on the Federal outer continental shelf when there are clearly  areas that have great potential for new domestic energy supplies. The President recently closed most of the Federal OCS to any exploration until 2012. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration embraces the Kyoto Protocol which would impose staggering economic costs on the United States. The Protocol would require the U.S. to vastly reduce its use of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal to achieve reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide--which is not a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and has not yet been proven to be the cause of climate change. The U.S. Senate voted 95-0 to reject it. 
   Clearly, there is a pattern. 
   It started in 1993 when the Clinton-Gore administration proposed a $73 billion 5-year tax to force U.S. use of fossil fuels down. 
   It continues with misguided Federal land use policies, environmental policies designed not necessarily to protect the environment but to kill fossil fuel use, and continues with administration support for the economically punitive Kyoto Protocol. This administration hates the fossil fuel industry and apparently the economic well-being these abundant and relatively cheap fuels have helped the U.S. economy achieve. These are the words of the Vice President:  
   Higher taxes on fossil fuels ..... is one of the logical first steps in changing our policies in a manner consistent with a more responsible approach to the environment.  
   That is by Senator AL GORE, from ``Earth in the Balance,'' 1992, page 173. 
   To me it is pretty clear that this administration is unwilling to commit to a rational energy policy that will help America's families. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today, as has the Senator from Maine, to speak about the energy crisis our country finds itself in. Let me use those words again: energy crisis. 
   A week and a half ago, Senator SNOWE was before my subcommittee testifying on some key legislation she has introduced. The Senator from Maine recognizes the phenomenal impact high energy costs have on her State. Whether it is home heating or the transportation systems that drive her industries, she has recognized it clearly and early on announced to this administration there was a problem coming and encouraged them to change their policy. Yet they have done nothing. 
   As I listened to the Senator from Maine this morning, she spoke very clearly about what this country needs to do. I strongly support the words she has stated for the RECORD. 
   When the Clinton-Gore administration came to town in 1993, it announced its intent to drastically alter the way the Nation used energy, especially fossil fuels. Remember, briefly, the President and the Vice President determined that through the use of a broad-based Btu tax, they would drive us away from our most abundant and economical fuels to a renewable solar wind or biomass system. The objective has remained a hallmark of this administration's energy policy. That is all they have wanted to talk about until now. 
   Their policy now is to send the Secretary of Energy abroad with a tin cup, begging at the wells of foreign energy producers, asking them to please turn on their tap. We will know next Monday whether the begging of Bill Richardson and the energy policy of this administration has worked. 
   President Clinton promised early when he came to town that the tax he proposed, $72 billion over 5 years, was going to be fair, it was going to be healthful, it was going to force down dependency on foreign oil, and do the right things for consumers. In fact, it would have unfairly punished energy-intensive States such as mine, Western States where transportation needs and movements spread across broad expanses in agricultural States such as mine. The American Petroleum Insurance Institute and the National Association of Manufacturers predicted the tax would hurt exports, reduce GDP in this country by $38 billion, and destroy some 700,000 jobs. 
   Yet the administration wouldn't listen. They drove on, pushing the tax issue. 
   Clinton and Gore claimed the tax was needed to balance the budget and fund large new spending programs to offset the negative impact of the tax. They also claimed the use of crude oil imports would fall dramatically, by 400,000 barrels a day. 
   At that time, DOE's own projections predicted the tax would shave oil import growth by less than one-tenth after 10 years. DOE predicted by the year 2000, Americans would depend on foreign oil for three-fifths of their total crude oil requirements. 
   The American Petroleum Institute testified before the Energy Committee on which I sit. It said:  
   ..... even if imports were to fall by the full 400,000 barrels a day claimed by the administration, the cost of $34 billion in lost GDP is excessive relative to other alternatives for improving energy security. Using the administration's optimistic predictions, the cost of the Btu tax works out to be about $230 a barrel.  
   That is right, $230 a barrel. In the end, Congress refused. Thank goodness we listened to the experts. We didn't listen to the politics of the Clinton-Gore administration, and we said no. Hopefully, in the next few days we will also reverse something that was largely a Clinton-Gore initiative and that was the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax that our consumers are now paying. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration's obsession with the use of fossil fuel reduction has actually put us in the position we find ourselves today. What does our President say? On March 7 of this year, he said:  
   Americans should not want them [oil prices] to drop to $10 or $12 again because that ..... takes our mind off the business of ..... alternative fuels, energy conservation, reducing the impact of all of this on global warming.  
   Mr. President, we should not take our minds off energy conservation. That is good policy. We should not take our minds off alternative fuels, that is also good policy. But saying you are going to tax hydrocarbons out of existence and now finding this Nation pushing itself into an inflationary mode, finding our costs going up dramatically because of your policies, it was wrongheaded then and it is wrongheaded now. And we know it. 
   What has happened since 1993? Domestic oil production is down 17 percent. Domestic crude oil consumption is up 14 percent. Dependence on foreign oil sources of crude oil has risen to 56 percent of our total crude requirements. 
   In 1973, during the Arab oil embargo, our dependence on foreign crude was 36 percent of our crude oil requirement. 
   Iraq is our fastest growing source for U.S. crude imports, about 700,000 barrels a day. I have one thing to say to the President: Shame on you. Shame on you for the absence of policy and the clear knowledge that you had, that all of us had, that this kind of dependency would ultimately result if we did not push and we did not drive toward a more effective domestic policy to increase production and find all the other effective conservation uses we could find. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration, while making much of the increase in efficiency, greater use of renewables from biomass, and other things, ignores the very fundamental fact that a large part of our energy use cannot be addressed by these measures. 
   Sure, it is an important part of the blend but a very small percentage of what is absolutely and necessarily needed. 
   Of course, those of us who come from agriculture recognize the importance of crude oil feed stocks to the chemical industry and the products they produce, which results in the high quality of agriculture production in our country. The administration fails to encourage domestic oil production and the production of coal and natural gas that now leads us to this point. 
   The administration has refused to acknowledge the vast reserves of oil and gas offshore, in Alaska and the Rocky Mountain overthrust area. Of course, we, the consumers, are now paying the price. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration recently announced a ban on future exploration on most of the Federal Outer Continental Shelf until the year 2012. Can you imagine that? Here we are, increasingly dependent on foreign sources, and the President turns his back on some of the largest reserves left in this country to be explored by some of the finest technology in environmentally sensitive ways that we now know, to bring oil into production in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   In 1996, the administration resorted to the use of the Antiquities Act to lock up 23 billion tons of mineable low-sulfur, high-quality coal in Utah. The story goes on and on. 
   I would argue the Clinton-Gore administration has acted in other ways designed to force us away from the use of all of these resources that are so abundant and so available to us and wise for us to use. At the present rate, we are now demonstrating our unwillingness to produce at the local, national level. We will be 56-percent dependent, moving into 60-percent dependent in very short order.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, earlier today I came to the floor, as did several of my colleagues, to discuss what I believe is now nearing a crisis in our country; that is, the tremendous runup in the price of energy that we have watched for well over 3 months creep up on the reader boards at the local gas station or in fuel bills for those in homes heated with fuel oil. 
   A lot of Americans are scratching their heads and saying: What is happening? Last year, at this time out in  Northern Virginia, I purchased regular gasoline for 78 cents a gallon. There was a bit of a price war going on at that time that probably bid the price down 10 or 12 cents, but there is no question that America's driving public a year ago was paying at least 100 percent less, in some instances, than they are paying today. 
   It is right and reasonable to ask why? What has happened? What happened is obvious to many who watched the energy issue. I serve on the Energy Committee. For the last several years, we have become quite nervous about the fact that we as Americans have grown increasingly dependent on foreign sources of crude oil to fuel the economy of this country. Several speakers on the floor today, and over the past several days, have talked about a dependency that has gone up from 30-plus percent in the 1970s to over 55 percent today for oil flowing in from outside the United States. 
   Why is that happening? Why don't we have a policy stopping it? Why are all these things happening at a time when our economy is doing so well? 
   This morning I joined some of my colleagues to discuss some of the whys. This country, for at least the last 8 years, has been without an energy policy. When the current Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, came to that seat, I asked him in his confirmation hearing: If we don't have an energy program, can't we at least have an energy policy that looks at all aspects of the energy basket--both, of course, crude oil for the hydrocarbons and for all that it provides for our country, a recognition of electrical generation in this country, both nuclear, hydro, and certainly coal fired and oil fired? He assured me that would be the case. 
   Of course, today, that simply isn't the case. In the budgets this Department of Energy has presented to this Congress in the last 2 years, there has been a tremendous increase in the money the Clinton-Gore administration has wanted to allocate for solar and wind, but they have constantly dropped the research dollars on hydro production or clean coal production for the use of coal in the firing of our electrical generating facilities. 
   While all of that has been going on, there has been something else that I find fascinating and extremely disturbing: a progressive effort to lock up exploration and development of our public lands and public areas where the last of our oil reserves exist. The administration has not tried to encourage domestic production. In most instances, they have openly discouraged it or they have set the environmental bar so high that no one company can afford to jump over it. 
   Over the course of the last 5 or 6 years, we have seen a tremendous number of our production companies leave this country. In fact, the CEO of one company sat in my office 5 years ago in a rather embarrassing way saying: Senator, after having been in this country drilling, developing, and producing oil and gas for almost 100 years, my company is being forced to leave the United States if we want to stay profitable or productive. 
   Of course, that company did largely go overseas. That is an American company and they will be producing oil and gas. But they are, in most instances, producing for a foreign government, and they don't control their supply. Most importantly, that supply is not a U.S. supply. It is a foreign supply being brought into this country, dramatically changing our balance of trade. Of course, 
   many of those nations are members of OPEC or are other oil-producing nations that are, in part, causing the problems our consumers are currently experiencing. 
   I have found it fascinating over the last several years as we have watched this administration refuse to acknowledge our vast reserves of oil and gas, offshore, and in Alaska. The Senator from Alaska, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, was on the floor to speak for the last hour about one of the great remaining reserves in northern Alaska that could be tapped, and tapped in a sound and safe environmental way so the beautiful area would not be damaged. Literally, tens of thousands of barrels a day of oil could be produced from that region of our country and brought into the lower 48 to be refined and sold. 
   The Rocky Mountain overthrust belt in my area of the country is largely now off limits to further exploration and production. Yet in the 1970s and the early 1980s a lot of the new domestic production in our country came from the overthrust belt areas of Wyoming and Colorado. 
   We have seen the Clinton administration recently announced a ban on any future exploration of many areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, where some of the largest oil reserves exist today, all in the name of the environment. Even though some of the great new technologies have allowed the kind of development in the Gulf of Mexico and other areas where the chance of a spill is almost nonexistent today. In fact, the greatest concern for a spill is not drilling and development and transfer onshore of crude oil; it is the shipping in the great supertankers from all around the world. That is where the greater risk to our oceans exist, not offshore oil production. Yet this administration, all in the name of the environment, says, no, we will not develop our offshore capabilities. 
   In 1996, the administration resorted to the little-used Antiquities Act. I mentioned that earlier this morning. They made 23 billion tons of low-sulpher mineable coal off limits to production in southern Utah. The U.S. Forest Service issued road construction policies designed to restrict the energy industry's ability to explore for gas and oil on Forest Service lands. The Clinton-Gore administration has vetoed legislation that would have opened the coastal plain, as I mentioned, in the remote Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, where an estimated 16 billion barrels of domestic oil may be found. 
   The administration has ignored a report prepared by the National Petroleum Council requested by the Energy Secretary explaining how the Nation can increase production and use of domestic natural gas resources from about 22 trillion cubic feet per year to more than 30 trillion cubic feet per year over the next 10 to 12 years. 
   Doable? Yes. Environmentally sound? Yes. A clean fuel source? Yes. Then why aren't we doing it? Because we have an administration that is hostile to the idea of actually producing in this country and providing for this country, and their 8 years of record clearly show that. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration has shown little interest in solving these kinds of domestic problems and, as a result, as I mentioned earlier, we have watched our dependence on foreign crude tick up to 56 percent of our total crude demand. The price last year of a barrel of crude was around $10 and peaked last week at somewhere near $34 a barrel. 
   Did we see it coming? You bet we did. Has the administration known it? Yes, they have. On two different occasions, and in two very well-developed reports over the last several years, that message has been so clearly sent to this administration. 
   Why would they ignore it? There are probably a lot of reasons, and I have already expressed some of those reasons why this country cannot use its energy resources. 
   Yesterday, my distinguished friend from West Virginia, Senator ROBERT BYRD, spoke eloquently on the floor on this very subject. Of course, his State of West Virginia is a great coal State, a great producing State. The United States has the world's largest demonstrated coal reserve base and accounts for more than 90 percent of our total fossil energy reserve. In other words, we have more coal than any other country. Yet we have an administration that truly wants to deny the use of it or the development of technologies that will cause it to be burned in an ever increasingly clean way. 
   At the present rate of recovery and use, U.S. coal reserves can last us for more than 270 years. Let me repeat that. For 270 years, we can be self-sufficient at our current level of coal consumption. Of course, we all know the technology that will develop over that period of time that might well make the use of fossil fuels unnecessary at some point in the distant future. 
   Coal is used to generate over 56 percent of our electrical supply and about 88 percent of the Midwest's electrical needs. Coal use for electrical power has risen more than 250 percent since 1970, while sulfur dioxide emissions has decreased to 21 percent below the 1970 level.  
   While there has been a dramatic increase in the use of coal, there has been a dramatic drop in coal-fired emissions. Why? Technology, the application of technology, the kind of combustion technology that has continued to drive down emissions and make continued use of coal economically attractive. 
   Why shouldn't we be putting more research dollars into even better technology? Of course, we should, but it does not show up in this administration's budget. Not at all. They want windmills and solar cells. The last I checked, to provide electricity for Los Angeles with solar energy, one has to cover the whole State of Arizona with solar panels. President Clinton, don't you understand that would be environmentally unsound? It would not make a lot of sense and would not be a very, shall we say, aesthetically valuable thing to do. 
   Somehow they are caught in this mythical illusion: Pop up a solar cell, put a propeller on the end of a stick, tie a generator to it, and the world is going to light up. We simply know that is not the case when it comes to the kinds of energy we need to fuel our households and drive our industries. That kind of energy has to be of large capacity. It has to have the ability to peak and 
    supply our needs during high-demand periods. Of course, it says little for the need of America's farmers and ranchers when they go to the pump this year to find out their energy costs have now doubled. 
   What about nuclear? Nuclear drives 20 percent of our electrical needs, and yet this administration is the most antinuclear administration in the history of this country. They have on every occasion attempted to block the effective storage of nuclear waste, high-level waste, the kind that comes from nuclear generation of electricity. They are basically saying to the electricity industry, the power industry, at least the generating industry: Don't build any more nuclear plants, even though there are no emissions from such plants. If you want to strive to get to the clean air standards that we want in our unattainment areas, you cannot do it any other way than to assure that we at least maintain the 20 percent of our electricity being generated by nuclear power. 
   What does that mean? It means we have to bring newer reactors online, safer reactors with new technology. Yet this administration will not invest in the necessary research. 
   In November of 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency sued several coal-burning utilities claiming they made major modifications in their facilities without applying for new source review permits. Utilities maintain that the modifications fell within the routine maintenance provisions that had been provided and grandfathered into the Clean Air Act in 1990. 
   What kind of a message does a central government send to the generating industries of this Nation? It tells them: We will not stick by the rules; we will not play by the rules; we are interested in politics at this moment, EPA politics, environmental politics; we are not interested in the pocketbooks of the consumer or, more important, the strength of the economy, even though the utility industries are providing ever cleaner sources of energy. 
   EPA is discussing the notion that new-source review should include voluntary regulation of CO2, which is not a poisonous gas and which is not regulated under the Clean Air Act. President Clinton, don't you understand that you cannot keep beating this economy and our energy supplies over the head with these silly notions and expect the economy to remain productive? 
   EPA recently changed the toxic release inventory, or the TRI, to require electric utilities to report chemical release data. The level at which reporting is required for mercury was lowered by an order of magnitude. In making these changes, EPA presented no studies or supporting rationale for why nearby communities should suddenly be concerned about such releases. Nevertheless, the reports will be widely published, thereby placing utilities at the top of the ``dirty'' facilities list. 
   Again I say to the President: From where are you coming? What is the game? Because it appears you are attempting to game this issue. 
   In 1993, EPA staff concluded that coal combustion waste, or fly ash, bottom ash, slag waste, or other combustion products, from electric utility generation do not warrant hazardous waste regulation. Yet, EPA at the behest of the environmental community seems to be about to overrule the staff recommendation. The story goes on and on. 
   Here is the other message. Out in my area of the country, a very large portion of the electric generating capacity comes from hydropower. We dam up rivers and we put generators in the face of the dams and we generate large quantities of renewable clean electricity. 
   Ever since Secretary Babbitt took office, he has been running around the country trying to find a dam to blow up. On numerous occasions, he said: I would like to blow up a really big dam. That is what the Secretary of Interior wants as his legacy. What kind of a legacy is that? I think it is called a cave man 
    mentality legacy. Give everybody a candle and send them to a cave? Come on, Bruce Babbitt. You know the tremendous value of clean hydroelectric generation. Some 15 to 18 percent of our market blend today is hydro. 
   In my area, it is much larger than that. Do we need to modify our dams to save fish? Do we need to make them operate more efficiently with new technology? Absolutely we do. And we are doing that. Already we are putting in new fish-friendly turbines at Bonneville Dam at the lower end of the Columbia River. We are going to work our way up the Columbia-Snake Rivers system and that marvelous hydro facility that fuels the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. No, Mr. Babbitt, we ``ain't'' going to blow up any really big dams. 
   It is going to be kind of refreshing when that man leaves office to leave that silly mentality by the wayside. 
   Technology? Yes, you bet. Bring on the new technology. But shouldn't we be encouraging clean fuel, renewable resource technology of the kind that is so abundant in the West today? 
   I could talk a good deal more about this, but what I hope we accomplish is a reduction in the overall fuel cost of this country by eliminating the 4.3-cent Gore tax. That is right, that is AL GORE'S tax. He is the one who sat in the Chair and broke the tie and caused the tax to become law. I want him to get the credit for raising the cost of energy in this country by that vote. 
   Here is something else I want to close with today that is added frustration as to why this country finds itself increasingly in an energy dilemma. The Clinton-Gore administration embraces the Kyoto Protocol. What is the Kyoto Protocol? It is the misguided result of concern by scientists around the world--and by all of us--that our world may be getting warmer as a result of the generation of greenhouse gases. 
   We all know that we have phenomenal long-term cycles in our country of warming and cooling. Once upon a time ago, there was an ice age. Prior to that, there was a warm period. Those 5,000- to 10,000-year cycles are very evident throughout geologic time. We know, as a fact, we get warmer. We know, as a fact, we get colder. Right now we are getting warmer. 
   The question is, Does the presence of man on the globe and what we are doing to our climate cause us to get warmer or does it cause us to get a little warmer under a normal warming cycle? We don't know that yet. Yet this administration, in the absence of science, and in the full-blown presentation of world environmental politics, said: Let me tell you what we are going to do. We are going to put all kinds of restrictions on the United States and other developed nations. We are going to tax the use of hydrocarbons. We want those lessened in their use. To do that, we are going to drive up the cost. AL GORE thinks the internal combustion engine is a really bad idea. He's said so on numerous occasions. 
   But what they did not recognize was the double kind of impact that would result from driving up the costs through taxes and limiting production at a time when the world was not ready to shift away from conventional forms of energy. 
   The Kyoto Protocol would require the United States to vastly reduce the use of oil, natural gas and coal, and achieve emission reduction standards when, frankly, the rest of the world  would not have to play--or at least the rest of the newly developing world that will be the largest generators of greenhouse gases. 
   Thank goodness this Senate, in July of 1997, stood up, in a very bipartisan way, and said: No, Mr. President. No, Mr. Vice President. Your idea and the protocol is wrongheaded. We are going to stand together as a nation. More importantly, we are going to convince the rest of the world to go with us. If we are going to develop this kind of policy, we will all share equally. 
   What we ought to be doing, with our tremendous talents, is developing the technology for the rest of the world to use to clean up their air and to clean up their water. We should not ask them to sacrifice. We should not ask the people of developing nations to live with less than we have simply because we do not want them to use their resources for the purpose of advancing their economies. Yet that is exactly what this President and this Vice President have said by the proposal of and the endorsement of the Kyoto Protocol. 
   Our Senate said no, on a vote of 95-0. Thank goodness we did. It had a chilling effect. In fact, I have not heard AL GORE mention Kyoto once in the last 6 months. Why? Because he knows he has created a tremendous liability for himself politically, when the American public really understands what would have happened if the protocol had become law, and those kinds of standards and those kinds of taxes had been placed on the American consumer on the eve of a dramatic runup in the cost of crude oil that has resulted from our OPEC neighbors getting their political act together. 
   We will be back next week. Stay tuned. 
   On Monday of this coming week, on the 27th, the OPEC nations meet. Bill Richardson has been running around, all over the world, with his tin cup, begging them to turn on the oil. They turned them off 6, 8 months ago--or turned them down by several millions of barrels of production a day. They may open them a little bit. 
   But my guess is, their goal is to keep crude oil prices well above $20 a barrel, which means the price at the pump will remain high. It may come down some this summer--and I hope it does. I hope we can jawbone them. I hope we can convince them, through good foreign policy, that wise economic policy dictates that they ought to increase production. 
   Yesterday, the House spoke very clearly. It said to the OPEC nations: If we are going to provide for your defense, as we have in the past, maybe you need to help us provide for some of our energy needs. All of that is a part, in combination, of what we ought to be involved in and what we ought to be talking about. I think our consumers would expect nothing less of us because, clearly, energy policy is a Government responsibility in this country, especially if there is policy that is negative in its impact on the ability of the private sector to produce an abundant source of low-cost energy to the consuming public. 
   This is an issue that will not go away because every day, when the consumer goes to the gas pump, and sticks his or her credit card in it, and pulls out 10, 12, 15, 20 gallons of gas, they are going to feel the impact. If you go out to buy new carpeting, if you go out, as a farmer, to buy pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides--all with a hydrocarbon base--you are going to find out that this runup in cost is having a dramatic impact on the economy and, ultimately, could have an impact on the lifestyle of all American citizens. 
   We must act. I hope we act both with short-term and long-term policy that is sensible, environmentally sound, but recognizes that energy abundance in this country has been the key to our tremendous economic successes down through the decades. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join many of my colleagues today in support of S. 2251, the crop insurance reform bill. Senator GRAMS spoke most eloquently on the issue and of its importance. He has certainly led the issue, along with a good many other of our colleagues who brought us to this point of shaping the legislation and bringing it to the floor. 
   I thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator LUGAR, for recognizing the issue and the need for the legislation. While he didn't agree with all that is in S. 2251, he recognized its importance. He recognized the importance of building a compromise, as we were able to do in the committee. 
   At this time, I am proud to join not only the chairman but certainly my good friend, Senator ROBERTS, and Senator KERREY, who really led the issues that are found and embodied in S. 2251. 
   There is no question that reform of the Federal Crop Insurance Program was not only a necessity but it was an obligation. It was a promise that we in the Senate and the House made to America's production agriculture when we moved to the new agricultural policy embodied in the current farm bill, Freedom to Farm. We said not only would we free up individual farmers to produce for the market absent specific Federal programs but we would provide them with the necessary tools to compete. One of them would be a risk management tool--crop insurance--so they could use it against downturns in the market or certain environmental circumstances such as drought, frost, or floods that might impede their ability to produce or destroy the very crop they planted in the ground. 
   We also said we would look at the trade issue, and obviously the sanctions our Government had placed against certain potential markets across the world. We addressed that last year in the Senate. We will address it again this year. If we can pass the sanctions legislation and it becomes law, and if S. 2251 becomes law, then we will have completed a package that was promised a good number of years ago to our farmers and ranchers across this country. 
   The bill before us addresses several concerns farmers in my State and I have had about crop insurance. The bill provides increased subsidies for a greater buy-up of the crop insurance; funding for research and development of specialty crop insurance, which is critically important; removal of the noninsured assistance program, better known as NAP, area trigger which was a true impediment in past Federal crop insurance programs; and several other items. 
   Let me explain the uniqueness of Idaho agriculture. 
   There are sometimes two or three crop components to our large Midwestern agricultural producing areas. Idaho's great agricultural economy is based on minor crops and nontraditional crops. We know about Idaho's potatoes. But we oftentimes don't know about Idaho's winter peas, or our trout, or our seed peas, or our lentils, or our sugar beets, or our barley, or our mint. 
   Many people don't recognize that I have one of the most diverse agricultural counties in the Nation that produces large quantities of seeds for sweet corn, carrots, onions, celery, and all of those kinds of things you would not expect a State such as Idaho to grow, but we do because of our unique environment and our ability to control moisture through irrigation, and, as a result, creating the ideal situation for the growing of some of these seed crops. These are all minor crops and high-value crops that are sensitive to certain environmental or market downturns. 
   Current Federal crop insurance does not always provide for them. This legislation not only provides for the research to move us in that area, but it removes the NAP area trigger that was very prohibitive. 
   That is why I have worked with Senator KERREY and Senator ROBERTS to include a provision to reform the Noninsured Assistance Program, or NAP, in this amendment. NAP is used by farmers who grow these ``specialty'' or ``minor'' crops across our Nation. This legislation removes the area trigger and makes it a much more workable proposition for farmers in my State. 
   I often hear from farmers who are frustrated that crop insurance does not exist for our many specialty crops. It is why my farmers don't use it at the rate other producers across the country do. 
   This legislation should move us in the direction of creating another risk management tool for Idaho's agricultural production. I hope we can accomplish that. This legislation specifically encourages the development of specialty crop produce and allows the risk management agency to partner with entities to develop new crop insurance products. The bill also inverts the subsidy formula to make higher levels of coverage more affordable to farmers. These changes will speed new products to the market and make crop insurance a real risk management tool. These changes will help farmers protect crops against the disasters that oftentimes hit. 
   I once farmed and ranched. I remember one day standing at the window of my farm and ranch home watching a hailstorm wipe out 200 acres of the most beautiful barley crop I had ever raised. But I was fearful that year that we were going to have hailstorms, and this was a unique crop. This was a seed crop, and a high-volumn crop because it was a new, hydrosized barley. I had it insured. While I was rather fearful of the destruction of crop, as I watched it, I also knew I had protected my investment. I had done the right thing. It was a tool that was available in the market at that time, and it was affordable. 
   That was 25 years ago. Today, that tool doesn't exist at the level of affordability that it did in those days. As a result, farmers have walked away from crop insurance and have oftentimes during disastrous circumstances simply turned toward Washington to say to those of us who serve here: Help us. 
   What we are saying today with this legislation on the floor of the Senate is: Agriculture, help yourself. We are providing you with the ultimate of risk management tools, so you should not have to rely on a Federal Government to bail you out of a circumstance that is beyond your control. We give you the option, and we want you to use the option, providing for yourself as a stand-alone, private entrepreneurial entity of this economy. 
   This bill, however, provides a provision that concerns me, and it concerns the cattle producers of my State. The provision is federally-subsidized revenue insurance for livestock production. This could disrupt markets by masking market signals and create dependency on subsidies that could stimulate overproduction and create perverse incentives for producers who are striving to make sound, market-oriented management decisions. 
   The livestock industry of our Nation has never turned to the Federal Government to help them. They have received in situations of drought sometimes feed assistance, but there has been no program in the past that simply provided a level of stability to their income as has been true of other commodities produced by the agricultural sector. They are inherently worried about a Federal program that might create or cause market incentives that are not true to the livestock or beef industry market. 
   The beef industry is recovering now from a market downturn of the past few years. Relative to other segments of agriculture, the beef industry works unobstructed by Government pricing and direct payments to producers and other controls. This allows beef producers to make decisions about their own enterprises without having to worry about what Congress will do about the program or to the program. Cattle ranchers tell me they like it that way although it is sometimes very tough. I would like to see the beef industry continue down the path toward an open market approach, unstifled by any form of government involvement in their situation. 
   I hope in conference with the House we might work out this livestock provision in a way that will not create a preferred market incentive.  
   In my view, S. 2251 does the most for specialty crops and minor crop insurance of any proposal I have seen to date. Once again, I want to thank Senator ROBERTS, Senator KERREY, Senator LUGAR, and others who have directed a tremendous amount of their energy to resolving the issue of Federal crop insurance by presenting the legislation now before the Senate. I hope we will have a sizable vote on it tomorrow and that we can move it to conference with the House to work out our differences and put it on the President's desk at the earliest possible date. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am pleased to come to the floor this afternoon with my colleagues from Maine and Arkansas and others who are here to discuss the Senate's consideration of H.R. 5. 
   It is an interesting moment for me because when I first came to Congress in 1981, one of the first pieces of legislation I cosponsored was the elimination of the earnings limit test on those seniors who were taking Social Security and, as we know, limited in the amount of money they could earn at that point in time. 
   In 1983, the Congress decided, along with then Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, and President Ronald Reagan, that an entire reform of the Social Security system was necessary and that there should be a substantial tax increase to create solvency in the Social Security system. It seemed reasonable to me and my colleagues in the House at that moment; why should we not encourage those who were retiring and taking their Social Security benefits at age 62 or 65 to go on and earn an income beyond the Social Security benefit and pay into the system. 
   We were still caught in the Depression-era mentality that somehow you took an older person and shooed them away from the labor market by some kind of, what I called, perverse incentive; that is, we will tax you out of the labor market if you choose to be a productive citizen in it. As a result, we did not put the reform into Social Security in 1983 as we should have. 
   We know Social Security today is very solvent. It is solvent as a result of that 1983 initiative that was a bipartisan effort on the part of the House and the Senate. 
   The reform we are here to discuss today is one that was clearly debated at that time and denied, denied by a Congress that was still under the control of groups in this country that had dominated labor policy for years and believed that at age 65 you left the labor force and went into retirement and some younger person took your slot. They had failed to recognize that economies expand and grow; If you treat an economy right, there is not only always need for new hires, but there is oftentimes a tremendous demand for the kind of knowledge, what I call institutional knowledge, that older workers bring to the workplace. Of course, we know that is very much the case today. 
   I guess my mother would probably have called me strong willed in my youth. That was a polite way of saying I was bullheaded. I would persist, if I could, until I won the issue in which I was interested. 
   Over the years, I and others of the House and the Senate have persisted. Every year, we went out and introduced the earnings limitation elimination. Every year, we were either defeated or the appropriate committees simply would not recognize it. That was through the 1980s and the early 1990s. Of course, as we know, the economy in large part has dramatically changed. 
   During that period of time, my father considered retiring from the farming and ranching business in his midsixties. He found it was of no value to do so because he would have denied himself a substantially larger income than he could have ever received from Social Security. So it wasn't until after age 72, when the earnings limitation did not apply, that my father and my parents, along with a good many other seniors in our country who were self-employed and who were clearly entitled to receive Social Security benefits, simply denied themselves the benefit because they couldn't afford to take it. They waited until much later in life to decide to retire or, as my dad said, slow down a little bit to 12-hour workdays instead of 18-hour workdays, which was quite typical of his generation in the labor force. Now, at age 84, he still thinks a 12-hour workday is a modest effort for any one individual to make in his or her contribution to society. I say that with a bit of jest, but it is very true of that workforce. 
   It was only at that time I think they recognized that my persistency, along with others of my colleagues in trying to eliminate the earnings requirement, was the right and appropriate thing to do. 
   So we were saying to seniors, age 65 through 69, they could only continue to earn up to a certain limit, $17,000 a year, while receiving the full benefits of Social Security. But for every additional $3 of earnings beyond that limit, the Government reduced their benefit by $1--in other words, again, still penalizing them, still saying: We want you out of the workforce. Even if you are healthy, even if you are productive and can be a major contributor to the workforce, get out, if you want to receive the full benefits of the Social Security system that you had paid into all of your productive life and that you were certainly entitled to receive.  
   Well, as we have worked this issue over the last decade, one thing has changed. The President, for example, instead of expressing open opposition, is now saying this is a bill he will sign. As my colleagues from Arkansas and Maine have said the House, in almost a unanimous vote, declared their support for H.R. 5 in the last several weeks. I think the Senate will respond in kind this week. 
   I have set forth a lot of the reasons it is important. It is fundamentally important because it is fair. That is the No. 1 reason we ought to be doing it. It is fair for an individual who has paid into the system all of his or her productive life, at age 62 or 65, to gain those benefits and go on to continue to work if they wish. 
   Do we say to a young Federal employee who has vested his or herself in the retirement program of the Federal system and who chooses to step out and gain those benefits that they can't go on working? Do we say that to a military retiree? In fact, quite the opposite--we expect them to go on working. 
   Now, of course, as our seniors live longer and find out that some of their retirement benefits are simply not enough and they are outliving them, there is not just the accommodation of fairness to a senior in the workplace, there is the accommodation of necessity. 
   Many of our seniors find it necessary to work beyond age 65 to provide for themselves, to try to sustain the lifestyle they had when they were once full employees at a different period in their lives. So a combination of other forces is now working out there. I am proud that, as a Republican, I and many of my colleagues have worked over the last several years to change the character of the workplace, to recognize the flexibility that is necessary in a new and very different world from 1935, or 1945, or 1955, or 1965, or 1975, or even 1985. 
   We know that the workplace of the year 2000 is even different than the workplace of 1995. Now both spouses are working. Now we offer flexibility in kind. Now we allow people to stay home and work from their homes as major contributors in the workforce, and we offer flextime, and so forth. Yet we have said this up until now to a senior at the appropriate age of receiving full benefits from the Social Security system: If you go out and find a job, you can only earn up to a certain limitation and beyond that we will penalize you substantially until you are probably old enough not to want to work anymore, and then you can have the full benefits even if you do work. 
   Shame on us. Shame on a Congress and a Government that has held that policy as long as we have. Now, of course, as my colleague from Arkansas states, this is the longest sustained period of near full employment that our country has seen in decades. Now we need the senior in the workforce more than ever, for all of the right kinds of reasons. As the House has spoken, I hope the Senate will speak in a unanimous vote and that we can send this to the President and say: Mr. President, the Congress of the United States is ready to knock down the decades-old law that no longer fits the American workforce or the American culture--if it ever did. And we have done this in a unanimous way. 
   That is the kind of expression I hope the Senate will make this week. The House has already spoken. I think that is probably due to my persistence, along with many colleagues over the past decade and a half; we have argued that this is something that is right and fair, in the first instance, and now is a combination of necessity, in the second instance, as the culture and economy of this country have changed significantly over the period of time in which this provision has been a part of the labor and Social Security laws of our country. 
   Madam President, I will proudly vote for H.R. 5 and encourage all of my colleagues to do the same. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there are few duties of the Senate more important than the confirmation of nominees to positions on the federal bench. 
   It is my strong belief that the qualifications of the nominees must be weighed carefully and deliberately, no matter what level of the court system the nominee is supposed to join. 
   My decision on a judicial nominee's fitness is based on my evaluation of three criteria: character, competence and judicial philosophy--that is, how the nominee views the duty of the court and its scope of authority. This is the original role of the judiciary: neither rubber-stamping legislative decisions, nor overreaching to act as substitute legislators. I have heard from citizens complaining about the harm done by social activists of the bench--harm that may only be reversed by an extraordinary action on the part of the legislative branch, if at all. 
   It is exactly this aspect of the nomination before us that concerns me. I have reviewed the background materials on Judge Paez, and I cannot ignore the nominee's penchant for imposing his own political vision on the case before him. 
   Judge Paez has shown, on more than one occasion, his activist judicial philosophy. He was quoted in the Los Angeles Daily Journal as saying: ``I appreciate the need of the courts to act when they must, when the issue has been generated as a result of the failure of the political process to resolve a certain political question........There is no choice but for the courts to resolve the question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through the legislative process.'' 
   That is as clear a statement of judicial activism as I have ever heard. 
   On another occasion, Judge Paez demonstrated that his politics were more important than the appearance of judicial impartially and independence. In a 1995 speech he attacked California Proposition 187 (to end assistance to illegal immigrants) as anti-Latino ``discrimination and hostility'' and Proposition 209 (to end racial and gender preferences in California) as anti-civil rights. What strikes me is that, at the time, both propositions were subject of pending litigation. Clearly the Judicial Code of Conduct prohibits a judge from such comments. 
   Even if these were the only incidents of this kind, they would weigh heavily with me. But Judge Paez' record contains a number of other troubling episodes. In the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival case, Judge Paez ruled that a Los Angeles city ordinance--prohibiting aggressive panhandling at specified public places and passed in response to the death of a young man who refused to give a panhandler 25 cents--was unconstitutional under California's constitution. He affirmed that this law constituted ``content-based discrimination'' because it applied only to people soliciting money and consequently granted an injunction to prevent it from being enforced. However, apart from Los Angeles where the ordinance has yet to be enforced, the same law has been ``peacefully'' upheld in other parts of California by other federal judges. 
   The position expressed by Judge Paez was well out of the mainstream. This became even clearer last week, when the Supreme Court of California, asked by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to rule on the merits of Paez' holding, held that the Los Angeles ordinance was constitutional and valid. 
   I have also been troubled about the implications and consequences of the Unocal decision issued by Judge Paez in 1997, in which he ruled that American companies can be held liable for human rights abuses committed by the foreign governments or overseas companies owned by the foreign governments with which they do business. This decision leaves open a wide range of issues and has the potential to cause significant consequences in the U.S. and world markets, not to mention U.S. foreign policy. 
   It is not surprising that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has expressed its opposition to the nomination of Judge Paez to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in view of the decision's potential impact on international commerce. At a minimum, Judge Paez pushed the limits of prior law in this ruling--but this decision takes on a great deal more significance in light of his prior statements and other judgments. This is a judge who is ready, willing, and able to act on an opportunity to open new frontiers in the law. 
   I share the concerns that many of my colleagues have raised about the structure of the ninth circuit itself. It covers 38 percent of the area of the Nation and serves more than 50 million people, 20 million more than any other circuit. It has 28 authorized judgeships, 11 more than any other circuit. I am one of the majority of Senators representing that circuit who believe it should be split. 
   The ninth circuit remains, as the New York Times labeled it, ``the country's most liberal appeals court'' and a circuit out of the mainstream of American jurisprudence. 
   Over the past six years, the Supreme Court has reversed nearly 90 percent of the ninth circuit cases it has reviewed: in 1997-98, the reversal rate was 96 percent (27 out of 28 decisions) and 35 percent of the decisions reviewed by the Supreme Court were from the ninth circuit. 
   It has been suggested that the ninth circuit has difficulty developing and maintaining coherent and consistent law because, as the size of the unit increases, the opportunities the court's judges have to sit together and to develop a close, continual, collaborative decision making decrease. Of course, this would increase the risk of intracircuit conflicts since judges are unable to monitor each other's decisions and very seldom have the chance to work together. 
   In any event, my constituents and other citizens in the ninth circuit would hardly be well served by adding yet another liberal judicial activist to the current mix. Whether or not Congress ultimately addresses the circuit's problems by agreeing to the split I am advocating, this Senate should not exacerbate the problems with this ill-advised nomination. 
   I know the administration must take the best case possible for its nominees, but they cannot expect this Senator to ignore ``the other part of the story.'' Judge Paez' record reflects an eagerness to use his authority to accomplish social change and a disrespect for principles of judicial decision making. In sum, I strongly believe it would be a mistake to advance Judge Paez to the ninth circuit, and I will vote against his confirmation.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize teachers across America for the vital work they do. I come from a family of educators, so I have seen firsthand the impact teachers have on children. They do this because they care about each and every child they teach. These public servants deserve our gratitude and thanks. 
   While I believe this can be said of all teachers, I would like to recognize one particular teacher today who embodies this sentiment. She is Nancy Larsen, of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and she was chosen by my state as Educator of the Year. 
   One look at her career shows why she was chosen as the Educator of the Year. She has dedicated eight years of her life to teaching the second grade, and these eight years have been full of innovation and a real love for education. Not only has she been busy in the classroom, she has also found time for activities which broaden her knowledge and make her a better teacher. For example, she has published articles in magazines such as Learning and Portals: A Journal of the Idaho Council International Reading Association. She has also designed and presented numerous workshops in the past five years, and participates in many professional organizations, including serving as President of the Panhandle Reading Council. 
   While these activities are important, her classroom work is what truly sets her apart. For example, she actively seeks to involve parents in her students' education, realizing that parental involvement is key for scholastic success. Her weekly letters on students' activities, her project, ``Family Math Night,'' are further examples of her commitment to parents as computer and classroom helpers. There have been many studies which show that parental involvement increases children's ability to learn. Nancy know this from her first day on the job, and has worked to make this involvement a reality. 
   Her students adore her and her peers respect her. This is what every teacher strives for, and Nancy has earned this respect. As one of her students said, ``I'm really glad to have such a nice teacher.'' 
   As you can see, Nancy Larsen is truly a treasure for her school, for Idaho, and indeed for the Nation in general. Teachers like Nancy make education a rewarding experience for students and parents alike. I am proud that the state of Idaho chose her as its Teacher of the Year. She is a great example for the rest of the state and the Nation, and I hope this award gives her a platform so she can help other teachers to have the same success she has.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues and to acknowledge the leadership of Senator BOND in introducing the Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act of 2000. 
   Congress has repeatedly demonstrated strong support for adoption.  I think there is a clear consensus here that adoption is a positive experience--for children needing homes, for birth parents, and for adoptive parents, not to mention for society at large. In recent years, we have shaped federal policies so that they do more to help waiting children find permanent, loving families. 
   Now we have an opportunity to bring home our advocacy for adoption. 
   The Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act follows the lead of a growing number of private sector businesses in establishing an adoption benefit for employees. It is well known that family-friendly workforce policies help attract and retain qualified workers. While adoption benefits generate considerable good will and loyalty among employees, they cost little for employers, because they are relatively rarely used. Yet in view of what continues to be a huge price tag for adoption--in the tens of thousands of dollars--these benefits can truly make a difference in helping an employee choose this option for creating or expanding a family. 
   By implementing these policies for federal workers, we can underscore our strong message of support for adoption and encourage more private sector employers to do likewise. At the same time, we will be improving the competitiveness of the federal government in recruiting good workers and helping to increase current workers' job satisfaction and commitment. 
   The benefit that could be provided by the Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act is by no means lavish, but it compares favorably with similar benefits in the private sector. This policy will be good for workers, good for the federal government, good for taxpayers, and--most important--good for the more than 100,000 children in this country who are eligible for adoption today but still awaiting a permanent, loving family. 
   I congratulate Senator BOND for bringing this initiative to the Senate and encourage all our colleagues to join us in working to pass this important legislation.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Seniors' Security Act of 2000--a bill that will address the growing problem of prescription drug coverage for senior citizens. 
   As we are all aware, seniors' access to prescription drugs is an important issue. Currently, traditional fee-for service Medicare covers few drugs for seniors. At the same time, however, prescription drugs are an increasing component of seniors' health care. For these reasons, I believe that it is time Congress worked to increase American seniors' access to prescription drugs. 
   The Senior's Security Act of 2000 will increase seniors' access to prescription drugs in two ways. First, it will extend tax equity to seniors by allowing them to deduct the cost of health insurance that contains a qualified prescription drug benefit. We already provide such favorable tax treatment for employer-provided health insurance and are moving toward doing so for the self-employed. If we are truly concerned about seniors' access to prescription drugs, we should do the same for them. 
   In addition, SSA 2000 will also allow both current and future seniors to deduct the cost of long-term care insurance from their taxes and make long-term care insurance available through employer-provided flexible spending accounts (FSAs). 
   SSA 2000 also provides for the design by National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) of additional Medigap policies in order to make prescription drug coverage more accessible and affordable. This process follows that which produced the existing Medigap policies. SSA 2000 also directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to analyze and report on the salient issues in the design of prescription drug benefit policies. MedPAC is directed to issue their findings in a June 1, 2000 report to Congress and the NAIC in order to aid in designing new Medigap policies. 
   I believe SSA 2000 will make prescription drug coverage cheaper, both directly and indirectly. More than 18 million seniors have an income tax liability that can be reduced by this reform; by increasing the number of participants and making new Medigap policies a available, the bill will indirectly reduce the cost of coverage, as well. Unlike some other proposed reform measures in this area, it preserves and strengthens the private insurance market--it contains no mandates, no price controls, and preserve all existing Medigap policies--rather than jeopardizing or eliminating it. 
   This bill does not attempt to address the issue of prescription drug coverage for every senior; instead, it is the answer for a portion of the senior population who have been paying at least part of the costs for their health care and prescription drugs, but still need and deserve to have a reduction in their out-of-pocket expenses. The Seniors' Security Act of 2000 is the best way to provide relief to this group of seniors, while at the same time continuing to work towards solutions for those seniors who aren't as economically secure.

   Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, thank you very much. I am extremely pleased to be able to come to the floor this afternoon to join my colleague in support of S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act. 
   A few moments ago, I was in our TV studio cutting a tape, as many of us oftentimes do, to send back to our constituents or to speak out on a given issue in which a group has asked us to become involved. I was cutting a tape on a project that is a nationwide project called Safe Place. You have probably seen that triangular, yellow sign that shows a child inside that is on the glass or door of a small business, a fire station, or a city hall. It says ``Safe Place,'' and designates that particular location as ready to receive a child in crisis, a child who has had a crisis within its home or with its peers in the community and feels at risk and therefore seeks a safe sanctuary, a haven. 
   I have also asked our colleagues to support the third week of March for the second year in a row as National Safe Place Week. 
   The reason I say that in the context of the Affordable Education Act is that we Americans recognize the value of our young people. We recognize they are without question our most important asset and that we have a fundamental responsibility to them as a culture and as a society. 
   When I speak about Safe Place, that is one of the first things we think of as a parent and as a community. Are our children safe within our homes, safe within our suburbs, or safe within our communities? The next thing we begin to think about after their safety is their well-being beyond safety. I think we all recognize that beyond safety comes education as a major part of a child's well-being; therefore, early on as a country we began to establish a general educational system so that all of our young people could be more educated and more prepared than the generation before them. 
   Education has become a profound part of all levels of our government. While we recognize education is still the primary responsibility of State and local units of government, we have also said the family unit has as its major responsibility not only the haven of safety and security but the responsibility of assuring its young people an education and that we in government would help facilitate that, we would help make that happen. But most important is to empower the parent and the family in a way that allows them to bring on that fundamental and basic responsibility of providing for their children and their education.

I stand before you today with a new bill that will restore $500 million to the School Lunch Program. The positive impacts of this program are endless. Children should not have to pay the price of not having enough money for food. 
   Originally enacted in 1946, the school lunch program set goals to improve children's nutrition, increase low-income children's access to nutritious meals, and to help support the agricultural industry. A family of four has to have an income at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level to qualify for a free lunch. The income for these families is tragically low. Congress has a role in providing these children with assistance their families cannot provide. 
   Last year, Congress enacted the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act. This legislation amended the School Lunch Act to require the United States Department of Agriculture to count the value of bonus commodities when it determines the total amount of commodity assistance provided to schools. This change will result in a $500 million budget cut for the school lunch program over a nine-year period. 
   In FY1998, the school lunch program comprised over 90 percent of schools, with some 90,000 schools enrolling 46.5 million children. Children receiving free lunches averaged 13 million a day, and those receiving reduced price lunches averaged 2.2 million a day. Each state and millions of children are affected. This program provides a basic requirement of food for needy children. 
   No child should be without food. The Emergency Commodity Distribution Act of 2000 would ensure that schools receive the full value of entitlement commodity assistance, and allow the School Lunch Program to continue to meet its dual purpose of supporting American agriculture while providing nutritious food to schools across the country. I urge members to support this bill, support children, and support our future.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise to propose a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress regarding the responsibility of the United States in guaranteeing the security and passage of vessels through the Panama Canal. 
   The Panama Canal Treaty and the Treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal were a battle fought and lost before my time in the Congress of the United States. However, we still have an obligation to the world, our allies, and the people of the United States to ensure that the Panama Canal will remain open, secure, and neutral in providing safe passage to vessels of all nations. 
   These treaties with Panama gave the United States the option of continuing our presence in Panama beyond 2000. This option must be exercised! The United States needs to retain a presence in Panama to ensure a measure of power projection capability in an area of vital national interest to our economy, our freedoms, and our way of life. 
   Mr. President, this extension of our presence in Panama is also consistent with the intent of Congress. The 1979 Panama Canal Act, which incorporated the treaty into United States law, included a sense of the Congress resolution that the ``best interests of the United States require that the President enter into negotiations with the Republic of Panama for the purpose of arranging for the stationing of United States military forces after the termination of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977.'' 
   Panama agreed to these terms in 1979. Since this time, both sides have been working on an agreement to define our future presence, but progress on this effort stalled in early 1998. 
   The current administration's policy in the region is a legacy of missed opportunities, including their failure to negotiate a continued United States presence in Panama. There exists a dire need for a stabilizing presence which the United States has brought to the region since World War II. Although the traditional threat of a foreign naval attack on the Canal has virtually disappeared, the United States still needs to be able to project military power in the region. The unprecedented upsurge in political instability and state-sponsored terrorism that the United States now faces makes it necessary to provide rapid troop and logistical transit through the Canal. The need to conduct surveillance or to pursue actual and potential adversaries also requires immediate access to the Canal. Such possibilities make it essential that the United States retain a measure of conventional military presence in the region. 
   There are many other reasons for the United States to retain a presence in Panama: First, the United States conducts a number of humanitarian and civil-military programs throughout the region. These missions have been greatly benefitted in the past with lower transportation costs and greater efficiency afforded by centralized logistics within the region. Second, as we all know, Panama is located in the center of a major drug transit corridor. Anti-drug operations will continue to be a critical feature of United States policy in the region. Third, with the issue of military readiness, the Jungle Operations Training Center at Fort Sherman provided unequaled facilities for training in low-intensity warfare. Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Frederick C. Smith stated that this and other sites ``will be difficult to replicate elsewhere.'' Last, 65 to 80 percent of the Panamanian people favor United States involvement in the region. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, we need to send a decisive message to the current administration to renew negotiations for security arrangements and a continued United States presence in the region. And the United States Government should make it clear to the world that the Panama Canal will remain free, open, and neutral, and any indications to the contrary will be considered as an act of war against the people of the United States.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to invite my colleagues to join me in sponsoring a resolution designating the week beginning March 12, 2000 as ``National Safe Place Week.'' This resolution supports the successful Project Safe Place program and encourages its growth. This resolution promotes a program that improves the quality of life for young people across the nation without depleting social service funds or instituting new government programs whose success is unsure. Project Safe Place makes use of programs already in place, seeks to bring families together by helping them resolve their conflicts. and does not reach into the taxpayer's pocket. 
   The National Network for Youth estimates that more than two million young people run away from home each year. Increasing numbers of teens and even children are also being turned away from their homes by disinterested or frustrated parents. On the street, these youth are likely to resort to using drugs, prostitution and other criminal behavior or survive. They are more vulnerable to physical or sexual violence, and they are more likely to commit suicide. Without help, their future is bleak and frightening. 
   Project Safe Place is designated to assist young people and families who face difficult situations. The problems vary from one individual to the other. Some young people ask Safe Place for assistance because they frequently find themselves in hour-long screaming matches with their parents. Others go because they are beaten and mentally  abused at home. Sometimes they have a parent who is addicted to drugs or alcohol. All the young people who find Safe Places have in common an overwhelming need to improve their home life. 
   The program works by creating a network of businesses and public locations that display the bright yellow, diamond-shaped Safe Place logo in their windows or on other highly visible places on the front of their buildings. Businesses and locations such as convenience stores, fire stations, libraries, and fast food restaurants are effective Safe Places because they are found throughout the community and they tend to be easily accessible. Also, young people are more likely to ask for help in familiar, non-threatening places. In most cases, it is easier for a young person to find a convenience store and walk into it than it is for him or her to track down a social services agency, travel to it and then brave the intimidation of walking through its doors. 
   The employees at Safe Places are trained to act as a link to help. At the Safe Place they make sure youth who ask for help are taken into the back of the store or restaurant, away from people who may know them and question them later. The employee immediately notifies a shelter. The shelter sends a volunteer counselor to talk to the youth, offer advice and evaluate the problem. The volunteer, who is the same gender as the young person, will transport the youth to the shelter if more counseling is necessary or if the young person would like a safe place to stay. If the youth decides to stay at the shelter, parents will be notified that the young person is all right. 
   Project Safe Place is a national program that operates locally. It is a unique collaborative effort between youth service agencies, a network of volunteers and local businesses to make help available to youth quickly and in their own neighborhood. Safe Place aims to return young people to a healthy emotional environment. That could mean seeing that the family receives counseling or that could mean finding a place outside the house for the youth to live. 
   In addition to enhancing outreach programs to area youth, the distinct Safe Place signs increase awareness of the plight of troubled youths. They remind adults of problems in the community and often inspire people to volunteer. They demonstrate to businesses that the private sector can play a positive role and usually lead to more Safe Place sites. 
   Since its beginning in Louisville, Kentucky in 1983, acknowledgment of Project Safe Place has been crucial to letting young people know that the service is available to them and inspiring others to create more Safe Places. In March 1998, many Senators helped pass Senate Resolution 96, making the third week to March 1998 ``National Safe Place Week.'' Since then, sites grew from 6,000 to 8,000. Today, more than 30,000 young people and their families have been helped. Even if your state is not one of the 34 that has at least one Safe Place, the program has probably still affected your state. It is likely that a runaway from your state has been returned to his or her family through this program. Counseling initiated by the program may have involved a parent who lives in your state. 
   My goal is to have at least one Safe Place in every state by the end of the decade. I urge all my colleagues to champion this plan and to begin by cosponsoring this resolution making the second week of March ``National Safe Place Week.'' The designation of time is a crucial step in promoting awareness of this effective program. Your support will help continue the valuable partnership between government and the private sector as we move toward a society with happier and safe young people.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning National Potato Lovers Month. 
   It is whispered that February is the month for lovers. Well, Idahoans know that better than most Americans. You see, February is National Potato Lovers Month. That means that the ``eyes'' of the nation are upon the great state of Idaho. 
   Our spuds come in all shapes, sizes, and varieties, but they all have homegrown a-peel: Hot taters, big taters, little taters--even tater tots. Spuds all over the state of Idaho chip-in to put our best side up during National Potato Lovers Month. 
   Potatoes are truly an ``all-American'' food. In fact, instead of apple pie, it would be more accurate to say something is as ``American'' as the potato. Potatoes were first pulled from the ground in the New World, whereas apple pie originated in Europe. As early as 200 B.C., Inca Indians used potatoes to prevent indigestion and rheumatism, and used their growing cycles to measure time. During the 19th century, the American food was planted in Ireland, where its popularity surged. In fact, the Irish soon learned they couldn't live without potatoes. When Irish potato crops failed for three years, eight million people died. 
   Later in the 19th century, Irish immigrants popularized potatoes in America. They eventually discovered the promised land for potatoes--Idaho. Our state has the cool and moist climate that grows perfect spuds. 
   The only hiccup in America's steady consumption of potatoes came in the 1950's. First, instant convenience foods hit the market, and then a fad diet mistakenly identified potatoes as fattening. But when the tuber's true traits were told, potatoes joined the ranks of other processed foods. 
   Spuds have a long and cultivated history that includes the political stage. Politics and the potato met long ago, when Thomas Jefferson served spuds at White House dinners to special guests. And politics and the potato met again when Dan Quayle accidentally gave the country--and himself--a spelling lesson, making Dan Quayle a true ``hot potato.'' 
   The potato continues its appetizing presence in the political arena. We here in the Senate might disagree, but we usually stop short of calling each other half-baked. And, because we know there is more than one way to skin a potato, we generally manage to unearth solutions. 
   To celebrate National Potato Lovers Month, I'll be sending each of my colleagues a sampling of the world's best spuds--Idaho potatoes.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor this afternoon and support the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in an effort he has led for a good number of years. I have participated with him in trying to bring some reasonable resolution to the issue of a permanent repository for the high-level nuclear radioactive waste of this country. 
   Mr. President, this debate will proceed. It is my understanding we have a vote tomorrow morning. Already we have heard a variety of opinions on the process used to deal with the issue of high-level nuclear waste. Without question, this is an issue that Congress has dealt with over the years in which the public has had to go through more misstatements, false statements, or emotional statements about what isn't  true or what some wished might be true. All we can do is look at the scientific and engineering facts of the history of the management of nuclear waste in our country to say that this country, about 99.9 percent of the time, has done it right and not exposed their citizenry to the mismanagement of the storage of waste. 
   Yes, we have learned periodically of the handling of radioactive materials where mistakes were made and immediately corrected. However, our country has a positive legacy in nearly all instances of dealing with this issue. 
   The Senator from Alaska and I have brought different versions of this issue to the floor over the last 4 years as we have tried to force this administration to move responsibly following the enactment of a law in 1982 that was a long-term approach toward funding and establishing a permanent geologic repository. We are now at a time when the issue of radiation release standards at what may become the permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain has been largely the focus of what this legislation deals with. 
   It think it is important to put the debate in the context of what is happening under current law, not under the legislation, under the law as it stands today. 
   My purpose in describing the current situation is to explore with my colleagues what I believe is a problem with EPA's current path and for my colleagues to understand why I have reservations about the games that are currently being played. 
   My frustration with EPA is that sometimes their science is rolled up in politics. 
   Let me also be clear about what is at stake. I firmly believe, if Congress does nothing on this issue, what is at stake is the viability of geologic disposal. In other words, to me this issue is larger than the site at Yucca Mountain. It is about whether or not we will be able to site and license a geologic repository anywhere in our country. 
   It is not by accident that legislatively we picked Yucca Mountain years ago. It was not done with a crystal ball. It was done with some reasonable knowledge that the geology of the region might well hold up and would probably be a point of isolation of the kind we would want for a repository, compared with no other place in the Nation. That has still held up and remains true today. 
   I do not believe the current process for setting radiation standards in dealing with this is what I would hope we would have. It is not being informed by good science, and I hope that Congress will bring good science back into the process. That is why this legislation is very important. 
   The chairman's original bill, S. 1287, contained the remedy of giving authority to set radiation standards to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Why? Credibility. Honesty, no politics, in large part, and a historic standard of doing it with the kind of science and knowledge that you want to have to make these kind of decisions. 
   The chairman's substitute bill has a different remedy. EPA would still set the radiation standards but only in consultation with the NRC and the National Academy of Sciences. 
   I wish EPA were not setting those standards. I don't think they have the scientific knowledge or credibility to do so, although we have created this myth about them because it says: They are the Environmental Protection Agency. Surely their commitment is to the environment. 
   Sometimes their commitment is to politics. You cannot say that about the National Academy and you cannot say that for the NRC. So what we have tried to do and what the chairman, I believe, has successfully done is bring all this together. Therefore, we can maybe satisfy the political side of it and, I hope above hope, we can address the scientific and the engineering side of it in a way that is credible and, most important, safe for our public and, of course, safe for the State of Nevada. Both of these approaches are superior to the current situation which I would like to describe. 
   Today, the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for setting the radiation standards at the Yucca Mountain repository. That authority was granted to EPA in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. So on August 19 of last year, 1999, the EPA finally proposed a draft radiation standard. That draft standard is lengthy and has a lot of technical detail, but it boils down to two critical items. In other words, when you sort through the chaff, here are the facts that make this issue important. 
   First, EPA's draft proposes an individual protection standard from all exposure pathways--food, water, air, et cetera--of no more than 15 millirems per year. 
   Second, EPA proposes a ground water protection standard that limits ground water contamination to levels at or below EPA's maximum contaminant levels for drinking water--drinking water, in an area where none is drank, or where there are no people to drink it. 
   What that means, in simple terms, is that if we are able to sink a well at the repository and draw the water up and into a glass, EPA says you have to be able to drink that water straight from the ground without treatment. 
   Not much water is consumed without treatment today, except maybe in an isolated farmsteads and in some rural areas. There are very few places, even in remote wilderness areas, where I would be 
   willing to sample drinking water in the way I have just described it. Even in some of the pristine, beautiful areas of my State of Idaho, I suggest you do not drink from a stream. My forebears were able to do that, but today you might get a bacterial contamination known as Giardia. 
   So we have a 15-millirem standard overall for Yucca Mountain and requirements for underground water that translates, I am told, to a limit of about 4 millirem exposure from underground water. Those are technical terms. That is why I have tried to break them down to a simple explanation as to what it might mean. 
   What I want my colleagues to understand is that these levels, 15 millirems and 4 millirems, are measured against a background level, a point of measurement. You have to have that to determine any increases. You go to what is known as a background level of naturally occurring radiation--from the rocks, the nature of rocks, and of course the Earth and the atmosphere itself--naturally occurring radiation of about 300 millirems per year. 
   Yucca Mountain is located in a very arid, desert environment. If you had to try to find a site within the entire contiguous United States where you might have some hope of meeting a 4-millirem ground water standard, Yucca Mountain is the kind of site you would want to pick. Yet even in the case of Yucca Mountain, the period of performance is so long and the radiation limit is so unrealistically stringent that there is some doubt that the Department of Energy will be able to demonstrate with absolute certainty that a 4-millirem ground water standard could be met. 
   If a dry, desert site cannot meet a 4-millirem ground water limit, it is reasonable to question whether any site anywhere could meet this unrealistic standard. 
   I could talk at length about how ridiculous I find these kinds of radiation limitations, but I think there is a body of criticism of EPA's proposal already existing in many of the comments that have been submitted by experts--not politicians but by experts on EPA's draft. Perhaps it will be more persuasive to my colleagues if I quote from the comments submitted to EPA by radiation experts regarding this draft radiation standard. 
   The American Nuclear Society, which is a nonprofit professional association made up of 11,000 members who are nuclear scientists, engineers, administrators, educators, physicians--you notice in that list I did not say politicians; they do not have a reason to be political, they are professionals in an area of importance to this country--they submitted comments on EPA's radiation standards. The American Nuclear Society had the following to say regarding the 15-millirem proposal:  
   The individual dose limit that EPA is recommending is not appropriate.  
   That is what they said.  
   EPA points out that the proposed dose limit of 15 millirem per year is far below the level of background radiation--  
   I have already mentioned that--  
   (about 300 millirem per year) and that any hypothesized effects of background radiation are not detectable against the rate of health  effects in the general public. While this is certainly true, we believe that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a better basis in scientific logic than EPA. The individual dose limit that the NRC has proposed (25 millirem per year) is also lower than warranted....... [W]e conclude that a dose standard of 70 millirem for the repository alone is appropriate, conservative, and adequately protective.  
   So the American Nuclear Society, an association of these 11 million professionals, has endorsed a radiation standard as high as 70 millirem per year. 
   What does the American Nuclear Society have to say about the 4-millirem groundwater standard? They say the following:  
   A ground water standard is unnecessary....... EPA's reasons for applying a groundwater standard appear to stem from a desire to influence the engineering design of the repository and to reduce collective dose to the general population, neither of which is appropriate. Both approaches are inconsistent with the National Academy of Sciences conclusion that an individual dose standard is adequately protective.......  
   In other words, you do not need to do both.  
   [V]ery small individual doses are not meaningful in assessing public health impacts....... In addition, the Linear, Non-Threshold theory of radiation health effects is being questioned with increasing intensity, and a body of scientific opinion exists today that holds it to be without scientific basis.......  
   If it is ``without scientific basis,'' then maybe the only basis left is a political basis. That is the frustration with which the chairman and I have had to deal for the last few years as we have tried to bring this issue to completion so the American people would know they had a permanent, safe repository in which to put high-level nuclear waste. 
   How do other nuclear experts look at this? Let me turn to the comments submitted to EPA by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a letter dated November 2, 1999, providing NRC's review of EPA's draft 15 and 4 millirem radiation standard. 
   On the ground water standard, NRC commented the following:  
   The NRC staff objects to the inclusion of separate groundwater protection requirements for the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain because these requirements would result in non-uniform risk levels, they misapply the Maximum Contaminant Levels ....., and they far exceed what is needed for protection of public health and safety.  
   If the public is listening to me or if they have listened to some of this debate, they would say: But, Senator CRAIG, don't you really want to make this as safe as humanly possible? 
   The answer, of course, is yes. The only problem with what EPA is saying is that if we make it that safe, we cannot make it. Of course, I am sure my colleagues from Nevada hope that would be the case. If that were true and if it were to become true, this Nation would still be without what the world of engineering and science says is a safe, permanent repository for nuclear waste. Why? Because we allowed politicians instead of scientists to make a determination as to what is right and how this facility ought to be constructed for the purpose of long-term safety. 
   What does the NRC have to say about the 15-millirem limit as compared to the NRC's proposed 25-millirem limit per year? Again I quote from the NRC's comment letter to EPA:  
   Although the EPA rule proposes a lower limit of 15 millirem, and the difference between 15 and 25 millirem is small, the lower value is not necessary for protection of public health and safety and would provide little, if any, reduction in health risk when compared with 25 millirem. It is also important to consider that the average American receives approximately 300 millirem per year from background radiation.  
   Oh, my goodness, you mean we are all being irradiated as we stand here or as we travel in our cars or live in our homes or walk in our back yards? The answer is, yes, we are. It is natural. Shame on that Sun and shame on the ground and shame on the minerals within the ground because they collectively give us 300 millirem per year in background radiation. 
   NRC goes on to say:  
   In addition to the lack of public health and safety benefits, there are regulatory concerns associated with lowering the dose limit to 15 millirem. Specifically, as the dose limit becomes smaller, limitations in the DOE's models used for estimating performance, and the associated uncertainties in supporting analysis, become more pronounced.  
   In other words, how you prove your case becomes more complicated.  
   Further, a 15 millirem dose limit is likely to cause unnecessary confusion for the public and cause the NRC to expend resources without a commensurate increase in public health and safety.  
   Zero risk. Is it possible in the world today, with all of our talent, all of our intelligence, and the best computers in the world, to construct a zero-risk environment? The answer is no. It cannot be done. It is humanly impossible under any circumstance for any situation; not just for radioactive material, but automobiles and planes, walking across the street, or riding the train back to our offices in the Senate. Zero risk? No. It does not exist. It does not exist in science, and it does not exist in the environment. It never has, and it never will. 
   Yet I am quite sure the public believes we are so sophisticated today that we in fact could create that with the unique talents of this country. We cannot. It is important we say that. That is why we have professionals determine what is doable, right, and responsible, and that is all tied with costs and the ability to create. 
   What the NRC is saying by that--``the expending of resources without commensurate increase in public health''--is one can lower it to such a level of safety that there is no justification to go beyond that. 
   I could continue quoting from these various radiation experts for a very long while because the list is long; remember, experts not politicians. Their objections to EPA's current draft radiation standards reflect a very thorough and well-researched review of EPA's proposal, and the criticisms of these experts should inform our debate as we struggle to understand what all of these numbers mean and what they mean for the future of this country's nuclear waste disposal program. 
   But I think perhaps DOE said it best, in a letter to EPA transmitting DOE's comments on the draft radiation standard. And the reason that I like this quote is, I think it sets the larger context for what these radiation standards mean for our ultimate success or failure. 
   DOE says the following:  
   EPA's standards will play a pivotal role in achieving the long-standing policy of the United States to properly dispose of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in an underground mined geologic repository. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must implement EPA's standards in its regulations for licensing a repository at the Yucca Mountain site, and DOE must be able to comply with those NRC regulations in order to construct a repository. If EPA were to select unrealistic, unnecessarily conservative, or non site-specific standards, the result could be the rejection of an otherwise suitable site, and the de facto rejection of the geologic disposal option without commensurate benefit to the protection of public health and safety. Such rejection would not avoid the consequences of radioactive water management, but it would require resort to a different and currently undefined approach.  
   I think the statement I just read describes the situation we are in now with EPA's unrealistic and unsupportable draft standard. I hope my colleagues will agree with me that this is a situation Congress must act to correct, by bringing good science back into the process of setting a radiation standard. 
   We need a disposal program. Congress, more than a decade ago, chose a course, a path. We began to tax the ratepayers of the utilities that have nuclear generation in this country to pay for that path. 
   That is where we are today. Some resist that path using all the reasons they can humanly generate, and that is why it is important we have this legislation. I hope the Congress can pass it and the President will sign it. 
   Those are the issues with which we have to deal in understanding this problem. It is critically important to our Nation. 
   At lunch today, I addressed a group of congressional staff and people in town who represent energy companies and those who do not. I said: I find it fascinating that the administration would want to take us through a climate change initiative, known as the Kyoto Protocol, in which they want to reduce carbon emissions in this country; therefore, we would have to reduce the use of fossil fuels which are currently our most abundant source of energy. In doing so, they are also not  willing to find a way to deal with nuclear waste, so that we can see an extension of the nuclear generation of our country for electricity. They are downplaying that energy source also, and, at the same time, we have a Secretary of Interior who wants to blow up hydro dams. They downplay hydro, and they will not even put hydro in the renewable resource category. 
   I find it fascinating, a country that exists on energy, an economy that is being driven today by artificial intelligence as a new industry, and that very industry operates on electricity itself. 
   I see our staff on the floor with computers in front of them. If you turned off the power of that computer, its brain would go dead, we would no longer have the tremendous expansion of this economy from which we are all benefiting. Yet we have an administration phenomenally resistant to the establishment of a permanent repository for nuclear waste but is open to the idea that if you do not handle the waste, you will ultimately kill the industry; and if you kill the industry, you will never build another nuclear reactor to generate environmentally clean electrical energy. And they want to get rid of the dams and they want to stop burning fossil fuels. Oh, my goodness. 
   What a reality check for our country, to have as our national policy no energy policy at all. Our wealth and our very existence, as a major economic force in the world, has always been built on the abundance of reasonably inexpensive but readily available energy. 
   That is a part of all of this debate. I think it is probably separate from what my colleagues from Nevada would say in opposing this legislation. Obviously, they have to reflect the politics of home, as they should. 
   But for a President to say, in a relatively unspoken way, as a policy for the country, we have no energy policy at all--we do not even have an energy strategy except maybe a few windmills and solar cells--it is no policy at all. 
   That is why we are on the floor trying to close the link between the generator of electrical power, by the use of the atom, and the necessity to have a responsible method for handling the waste that is created by that form of generation. 
   While the rest of the world around us builds nuclear reactors for generating power, and has responsibly handled their waste--and has used, in large part, our technology to do so--we have been bound up in the politics of it for well over a decade. I hope, finally, an opportunity exists for us to break through it. 
   In my opinion, this is one of the most significant environmental bills we will have before the Congress this year. While those on the other side would like to cast it as antienvironment, finding a way to collect the nuclear waste of this country, and putting it in one safe spot, far from any human being, high in the dry desert of Nevada, seems to me, and a lot of other people, to be darn good policy. 
   So let me thank my colleague from Alaska for his leadership. While he and I over the years have had disagreements on this issue, we have worked them out. We have asked the Senate to work with us to work out the differences. In most instances they have because this policy is too important for the normal course of politics that it has been served. This is an issue whose time has come. I hope the Senate and the House recognize that as we attempt to deal with it. 
   Again, I thank my chairman and yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. CRAIG THOMAS, for coming to the floor today once again to shape and clarify some of these issues that are going to be front and center before this Congress and this Senate over the coming months as we deal with Presidential initiatives, Presidential budgets, and some of the issues that are going to be, by fall and November, election-time issues. 
   Last week, I took issue with the President's State of the Union Address in a broad sense as it related to the budget and some of the initiatives he propounded within the State of the Union. Today, I will focus, as my colleague from Wyoming has focused, on the element in the President's speech dealing with guns and gun violence. 
   Last November, the Centers for Disease Control reported 34,000 Americans die every year from firearm injuries. If there is good news to be found in that terrible statistic, it is that the number has declined every year for the last 4 years. It is fewer than the 43,000 Americans who die every year from motor vehicle accidents. And yet when we have some of our colleagues on the floor pounding their podiums and saying how terrible it is--and it is terrible--they forget to put it in relation to other kinds of accidents and/or intentional acts that produce deaths among the American citizenry. 
   That figure of 34,000 is far less than the 44,000 to 98,000 patients who die every year by medical error. That is right. I am talking about errors made in the delivery of medicine. It is estimated that 44,000 to 98,000 patients die every year by medical error--that is a statistic which comes from the Institute of Medicine--and yet somehow when such a tragedy happens, it does not make the headline in the paper; it simply makes the obituary page. 
   When we consider there are over 200 million privately owned guns in the United States, we cannot escape the conclusion that the overwhelming majority of America's 80 million gun owners are peaceful and extremely responsible and using their constitutional rights in a responsible-citizen way. There are 80 million gun owners and 200 million privately owned guns in America. 
   We in the Government are charged with the responsibility of seeing that guns are used appropriately within the Constitution. That is, in part, our job. It is an American right and responsibility of all Americans, should they wish to exercise it. We are here to deal with those who use guns to intimidate, to steal, to rape, to murder. That is what the Government is for. That is our job, not to restrict or control the right of the free citizen in the exercise of his or her constitutional right, but to go at those who do the opposite, who use the right in the wrong way--to steal, to rape, or to murder. This duty comes before any other matter that we would want or should want to consider on the issue of guns. 
   We know when the Government takes this responsibility seriously, we save lives. You can come to the floor and pass all of the politically driven bills that you 
   want to, but if they are not enforced or not enforceable, then it is a political statement, not a responsible act of our Government. 
   In Richmond, VA, a Republican initiative called Project Exile has stepped up and prosecuted the gun-toting criminals and cut the murder rate by 30 percent every year since it was enacted in 1997. That is in Richmond, VA. In fact, it is said in Richmond that a man walked into a 7-Eleven with a baseball bat to rob it. They caught him. They said: Why didn't you use a gun? He said: You get locked up if you use a gun. 
   Isn't it amazing that the criminal element of our society will read and respond to the effective and targeted enforcement of a law? As a result of that, in a city that was plagued by what any person would judge as a high rate of crime and murder, it has dropped that precipitously, since the targeted direction of law enforcement not only to arrest but to prosecute and lock up those who misuse their gun rights. 
   How does the administration address the duty to the American people? Over the past 7 years, the Clinton-Gore administration has cut the ATF's pursuit of criminals who use guns by nearly half. The number of prosecutions fell by nearly as much, and the number of gun-toting criminals convicted fell by one-third. This isn't an NRA statistic; this is an independent Syracuse University statistic. It is objective by every politician's measurement. 
   This is how it profiles on a chart. Last year, in this Chamber, Vice President AL GORE cast the tiebreaking vote in favor of interfering with peaceful, law-abiding, responsible gun ownership--not criminals, but responsible citizens exercising their right to go out and buy a firearm for their personal ownership and possibly for their personal protection. 
   It was quite a moment for the Vice President. There he sat in that chair, the image of leadership. He was able to tell Americans how concerned he was about gun violence because he had cast the tiebreaking vote to impose greater restrictions on law-abiding Americans. 
   But I wonder, when this administration was gutting the enforcement of laws against gun violence, was the Vice President casting his vote then? No. Here is the Vice President's record, right here on this chart. This is where he and the President took over the law enforcement responsibilities of the Justice Department of this country. 
   Look what happened during the Reagan and the Bush years--aggressive efforts to go at the criminals; arrests went up; crime began to go down. 
   Here the Clinton-Gore administration backed off. They cut budgets. You know the rest of the story. When this administration was letting violent criminals off, I have a simple question to ask: Where was AL? 
   How many gun-toting criminals would be locked up today if the Clinton-Gore administration had merely kept pace with the Reagan-Bush administration's record portrayed on this chart? I would like to hear the Vice President answer this question to American mothers. It is the right question to ask. It is a response that all deserve.  
   But there is more disturbing evidence that this administration does not take seriously its duty in law enforcement. 
   The national instant check system is designed to immediately notify the FBI if a criminal is trying to purchase a 
   gun. I support that. Every Senator supports the ability of someone going into a licensed firearm dealer to buy a firearm immediately being checked, just like swiping your credit card through a machine at any retail outlet in America and instantly finding whether you have credit on your card so you can make that purchase. 
   We want the same kind of response when it comes to the purchase of a gun. We are nearly there. We have nudged, we have pushed, we have cajoled this administration and their Justice Department until they have finally done it--although they dragged their feet progressively over the last 8 years. 
   According to a staff report of the Senate Judiciary Committee, since November of 1998, this Republican initiative, started here on this floor--the instant check system background check--has stopped over 100,000 criminals from purchasing guns. That represents an enormous number of bad actors who need to be put back in jail. How many have the administration put back in jail? To my knowledge, none. 
   You heard the President in the well of the House in the State of the Union Address talk about all of these criminals detected and stopped from buying a gun. If a criminal walks into a hardware store or a gun shop and attempts to buy a gun over the counter from a licensed firearm dealer, and his background is checked, and he is a felon with a record, he has violated a law. He is in violation of the law. Yet the ATF has referred only one-fifth of 1 percent of these criminals acting illegally to the Justice Department for prosecution. 
   Mr. President, I am sorry. You can talk all you want about guns, but your actions show you don't care. You only want the politics of it. 
   Last year, this Congress said: No. We do not want the politics of it. We will not take that effort. We want substance. The administration claims it has increased the referral of firearms cases back to the States for prosecution. But that is the same as letting a criminal off the hook. 
   That is not an accusation of the States. These are Federal firearms violations. They deserve Federal prosecution. State prosecutors have fewer resources than Federal prosecutors, and State firearm convictions result in shorter sentences. 
   Moreover, with a budget that grew 65 percent from 1992 to 1998, I am sorry, Janet Reno, we gave you the money; you didn't do the job. That growth in budget was the Justice Department. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration even lets convicted felons off the hook. Last September, we came to the floor to speak about it. This President, with his Executive power, granted clemency to 12 terrorists convicted of 36 counts of violating Federal firearms laws. I am amazed at you, Bill Clinton, that you can stand on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives and, with a straight face, talk about firearms control, when you turned loose convicted felons, convicted of firearms violations. 
   As recently as last year, the President said he would spend not more than $5 million on the programs such as Project Exile, the kind I just outlined used in Richmond, VA. We asked for $50 million. The President largely got his way. The final figure was about $7 million. Sorry, Mr. President. Last year at this time you didn't deserve credit for any of it. Now you have stepped up. Now you are saying you want $280 million to hire new investigators and prosecutors, both at the Federal and the State level. I ask you why, Mr. President? I think I know the answer. It is polling well. You went out and asked the question of the American people about law enforcement, something every Senator knows about, and it polled well. It got in the State of the Union. 
   It is far from clear that inadequate funding is the problem. The drop in prosecutions we have seen under this administration cannot be explained entirely by staff levels. The ATF observers at Syracuse University attest, ``other unknown forces or policies changes are apparently at work.'' Many observers believe the administration already has the resources it needs to increase as dramatically as they want the prosecutions necessary. 
   I ask unanimous consent to continue for 3 more minutes.

   Mr. CRAIG. One other issue I think is important: The President did something the other night that is the most radical expression on gun control by any President in the history of this country--I think that is worth repeating--the most radical proposal on gun control by any President in the history of this country. Here is what he said:  
   Every state in this country already requires ..... automobile drivers to have a license. I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases.  
   Mr. President, it is obvious you don't understand. 
   What the President failed to grasp is that no State requires a license to purchase a car. If you want to have it hauled home to your ranch out in Wyoming and you stay on your ranch and you never get off on the public road, you, Senator CRAIG THOMAS, do not need a license to own a car. You need a license to drive a car on a public right of way, on a public road. States do not require a license to drive a car except on public roads. That is the whole point the President made. The average American scratches his head and says, yes, license cars, license guns. But the President said you had to have a license to buy a gun, a direct statement of violation of the second amendment of our Constitution. 
   I can understand why Americans are frustrated, but I doubt the President has had a driver's license, maybe a valid one, in a long while. He has not needed one. I doubt he has ever waited in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles to get a license or to take the test in a long while. So if the President wants to license handguns like cars, then he is talking about issuing licenses to take a firearm out in public because it would be against the Constitution to require a license to buy one, so he must be talking about taking a license out to take a gun out in public. Well, we already do that. It is called concealed carry permits. Thirty States already say you can get a license to carry a gun in public, and it is called a concealed carry. The State of Vermont doesn't require a license at all. 
   I regret to inform you, President Bill Clinton, that what you are talking about is something I don't think you understand. No State requires a person to have a driver's license to purchase a car, nor should this Federal Government ever require a free citizen in our country the need to have a license to purchase a gun. 
   Mr. President, are you then talking about a national concealed carry law? That is probably a pretty good idea. For those who want to carry in public, you could say you have to have a certain safety record and safety standard and experience and all of those kinds of things if you want--not to own, now, but to carry openly in public. I think that is what the President is not talking about at all. 
   My time is up and there are a good many other facts to be dealt with. In States that have concealed carry, crime drops; when the criminal element knows that the citizen out there is armed for his or her self-protection, for the protection of their private property and their personal rights and their person itself. 
   Extensive study has also shown that when states begin issuing concealed carry permits, murders drop by about 8 percent, rapes fall by 5 percent and aggravated assaults drop by 7 percent. 
   Moreover, as economist John Lott notes, states that began issuing nondiscretionary permits between 1977 and 1992 ``virtually eliminated mass public shootings after four or five years.'' 
   Why does crime fall when citizens' right to bear arms is protected? Because there is nothing a criminal fears more than a citizen who can defend himself. 
   The President's comments were, of course, a plug for the Vice President, who has been talking for some time about regulating guns like cars. 
   I wonder if that's really what either of them wants. In the words of second amendment scholar David Kopel, ``if Gore follows through on his promise to treat guns like cars, he will oversee the most massive decontrol of firearms in  America since 1868, when the 14th Amendment abolished Southern states' Black Codes, which prohibited freedmen from owning guns.'' 
   Preserving and strengthening the second amendment would suit most Americans just fine. I hope that's really what the President and Vice President want. But I suspect it isn't. And I worry that if word gets out, some poor White House speechwriter is going to lose his job. 
   These are issues we will debate at length on the floor of the Senate over the coming months. I thought it was important to come to the floor to begin to understand, to begin to explain so the American people can more clearly understand the kind of irrational approach this administration is currently proposing and certainly the less than legitimate record they have in the area of law enforcement when it comes to the use of a firearm. 
   I thank my colleague from Wyoming for taking out this time.

   Mr. CRAIG. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer from Kansas for recognizing the Senator from Idaho. 
   Mr. President, I said yesterday--and I meant it most sincerely--that I am very respectful of the Senator from  Iowa and the Senator from Utah who have tried to reshape bankruptcy law in this country to be fair and equitable and representative of those who find themselves in desperate straits as a result of debt and the need to reorganize and reshape that and, in some instances, to discharge it altogether. We have said historically that those who willfully, maliciously, or recklessly cause endangerment cannot do that. That has been the standard, and that ought to remain the standard. 
   Today, there is an attempt by the Senator from Michigan to use the bankruptcy code to be politically correct, to be more political than substantive as it relates to the law; that is, to single out an industry and that industry's legal distributors as somehow being separate, special, and unique and, therefore, not being allowed to use the bankruptcy law. 
   It is a great mistake for the Senate to begin to play that kind of game. That is raw politics, and we have not done that in the past. I am not sure we should ever do it for any reason other than the ones we have already said: a willful, malicious kind of action. 
   They say this is for gun manufacturers, those folks whom they attempt to paint as a very evil group who produce a legal and legitimate product and sell it through federally licensed dealers. Somehow they are all wrong now because the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from New Jersey say the American 
   people sweepingly demand that we change. The American people do not sweepingly demand this change; they demand that the Justice Department enforce the laws, which we know they have not, and, as a result, some misuse of firearms has certainly gone on in our country. 
   The issue is not with the Kmarts, it is not with the Wal-Marts, it is not with the local hardware dealer, and it should not be with the manufacturer. But for some reason today, for political correctness in this Chamber, that is exactly what they are attempting to do. I hope my colleagues understand and recognize that we are not shielding somebody who acts willfully and maliciously but who acts knowing their action endangers others. They are not going to be exempt because they are not now and they will not be later. 
   The Senator from Alabama is right; judges are already dismissing these kinds of frivolous, politically motivated lawsuits, and they will keep filing them hoping someday they can find a judge on whom they can hang it and he will say OK. 
   If that happens, then what happens? If a company that finds itself in this situation is not allowed to use chapter 11 to reorganize, then they will use chapter 7. What does that mean? It means they will go bankrupt, they will liquidate, they will go overseas, if they need to, to manufacture their product, and jobs on Main Street in a lot of our communities can and will be lost. 
   Is this a jobs issue? It can be when you straitjacket the law, when you pick winners and losers, when you want to play the politically correct game against someone who, by their judgment, has fallen out of favor with the American people. I hope we do not use bankruptcy law or any other part of the Federal code of this country for that kind of political gamesmanship. 
   Last year, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle worked overtime trying to make guns an issue, and they failed. The reason they failed is that the American people said: Wait a moment; there are tragedies being perpetrated out there and guns being used in those tragedies, and there are 60,000 gun laws in America and the Justice Department is not enforcing them. 
   Somehow we just stack more laws up and the world becomes safer? No. The American people are way ahead of us by last year's polling and this year's current polling. They say: Don't do that. More laws do not a safer world make unless the laws are effectively enforced and administered against the criminal element of our society or those who would misuse their rights. 
   Here the Senator from Michigan is deciding who is going to be criminal and who is going to be malicious by standing in this Chamber and saying: I think I will find these people less than popular in my judgment because back home it might be politically correct with my base of support. 
   That is not good policy. It may be good politics. We have already found even that politics is not working very well. 
   I ask my colleagues to join in a motion to table. We should not mess up the bankruptcy law. It ought to be used for the purposes it is being used, and those who find themselves misusing the laws of our land or acting in a reckless, willful, malicious way are going to be treated appropriately within the law; 
   that is, to not discharge their debt or their liability if they find themselves in this kind of an environment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah, and let me also thank the Senator from Iowa for bringing what I think is necessary to bring to this debate as it applies to the Levin amendment, and that is common sense. Is, in fact, this amendment the kind of legislation we want to see? If you support the bedrock policy of bankruptcy law, I do not know how you can support the Levin amendment because it undermines basically all of those policies. 
   The bankruptcy code establishes a structure that ensures everyone who is owed money by the debtor will be treated fairly when the debtor is given, in essence, a fresh start under the law. The main purpose of the bankruptcy reform measures we are working on is to get more debtors to pay back more of the debts they owe to more of their creditors. That is a rather simple principle before this Senate. This issue has been with us. The Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Utah and others have struggled with it mightily for the last good number of years, to bring fairness and equity in it, but also to say to debtors there is a credibility here and a responsibility you owe to your creditors. There needs to be a greater sense of fairness and balance brought. I think the fundamental underlying bill offers that. 
   The Levin amendment is a carve-out, and I think it flies in the face of those general policies. The supporters of the Levin amendment say they are trying to prevent firearm manufacturers from escaping accountability for bad acts that result in a civil judgment against them. That is rather straightforward. 
   It is not only manufacturers; it is retailers and it is corporations. So it is a broad brush. While they would like, I am sure, to create the image that there is a manufacturer out there who produces a firearm and somehow it is evil, are Wal-Mart and Kmart and hardware stores that sell legitimately as federally licensed firearms dealers evil? In the eyes of some, they probably are. That is not the debate, nor is that the issue. Let's look at what the amendment does. It is unfair because it picks out a specific industry and it restricts the bankruptcy relief available to that industry. 
   In other words, if we in the Senate have now decided we are going to pick winners and losers who are politically correct or politically incorrect based on your particular philosophy or point of view, that is what the Levin amendment, the Levin carve-out does. Is this Senate going to start picking winners and losers amongst businesses in our country? We never have. We created certain conditions or certain things that are special within the law but never politically have we said: You are a winner, you are safe under the law; you are a loser, you lose. That is not what we do. We let the marketplace generally do that, and we let consumers generally do that. 
   Today it is the firearm manufacturers and tomorrow is it an industry that produces alcohol; or a fatty product, and we have decided in our society that  fat consumption is no longer good for the American consumer, even though as free citizens they ought to have a right to choose. 
   ``That sounds silly, Senator CRAIG. You ought not be saying things like that.'' 
   When I watched the trial lawyers organize and convince the 
   attorneys general that going after the tobacco companies was good because the tobacco companies had fallen out of favor and it was a politically correct thing to do, I said, ``And next will be firearms.'' There were some who chuckled. Of course, guess what. Next were the firearm manufacturers. That is what is going on out there today. Municipalities that do not enforce the law but, most important, municipalities that arrest people who illegally use firearms do not have a Justice Department that backs them up. 
   The Clinton administration ran from enforcement for 7 years. Of course, just this year they got a new religion out there because they have seen the polls and they have seen what the American people have said: Enforce the laws, Mr. President. 
   I wonder how my friends across the aisle would react if I proposed a similar amendment making bankruptcy relief unavailable to former Presidents of the United States? ``That would be foolish, LARRY. You should not do something such as that.'' 
   That spells the intent of this amendment. I think the Senator from Iowa was a little kinder than I am, suggesting maybe there was an ulterior motive and it was probably more political than it was legally substantive. I think he is right. 
   It is also unfair because it would have the effect of putting the interests of some creditors ahead of others. The lawsuits we are talking about are not claims for real injuries resulting from somebody's bad acts. Instead, they are treasure hunts. We saw the hundreds of millions of dollars the trial attorneys made, and now States are getting, from the settlements from the tobacco industry. The treasure hunt resulted; the treasures were found. They are looking for multimillion-dollar verdicts or settlements to go to the trial lawyers and municipal governments they represent. 
   If there are legitimate creditors out there in a bankruptcy settlement, they are no longer protected because we have taken those companies out and they simply fall away. The effect of the Levin amendment would be that lawyers and government bureaucrats get paid first. Remember that: Lawyers and government bureaucrats get paid first. If there is anything left in this kind of bankruptcy of these multimillion-dollar verdicts, then and only then will a creditor get a dime. 
   The Levin amendment would also hurt the very people it claims to help because it would make it unlikely that more than a fraction of the judgments, if that much, would ever get paid off. This is because it would prevent more companies from taking a reorganization bankruptcy. Instead, it would simply, in all reality, force them into liquidation, where the creditors get nothing. Is that the intent of the Levin amendment? My guess is, if it is not the intent, it clearly is the result. 
   What is the practical effect of all of this? It means instead of a company continuing to exist, a company being allowed to stay in business, to reorganize, to keep its employees intact, they close their doors, they lay off their employees, and their creditors go wanting. Not only are the creditors not going to be there to get the benefit of it, the jobs are lost. 
   It means there will be no business-generating income to continue to pay the debts it created. Whatever you can squeeze out of a business today is all you are going to get. That is the result of this amendment. Maybe that is the intent of the amendment. If it is, why don't we be honest with ourselves? This amendment is not substantively charged, it is politically charged. I think all of us understand that. My guess is that is how the vote breaks out on an issue such as this. In short, the amendment turns bankruptcy policy on its head. 
   It is designed to destroy legitimate and law-abiding businesses. It injures consumers, and it destroys jobs. The Levin amendment is clear and simply bad policy for this country, and I hope the Senate will choose to defeat it. We should not mix that kind of politics with this kind of constructive policy change that these Senators have worked to bring to the floor. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor as one who spent over 90 minutes on the floor of the House last week listening to the President's State of the Union Message. 
   For a few moments, I would like to kind of analyze that State of the Union Address as seen through the eyes of this Senator reflective of what I believe to be, shall I say, self-evident truth. 
   There is no question that our President is a gifted speaker. He waxed eloquently while spending our children's heritage and vastly increasing the size and the parental meddling of our Government by all of the new programs that he has proposed to create while claiming credit for virtually every good thing that has happened in the last century, including those things which were accomplished despite his opposition and his veto. 
   I say: Lyndon Johnson, move over; you heard a speech the other night that would cause your ghost to shudder. You had the record as being the biggest spending Government creator since FDR. Let me propose that this President is now vying for first place. 
   Let me start by analyzing his spending spree. 
   In his speech, President Clinton called for continued fiscal discipline while at the same time suggesting that we do a lot of other things and buying down the Federal debt. 
   I say, Mr. President, what hypocrisy. Until the Republican Congress imposed fiscal discipline, until the American people demanded fiscal discipline, the President consistently proposed budgets with spending and debt and deficits as far as the average person's eye could see and the greatest prognosticator 
   of the Office of Management and Budget could look in his crystal ball and predict. He didn't refuse to stray from the path of fiscal discipline. He simply did it. We forced him to get to that path. That election occurred in 1994. We know the rest of that story. Yet what has he proposed in his last State of the Union Message? 
   The Senate Budget Committee made a preliminary estimate of the new spending proposed by the President at about $343 billion. That is about $3.8 billion a minute for his 89-minute speech. Not bad spending, Mr. President--the most expensive speech given in the history of this country, I suggest. If the Treasury can only print about $262 billion a year with the presses running nearly 24 hours a day, you even outspent, Mr. President, the ability of the U.S. Treasury to print it.  
   What about the taxpayers whose earnings the President would spend so freely? 
   Last week, the Congressional Budget Office, using its most pessimistic estimate, announced that there would be an $838 billion non-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years. That is phenomenal. That is wonderful for this country. Yet the Clinton speech mentioned he would give back only about $250 billion of it. That is less than 30 percent of the excessive income tax paid by the American people who that $838 billion represents. However, even this paltry $250 billion tax cut wasn't real. Much of it is disguised in new spending. Even the Washington Post, sometimes as difficult as it finds criticizing the President, said that he has artfully couched many of these new tax cuts in new spending programs. Thank you, Washington Post, for pointing that out. 
   What is worse? This $343 billion in spending is just the tip of the iceberg, and the American taxpayers are riding on a potential Titanic.  
   The Clinton version of government is not the end of big government as we know it. That is what he said a few years ago. But then again let's remember the source. It is Bill Clinton. 
   More intrusive government? How about that. 
   Less personal responsibility? I think that was the message our President spoke to so clearly last week. 
   So let's talk about where he is, where I believe a Republican Congress is, and what I hope in the end we are able to do about it. 
   The President says he wants to make schools accountable--but to the Federal Government. The Republicans want to make schools accountable--but to the parents and to the young people who will be educated there. It takes Washington too long to realize the problems. Parents who deal with their children on a day-to-day basis know what the problem is very quickly. 
   According to the Heritage Foundation, one-third of college freshmen take remedial classes because our elementary and secondary schools are failing to teach them some of the basics. Those are the students lucky enough to go on to college. These kids don't need the Princeton Review, as the President suggests. They need quality teachers who are accountable to parents and the local school board. 
   What about health care? 
   In 1994, President Clinton tried to remake a national health care system in this country in the image of the U.S. Post Office. Thanks to bipartisan opposition he failed. 
   The world recognized it, and our public cheered. 
   In 1996, he vowed to push for Government-run health care ``a step at a time until eventually we finish this.'' Those are his words. He would go after health care ``a step at a time''--that is Government-run health care--until ``eventually we finish this.'' ``This'' meaning, of course, his U.S. Post Office-style health care system. Now the President has renewed his commitment to Government-run health care with legislation that would cancel the private coverage of over 2 million Americans so he can push them a step at a time into an expensive Government-run program. 
   Then there was that great but very soft and smooth Federal land grab statement he made the other evening. The President said:  
   Tonight I propose creating a permanent conservation fund, to restore wildlife, protect our coastlines, save our national treasures. .....  
   What he wants to do is annually take several billion dollars of oil and gas royalties paid to the Federal Government and buy more land and make it Federal Government land. If he is successful, it means Congress will have to find $2 billion elsewhere to fund programs. But more importantly, the ratios of private versus public ownership would change. The Government already owns 1 out of every 4 acres of the landmass of this country, primarily in Western States; 63 percent of my State is owned by the Federal Government. Idahoans do not want Bill Clinton buying one more acre of Idaho. Why? That is the tax base that funds our local governments and funds our schools. So, Mr. President, we won't give you that money. We should not give you that money. If the environment needs protection, we can find the necessary resources without giving you a blank check to buy more Federal land. 
   Mr. President, the very infrastructure of our National Park System is falling apart. How about putting some money there? That is where the American public wants to go recreate. Give our parks a chance to catch up with the traffic instead of shutting them down or closing people out of them. Let's let people into our parks. Let's invest in them. We don't need to buy more property; we need to take care of that which we have. 
   The President said:  
   The major security threat this country will face will come from enemies of the nation state: the narcotraffickers and the terrorists and the organized criminals.  
   He boasts about ``agreements to restrain nuclear programs in North Korea''--a program for direct U.S. subsidies for one of the most vicious, anti-American, terrorist-supporting, drug-trafficking regimes in the world, responsible for deaths of millions of its own people? Mr. President, I don't quite understand your priorities. 
   He is patting himself on the back for victory in Kosovo, a victory that means planting American troops in an alliance with what is known to be an organization of narcotrafficking terrorists and organized criminal cartels. 
   Mr. President, I am not quite sure you have made yourself quite clear to the American people. I think you are saying one thing when your actions clearly demonstrate you are doing something else. 
   The President highlights the needs for ``curbing the flow of lethal technology to Iran.'' The Republican Congress passed a 
   bill that would have done just that, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997, that is H.R. 2709. And what happened on June 23 of 1998? The President vetoed it. Remarkably, President Clinton continues to support paper agreements rather than U.S. actions to keep Americans secure. Although he outlined real threats from ballistic missile proliferation in his speech, President Clinton refuses to deploy a national ballistic missile defense system to protect Americans from ballistic missile attacks. He even signed legislation calling for the deployment of such a system, although, in typical Clinton fashion, he has found many excuses to reinterpret the straightforward language of that legislation. Instead of defending America against a clear and present danger, the President hides behind outdated, ineffective, and obsolete arms control treaties. 
   Because of President Clinton, Americans remain defenseless against ballistic missile attack. It is interesting; the President is now calling for ``constructive bipartisan dialog'' on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty when the administration turned a deaf ear to the critical national security concerns being voiced by Republicans for the last good many months. 
   Despite President Clinton's best efforts to underfund and overextend U.S. military forces, it has been a Republican Congress that has consistently sent the President bills to keep our forces well trained and well equipped and properly paid. It was a Republican Congress that initiated the bill to improve the quality of life of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines, and helped retain those who were leaving who had already gained the kind of special skills that are so necessary in our military. 
   Hyperbole? Hypocrisy? Exaggeration? Shame on me for even suggesting that. 
   The President claimed credit in his speech for most of the good news in America for the past several decades--the healthy economy, welfare reform, falling crime rates, balanced budgets, a cleaner environment, smaller Federal workforces, and social progress. Anybody who sits in the Presidency and possesses the bully pulpit when times are good can make claim and take credit, but just for a few moments let me talk about how it got done. 
   Mr. President, you are entitled to take credit but you can't steal Republican principles, Republican ideas, and the kind of work that went on in the Congress to make it happen. The President claimed that he ended welfare as we know it--after he vetoed it twice. Shame on you, Mr. President. It was a Republican Congress but, more importantly, it was Republican Governors out in the States who reformed welfare. We copied them. We didn't have the genius here. We were stuck in the old bureaucracy. We wanted to talk about reform but we took the ideas of  the States, implemented them into the Federal program, and it worked. So, yes, you can take credit for it but you didn't do it. You vetoed the bills, you kept vetoing the bills, and on the very day that you signed them, you said we will be back to change them because we don't like this. 
   But, of course, it was an election year. You knew you had to sign it, and you took credit for it while at the same time you were criticizing it. I am sorry, Mr. President; I happen to read history and I happen to remember what you said. Shame on me. 
   On the environment, the President said:  
   ..... one of the things I am grateful for is the opportunity that the Vice President and I have had to finally put to rest the bogus idea that you cannot grow the economy and the environment at the same time.  
   He said:  
   ..... we have rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste, ensured cleaner air and water for millions of people. In the past 3 months alone, we have preserved over 40 million roadless acres in the national forests. .....''  
   Mr. President, here is the rest of the truth. Those 500 neighborhoods you claim are a product of the Superfund laws that were passed long before you got here. Also, you are taking credit for cleaner air and water. Congress passed the Clean Air Act and Congress passed the Clean Water Act under Republican direction, and subsequently amendments to change that in a way that would make it more operative--and it has worked. But you are the one who ruined regulation, through ozone and particulate matter rules, for example, that have tried to pull it down and make it less operative. 
   Mr. President, why don't we both take credit for the environment: past Congresses, current Congress, past administrations, current administration. We have worked together and our environment is cleaner, and we are proud of that. 
   In 1995, President Clinton said balancing the budget was a bad idea. Let me repeat that. In 1995, Mr. President, you said balancing the budget was a bad idea, it was bad for the economy. 
   Going into 1996 and faced with poll data that indicated the American people were demanding a balanced budget, you decided to surrender on principle and argue about the details later. The size of our economic boom today is because Bill Clinton reluctantly went along with the core principles that swept Republicans into control of the Congress in 1994. That balanced budget did not happen until there was a Republican Congress shaping it and, Mr. President, you know it. Social Security taxes today are being locked up and protected to secure Social Security and, Mr. President, that was not your idea. In fact, you wanted to spend a big chunk of that money last year, and we simply would not let you do it. 
   President Clinton's greatest success story--the continued economic boom--is a direct result of the Republican fiscal policies enacted over the consistent objections of the President and his Democratic colleagues in the Congress. No, we will stand toe to toe on that debate. You cannot hide from your rhetoric and your actions of the past. Those were your policies before the American people said: We have gone too far; let's bring our Government under control. 
   President Clinton is a President who claims he wants to protect Social Security, but in 8 years, he has failed to submit a serious Social Security protection plan. And President Clinton is a President who claims he wants to protect Medicare, and yet, last year--we all know it--he whispered in the ears of those he put on that conference and said: Don't vote for it. That was a bipartisan proposal, and that is the way reform of Medicare must come. 
   Why didn't he want them to support it and to get it all wrapped up and finished in an election year? Because one could 
   go out and point fingers and politicize Medicare and prescription drugs. Shame on you, Mr. President. Come back and work with us on that. Let's reinstitute the bipartisan agreement on which Democrats and Republicans stood. We will vote for it and you ought to sign it, Mr. President. And if you do, that could be your legacy. On that I would give you some credit.  
   We have reinvented Government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas. ..... With the smallest Federal workforce in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record surpluses. .....  
   I was quoting the President. Our record surpluses have little to do with the size of the Federal workforce. Record surpluses were created by hard-working Americans earning money and paying taxes and a highly productive economy. That is what has produced the surpluses, Mr. President, and it also produced record high taxes. 
   Another area on which I want to comment is foster care. It was fascinating to me and frustrating when the President talked about foster care. I know how that happened. I know Republicans and Democrats have their differences. We came together and we worked on it in Congress. It was not in the White House nor was it the President's idea. But because it was a strong bipartisan effort here, we happened to pass it. Democrats and Republicans at the congressional level did that, and the President has ridden on it ever since. Why? Because it worked, because children are less in foster care today, and we are finding them permanent, loving homes. No longer is the bureaucracy harboring them. Foster care is a good institution, but it is an institution that was reshaped. 
   Mr. President, because you signed the bill, I am willing to give you some credit for it, but that is all you did and that is all you deserve. 
   Then, of course, there is that issue of guns. Last June, the President said: I will not send up a licensure bill on guns because the Congress won't pass it. 
   Even on less controlling issues, a Democratic vote in the House killed gun control ideas of this administration. So why did the President do it this time? For Bill and AL; that is Bill Bradley, of course, and AL GORE. They are out on the stump talking about it. His party failed to make guns a national issue, and the reason they failed is because the American people know there are over 40,000 gun control laws on the books today, and the American people have grown wise. If you do not enforce the laws, the criminal element still runs rampant and commits crimes with guns. 
   The American people are not asking for more gun control laws. They are asking for a Justice Department that will prosecute those who violate the law. Mr. President, that is the message and, of course, that is what we will do as a Congress. We are not going to stack up more gun laws; we are going to cause the Justice Department to enforce them. 
   There are myriad other points of discussion, but I wanted the public and the record to show there is a very real difference between what this President said in his State of the Union Address and what actually happened and what is happening because we do not stand with this President on a variety of his ideas, and Congress and the public have largely rejected them. 
   Republicans will not stand for a Government-run health care system. We will pass a Patients' Bill of Rights this year. We will allow citizens to be in control of their health care and 
   their health care delivery, and we will enhance education this year. We will send it back to the States and local communities to control. We will save Social Security, as the Senator from Wyoming said, and I hope we can deal with Medicare. 
   Mr. President, what is important is that if you want to work with us to resolve these problems in the final hours of your administration, then let us sit down and begin to talk because the hour is late, and I believe you have already written your legacy. I do not think there are enough Federal dollars for you to buy a new one. The American people are going to remember Bill Clinton not for his big government ideas and his big spending but for something entirely different. 
   Let us begin our work in this Congress in the last session of the 106th Congress to balance the budget and to secure Social Security. I hope we can deal with a Patients' Bill of Rights. I would like to see us deal with pharmaceutical drugs for our elderly. I hope we can also deal with our farm crisis and assure a strong military. 
   I am not going to promise we can do all that Bill wants done and give tax cuts and buy down the debt because we cannot do all those things. Most important, we should not. I hope we can give  a tax cut. We are buying down the debt. Most importantly, I say to the American people: We are not going to allow Government to grow in the image of Bill Clinton just for a legacy he would like to establish. 
   I thank my colleague from Wyoming for the liberty he has allowed me in the use of time, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleague Senator HARRY REID, and Senators ASHCROFT, BENNETT, BREAUX, CRAPO, GRASSLEY, MURRAY, ROBERTS, ROBB, and SARBANES to recognize January 2000 as National Biotechnology Month.  
   It is fitting that in the first month of this new year, at the start of a new century, we look to biotechnology as our greatest hope for the future. 
   Mapping the human genome, for example, is ahead of schedule and nearly complete. That achievement, begun 10 years ago, will rank as one of the most significant advances in health care by accelerating the biotechnology industry's discovery of new therapies and cures for our most life-threatening diseases. 
   Biotechnology not only is using genetic research to create new medicines, but also to improve agriculture, industrial manufacturing and environmental management. 
   The United States leads the world in biotechnology innovation. There are approximately 1,300 biotech companies in the United States, employing more than 150,000 people. The industry spent nearly $10 billion on research and development in 1998. Although revenues totaled $18.4 billion, the industry recorded a net loss of $5 billion because of the expensive nature of drug development. 
   In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved more than 20 biotechnology drugs, vaccines and new indications for existing medicines, pushing the number of marketed biotech drugs and vaccines to more than 90. Total FDA biotech approvals from 1982 through 1999 reach more than 140 when adding clearances for new indications of existing medicines. The vast majority of new biotech drugs were approved in the second half of the 1990s, demonstrating the biotechnology industry's surging proficiency at finding new medicines to treat our most life-threatening illnesses. 
   Biotechnology is revolutionizing every facet of medicine from diagnosis to treatment of all diseases. It is detailing life at the molecular level and someday will take much of the guesswork out of disease management and treatment. The implications for health care are as great as any milestone in medical history. We expect to see great strides early in this century. 
   A devastating disease that has stolen many of our loved ones, neighbors and friends is cancer. Biotechnology already has made significant strides in battling certain cancers. This is only the beginning. 
   The first biotechnology cancer medicines have been used with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation to enhance their effectiveness, lessen adverse effects and reduce chances of cancer recurrence. 
   Newer biotech cancer drugs target the underlying molecular causes of the disease. Biotech cancer treatments under development, such as vaccines that prevent abnormal cell growth, may make traditional treatments obsolete. In addition, gene therapy is being studied as a way to battle cancer by starving tumor cells to death. 
   Many biotech drugs are designed to treat our most devastating and intractable illnesses. In many cases these medicines are the first ever therapies for those diseases. For example, advancements in research have yielded first-of-a-kind drugs to treat multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis as well as cancer. 
   Other medicines in clinical trials block the start of the molecular cascade that triggers inflammation's tissue damaging effects in numerous disease states. In diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's, clinical trials are under way to test a variety of cell therapies that generate healthy neurons to replace deteriorated ones. Recent breakthroughs in stem cell research have prompted experts to predict cures within 10 years for some diseases, such as Type I (Juvenile) Diabetes and Parkinson's. 
   With more than 350 biotechnology medicines in late-stage clinical trials for illnesses, such as heart ailments, cancer, neurological diseases and infections, biotechnology innovation will be the foundation not only for improving our health and quality of life, but also lowering health care costs. 
   In the past 2 years Congress has increased funding for the National Institutes of Health's basic research programs by 15 percent per year. We are 40 percent of the way toward doubling the NIH budget. Health-care research, however, is not one-sided. The public funds we provide are for basic research. The private sector takes this basic science and then spends many times more than what the government has contributed to create new drugs and get them to patients. In today's world, biotechnology companies are among the greatest innovators and risk takers. 
   Biotechnology also is being used to improve agriculture, industrial manufacturing and environmental management. In manufacturing, the emphasis has shifted from the removal of toxic chemicals in production waste streams to replacement of those pollutants with biological processes that prevent the environment from being fouled. And because these biological processes are derived from renewable sources they also conserve a traditional energy resource. Industrial biotechnology companies are the innovators commercializing clean technologies and their progress is accelerating at an astonishing rate. 
   In agricultural biotechnology, crops on the market have been modified to protect them from insect damage thus reducing pesticide use. Biotech crops that are herbicide tolerant enable farmers to control weeds without damaging the crops. This allows farmers flexibility in weed management and promotes conservation tillage. Other biotech crops are protected against viral disease with the plant equivalent of a vaccine. 
   The number of acres worldwide planted with biotech crops soared from 4.3 million in 1996 to 100 million in 1999, of which 81 million acres were planted in the United States and Canada. Acceptance of these crops by farmers is one indication of the benefits they have for reducing farming costs and use of pesticides while increasing crop yields. 
   Biotech crops in development include foods that will offer increased levels of nutrients and vitamins. Benefits range from helping developing nations meet basic dietary requirements to creating disease-fighting and health-promoting foods. 
   Biotechnology is improving the lives of those in the U.S. and abroad. The designation of January 2000 as National Biotechnology Month is an indication to our constituents and their children that Congress recognizes the value and the promise of this technology. Biotechnology is a big word that means hope.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand that my amendment, as modified, has been accepted on that side. 
   I guess I am at risk, as we are anytime a Senator comes to the floor and says, ``This is a simple amendment'' But in fact that is exactly what this amendment is. It corrects a very small but very real problem. We are talking about property that is pawned by a debtor. 
   This amendment deals with the question of when that pawned property is legally out of the reach of a debtor's bankruptcy estate. 
   This amendment would allow pawned tangible personal property to be excluded from the bankruptcy estate, so long as the debtor has no legal obligation to repay the money or redeem or buy back the property and the contract or statutory redemption period has expired on the pawned property. And, of course, it is that expiration date that is clear and important as it relates to the period of redemption, and that is where the courts have found themselves in the last several years. 
   This amendment incorporates the general position of the courts that pawnbrokers should be allowed to have complete and clear title to the pawned personal property of a person in bankruptcy once the redemption period has expired and the debtor or trustee has not exercised the right of redemption. 
   This amendment allows the pawnbroker to sell the pawned property without burdening the courts with unnecessary actions seeking relief from the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code. 
   Courts have found that unredeemed, pawned, tangible personal property cannot be treated as property of the bankruptcy estate because once the statutory redemption period has run, and the pawned goods have not been redeemed, the debtor forfeits all rights and title to the pawned property. The cutoff date for inclusion of the bankruptcy estate is the end of the redemption period. I am referencing Dunlap, a 1993 case in Maryland and Tennessee, 158 BR 724. 
   In the circumstances outlined by this amendment, the property doesn't belong to the debtor anymore. Once that redemption period has run out and they have not exercised it, it is out of his possession and out of his right to control. It is only common sense that when it is no longer his property, it cannot be pulled into the bankruptcy estate. That is what the courts have said, and that is what this amendment says. 
   All too often, however, pawnbrokers are pulled in and ultimately they have to go through the expense of hiring attorneys and doing all of those kinds of things even though it is very clear that the property redemption period has expired and the courts ultimately ruled in favor of the pawnbroker. 
   So we are clarifying that with this amendment, and I hope my colleagues will accept it and be consistent in this law with what the courts have been saying now over the last period of years. 
   Mr. President, I relinquish the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my friends from Alaska, Senator MURKOWSKI, and Nevada, Senator REID, have worked hard to protect the mining jobs in their States and in mine, and I extend my thanks to them for working with me to keep the Department of Interior from mindlessly destroying jobs and lives by trying to rewrite the Mining Law.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee a problem that has come up in Twin Falls in my State of Idaho. In July 1998, the Bureau of Land Management's state office closed the tanker resupply base at the Twin Falls airport, after an internal inspection indicated unsafe conditions. At the time of that closing, the BLM Shoshone and state BLM offices expressed their interest in re-opening the facility as soon as possible. Over the following months, discussions between BLM and local officials included mention of re-opening as early as during fiscal year 2000. 
   Then, approval and timing of the project appeared to enter a twilight zone somewhere between south Idaho and Washington, DC. In February of this year, a project data sheet was produced showing a request for FY 2001. Local officials in Twin Falls were told that this delay was the result of no prioritization decision being made at the national level, and that FY 2001 was going to be the earliest year for which the request could be made. Subsequently, local officials were told both, that no final decisions had been made, and that the project had slipped to a lower priority and would be delayed at least until FY 2002. 
   Prompt replacement of this airtanker reload base is important for several reasons. It is the only such base within 100 miles of most of the Idaho-Nevada border and is therefore situated to provide the fastest possible response in the area during the fire season. Because of the location of the airport and its clear departure paths, it offers fast, safe turnaround times. Many customers in addition to BLM need a base in this area. If the base is not re-opened soon, it will hurt airport operations and hurt the local economy. 
   I am not suggesting to the Chairman that anyone is acting inappropriately. But I do think it is important for us to look into the matter, find out more about the decisionmaking process and what it is producing, consider what the fairest, most prompt outcome should be, and engage with BLM to arrive at that solution.

   Mr. CRAIG. Senator GORTON, I have in my hand a copy of an August 27 order from Judge William Dwyer instructing the parties in a lawsuit over timber sales in the Pacific Northwest to negotiate a settlement regarding a requirement to survey for 77 species of mollusks, lichens, bryophytes, salamanders and slugs prior to conducting ground disturbing activities. This lawsuit has held up over one quarter of a billion board feet of federal timber sales. 
   Let me read a single sentence from the Judge's order:  
   Negotiations should now be resumed, should include the defendant-interveners, and should explore short-term solutions that would reduce the impact of injunctive relief  on logging contractors and their employees while complying with the Northwest Forest Plan.  
   I have been advised by media accounts that the settlement announced, with great fanfare, by Under Secretary Jim Lyons yesterday did not involve the ``defendant-interveners.'' Indeed, in his public comments Mr. Lyons indicates that, the defendant-interveners were excluded from discussions. Defendant-interveners have been unsuccessful in even securing basic information that the government currently has available about affected sales. Furthermore, the settlement did not ``reduce the impact of injunctive relief on logging contractors and their employees'' at all. Instead, it actually expanded the injunction by adding four more sales to the dozens that are already either enjoined by the Court, or not awarded by a decision of the Administration. Mr. Lyons gave the environmental plaintiffs more than what Judge Dwyer ordered in his original decision simply to settle the case and claim that his Northwest Forest Plan was ``back on track.'' This seems more like a capitulation, rather than a settlement.

   Mr. CRAIG. Senator, I also understand that Section 334 of the Interior Appropriations Bill was dropped, in part, because of concerns by the Administration that the measure would disrupt the negotiations that were underway, and could prevent the release of any of the enjoined timber sales. But, the settlement announced yesterday will not release any of the enjoined sales. 
   To add insult to injury, Mr. Lyons is nevertheless claiming that the settlement he announced yesterday will, indeed, allow the sales to go forward. I understand that nothing could be further from the truth. These sales are still on hold while the Forest Service tries to figure out how to search for slugs, slime and salamanders. Most importantly, the Administration is not willing to commit to a time-frame to complete these surveys. I believe this is a wrong that must be corrected.

   Mr. CRAIG. I agree. It seems to me that, based upon the Administration's performance, Congress should reinstate Section 334 or some similar measure in the FY2000 Supplemental Appropriations bill and direct the Administration to release these sales immediately. The Administration's present course will keep this conflict alive interminably, and expose the taxpayers to the liability of damage claims from contract holders. Moreover, this consistent record of deceit and chicanery from the Administration must stop. We made a good faith effort to respond to the Administration's concerns over Section 334 based, in part, on its promise to negotiate a fair settlement of this legal dispute. Not only did they not do that, they now have the audacity to claim publicly that they did, and spin their announcement in the most shameful of ways. If truth is the coin of the realm, Mr. Lyons and his cohorts are hopelessly bankrupt.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator from West Virginia has included our two colleagues from the State of Nevada. Today, Nevada is probably the lead mining State in our Nation as it relates to the production of gold. 
   For the last hour you have heard probably some of the most eloquent statements spoken on this floor on the issue of coal mining. The Byrd amendment does not deal only with coal, although it is extremely important, and the public attention of the last week has been focused on a judge's opinion about coal, coal mining in West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and up and down the Appalachia chain of this country. 
   But the amendment also has something else in it that my colleague from West Virginia and I agreed to some time ago: When we talk on this floor about mining, when we talk about the economy of mining, the environment of mining, and the jobs of mining, we would stand together; that we would not allow our political differences to divide us. Because if you support the economy of this country, you have to stand together. 
   I am absolutely amazed that the Speaker of the House or the senior Senator from West Virginia would get a letter from the White House of the kind to which both he and the Senator from Kentucky have referred. Lying? I hope not. Uninformed? I doubt it. Here is the reason I doubt their lack of information. 
   For the last 7 years, this administration has been intent on changing current mining law. I am referring primarily to the law of 1872. I am referring primarily to hard-rock mining on public lands, because the laws that the Senator from West Virginia referred to that were passed in 1977, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, have become law, and established the principles and the policies under which we would mine the coal of America. 
   Then, on top of that, came the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act--all of 
   them setting a framework and a standard under which we could mine the minerals and the resources of this country and assure our citizens it would be done in a sound environmental way. 
   As the laws of West Virginia, which are the laws of America, which are the laws this Senate passed, apply to coal mining, at least in the instances of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, they, too, apply to the mining of the west--to hard-rock mining, to gold mining, to silver mining, to lead and zinc mining, and to open-pit gravel operations of America. 
   Yet there is an attorney--not a judge, not an elected U.S. Senator, but an attorney--who sits at a desk at the Department of Interior and upon his own volition 2 years ago decided he would rewrite the mining law of this country--a law that had been in place since 1872, tested in the courts hundreds of times, and that in every instance one principle stood out and was upheld. That was the principle of mill sites and how the operating agency, primarily the BLM, could, upon the request of a mining operation under a mining plan uniform with its processes, ask for additional properties under which to operate its mine. Consistently, for over 100 years, the Federal agencies of this country have granted those additional mill sites. 
   The attorney I am referring to, prior to his job with the Secretary of Interior, was an environmental activist. In the late 1980s, he wrote a book. His book decried the tremendous environmental degradation that the mining industries of America were putting upon this planet. In that book, he said there is a simple way to bring the mining industry to its knees. ``If you can't pass laws to do it, you can do it through rule and regulation.'' Those are his words. He wrote it in the book, which was well read across America. 
   When I asked that solicitor to come before the subcommittee I chair, which is the Mining Subcommittee, I quoted back to him his own words and said: If that is not what you said, then what are you doing now? He didn't say yes, but he didn't say no. Here is what he did say. He said: I have reached out to every State director of every BLM operation in this Nation, and I have asked them if the process I have overruled by my decision is a process that has been well used by the agency. He said they responded to him: Not so--very lightly used and only used in recent years. 
   The tragedy of that statement is that it was a lie because the Freedom of Information Act shows that every State director wrote a letter to the solicitor a year before I asked him the question and every State director of every State office of the Bureau of Land Management said this is a practice in our manuals and has been used consistently since the 1872 law was implemented. 
   What did solicitor John Leshy do before the Mining Subcommittee of the Senate? He perjured himself. That is what he did. And the Freedom of Information Act shows that. 
   I would say to the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Kentucky, my guess is that the informational mind that wrote the letter that John Podesta sent to you came from an agency that had already perjured itself before the U.S. Senate. I know that as fact. I give that to you on my word and with my honor. 
   Therefore, in the Byrd-McConnell amendment is a provision that said: Mr. Leshy, you cannot arbitrarily or capriciously overturn over 100 years of mining law. That is not your job. 
   You are a hired attorney. You are not an  elected Senator or a President. That is our job--to change public policy and to do it in a fair and sound environmental way. 
   We are all environmentalists. The senior Senator from West Virginia said it so clearly. I say what I mean. And we all know as politicians and public people that none of our colleagues have ever run on the dirty air or the dirty water platform. We are all proud of our environmental records. We want the air and the water to be clean. 
   But have you ever driven to the mountains of the west or the mountains of West Virginia? They are rugged and steep. We must craft unique policies and procedures to mine the wealth from underneath those mountains. It is a tough struggle. We know it. We have learned in the last decades to do it in a much better way than our forebears. That is called good environmental policy and good stewardship. 
   Every one of us is an environmentalist. But we are not radical preservationists who would deny the thousands of working men and women in West Virginia and Kentucky no food for their table, no money in their pocket, or no education for their children. If you don't like the environment here, get in a car and drive down the road. To heck with your job and to heck with you. 
   I understand the young person in urban America today sitting at his or her keyboard, working the high-tech economy of our country, saying to the Senator from Idaho, West Virginia, and Kentucky: What are you talking about? Does it make much sense? We want a clean environment. Save the mountains of West Virginia, Idaho, Nevada, and Kentucky, and the plains of Texas. 
   Let me say to that marvelous young American sitting at his or her keyboard: As you touch that keyboard tonight, and it lights up for you and it energizes, it is the electricity generated by the coal of West Virginia that gave you the power to reach the Internet and to reach the stars beyond. That power surge through connections created of gold and silver came from the mines of Idaho, from the mines of Nevada, and from the Western States. 
   Please, America, broaden your vision of what it takes to make the leading economy of the world work so well. 
   It is our clean air, it is our clean water, and that we are proud of. But 60 percent of America's electricity is generated out of the coal mines of America, and the connections that create the fluidity of the flow of that electricity so there is less restriction is the gold and the silver of the West. That is what makes our country work so well. That is what makes our country the cleanest country in the world. 
   Our leadership, our policy, our clean coal technology, our ability not to tear up the Earth anymore--but when we do, we replace it, we reshape it, we change it--that is our law that causes it to happen. That is the law that this Senate crafted. So, no, we cannot be extreme nor can we be radical. We have to offer balance and we will offer that in the context of the best environment we can create. 
   I will not forget, when I asked Alan Greenspan to come before the Republican Policy Committee this spring to talk about surplus and how we handle them, afterwards I said: Mr. Greenspan, you watch our economy everyday; why is it so good? Why is it literally pulling the rest of the economy of the world with it? Last month, unemployment in this country was 4.1 percent; average wage, $13.39 an hour, the highest average wage ever and the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years. And we do it with the cleanest of the environments of the developed nations of the world. Why do we do it? Mr. Greenspan said it well: We just know how to do it better than anybody else. We know how to mine better than anybody else. We know how to create economies better than anybody else and, in almost every instance, we do it with the minimal form of government regulation. 
   The Senator from West Virginia makes a very clear case. It isn't that West Virginia was trying to do it better. They were. It is that this White House won't support this effort. They have not chosen to follow the route of the environmental community. They have chosen to follow the word of a few radical preservationists who would ask young Americans to turn on their computers tonight to the light of a candle. If it is the light of a candle that will lead this world, computers will not turn on, the economy will not energize, and the men and women of West Virginia will go hungry. 
   I support the Senator from West Virginia because he supports mining, as I do. It is time our Senate and the House bring balance to this issue. I hope they support attaching this critical amendment to the continuing resolution. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today in conjunction with my colleagues Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator THOMAS the Outfitter Policy Act of 1999. 
   This legislation is very similar to legislation I introduced in the past congress. As that legislation did, this bill would put into law many of the management practices by which federal land management agencies have successfully managed the outfitter and guide industry on National Forests, National Parks and other federal lands over many decades.  
   The bill recognizes that many Americans want and seek out the skills and experience of commercial outfitters and guides to help them enjoy a safe and pleasant journey through our forests and deserts and over the rivers and lakes that are the spectacular destinations for many visitors to our federal lands. 
   The Outfitter Policy Act would assure the public continued opportunities for reasonable and safe access to the special areas found throughout our public lands. It establishes high standards that will be met for the health and welfare of visitors who choose outfitted services. It will help guarantee that quality professional services. It will help guarantee that will be available for their recreational and educational experiences on federal land. 
   This legislation is needed because the management of outfitting and guiding services by this Administration had created problems that threaten to destabilize many of these typically small, independent outfitter and guide businesses. In addressing these problems, this legislation relies heavily on practices that have historically worked well for outfitters, visitors, and other users groups, as well as for federal land managers in the field. When the bill is enacted, it will assure that these past levels of service are continued and enhanced. 
   Previous hearings and discussions on prior versions of this legislation helped to refine the bill I am introducing today. This process provided the intended opportunity for discussion. It allowed for the examination of the historical practices that have offered consistent, reliable outfitter services to the public. The legislation I am now introducing is a result of that process. 
   I look forward to considering this legislation in the coming session of the 106th Congress.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that will set a new course for the Forest Service in determining fees for forest lots on which families and individuals have been authorized to build cabins for seasonal recreation since the early part of this century. I am pleased to have Senators MIKE CRAPO, CRAIG THOMAS, and CONRAD BURNS joining me in sponsoring this legislation, which is a companion bill to H.R. 3327, introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman GEORGE NETHERCUTT. 
   In 1915, under the Term Permit Act, Congress set up a program to give families the opportunity to recreate on our public lands through the so-called recreation residence program. Today, 15,000 of these forest cabins remain, providing generation after generation of families and their friends a respite from urban living and an opportunity to use our public lands. 
   These cabins stand in sharp contrast to many aspects of modern outdoor recreation, yet are an important aspect of the mix recreation opportunities for the American public. While many of us enjoy fast, off-road machines and watercraft or hiking to the backcountry with high-tech gear, others enjoy a relaxing weekend at their cabin in the woods with their family and friends. 
   The recreation residence programs allows families all across the country an opportunity to use our national forests. This quiet, somewhat uneventful  program continues to produce close bonds and remarkable memories for hundreds of thousands of Americans, but in order to secure the future of the cabin program, this Congress needs to reexamine the basis on which fees are now being determined. 
   Roughly 20 years ago, the Forest Service saw the need to modernize the regulations under which the cabin program is administered. Acknowledging that the competition for access and use of forest resources has increased dramatically since 1915, both the cabin owners and the agency wanted a formal understanding about the rights and obligations of using and maintaining these structures. 
   New rules that resulted nearly a decade later reaffirmed the cabins as a valid recreational use of forest land. At the same time, the new policy reflected numerous limitations on use that are felt to be appropriate in order to keep areas of the forest where cabins are located open for recreational use by other forest visitors. Commercial use of the cabins is prohibited, as is year-round occupancy by the owner. Owners are restricted in the size, shape, paint color and presence of other structures or installations on the cabin lot. The only portion of a lot that is controlled by the cabin owner is that portion of the lot that directly underlies the footprint of the cabin itself. 
   At some locations, the agency has determined a need to remove cabins for a variety of reasons related to ``higher public purposes'' and cabin owners wanted to be certain in the writing of new regulations that a fair process would guide any future decisions about cabin removal. At other locations, some cabins have been destroyed by fire, avalanche or falling trees, and a more reliable process of determining whether such cabins might be rebuilt or relocated was needed. It was determined, therefore, that this recreational 
   program would be tied more closely to the forest planning process. 
   The question of an appropriate fee to be paid for the opportunity of constructing and maintaining a cabin in the woods was also addressed at that time. Although the agency's policies for administration of the cabin program have, overall, held up well over time, the portion dealing with periodic redetermination of fees proved in the last few years to be a failure. 
   A base fee was determined 20 years ago by an appraisal of sales of comparable undeveloped lots in the real estate market adjacent to the national forest where a cabin was located. The new policy called for reappraisal of the value of the lot 20 years later--a trigger that led to initiation of the reappraisal process in 1995. 
   In the meantime, according to the policy, annual adjustments to the base fee would be tracked by the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD), which proved to be a faulty mechanism for this purpose. Annual adjustments to the fee based on movements of the IPD failed entirely to keep track of the booming land values associated with recreation development. 
   As the results of actual reappraisals on the ground began reaching my office in 1997, it became clear that far more than the inoperative IPD was out of alignment in determining fees for the cabin owners. 
   At the Pettit Lake tract in Idaho's Sawtooth National Recreation Area, the new base fees skyrocketed into alarming five-digit amounts--so high that a single annual fee was nearly enough money to buy raw land outside the forest and construct a cabin. Meanwhile, the agency's appraisal methodology was resulting in new base fees in South Dakota, in Florida, and in some locations in Colorado that were actually lower than the previous fee. 
   Very generally speaking, the value of the use of the forest lot is approximately the same for any cabin owner, whether they are tucked into what has become in recent years the Sawtooth National Recreation Area of Idaho, or high in the Sierra Mountain range of California, or in the lowland forests of the southeastern States. Yet Idaho cabin owners are now expected to pay a new average fee of $9,221 each year, while cabin owners in Kentucky will be paying a new average fee of $140. 
   At the request of the chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture in 1998, the cabin owners named a coalition of leaders of their various national and State cabin owner associations to examine the methodology being used by the Forest Service to determine fees. It became obvious to these laymen that analysis of appraisal methodology and the determination of fees was beyond their grasp, and a prestigious consulting appraiser was retained to guide the cabin owners through their task. The report and recommendations of the coalition's consulting appraiser is available from my office for those who might wish to examine the details. 
   At the bottom line, it was learned that the Forest Service--contrary to its own policy--was appraising and affixing value to the lots being provided to cabin owners as if this land were fully developed, legally subdivided, fee simple residential land. 
   In other words, the agency has been capturing the values associated with a variety of structures and services that the homeowners themselves (not the agency) provide. The Forest Service, in setting fees on this basis, has been capturing incremental values assigned by a developer at various stages of development for risk, expectations of profit and other factors. 
   My goal is to see that the cabin program remains affordable for American families. Consistent with the recommendations of the coalition's consulting appraiser, the methodology for determining fees is directed toward the value of the use to the cabin owner--not what the market would bear, should the Forest Service decide to sell off its assets. 
   This is highly technical legislation. Its purpose is to send a clear set of instructions to appraisers in the field and a clear set of instructions to forest managers to respect the results of appraisals undertaken to place value on the raw land being offered cabin owners. 
   I intend to hold hearings on this legislation early in the next session. I urge each of my colleagues to be in contact with cabin owners in their State during the congressional recess. There are more than 15,000 families out there who fear that the long tradition of cabin-based forest recreation is nearing an end because the agencies fee mechanism has made the program unaffordable for all but the wealthy. These cabin owners and I would wholeheartedly welcome the support and cosponsorship of all Senators for this important legislation.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, every year the President's Service Award honors volunteers for their efforts directed at solving critical social problems facing today's communities. This year, Hewlett Packard's Hispanic Student Outreach program, based in Boise, ID, has been named one of 21 honorees. This unparalleled distinction is the highest honor given annually by the President of the United States for volunteerism. The award is sponsored by the Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation for National Service. 
   As a 1999 honoree, program representatives traveled to Washington, DC, to participate in awards festivities October 13-15. This trip included a Capitol Hill Reception, an awards dinner and the participation in 1999 President's Service Awards Ceremony. 
   In 1995, Hewlett Packard employees in Boise, ID, started the Hispanic Student Outreach Program (HSOP) because they were concerned about the alarming 60 to 70 percent high school dropout rate among Hispanic youths. Based on the adopt-a-school concept, the program matches Hewlett Packard employees with teachers and students at a local middle school. The volunteers act as role models, motivating and encouraging the students to stay in school. The HSOP is the only program of its kind in Idaho. Through this program more than 250 Hewlett Packard volunteers have touched the lives of nearly 1,600 Hispanic students. 
   The program includes many activities, one of which is Career Day. These educational field trips for 7th and 8th grade students include the students to Hewlett Packard offices for hands-on science experiments, job shadowing and computer lab sessions, local science center trips, and university campus talks and tours. The college campus trips have proven especially significant by allowing the Hispanic middle school students to interact with Hispanic college students. Another effective program is the after school math tutoring program which pays local college students to tutor younger students. Professionals are also brought into the schools monthly to talk about career opportunities and the importance of math, science and writing skills beyond middle school.  
   Elena Tsuxton, the founder and Chairperson for the HSOP, commented that the ``program is absolutely thrilled to be receiving the President's Service Award.'' She saw it as a ``validation of our efforts that we are definitely meeting a critical need in our community and state. If we can help one more Hispanic student to finish school and go out to college, we will have met the HSOP program vision.'' 
   The President's Service Awards were created as the President's Volunteer Action Award in 1982 to honor outstanding individuals and organizations engaged in volunteer service directed at solving critical social problems while calling public attention to the contributions made by the nation's 93 million volunteers. In 1999, more than 3,500 nominations were submitted and reviewed in four activity areas: human needs, environmental needs, educational improvement, and public safety. A select panel of distinguished Americans judged the nominations based on achievement, meeting community needs innovation and mobilizing others to serve. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate this Idaho volunteer program for receiving this well deserved honor and thank them for their service to Idaho and its youth.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator from New Hampshire speak in what I call the common sense of New Hampshire. I think all Members have been frustrated by this administration running a flag up the pole every morning at the White House to see which way the wind is blowing and then not only attempting to shift Government policy but oftentimes bringing Government to an entire halt until they can determine if the direction in which they are heading is the right direction. 
   Another example of a misdirected effort by this administration was announced on Friday. I think all Members were paying attention to some degree and were anxious to hear how a Federal judge could decide to run the technological world in which we are living better than the marketplace itself. Sure enough, on Friday, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the judge down at the Justice Department who examined the ins and outs of Microsoft and the marketplace, has determined that Microsoft is a predatory monopoly.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, one editorial is by Robert Levy, a senior fellow of constitutional studies at the CATO Institute. He starts his op-ed piece:  
   Here's the lesson that high-tech companies can glean from Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings in the Microsoft case: If you're sufficiently ambitious, competent, and hard-working; if you're willing to risk your time and fortune; if you succeed at rising above your competition by serving customers with better products; then watch out, because our government will come down on your neck with the force and effect of a guillotine.  
   The editorial in the Wall Street Journal probably sums it up best of all. There is no question my colleagues from the other side of the aisle--or should I say their political machinery as expressed by--I don't want to call them outbursts, but certainly the expressions of our Attorney General, Janet Reno, are best summed up when they discussed the Microsoft case this morning in the Wall Street Journal. Here is their concluding paragraph:  
   But let's get to the real bottom line. Washington's crusade against Microsoft has fulfilled its purpose, serving as a great lever to pry open the wallets of the Silicon Valley. Where three years ago the technological plutocrats spent their surplus income on racing yachts and Ferraris and charity, now they patriotically send donations to Washington to support the fixer class and its retinue in the style to which it would like to become accustomed. 
   Steve Case of AOL, who happens to be on the other side of this issue, recognizes the problem, though. He says the future of technology will be decided in the political arena rather than the marketplace. My guess is, if that is true, your computers will not be working as well tomorrow as they are working today. 
   I came to the floor this morning to join with my colleague from Wyoming, not to discuss the Microsoft case; that is going to get played out over time, and I think we are going to have a Federal judge who will try to run the technology business of this country. Maybe we need to decide to start a new agency of our Federal Government called U.S. Department of Microsoft. If it is as profitable as Microsoft, maybe we can make a lot more money without taxing the American public to allow our Democrat colleagues on the other side of the aisle to spend it. 
   Certainly Microsoft is now making as much as $1 billion a month in cash to spend. It is obvious somebody else wants their hands on that or wants to break up that very profitable business.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, what I came to the floor to talk about is a combination of issues that come together in the issue of violence. We watched the great tragedy as a fellow entered a workplace in Hawaii the week before last and killed some of his coworkers. Last week in Seattle, another man went into a business and shot and killed individuals. All of us, as Americans, are tremendously frustrated by this expression of violence or people seeming to want to solve their personal problems by acting in a very violent fashion. The Washington Post poll on Sunday showed that the No. 2 issue among Republicans was violence in the schools; the No. 4 issue among Democrats, violence in the schools; the No. 2 issue among Independents in America was violence, violence in the schools. 
   Our President last week suggested we live in a very violent society, when in fact violence is down substantially in our country. It is true that it is. We have come off a very violent year, but over the last 7 years the average rate of acts of violence is dropping, in the broad sense. Yet we have had some of these tremendously public-attention-gathering events that caused the American public to be concerned, as they are. 
   Of course, the issue I want to speak briefly about this morning is the question of how we fix this violent expression in our society. Last week, the President, Janet Reno, and AL GORE said there is a quick and easy way to fix it: We just need to pass a few more laws; gun laws, that is. We need to add to the 25,000 to 30,000 gun laws that are already on the books. If we do that, we will make America a safer place in which to live. Or at least we will say, politically, to meet the polls the Washington Post presented to us on Sunday, that if we pass the 
   laws, the public at least will think America is a safer place in which to live. By that, we will be able to curry their political favor in the next election. 
   If gun laws make America a safer place, then what happened in Hawaii should not have happened; what happened in Seattle should not have happened; what happened in Littleton, CO, at Columbine High School, should not have happened--because there are laws to stop that. Mr. President, 13 laws were violated, tragically, by those two young men who later took their lives at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, after they had killed so many of their classmates. But there was a law to stop them. Then why did it happen? 
   I do not know the answer to why it happened. I do know they broke a lot of laws to cause it to happen. Yet our President last week, and the Vice President, and the Attorney General said give us more laws and the world will be a safer place. We have all been on this floor discussing, for well over a year, our frustrations with problems with our culture, problems with our public schools. People are acting out their frustrations in violent ways by taking other people's lives. My guess is, you cannot legislate a fix on that one. 
   There are other problems within our society that have to be addressed. So let me focus for just a moment on Hawaii. There, we all know what happened. The fellow has been caught. We all know now he probably, during that act, was mentally incompetent, mentally in trouble, mentally deranged. But his actions cost lives. 
   His actions happened in a unique environment, though. Hawaii has more gun laws, to control gun ownership and gun usage, than any other State in the United States. So would logic not follow, at least the logic of the President and the Vice President and the Attorney General, if that were so, Hawaii should have been a terribly safe place? Hawaii is the only State in the Nation where you not only register every gun you have with the local and State authorities, you also register the bullets--you register the ammunition. Somehow, politicians in the State legislature in Hawaii thought that would make Hawaii a safe place--the only State in the Nation. 
   It just so happens, Janet Reno and AL GORE and the President want us to do the same in this country. But it did not stop the individual who killed his colleagues in Hawaii. 
   How about a permit to purchase? Of course, that is exactly what some of our colleagues would want here. Hawaii requires a permit to purchase any kind of gun--not just one permit for multiple purchases but a permit for every purchase--and a full background check, and the requirement that you must be at least 21 years of age to own a gun. 
   What about assault pistols and Saturday night specials and all those kinds of buzzwords about guns that have become villains here on the floor for political purposes? All of those are outlawed in Hawaii. It is against the law to own them. It is against the law to have them. All of that is the law in Hawaii. The man who did the killings in Hawaii had met all of the requirements of the law. Yet the law did not protect the citizens whose families now mourn their death. 
   How about high-capacity magazines? That was a fully debated issue here on the floor of the Senate this past year. I was on the floor with Senator HATCH and Senator LAUTENBERG on that issue after Littleton. It is against the law in Hawaii. 
   Then there are the restrictions on places of possession, where you simply cannot have a gun: A business; you can't travel with one, only in the owner's home and in very restricted places; or if you are traveling from the home to the firing range or the pistol range for target practice, you may have a gun on your person. Those are tough laws in Hawaii. Yet people are dead. Of course, I mentioned transportation and the restriction on transportation. All of those are parts of the laws that guard citizens against the violent acts of others with the use of a firearm in the State of Hawaii. 
   The President, the Vice President, and the Attorney General seem not to understand that or, if they do, they are  finding another reason to express a need for greater gun control in this country. I am not sure what that need is. We all know our citizens are concerned about violence. 
   We all know we have citizens in our country who act out their frustrations in violent ways. It is tragic that we believe we can simply turn to Congress that will pass a law and, therefore, the violence will go away. 
   Are the President and the Vice President and the Attorney General trying to hide something? Are they trying to hide the fact that during the Clinton administration arrests and prosecutions of citizens who violate Federal firearms laws has dropped by over 70 percent? 
   Is the President trying to mask the fact that the Puerto Rican terrorists to whom he offered clemency were violators of Federal firearms laws and they killed American citizens? 
   Is this President, once again, trying to throw up a political smokescreen by simply saying we need more laws against the use of guns or the ownership of guns or the second amendment rights when he, the President, in my opinion, has violated the intent of the laws as they now stand? If you do not use the law, if you do not prosecute under the law, if you do not enforce the law, then the laws are no good. 
   That is the message I send to Bill Clinton today: Mr. Clinton, look at your own record. Your own Attorney General has let it be known to U.S. attorneys around the country that it is not worth their time to go after violators of Federal firearms laws. 
   There is a great program down in Richmond, VA, where a Federal prosecutor said to the local police: You arrest them and I will throw them away, I will put them behind bars if they use a gun in the commission of a crime. Crime dropped precipitously but, more important, crimes with a gun involved dropped dramatically. One fellow was arrested at a 7-Eleven with a stick, and after he was arrested, the local police said: Why are you robbing a 7-Eleven with a stick? 
   He said: Because if I used a firearm, they will lock me up down here. 
   Mr. President, Bill Clinton, don't you get the message now? We have plenty of laws on the books if we had an Attorney General who was a real cop, a supercop, a tough person who was saying to her U.S. attorneys: Let's put them behind bars if they use guns; let's throw those kids out of school who take a gun to school. They do not have the right to be in our schools if they are putting the rest of our kids in jeopardy. 
   Last year that happened over 3,000 times and only 13 were prosecuted. Sorry, Mr. President, sorry, Mr. Vice President, sorry, Ms. Attorney General, passing laws does not a safer world make. Enforcing the ones we have, being concerned about the culture, being concerned about the kids, their parents, and their educators in a way that not only makes a safe school but makes a concerned citizen is going to drop violence in America. Do not give the American public a political placebo by simply passing another law. 
   I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator DORGAN for outlining the intent of the effort underway by the Senator, myself, and 49 other colleagues. It was Senator BYRON DORGAN who approached me on the idea of creating a  WTO caucus to elevate the interests of agriculture in this up-and-coming round of the WTO planning session in Seattle in December. 
   I thank him for that vision. It has been fun working with him as we have created what I think is--sometimes unique in the Congress--a bipartisan, bicameral effort where we are all standing together on a list of items and issues we know are key for American agriculture. The Senator has outlined those on which we came together in a consensus format that we think are critical, that we presented to our Trade ambassador and to our Secretary of Agriculture. 
   Market access--we know how critically important that is; export subsidies and how they are used or used against us; State trading enterprises and their ability to mask the reality of subsidies from products that enter the marketplace in a nontransparent way; nontariff barriers that are used to block the movement we want to see in certain trade efforts. 
   All of these are the issues we have presented and because of our effort collectively, we have caused the Secretary of Agriculture and the Trade ambassador to suggest that No. 1 on the agenda of America's negotiators at the WTO will be agricultural issues. 
   Why are we concerned about it? Here is an example. Even after the Uruguay agreement which required tariff reductions of some 36 percent, the average bound agricultural tariff of WTO members is still 50 percent. In contrast the average U.S. tariff on agricultural imports is less than 10 percent--50 percent versus 10 percent on the average. Those are the kinds of relationships we have to see brought into balance and corrected. 
   The United States spends less than 2 percent, $122 million a year, of what the European Union spends on export subsidies. They spend $7 billion a year, buying down the cost of their product to present it into a world market. In fact, the European Union accounts for 84 percent of the total agricultural export subsidy worldwide. Subsidized foreign competition has contributed to the nearly 20-percent decline in U.S. agricultural exports, as Senator DORGAN so clearly pointed out on his charts a few moments ago. That dramatic reduction in the agricultural trade surplus from a $27 billion surplus for us in 1996 to just $11.5 billion this year says it very clearly. We have to do something on behalf of American agriculture to allow them a much fairer access to world markets. 
   Those are the issues we think are so critical as we deal with our world traders in Seattle. Nontariff barriers have become the protectionist weapon of choice particularly for the products derived from new technologies, as Customs tariffs are lowered. U.S. negotiators should prevent our trading partners from making crops and other foods produced with genetically modified organisms into second-class food products. Yes, we have to do a better job of convincing the world of our tremendous scientific capability. At the same time, they cannot arbitrarily be used as a target for nontariff barriers, as will be argued or debated in Seattle. 
   That is a collection of many of the issues with which we are going to be dealing. It is so important America recognizes the abundance of its agriculture and the unique situation we find ourselves in a world market today where we have had the privilege, through the productivity of America's farmers, to lead the world. We now do not lead when it comes to agricultural exports but we will search to cause it to happen, through the openness of the marketplace, through the fairness of competition we know American agriculture, given that opportunity, can offer. 
   Again, I thank Senator DORGAN for his cooperativeness and the ability to work together with our colleagues MIKE SIMPSON and EARL POMEROY from the House and, as Senator DORGAN mentioned, the Senator from Wyoming who is presiding at this moment. All of these are tremendously important and critical issues for our home States and for America at large. The abundance, the productivity of American agriculture hangs in the balance. To the consumer who walks in front of a supermarket shelf every day to see such phenomenal abundance, that in itself could decline if we are not allowed the world marketplace in which to sell the goods and services of American agriculture. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD agricultural trade priorities for the WTO Conference.

   Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is absolutely correct. When we came out of the Uruguay Round, when the round was heralded to have significant improvements in overall tariff levels, the problem was that most tariffs in the world were very high and ours were very low. 
   So we negotiated everybody down equally. We took a reduction in tariff. They, the European community, and others, took a reduction in tariff, which brought the average, other than the tariffs of the United States, down to 50 percent; and ours were down in the 10-percent-or-less range. So it was this kind of gradual slide. 
   I do not call that fair or balanced. It would have been different if the rest of the world had come down to a 20-percent-or-less range or properly on parity with the United States at 10 percent or less. That really is the way we should negotiate. 
   Thank goodness our Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, agrees with us now and has agreed they will not negotiate from that position in Seattle, that clearly the European community and others have to bring that down to a near level area.

   Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is absolutely correct. In fact, let me give an example of the disadvantage we were in that caused great frustration. 
   The Senator's State and my State produce a variety of grains. And we produce them at high rates of yield. They are high-quality grains. Yet we found shiploads of grains, barley in some instances, from foreign countries sitting at our docks, being sold into our markets at below our production costs. 
   How did that come about? That came about because the government of the producing country that sent the boatload of grain to the Port of Portland subsidized it down to a level that they could actually enter our market and compete against our producers who were getting 1950 prices for their 1998 barley crop. 
   How do you pay for a brand new tractor or a brand new combine with 1950 dollars in 1998? You do not. You run the old combine, you fix it up, or you go bankrupt. But that is exactly what was happening because our negotiators did not do the effective job of bringing down export subsidies in a way that would disallow the 
   greatest grain-producing country in the world to accept grain at its ports from foreign nations at below our cost of production. That is the best example I can give.

   Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is absolutely right. When he speaks of State  trading enterprises, the Canadian Wheat Board and the Australian Wheat Board control over one third of the world's wheat and wheat flour trade. As the Senator just explained, those negotiations are kept secret. Those trading enterprises buy the grain from farmers at the going market price. Then when they sell it, they do not report it. If they are to sell it well below the cost of the market, to get it into another country for purposes of sale, they sell it, and they are subsidized accordingly. If they can make money, they make money. But the point is, those kinds of transactions are not transparent. They are not reported. 
   In my State of Idaho, you can get a truckload of barley out of Canada to an elevator in Idaho cheaper than the farmer can bring it from across the street out of his field to that elevator. Why? Because that was a sale conducted by that particular trading enterprise, and it was sold well below the market, and, of course, that was not reported. You do not have marketplace competition. You cannot even understand it and compare figures, if you have no transparency in the marketplace. 
   State trading enterprises are known for that, and we have asked our Secretary of Agriculture and our trade ambassador to go directly at this issue. Even the farmer of Canada now recognizes that this is also disadvantaging the producer in Canada, to have this kind of a monopolistic power controlling the grain trade of the world.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks in support of the 4-H postal stamp resolution. 
   We must not fail to notice all the admirable efforts of youth today across the country. One fine example of young people joining together to make a positive impact in our country is the 4-H Youth Development Program. In the year 2002, 4-H will celebrate its 100th Anniversary. To recognize this national organization's achievements, I am submitting this resolution urging the U.S. Postal Service to create a stamp in honor of their centennial. 
   4-H is comprised of over 6 million youth, 45 million alumni, and over 600,000 volunteers. As the 4-H pledge states, they are working everyday to become positive members of ``their clubs, their communities, their country and their world.'' Although this program started at the turn of the century focusing on rural agriculture and homemaking, today it boasts a diverse group with nearly a quarter of its members coming from central cities. 
   With programs in every state and 80 other countries, 4-H has demonstrated the importance of its ideals. Members follow the motto ``To make the best better.'' Their mission is to create supportive environments enabling youth and adults to reach their full potential. In this way they become capable, competent and caring citizens. As a result, participation in 4-H programs has helped reduce violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and unethical behavior in millions of youth. 
   Every state has seen the benefits of 4-H membership. A recent report, ``Programs of Excellence'' demonstrates this. Published by the USDA, the report highlights noteworthy 4-H programs in various states from New Jersey to New Mexico. In my state of Idaho, 4-H achieved recognition for its programs in youth development and ethics in agriculture. Idaho's ``Know Your Government'' conferences were applauded for giving youth positive attitudes toward government and increasing civic involvement and government knowledge. 
   This positive organization deserves our support and recognition. A centennial stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service is the perfect way to honor and celebrate a job well done.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I'm pleased to have joined Senators GORDON SMITH, BOB GRAHAM, MAX CLELAND, and several other colleagues this week in introducing S. 1814. This bill is a new, improved version of the Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act--or, as we call it, the ``AgJOBS'' bill. 
   We are facing a growing crisis--for both farm workers and growers. 
   We want and need a stable, predictable, legal work force in American agriculture. 
   Willing American workers deserve a system that puts them first in line for available jobs with fair, market wages. We want all workers to receive decent treatment and equal protection under the law. 
   Consumers deserve a safe, stable, domestic food supply. 
   American citizens and taxpayers deserve secure borders and a government that works. 
   Yet Americans are being threatened on all these counts, because of a growing labor shortage in agriculture, while the only program currently in place to respond, the H-2A Guest Worker Program, is profoundly broken. 
   Last year, the Senate adopted meaningful H-2A reform, on a bipartisan vote of 68-31. Unfortunately, that bipartisan floor amendment did not survive the last round of negotiations over the omnibus appropriations bill last year. 
   This year, the problem is only growing worse. Therefore, we are introducing a new, improved bill. The name of the bill says it all--``AgJOBS''. 
   Mr. President, our farm workers need this reform bill. 
   There is no debate about whether many--or most--farm wokers are aliens. 
   They are. And they will be, for the foreseeable future. The question is whether they will be here legally or illegally. 
   Immigrants not legally authorized to work in this country know they must work in hiding. 
   They cannot even claim basic legal rights and protections. They are vulnerable to predation and exploitation. They sometimes have been stuffed inhumanly into dangerously enclosed truck trailers and car trunks, in order to be transported, hidden from the view of the law. 
   In fact, they have been known to pay ``coyotes''--labor smugglers--$1,000 and more to be smuggled into this country. 
   In contrast, legal workers have legal protections. 
   They can assert wage, safety, and other legal protections. They can bargain openly and join unions. H-2A workers, in fact, are even guaranteed housing and transportation. 
   Clearly, the status quo is broken. 
   Domestic American workers simply are not being found to fill agricultural jobs. 
   Our own General Accounting Office has estimated that 600,000 farm workers--37 percent of the total 1.6 million agricultural work force--are not legally authorized to work in this country. 
   That estimate is low; it's based on self-disclosure by illegal workers to government interviewers. 
   Some actually have suggested that there is no labor shortage, because there are plenty of illegal workers. This is not an acceptable answer. 
   Congress has shown its commitment over the past few years to improve the security of our borders, both in the 1996 immigration law and in subsequent appropriations. 
   Between computerized checking by the Social Security Administration and audits and raids by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, more and more employers are discovering they have undocumented employees; and more and more workers here illegally are being discovered and evicted from their jobs. 
   Outside of H-2A, employers have no reliable assurance that their employees are legal. 
   It's worse than a Catch-22--the law actually punishes the employer who could be called ``too diligent'' in inquiring into the identification documents of prospective workers. 
   The H-2A status quo is slow, bureaucratic, and inflexible. It does nothing to recognize the uncertainties farmers face, from changes in the weather to global market demands. 
   The H-2A status quo is complicated and legalistic. DOL's compliance manual alone is 325 pages. 
   The current H-2A process is so hard to use, it will place only 34,000 legal guest workers this year--2 percent of the total agricultural work force. 
   Finally, the grower can't even count on his or her government to do its job. 
   The GAO has found that, in more than 40 percent of the cases in which employers filed H-2A applications at least 60 days before the date of need, the DOL missed statutory deadlines in processing them. 
   The solution we need is the AgJOBS Act of 1999. 
   Our new, improved AgJOBS bill includes three main parts: 
   First, it would create a national AgJOBS registry. 
   This new program would match willing workers anywhere in the U.S. with available farm work. Workers would be  free to work where they want and for whom they want. 
   Domestic American workers would be given first preference in job referrals. Once no domestic worker is available for a job, an ``adjusting'' worker could receive a referral. If no domestic or adjusting worker is available, an employer could then use the H-2A program. 
   This is essentially the same job registry as in last year's bill, expanded to accommodate the new category of adjusting workers. 
   Second, it includes much-needed reforms to the H-2A program. 
   Currently, red tape, regulation, and bureaucracy has rendered the H-2A program almost completely ineffective. 
   Our reformed H-2A program would expedite the process and more closely reflect market reality. Current red tape, delays, 
   and paperwork would be reduced or eliminated. Growers would be assured of the timely availability of workers. 
   Employers still would be required to provide transportation in out of the U.S., as under the current H-2A program. Employers must provide either a housing allowance or actual housing to H-2A workers. After 3 years, actual housing would be required, unless the governor of a state certified a housing shortage. This is a more stringent housing requirement than last year's bill. 
   The premium wage guaranteed to H-2A workers--called the Adverse Economic Wage Rate or ``AEWR''--would be based more accurately on prevailing wage paid to similar workers in that area. This is similar to current law, but other jobs, those not closely related, would be excluded from the calculation of the AEWR. This simply would ensure that the AEWR more closely reflected prevailing wages for that particular type of work. In the case of low-wage jobs, a premium would be added to the wage. This would still mean H-2A wages higher than virtually all non-H-2A farm worker wages. In other words, current H-2A workers would still have significant wage protection, and virtually all new H-2A workers would get a raise. 
   Third, the bill creates a one-time-only new Category called ``Adjusting'' Workers. 
   Experienced farm workers who are already in the U.S. would be allowed to stay if: 
   --They have worked at least 150 days in agriculture in the 12 months before the October 27 introduction of this bill; 
   --They agree to work at least 180 days a year, only in agriculture, for at least 5 of the next 7 years; during this 5-7 year adjustment period, they would be in a temproary, non-immigrant status; 
   --They return to their home country at least 2 months a year (during the 5-7 year adjustment period. Those with U.S.-born children--i.e., children who were already U.S. citizens--could stay year-round, but must agree to work in agriculture 240 days/year. 
   ``Adjusting'' workers would be earning the right to keep their jobs or move to other agricultural jobs. Eventually, they could earn the right to a so-called ``green card''--in other words, permanent residency. 
   For one moment, I want to mention, and then dispose of, the ``A-Word": 
   This bill is not about amnesty, for several reasons. I have always been opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants. If this were an amnesty bill, I'd be against it. 
   This bill is about workers who are already here, for employers who need them and value their services, earning a right to stay. 
   Amnesty is a gift; this bill is about earning a right. Amnesty means one is home free; this bill is about stabilizing the agricultural work force and conditions residency on a 5-7 year agreement to continue in farm work. 
   The level of documentation required to prove a worker already has been working in the U.S. is much stricter than for any past amnesty law. 
   In closing, Mr. President, this is win-win legislation. 
   It will elevate and protect the rights, working conditions, and safety of workers. It will help workers--first domestic American workers, then other workers already here, then foreign guest workers--find the jobs they want and need. 
   It will assure growers of a stable, legal supply of workers, within a program that recognizes market realities. The adjusted-worker provisions also will give growers one-time assistance in adjusting to the new labor market realities of the 21st Century. 
   It will assure all Americans of a safe, consistent, affordable food supply. 
   The nation needs the Smith-Graham-Craig-Cleland AgJOBS bill. I invite the rest of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors; and I urge the Senate and the House to act promptly to enact this legislation into law.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I especially thank the Senator from Wyoming for coming to the floor this morning to discuss with all of us some very important issues and building a perspective that I do not think the American people hear or have an opportunity to read or understand as it relates to the politics inside the beltway and what is good or not so good for the American people. 
   We just heard the chairman of a key appropriations subcommittee who spent the last 6 months crafting an appropriations bill to run a major portion of our Government while the President was out traveling around the world and traveling around this country not engaged and not focused on the budget. When the appropriations bill to fund these key areas of Government finally arrived at his desk, the President vetoed it and said: I didn't get my way. 
   I am always frustrated by an executive branch of Government that does not come to the Hill and sit down with us and work out our differences in the proper forum but chooses to set the stage of politics over the key issues that are substantive when it comes to law enforcement and safe streets and safe communities for our families and our country. 
   I have struggled with this President over the last several months, especially when he decided to allow terrorists out of prison. That is exactly what happened. I do not know of any other way to say it. This President personally decided that he was going to offer clemency to convicted terrorists. What were they convicted of? Violation of Federal firearms laws. That is law enforcement. Those are Federal laws violated by people who 
   killed others and violated Federal explosive and firearms laws. And this President says he is for law enforcement by putting more cops on the street, then he totally demoralizes or destroys the very foundation of law enforcement by saying: Arrest them and put them in prison and I will let them out because it is ``politically correct'' to do so. 
   Shame on you, Mr. President; shame on you and your politics at this moment because somehow you cannot have it both ways, at least I hope you cannot, but you are trying. You are also trying to make the use of a firearm a major political issue. Yet you offer clemency to those who violate the very laws you ought to be enforcing. Shame on you, again, Mr. President. 
   The Senate worked its will and did an excellent job with those appropriations bills. I do not deny the executive branch the right to participate. They have a legitimate role to play in the shaping of the budget. But in the final analysis, it is the Constitution that says it is the right and the appropriate role of the Congress to appropriate moneys, and it is the responsibility of the Executive to administer those moneys within the policy and the framework established for the Congress of the United States. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased you are finally going to lay off Social Security. Remember what our President said 2 years ago? Save Social Security; don't spend a dime of the surplus. Then this year in his state of the budget message he says: Well, gee, there is so much money there, why don't we spend a little of it. We will save 60 percent and we will spend the rest over the next 15 years and, oh, by the way, I also want to raise taxes during a time of unprecedented surpluses in our country because I have so many great ideas that I want for people, and I want to spend all this money and I want to raise your taxes to do it and I also want to spend some of the Social Security money to do so. 
   Thank goodness the Congress, the Republican Congress, stood up and said: No, Mr. President. The House passed a provision to provide a lockbox so that Social Security surpluses would be dedicated to Social Security and would pay down the liabilities of Social Security and strengthen the ability of that great system to support its obligations in the outyears. 
   We tried to pass it in the Senate, and guess who opposed it. The Democrats. They filibustered it and would not allow a vote and constantly said: We are all for Social Security. Why would they not guarantee that its moneys would be assured a lockbox provision? The American people said they wanted it. The seniors of America, recognizing the importance of Social Security to their very existence, said that is the right thing to do, but the President said: No, I want to spend about 30 percent or 40 percent of the Social Security surplus over the next 15 years. 
   Just in the last month, it is fair and important to say the President has finally agreed that he will leave Social Security surpluses alone and, thank goodness, Mr. President, you have agreed with us because that would have been a phenomenal fight because we were committed and dedicated, even though it was filibustered in the Senate by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we are going to protect the Social Security surplus. Period. End of statement. 
   Let's talk about the rest of the budget we are battling. A couple of weeks ago, I was amazed to see the President kind of quietly come out and then not so quietly say: We need more money to spend besides the record surpluses we have. 
   I have served Congress and the people of Idaho longer than I want to admit--19 years. I am amazed that only last year did I begin to see a slight surplus and this year a substantial surplus. Never at a time of surplus have I ever heard of a President asking for a tax increase. But this President did because of all these great new social ideas, that somehow is going to help people by taking more money away from them and then giving it back to them in politically correct ways. 
   I am not sure that ever helps the American family to take money away from them and then try in some form to decide what is the right way to give it back. We said: No, Mr. President. 
   Finally, just this last week, after having tried for well over 6 months, the President is slowly backing away from the tax idea, although yesterday he came through the backdoor again and said: Well, let's adjust some fees and let's see if we can come up with a little more revenue. Shame on you, Mr. President. America's taxpayers are being taxed at an all-time rate--high rate. While you are saying it is only a tobacco tax, a tax is a tax is a tax. 
   And, of course, while I do not smoke, and I wish that others would not--there are many who do who should not--yet we are going to tax them. Well, we are not going to tax them because I don't think this Congress will stand for it. 
   I have always understood the politics of surplus is more difficult than the politics of deficit spending. When I  first came to Congress in 1980, we had deficits, and they grew very rapidly over fights on budget priorities. But it was not until 1994, when the American people said: Enough of deficits. I'm sorry; a Democrat-controlled Congress is out of control, with a President who wants to spend more money, and we're going to change those dynamics, and they elected a more conservative Congress, a Republican Congress. 
   We said we were going to balance the budget by the year 2002 and we would shape a process that would take us there. Thank goodness for a strong economy and for a fiscally responsible Congress and a monetary supply that stayed in sync. We are now at a balanced budget. We had it last year. We now have a balanced budget and surpluses this year. And I see more wrangling over budgets and spending priorities than I have ever seen in all my years here. 
   I understand the politics of surplus are difficult. But why shouldn't we be giving back to the American people some of their hard-earned money? It is their money. But, no, we have had a President who has insisted on constantly spending it. We put a marvelous tax package together this year, going right at middle America, to enhance the lives of our citizens, to improve the condition of America's families and communities, and this President vetoed it because he wants to prescribe how the money gets spent because somehow we have a White House that says: I know better. I know I can outthink the American family. I can shape a school system better than the American family and the American community because somehow I abide by this unique knowledge of knowing how to do it better. 
   I disagree with you, Mr. President. Thank goodness, we have a Congress that does. That does not mean we are not going to work out our differences. The President has a right to participate. But I do not think he has a right to do one thing and say another, and do another thing and say something else. And that is what he has done with law enforcement. That is what he is doing in education. That is clearly what he has done on Social Security. That is what he is now trying to do with the budget.

   Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for acquiring this time to speak on these key issues. It is very important the American people see the difference. Politics should not be the business of hypocrisy. It ought to be the business of fact. Saying one thing and doing another should not stand. Yet we have had about 7 long years of it with this President. 
   Mr. President, I say no to those kinds of attitudes and reactions, and I think it is important that some of us speak out on it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of listening tonight to both you and the Senator from Florida discuss the introduction of what we call ag jobs. I must tell you that I am pleased to join with you as a shaper and an original cosponsor of this legislation because both you and Senator GRAHAM have so clearly outlined a fundamental human problem in our country that the Department of Labor refuses to look at with any creative form of resolution and for which America's agricultural base pleads for a resolution. 
   In the mid-1960s, I had the great privilege of serving as a national officer of the Future Farmers of America. During that year, I traveled the length and the breadth of America in behalf of American agriculture. From the beautiful green pea fields of eastern Oregon to the San Joaquin Valley of California where cotton was in abundance to the orange groves of Florida just at the time they were blooming, the one thing that was constantly present was a migrant farm labor force, working with those in production agriculture to pollinate, to weed, to thin, and, most important, to harvest the abundance of American agriculture. 
   During that year when I was traveling, I often gave speeches that said the American farmer produces enough for himself or herself and 55 other Americans. We, as Americans, were tremendously proud of that statistic. 
   Today, if I were making the same trip, I would say that the American farmer produces enough for himself or herself and 155 Americans and another 100 foreign mouths. Oh, we are so tremendously proud of America's productive capability. One of the reasons we are proud is not only are we unique in what we do, but we are tremendously efficient in how we do it. 
   We have always been labor intensive. It is the character of the industry, and  we have chosen that labor from where it was available. We have paid them good wages, but we must have them and we need them for the American consumer, for the abundance of the market shelf, and for the productivity of production agriculture. It is all a part of a total picture. 
   Starting several decades ago, we began to run into problems. We did not have a Department of Labor that would work collectively and productively with American agriculture to deal with a very significant part of the equation that I have just outlined, and that was the labor side. We have a H-2A program, and Senator GRAHAM has already outlined it. We recognize about 34,000 people are registered in that program on an annual basis and those are the ``foreign guest workers.'' Yet we have nearly 600,000 foreign illegal aliens in the agricultural job market. 
   What is wrong here? What is wrong is a phenomenally complicated process and, Mr. President, you held the book up tonight--thousands of pages of procedure, controls, regulations, and phenomenal forms for oftentimes illiterate people to fill out to identify with the job market that is clearly in this country. They fall victim to a term we call ``the coyote,'' that exploiter of human beings, the one who takes the opportunity to say: Ah, but for $1,000, I can get you across the border and into the farm fields of eastern Oregon or southwestern Idaho; pay me the money and I will find you the job. 
   Weeks later, they are oftentimes rounded up by the Immigration Service and whisked back across the border, and they are treated as less than human. Oftentimes, they are crammed into vehicles like sardines in a can. We hear the story almost every year about the vehicle that overturns and splits and spills open, and oftentimes these innocent people are killed. 
   That is one side of the story we are trying to solve, and I say to the Department of Labor: Why can't you work with us to solve this problem? Why can't we develop a national registry of domestic workers and from that point move to a system that allows workers into our country as foreign guest workers under an H-2A program and a system that recognizes those who are already here, 600,000-plus? 
   That is what we offer tonight in ag jobs. We think it is tremendously straightforward and it is honest. Yes, there will be opposition, to which the Senator from Oregon who is presiding at this moment, has spoken. I say to those who oppose, they oppose for all of the wrong reasons. They ought to sit down with us to see where we can work out our differences. 
   I have spoken to the human side of the equation, but I talk tonight about the whole picture of agriculture. There is the other side. There is the agricultural producer who should be allowed to have access to a stable, reliable, and available workforce. 
   The Department of Labor says today: If you need a job, advertise for it. So the onion farmer in southwestern Idaho advertises in Wisconsin, or New York, or Florida that he has a 2- or 3-week field job? I doubt it. It does not happen; it will not happen. But that is basically what the law of the day requires, and that is why there are 600,000-plus illegal aliens in our country 
   because the current law isn't working, it is denying the farmer his or her reliable workforce, and it is literally opening the doors of our borders and saying: Come in, illegals. The jobs are here for you. 
   As a sovereign nation, that is something we should not tolerate; and that is our inability and our unwillingness to control a border environment. And we do that if we have a reasonable and easily accessible system so foreign guest workers can find their way into it and find the jobs they seek. That is what our bill offers to that workforce. 
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics has just come out with an interesting figure that says, in the next 15 years, at today's current economic growth rates, there will be a deficit of at least 20 percent in our workforce. If we take all of the humans in America, all of the willing and available workers, all of those capable of working, and find them jobs, in this economy, there will still be a deficit of 20 percent. 
   What does that say? That if we are to maintain our productivity and our growth rates in this country, and our economic level of opportunity, that we have to find a legal, responsible, and easily accessible way of allowing foreign guest workers into our country to work at the jobs that will be there; and then for them to be able to return to their homes, having had a positive experience in this country and having allowed our country to grow and to prosper, as it should. That is what our legislation is about, only it is for agriculture specifically. 
   So we hope our colleagues will look at this legislation and join with us in it. As we move into next year's session, we will, obviously, be holding the necessary and appropriate hearings on it to address what is a very real problem in my State, in Oregon, in Florida, in every other agricultural State in the Nation, and that includes nearly all of the lower 48, and certainly even the State of Hawaii. 
   So I hope that is the story that comes from the introduction of our legislation tonight. It is one that I think is critically important for us.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important matter brought to my attention by one of my constituents. I recently received a letter from G. Ross Darnell, and he pointed out the importance of educating our students about the Constitution. In his letter, though, he also mentioned that our educational system has not been performing well in this area. I agree with Mr. Darnell on both points. 
   The importance of education in preserving our liberties has been realized since the founding of our Republic. In 1787, Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison with his reflections on the new Constitution. In that letter he said, ``I hope the education of the common people will be attended to; convinced that on their good sense we may rely with the most security for the preservation of a due degree of liberty.'' Jefferson knew if the people were not aware of the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution they would be powerless to stop any encroachments upon them. I'm sure Mr. Jefferson would be quite alarmed at the state of ignorance today. 
   While it is a cliche that a generation always finds faults with the one which follows, there is no denying that in terms of constitutional knowledge, the level of ignorance is severe. A poll of teenagers last year illustrates this. Only forty-one percent could name the constitutionally ordained branches of our government, only twenty-one percent could say that there were one hundred senators, and only thirty-six percent knew one of the most important phrases in our nation's history: ``We the People .....'' These teenagers are moving into adulthood, but they are not taking with them a knowledge of our nation's Constitution. 
   It is undeniable that our educational system has failed to address this deficiency. Many experts have documented the fact that most textbooks do not devote a sufficient amount of space to exploring the Constitution and the ideas and personalities which shaped it. Even the national history standards proposed a few years ago failed to address adequately the importance of this document. The Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence, is the very foundation upon which our nation is built. To not devote sufficient space in textbooks or time in class to it is a tragedy not only for students but also for the nation. 
   It's also troubling to note that when constitutional history is discussed today, the Founding Fathers are portrayed as racist, sexist elitists. This caricature of the Founders, which fails to take into account how the Constitutional Convention tried to balance the idealism of the Declaration of Independence with the political realities of the day, is only abetted by the shallowness of the constitutional teaching in our schools. How can students weigh the competing claims in this important debate when they don't even know what is in the Constitution? 
   How should this deficiency be addressed? I'm not here to suggest another federal program which would impose standards on the state and local school districts. I have long believed that curriculum is best determined by local school boards which are much closer to the people than we are here in Washington, D.C. Instead, I am today using this opportunity in the United States Senate to urge my colleagues to support states, school districts, and teachers beginning a wholesale effort to renew in our youth a respect and knowledge for the Constitution. Our young people need to know the rights guaranteed by this seminal document. As Thomas Jefferson said, our liberties may depend on it.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, few issues present stakes as high for our country as global climate change. Worst case scenarios involving elevated temperatures and sea levels are disturbing to many people. On the other hand, capping energy use at levels lower than those in the growth-oriented nineties could chill our economy faster than it would cool down the climate. 
   Responsible governance includes environmental stewardship. However, the ultimate obligation of any government official anywhere is to win freedom for the governed who do not now have it, and to protect freedom for those who are already free. 
   By freedom, I mean the opportunity to achieve one's true potential, whether as an individual, a community, or a nation. And isn't it marvelous how freedom spawns discovery and innovation? And, in turn, how discovery and innovation solve problems and create opportunities? 
   Mr. President, we need consensus on climate change. But there is no magic dust that we can sprinkle on ourselves to make us all embrace the same scientific and economic conclusions on this issue. Our only chance lies in good, hard work toward that end. 
   Where should we begin? Knowledge leads to understanding, and understanding to consensus. Mr. President, at the moment we have some critical gaps in our knowledge of climate phenomena. 
   We know not nearly enough about the Earth's capacity to assimilate carbon dioxide. We know not nearly enough about natural variability of the climate over years, much less over centuries and millennia. Our ability to measure and predict changes is not developed. Adequate measurement and modeling machinery is not even invented yet. Scientists at the National Research Council published a report in September, 1999, that confirm these observations. In the preface of that Report, they state:  
   It would be a misinterpretation of U.S. administration policy and agreements at the Kyoto conference to conclude that the causes and characteristics of global change are sufficiently clear that scientific inquiry in this area should be limited to mitigation measures. * * * * * 
   A great deal more needs to be understood ..... about global environmental change before we concentrate on ``mitigation'' science. We do not understand the climate system well enough to clarify the causes and likelihoods of rapid or abrupt climate changes.  
   Likewise, Mr. President, we need to understand the economic implications of the leading policy alternatives. One year ago the U.S. Department of Energy published a sobering analysis of potential economic impacts of implementing the Kyoto agreement. But shouldn't we hear from other agencies as well? What would the Department of Labor have to say? How about Agriculture and Transportation? Let's look before we leap. 
   A third area we must explore is technology. What do we really know today about how energy will be produced in this country in 20 years? What do we know about how--and how much--it will be consumed? Can we develop policies to encourage real improvement in energy efficiency without trying to pick the market winners and losers? 
   Mr. President, we are now living in the Information Renaissance. But many in government behave as though we are still in the Dark Ages. If some of us in Congress have difficulty gaining access to government-controlled information in this area--and all too often we have--can you imagine the obstacles to private citizens? 
   Let's get all the information--science, technology, economics--together. Let's make it freely and widely available. All Americans have a right to know what their Government knows--and what their Government is doing--about climate change. 
   Knowledge in the science, economics, and technology of climate change will yield to understanding. We should all be open to unexpected discovery, whether in pleasant surprises or confirmation of today's predictions. 
   While we are waiting to close our knowledge gaps, why not go ahead with some steps that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while accomplishing other benefits along the way? Every minute wasted in traffic tie-ups is that much more carbon dioxide man releases into the atmosphere. If we apply technology to solving traffic problems and the greenhouse gas theory fizzles out, at least our efforts will have saved time for busy travelers and commuters.  
   Let's find ways to encourage individual citizens, farms and small businesses, communities and States, to take some no-regrets action to lower greenhouse gas emissions. But let's not offer the false hope that their efforts will be rewarded in some kind of negotiable credits issued in an international currency of carbon caps or fuel rations. 
   Mr. President, the two companion bills that several colleagues and I are introducing today set out to do all these things with regard to the global climate change issue. My legislation does not pretend to answer all the questions. Rather, it lays out a framework for reaching consensus that begins by developing knowledge; and from knowledge understanding; and from understanding consensus. 
   Mr. President, let's get stared. I welcome my colleagues to join me as cosponsors.

   Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, seven years ago legislation was enacted, with my support, to create a memorial on the National Mall honoring Thomas Paine. A site has been selected and approved at 1776 Constitution Ave. However, the memorial project needs to be reauthorized until 2003 in order to raise the necessary funding to complete construction. Today I want to spend a moment to recognize the great American patriot, Thomas Paine. 
   Thomas Paine thrived on new ideas, was broad minded and progressive. Through brilliantly written persuasion, he advocated four concepts which have since become cornerstones of American society and governance: independence, representation, unity, and leadership. Thomas Paine was the first patriot to call for a ``Declaration of Independence'' and a ``Continental Charter'' which proposed the basic principles of our constitution: ``securing freedom and property ..... and above all things, the free exercise of religion.'' 
   Another cornerstone was laid when Paine had the foresight and courage to publicly advocate a representative, democratic/republican form of government for this country. He influenced George Washington and numerous other Revolution leaders as he stressed that government was a necessary evil which could only become safe when it was representative and altered by frequent elections. The function of government's role in society ought only be to regulate society and therefore be as simple as possible. 
   Paine also introduced our status as a united, sovereign country with due regard for individual and states rights. He coined the phrases ``Free and Independent States of America'' and ``United States of America.'' 
   The last cornerstone that Thomas Paine set for our country was the concept of a world leader fighting for human rights. Paine publicly denounced chattel slavery and was the first patriot to publish a defense of the rights of women in America. In his papers American Crisis I, Paine wrote:  
   These are the times that try men's souls....... Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; ..... What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.  
   Paine has often been quoted by the leaders of this country on the great ideas of American independence, freedom and democracy--concepts which he was and still is unmatched in expressing. Without Paine's vision and initiative, our country would not be the republican world power that it is today. 
   I am honored to have been able to help authorize his memorial seven years ago. I introduced S. 1681 to reauthorize the memorial until 2003 and I am glad that language from S. 1681 has been included in this bill to let this important work continue. Americans will be remembering Thomas Paine for generations to come, because of what we are doing today.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to engage in what has become an annual debate on campaign finance reform. But I am also here to honor Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, who has chosen to be a leader on this issue for all the right reasons and, most importantly, the right principled reasons. To defend our Constitution and to defend free speech in this country is an admirable cause. I thank him for engaging in it. 
   Along with that kind of leadership comes the risk of errors. I see that this weekend the New York Times, in its rather typical fashion, has decided to engage in this debate by simply calling names, suggesting that the Senate is a ``bordello'' and that MITCH MCCONNELL is its ``madam.'' Shame on you, New York Times. I thought you were better than that. But then again, why should we think you are better than that on this issue, because you have chosen to take what you call high ground, which is in fact exclusive ground, that only you as journalists would have to speak out for America when no one else would have that opportunity. 
   That is what this debate is all about. It is why I come to the floor, not only to support MITCH MCCONNELL but to support these important principles that somehow the New York Times just flat stumbles over on its way to its version of the truth. 
   There is another analogy I might use. It is similar to suggesting that this form of regulation is like a new architectural design for the Navy that gave us the Titanic. I suspect it is not new at all. In fact, it is not reform at all. And we have been up this creek one too many times. 
   We are here today and we are engaged in a most serious way to debate what I think is an important issue. The Senate has 
   held more than 100 votes on campaign finance reform during the past dozen years. Although the definition of ``reform'' has fluctuated widely over that period of time, the essence of this legislation remains the same--to restrict and stifle political speech. 
   The bill now before us would also federalize or nationalize vast parts of America's politics. For the average citizen listening in today, let me repeat that phrase. Do you want your Government to federalize or nationalize political free speech in this country, to shape it and control it, and to tell candidates and their supporters how to speak? Someday they might even suggest what to speak. That is really the importance of why we come to this floor today to debate this most important topic. 
   Under the new plan offered by Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD, there would be once again an across-the-board ban on soft money for any Federal election activity. 
   You have already heard the sponsors and the supporters of this bill talk on and on about how soft money is bad, about how President Clinton rented out the Lincoln Bedroom in exchange for huge soft money donations, or how foreign nationals paid tens of thousand of dollars during the President's 1996 election campaign. They say all soft money is bad. Or should we say that Bill Clinton misused it and so, therefore, it is bad? I believe that is the kind of connection they are using. 
   Sorry, Senator MCCAIN; sorry, Senator FEINGOLD. Don't put me in the same category with Bill Clinton. Put me in another category. Put me in a category that recognizes the importance of free speech and that recognizes there are appropriate ways of handling it. 
   As I have said in the past, and I say again, a total ban on soft money will have a significant negative effect on the lives of thousands of citizens who believe it is their American right to become engaged in the political process. In the end, you will hear no disagreement on this point from the sponsors or the supporters of the legislation. 
   Let me take a few moments to explain how this proposal of a ban on soft money will affect thousands of citizens involved in America's politics. 
   Here in Washington, the national party organizations receive money from donors. The donations can be from individuals, lobbying groups that represent their members, businesses, or unions. The political organizations receiving these donations include the Republican National Committee, the Democratic National Committee, the Republican Senatorial Committee, the Democrat Senatorial Committee, the Republican National Congressional Committee, and the Democratic National Congressional Committee. 
   All of these political organizations receive donations from contributors. What happens next is--and it is very important that we follow this because this is supposed to be the negative side of politics; this is supposed to be the side that corrupts. And yet, so far, it is clearly outside the Halls of the Senate. The money flows to these national political organizations. 
   What happens next? These political organizations distribute some of that money to their respective political parties in counties and localities all over the country. As you can imagine, there are thousands of State, county, and local political offices that receive this financial aid. 
   Then, under certain conditions already defined by State and Federal law, the local parties use this money for activities such as purchasing campaign buttons, bumper stickers, posters, and yard signs to express an opinion, to express an idea. The money is also used by voter registration activities on behalf of the partys' Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees. The money is also used for multicandidate brochures and even sample ballots. 
   Can you imagine corruption yet emerging out of this that somehow  would affect the vote or influence the vote of an individual Senator on this floor? I know Halloween is close. I know Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD are searching for ghosts. And maybe in this scenario there is a ghost. But, fellow Senators, it is only a ghost because here is what happens next. 
   Let me give you an example. Say it is an election day. You go down to your local polling site, whether it is at a school, a local church, a National Guard armory, or your American Legion hall. Sometimes there is a person there who will hand you what is called a sample ballot listing all of the candidates in your party running for office. It is a way of identifying people running for your office or running for office in your party. As most voters, you are more than likely to choose candidates of your party. 
   However, under the McCain-Feingold proposal, it would be against the law to use soft money to pay for a sample ballot with the name of any candidate who is running for Congress on the same sample ballot with State and local candidates combined. Corruption? As I said earlier, it is close to Halloween. 
   Under the McCain-Feingold legislation, it would be against the law to use soft money to pay for campaign buttons, posters, yard signs, or brochures that include the name or picture of a candidate for Federal office on the same item that has the name or picture of a State or local candidate. That is called Federal control. That causes the creation of a bureaucracy to examine every election process right down to the local county central committee. Imagine the size of the new building here in Washington. Imagine the Federal agents out on the ground. Imagine it; that is what ultimately we reduce ourselves to when we begin to micromanage, as is proposed in this legislation, the kind of political process that most Americans believe and have reason to believe is a fair and honest process. 
   Under McCain-Feingold, it would be against the law to use soft money to conduct a local voter registration drive 120 days before the election. These get-out-the-vote drives have proven to be effective tools for increasing interest among people in the political process. Frankly, that is what we are all about, getting people interested in participating in their government. Not enough do now. With McCain-Feingold, in the end we would probably even cause that to be restricted. 
   In fact, in 1979 Congress supported revisions in the law pertaining to get-out-the-vote drives because they were concerned about important party-building activities and they promoted citizen participation in the election process. As we have heard on the Senate floor, the sponsors and supporters of this bill think this, and what I have just discussed, is corruption. 
   Let's look at the reality of what this legislation creates. I will talk about a man I know by the name of Jack Hardy, the chairman of the Republican Party in Custer County, ID. Custer County is about as big as Delaware, New Hampshire, and New Jersey together with only about 4,000 citizens living in that huge geographic area. Jack Hardy, chairman of the Republican Party in that county, works at a full time job as a carpenter. He also enjoys spending time with his family. Jack relies on financial aid from the State and national party organizations to run his Custer County Republican Party. 
   There are thousands of Jack Hardys all over the country. Most are volunteers. They put in long hours supporting their party and their candidates hoping to make a difference because they believe as Americans they ought to be involved in the party process to get people elected who believe in and represent the ideals that the Jack Hardys of America hold. Jack Hardy is a hard-working man who wants to make a difference. 
   McCain-Feingold is saying we will make it tougher, Jack. Here is how we will make it tougher. We are not going to allow you to use the kind of resources that come from the State and the Federal parties. You have to get out and hustle: forget your job. You have to get hard money from donations, local business money, and individuals to fund any activities. 
   Jack already does some of this. He already solicits among individuals and businesses in his community. But never is there enough on an election day or before an election day to do the right kind of work. Jack Hardy relies on his State and Federal 
   party to help him. 
   People such as Jack Hardy will be forced to take more of their time off from what is a nonpaid voluntary job to help participate in American political activities. In other words, fundraising hard money will become a bigger concern for the State and local officials than ever before, and whoever raises the most money can fund more political activities. It is that simple. 
   Essentially, what we have done is make money the most compelling factor in campaigns instead of part of what is necessary to run a good campaign organization. 
   Frankly, this is silly stuff. Exactly what kind of campaign finance reform is this? What are we trying to accomplish? We just added more laws to a system that is already heavily burdened with rules and regulations, many of which can't even get enforced because the Federal Election Commission doesn't function too well. Again, it is a federal bureaucracy that has probably outserved its usefulness. 
   We have just added more laws to a system that is already not working. We forced thousands of State and local party officials to raise more money from their constituents, to confuse the process that we think works pretty well now. 
   If the point of McCain-Feingold is to reform the campaign finance system, then I think the last thing we want to do is ban soft money. 
   I support the amendment offered by Senator MCCAIN to require State and local officials to file immediate electronic disclosure of contributions. That is key to anything we do. Let the voters know firsthand about the money source coming into their politics. Voters are not dumb. They are talented, bright Americans who make their own judgments. And they should be based on the knowledge handed them, without having to create a monstrously large Federal bureaucracy. 
   I am bothered by what has been left out of McCain-Feingold. For example, there is no protection in this bill against union workers. This issue has already been debated thoroughly on the floor. I noticed just this past week the AFL-CIO has endorsed AL GORE in his candidacy for the Presidency. Of course, this will bring in millions of dollars of reported and millions of dollars of unreported money. Why? In large part, we have exempted labor unions from certain levels of campaign requirements and we do not exempt other citizens of our country. Most importantly, we have said labor bosses can take the dues of their members and use them for political purposes that maybe even those union members don't want. 
   The American political process ought to be a free process. We want it to be open. We want and must always have full disclosure. If union dues go to fund AL GORE's campaign, there will be a lot of union people in Idaho who will be very angry because they openly tell me they cannot support this candidate. Why? Because he put them out of work. His policy on public lands and public land resources and this administration's reaction has cost thousands of union men and women to be out of work in my State. If their dues go without their ability to say no, they have a right to be angry. Yet the provision I am talking about is not in McCain-Feingold. I am talking about a term we call ``paycheck protection.'' This is a very important part of any kind of campaign finance reform any Member wants to see. 
   During the 1996 elections, union leaders tacked on an extra surcharge on dues to their members in order to raise $49.2 
   million to defeat Republican candidates around the country. There is no reason not to say it; that was their intent. They were open about it. The union bosses have announced they plan to spend much more in the 2000 election. Yet nothing in this law says they can't do that. We shouldn't say, ``You can't do it.'' We should say there are rules about how to collect the money. The right of the citizen is to say yes or no to how his or her money is used for political purposes. 
   There are others waiting to speak. This will be an issue we will debate into the week. It is an important issue, but it is one I think the American citizens understand quite well.  
   When mom and dad come home at night and they sit at the dinner table and one spouse says to another, ``How was your day?'' my guess is they do not say, ``And, oh, what about those campaign finance laws that Senator FEINGOLD is debating in the U.S. Senate? Those are really important to us.'' I doubt they say that. In fact, I doubt even few moms and dads have ever said that. I think what they will talk about, though, is the shooting that happened down the street too close to their school; or the economy that cost a brother or a sister their job; or the taxes they paid that denied them the ability to spend more on their children or put away more for their children's education. Yes, and they probably even, in a rather disgusted way, talk about some of the examples of moral decline in this country. My guess is that is what goes on around the dinner tables of America, not, ``Oh, and by the way, Senator FEINGOLD has a great campaign finance bill.'' 
   What are important issues, as we debate the issues in the closing days of this Senate, are issues about public education and safety and crime and all of that. We will engage in that with our President in the coming days as we finalize some of these key appropriations bills. 
   Again, I think what is important to the American people are issues like crime, the economy, taxes, health care, education, social security, and the moral decline of the country. 
   What people really care about is whether their children will get safely back and forth from school--and whether they'll get a good education in the public schools. 
   They care about keeping their jobs and trying to make ends meet while they watch more and more of their hard earned money slip away to Washington to satisfy this President's lust for spending. 
   They care about their future--whether they can save enough money to retire some day. And if they retire, will there be any money left in the Social Security system, or will it all be spent on more government programs. 
   These are the real concerns of Americans today, and I hope the Senate will soon be able to turn its attention to these important issues. 
   Let me conclude by saying we are not wasting our time debating campaign finance reform. Defending the right of free speech and the right of citizens to participate in this most critical of American institutions is our job. To defend and protect that right is the reasonable goal. So I appreciate joining with my colleagues on the floor to oppose McCain-Feingold and hope Senators will join with us in protecting that freedom of expression of America's citizens. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. I join with my friend from the State of Montana in supporting this expectation that the states within the WRAP should not be precluded from any distribution of the $5,000,000 provided in this fiscal year 2000 appropriation bill. The State of Idaho has new requirements and responsibilities based upon this new regional haze rule. These new requirements require Idaho to develop new emissions data and programs which the state doesn't have now. So the State of Idaho must develop new internal capabilities to meet the new regulatory deadlines. The WRAP can assist the states in developing some of these capabilities, however, the states have their own unique roles and responsibilities beyond those of the WRAP. Thus, all states need additional funding beyond that provided to the WRAP.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies for his leadership in steering this bill and its many, diverse provisions successfully through the Senate and conference. 
   One item is noteworthy both for its importance and its ready acceptance on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses. This is the language prohibiting EPA from spending funds to implement the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change, prior to ratification and Senate consent. The bill language on this subject is the same as last year's reiterating a strong congressional position. 
   Also important is this year's Senate report language requiring greater accountability in the Administration's climate change proposals and initiatives. This language renews and reiterates directives in the managers' statement in last year's conference report. It also expresses disappointment in the late filing, earlier this year, of agency reports explaining the administration's programs, objectives, and performance measures. 
   I would ask the Chairman if it is fair to say the committee's intent is to put the administration on notice that we fully expect such reports to be included, on a timely basis, as part of the President's fiscal year 2001 budget submission next year?

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the FY2000 Agriculture appropriations bill. This important piece of legislation provides a total of $60.3 billion. While a large portion of this funding goes toward food stamps and nutrition programs, this bill also contains funding for agriculture research, conservation, rural development and direct assistance for our farmers to get through these tough times. 
   Farmers across the board are facing difficult times. Prices are the lowest  this decade and exports are decreasing while imports are increasing. For most commodities, the cost of production exceeds the revenue received. It doesn't take long to go out of business when your costs are more than what you can get for your end product. 
   The problem is price, not the farm bill or farmers. Because of the Asian flu and depression of other world markets, our farmers are suffering. Simple economics tells you when supply is above demand, prices will drop. Ag commodity prices will increase as our world markets come back, but we don't expect that to happen this year or next. If we want our farmers to stay in business, we must help them in the short term until commodities can be sold on a world market. 
   Something must be done to help the American farmer through these tough times, which is why I support this bill's $8.7 billion in farmer aid. The emergency aid includes $5.54 billion in additional agriculture market transition payments, which represent a 100 percent increase in a producer's 1999 payment. This is a direct payment that our farmers could receive before Thanksgiving if the President signs the bill into law. This is the immediate assistance our farmers and farm groups ask for in hearings in the Agriculture Committee and elsewhere. 
   The conference report includes assistance for crop insurance premium write-downs to maintain the 1999 level, which is essential if we want farmers to keep using the program. I am also pleased to see assistance to certain specialty crop producers. These are just a few of the provisions that I supported in this bill. 
   The conference report also contains mandatory livestock price reporting legislation. I supported this price reporting legislation when it was voted out of the Agriculture Committee and I am pleased to see it is moving forward. There needs to be greater transparency within the livestock industry. Our producers need information on which to base their marketing decisions, and this legislation will provide that. 
   As others have noted, this conference report does not include sanctions reform language that passed by wide margin on the floor of the Senate. However, I understand legislation to exempt agricultural commodities from unilateral economic sanctions will come before the Senate before we adjourn, and it is something we ought to pass this year. In order to insure the long term survival of the Agriculture industry in the United States we must work on trade and sanctions reform to enable U.S. producers to compete on a level playing field with the rest of the world. 
   Mr. President, I hope the Senate adopts the conference report today and the President signs it into law so that the hard working farmers across the country can get the assistance we have promised them and that they so deserve.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has far reaching domestic and international security implications, and it deserves the most thorough and thoughtful consideration by the Senate. Like my colleagues, I have followed the CTBT, and have paid close attention to the number of hearings that have taken place in recent days, and over the last few years. 
   Let me begin by saying that if I thought supporting this treaty would make the threat of nuclear war disappear, and give us all greater security from these lethal weapons, I would not hesitate in giving my support. Unfortunately, the facts do not demonstrate this; indeed, implementing this treaty will very likely increase danger to U.S. citizens and troops. For that reason, I am obligated to oppose ratification. 
   Ratification of the CTBT would prohibit the United States from conducting explosive tests of nuclear weapons of any kind. In spite of CTBT's goal of curbing the proliferation and development of nuclear weapons by prohibiting their testing, it is a dangerous and flawed agreement that would undercut U.S. national security. 
   American foreign policy must be based on decisions and actions that unquestionably enhance the national security interests of the United States, and nothing less. Our foreign policy cannot be based on a view of the world through rose colored glasses. Decisions must be made on the assessment of the clear and present dangers to the United States now and in the future. Let me reiterate some of those dangers confronting U.S. citizens today.  
   There are twenty-five to thirty countries that have sought or are seeking and developing ballistic missiles. Last August, North Korea flight-tested a long-range missile over Japan, demonstrating its potential to strike Alaska or Hawaii in the near future. Although our decisive victory in the Gulf War demonstrated to many of our adversaries that a challenge on the battlefield would be foolish, hostile states now seek to offset our conventional force strength through the development of their own nuclear weapons programs. Does this Administration really believe that if the U.S. ceased to test, nations like North Korea, Libya, or Iran would end nuclear development? The dangers to the United States are very real and threats continue to grow. 
   The center of U.S. defense policy is deterrence. Key to that deterrence is the credible threat of retaliation against those who would harm the U.S. and her citizens. This threat can only remain credible if our stockpile of weapons is reliable and modernized. CTBT runs counter to this objective. 
   Nuclear tests are the only demonstrated way to assure confidence in the reliability and safety of our nuclear weapons. The CTBT will diminish our ability to fix problems within the nuclear stockpile and make safety improvements. We have long relied on testing these extremely complicated weapons to demonstrate both their safety and effectiveness. 
   The Clinton Administration falsely claims that every Administration since Eisenhower has supported CTBT. What the President fails to say is that no other Administration has sought a test ban at zero yield like the current Administration. Frankly, this is a dangerous proposition for the reliability and safety of our arsenal. Former Secretary of Defense, James Schlesinger, explained the problem:  
   *.*.* new components or components of slightly different materials must be integrated into weapon designs that we deployed earlier. As this process goes on over the years, a simple question arises: Will this design still work? 
   That is why reliability testing is essential. As time passes, as the weapon is retrofitted, we must be absolutely confident that this modified device will still induce the proper nuclear reaction. That is why non-nuclear testing, as valuable as it is, is insufficient. It is why talk of a test ban with zero nuclear yield is irresponsible.  
   Mr. Schlesinger's point is well taken. Make no mistake, the effects of a zero yield test ban will be catastrophic for U.S. security interests. 
   The CTBT would also make it very extremely difficult to meet new weapons requirements. Throughout American military history, advances in air defense and anti-submarine warfare have created a need for new weapons, and testing has saved the lives of U.S. airmen. For example, nuclear testing was required to make the B83 bomb of the B-1B aircraft to allow the plane to drop its payload at a low altitude and high speed and escape the pending explosion. The bottom line is a test ban would harm modernization efforts, and jeopardize the lives of our men and women in uniform. 
   Furthermore, the CTBT will do nothing to stop proliferation, even if testing is thwarted. This treaty is based on the flawed assumption that prohibiting nuclear testing will stop rogue nations from developing nuclear weapons. However, this assumption fails to acknowledge that rogue nations could likely be satisfied with crude devices that may or may not hit intended targets. Killing innocent civilians does not seem to be a concern of leaders like Saddam Hussein of Iraq or Kim Jong-Il of North Korea. The only thing predictable about rogue nations is their unpredictability. Lack of testing is not a security guarantee. South Africa and Pakistan long maintained an untested arsenal, in spite of bold nuclear aspirations. To presume that absence of nuclear test equals enhanced security is dangerous proposition. 
   It is also very disturbing that ratification of this treaty would abandon a fundamental arms control principle that has been insisted upon for the last two decades--that the United States must be able to ``effectively verify'' compliance with the terms of the treaty. Verification has meant that the United States intelligence is able to detect a breach in an arms control agreement in time to respond appropriately and assure preservation of our national security interests. 
   Because the CTBT bans nuclear test explosions no matter how small their yield, it is impossible to verify. Low-yield underground tests are very difficult to detect with seismic monitors. In previous Administrations, CTBT negotiations focused on agreements that allowed explosions below a certain threshold because it is impossible to verify below those levels. As the CTBT is impossible to verify, cheating will occur, and U.S. security will be undermined. 
   Mr. President, I stand with all Americans today in expressing concern about the growing nuclear threat across the globe. The real question before us is whether ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will increase our own national security. Unfortunately, the answer is no. The sad truth about the CTBT is that it would be counterproductive and dangerous to America's national security. Moreover, I think the Senate must recognize that the implications of ratification of the CTBT is ultimate nuclear disarmament of the United States. If the U.S. cannot maintain a safe and reliable stockpile, and is barred from testing them, disarmament will be the de facto policy. The United States cannot afford this dangerous consequence. Nuclear deterrence has protected America's national and security interests in the midst of a very hostile world. I urge my colleagues to vote against this treaty.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an Idaho native and his contributions to this nation. Early next week Sgt. John Feiler will be recognized here in Washington D.C. as Fort Hood's Noncommissioned Officer and Soldier of the third quarter of 1999. 
   Let me to tell you a little about this wonderful Idahoan. John Feiler, a native of Burley, Idaho enlisted in the Army shortly after graduating from Burley High School. He began his training as a Combat Engineer in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. He was then assigned to the Engineer Battalion at Camp Eschborn in Germany. While in Germany he was an active participant in Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and Provide Comfort in Southwest Asia, for which he earned several awards and decorations. 
   After the Persian Gulf War, John was reassigned to Fort Stewart, Georgia. While there, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant, and a short time later he attended the Staff Sergeant Selection Board. During his assignment in Fort Stewart, he was selected as the Commandant's Inspection Awardee, made the Commandant's list, was nominated as the 24th ID Engineer Brigade NCO of the Year for two consecutive years (`93 & `94), and nominated to represent the 24th ID as their NCO of the Year for the XVIII Airborne Corps NCO of the Year competition. 
   In August of 1994 Sgt. Feiler pursued and completed the Army Recruiters Course. He served three years as a recruiter and was awarded the Gold Recruiter Badge as a permanent award. 
   In December of 1997 he arrived in Fort Hood, Texas and was assigned to his current unit, A Company 299th Engineer Battalion. During the eighteen months that he has served in the battalion, he has been awarded the Army Commendation Medal, two Army Achievement medals, and was chosen as one of the ``Heroes of Battle'' during the battalion's 99-05 NTC rotation. He is currently serving as a squad leader there. 
   His awards include the following: the Army Commendation Medal with four oak leaf clusters, the Army Achievement Medal with nine oak leaf clusters, the Army Good Conduct Medal (third award), the National Defense Service Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal (Saudi Arabia), and the Liberation of Kuwait Medal (Kuwait). 
   Idaho and the nation are proud of the way in which Sgt. John Feiler has served our country. I am pleased to draw the Senate's attention to the outstanding contributions he has made and hope all my colleagues will join me in honoring him.

   Mr. CRAIG. I am concerned about the funding level for Medicare contractors. The Senate Committee mark reduced the FY 2000 funding level by $30 million below the President's Budget recommendation. I want to be sure that this funding reduction will not adversely impact fee-for-service claims processing activities or the ability of contractors to provide critical beneficiary and providers services. 
   In the recent past, we have seen the effect that inadequate funding levels can have on services. In 1998 payments were slowed down, and beneficiaries and providers were forced to deal with more voice mail rather than human beings when they called their contractors with questions about claims. 
   Looking only at numbers, I see funding $21 million less than FY 1999 and $30 million less than the President's request. However, I understand this funding level reflects $30 million in savings from changes in the processing of dates. Therefore, am I correct in saying this would reflect efficiency and technological improvement, not a policy change in fee-for-service claims processing or beneficiaries and provider services? Furthermore, this $30 million in savings should not result in decreased funding to services for beneficiaries or providers, should it?

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to authorize the Castle Rocks Ranch/Hagerman Fossil Beds Land Exchange in my home state of Idaho. 
   Mr. President, in Idaho we have one of the foremost rock climbing destination sites in the world. It is called the City of Rocks National Reserve and is located in South Central Idaho. Most of the Reserve is owned by the National Park Service with parts of it being owned by the State of Idaho, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and private landowners. The State of Idaho runs the Reserve with a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service. 
   The Reserve has unique geologic features--essentially, large rock formations jut out of the ground. I can't give it justice with my description--it is really something that must be seen, so I invite everyone to come to Idaho and visit the City of Rocks. Besides the rock formations, many of which are used extensively and known internationally for rock climbing, the site has unique historic significance. The California Trail, one of the major trails for Westward expansion during the 19th Century, passes through the Reserve. One of the Reserve's major attractions, Twin Sisters, was a landmark for this trail and is currently being protected for historic significance. Additionally, wagon trains often stopped in the area to maintain their wagons. During these stops, pioneers wrote their names on the rocks with wagon grease. Many of these names are still visible on the rocks today and serve as a record of our ancestors who passed through the area. 
   Near the Reserve exists the Castle Rock Ranch, an approximately 1,240 acre ranch containing similar rock formations, which are ideal for fork climbing. Additionally, the Ranch contains irrigated pasture land. The Ranch was recently purchased by The Conservation Fund and other conservation groups in order to put it into the public domain for recreation. It is currently being operated as a working ranch. However, the State of Idaho would like to acquire this Ranch to make it into a state park. They would open up the rock formations for rock climbing, provide for camping and hiking, and, where irrigated pasture land exists, trade that irrigated land for dry land inholdings within the Reserve. This would help local ranchers acquire irrigated land, which is more valuable than gold in Southern Idaho, and allow the state to consolidate inholdings within the Reserve. 
   A couple of counties to the West and across the mighty Snake River exists the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument. This National Monument contains the Hagerman Fossil Beds, which is important because it contains the world's most important fossil deposits from a time period known as the late Pliocene epoch, 3.5 million years ago. They represent the last glimpse of time before the Ice Age. Additionally, the beds contain the largest concentration of Hagerman Horse fossils in North America. While the State of Idaho owns the actual fossil beds, the National Park Service runs and maintains the facility. 
   The State of Idaho wants to divest its interest in the fossil beds and acquire the Castle Rock Ranch. Additionally, the National Park Service wants to acquire the Fossil Beds. This would make it easier for everyone to work to protect the resources we have and open up opportunities for recreation. Consequently, I am introducing this legislation. 
   In brief, the legislation would authorize the National Park Service to acquire the Castle Rock Ranch, exchange the Ranch with the State of Idaho for the Hagerman Fossil Beds, and mandate that the State exchange land within the Ranch for inholdings within the City of Rocks. In the end, 
   the National Park Service would run and own the Hagerman Fossil Beds, the State of Idaho would own and run a state park in part of the Castle Rock Ranch, and voluntary inholders in the  City of Rocks would be able to trade their inholdings for irrigated land on the Castle Rock Ranch. 
   The only concern I have is the existence of an easement on the Hagerman Fossil Beds for the local irrigation company. This is the only way for farmers in the local area to get water to their farms--a necessity in that region. Section 4(e) of this legislation was included to ensure that this easement will continue to exist. It is vital to the existence of family farms in the area, and, for the record, it is not my intent to harm--and I will do all in my power to prevent this legislation from harming--this easement or the irrigation in the local area. 
   Mr. President, this is a unique proposal that makes fiscal sense for taxpayers and has garnered the support of the National Park Service, the State of Idaho, The Conservation Fund, The Access Fund (a national climbing group), other conservation groups, local legislators, and many local residents. I hope that my colleagues will recognize the importance of this legislation and work for its enactment.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me also join with the Senator from Utah for what I think he spoke very clearly about: the run amok of Government and the idea that we are going to craft public policy through the courts of our land. I believe that is the fundamental responsibility of the Congress, both the House and the Senate. Yet we have seen this administration and the trial lawyer community of this country decide that. First, it is tobacco. They are going to tell the world how to think and then tell the States and the Federal Government what the policy ought to look like. Now they are turning on the gun manufacturers. I don't care where you stand on the issue of guns. What is wrong in this country is to suggest that trial attorneys will meet in the dark of night to decide what group they are going to take on next, amass their wealth for the purpose of making hundreds of millions more, and then turn to the Congress and say, now that we have made these findings, go legislate a policy. I don't believe that is the essence of the foundation of our representative Republic.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to speak about an event which happened this past Saturday that in many States across the Nation went relatively unnoticed. It was National Public Lands Day. It was a time for all Americans to recognize the value we have in our public lands and a time for all of us to give a little something back by volunteering a Saturday to lend a helping hand to improve our public lands. 
   If you were out and about, you noticed volunteers both in this city on some of our parkways and across the area. But across the Nation, over 20,000 volunteers took some of their precious time. We all know that weekend time in a busy populace is a precious time and, by taking it, they performed over $1 million worth of improvements to our public lands--from helping construct to simply cleaning up and picking up. 
   In recognition of National Public Lands Day, I want to spend a few minutes today reflecting on the value of our public lands and on what the future holds for them. 
   There are about 650 million acres of public lands in the United States. They represent a vast portion of the total land mass of our continent. However, most of these lands are concentrated in the West. Coming from Idaho, I recognize that very clearly. There are some States where over 82 percent of that State's land mass is public. In my State of Idaho, it is nearly 63 percent of the entire geography that is owned, managed, and controlled by the Federal Government, or by the citizens of this country. 
   There can be a great beneficial effect for our public lands, for all of us. For starters, there are a great many resources available on our public lands--from our renewable forests to the opportunities to raise cattle on them, to drilling for oil, to mining for minerals from the surface. And the subsurface of our public lands holds a great deal of resources. We all depend on it for our lives. Without question, our public lands have been the treasure chest of the great wealth of our Nation. 
   Many of our resources have come from the utilization of the resource of the public land. Having these resources available has afforded not only the opportunities I have spoken to but it has clearly advanced some of our governmental services because most of those resources reap a benefit to the Treasury, and from the Treasury to our schools, our roads, and our national defense. All of these resources and their revenues have helped ease the tax burden on the average taxpayer. 
   Not only are the taxpayers of our country rightfully the owners of that public land, but we, the Government, and all of us as citizens are beneficiaries of those resources. 
   Just as important though is the recreational opportunity and the environment that our public lands offer. Every day, people hike and pack in the solitude of our wilderness areas, climb rocks, ski, camp, snowmobile, use their off-road vehicles, hunt, fish, picnic, boat, and swim--the list goes on and on of the level of recreation and expectations we have coming from our public land. 
   Because the lands are owned by all of us, the opportunity has existed for everyone to use the land within reasonable limits. Certainly our responsibility as a policymaker--as I am, and as are all Senators--in shaping the use of these lands, I am hopeful that this year Republicans and Democrats in the Senate can work together to pass balanced legislation that corrects the abuses by both debtors and creditors in the bankruptcy system. 
   But this partisan attempt to prematurely cut off debate before we even started to consider this bill does not bode well for that effort.  
   I hope that once this cloture motion is defeated, the Senate 
   will begin a reasonable and fair debate on bankruptcy reform legislation that reflects a balancing of rights between debtors and creditors. 
   Those public lands have been a historic and primary responsibility of the Congress itself. However, in the last couple of decades several changes have occurred. 
   We are in the midst of a slow and methodical attack on our very access as individuals to the public land itself. It started with the resources industries. That was the restrictive nature or the change in public policy that limited access by our resource industries and how they might use the land. Some would say, well, that is merely important for the preservation of the land. But what we have also seen is an ever increasing attitude to keep people--just simple people who want to hike or backpack, to have access to that land--off the land or in some way control their very character on the land. 
   Some radical groups are fighting to halt all resource management on our public lands, and they are working to restrict, as I have mentioned, the elemental human access to those lands. On the Targhee National Forest in Idaho, the Forest Service tore up the land to keep people off. I was out touring that forest and came upon over 300 huge gouges in roads that had been contracted by the Forest Service to stop access to the land. It was all in the name of an endangered species. But at the same time, if that kind of damage or destruction had occurred at the hands of a mining company or a logging company, the owners of those companies would have been in court. Here it was merely the forest land saying, oh, well, this huge tank trap or gouge in the road to stop traffic was our way of protecting the land. I am not sure who was the protector in that instance. 
   Additionally, we are seeing the implementation of dramatic changes in the philosophy of the public's access to our Forest Service from openness to an element of closeness. At the time when Gifford Pinchot convinced Teddy Roosevelt to remove forested lands from the public preserve and make them forested preserves, the concept was that these lands were open. While they were protected, to be utilized for forest and to be maintained for water quality and wildlife habitat, always the people could have access. 
   Slowly but surely, there has been a change in that attitude. That attitude has dramatically shifted to one in which the Forest Service would now suggest to you that our U.S. forests are closed to the public unless designated open. Gifford Pinchot would roll over in his grave as not only one of our Nation's great conservationists but one of the great advocates for forested reserves. The reason he would is that he said: If you do not associate the people to their land, ultimately the land becomes the king's land, much like feudal Europe in which the forests were the King's and the serf could not tread on that land unless given express permission by the King. 
   When the forest is closed--and that is what is being talked about today, and in many instances the chief of the U.S. Forest Service, Chief Dombeck, who is an advocate of this philosophy, ``closed unless designated open''--then where do you go to gain permission to access your public lands? You go to the Government. In essence, you go to the King. You go to the ruler. 
   I don't think that is what Americans want. While Americans may differ on how they want their public land managed and for what reason they want it managed, there is one thing I doubt any of us would argue about, and that is that the Federal Government should not have the absolute right to tell our citizens who may or may not tread upon these lands. 
   All of us should be outraged by a Forest Service attitude that it is their land and they control it and they will give permission, they will be the implementors of policy in a way that will determine who is locked off the land. That, in my opinion, appears to be their agenda. 
   That very forest in Idaho I told you about, where large tank traps appeared in the public roads, just in their new forest plan they have changed the philosophy of the management to suggest that all roads are closed and, therefore, the forest is closed unless designated open. 
   Yes, we must manage our public lands responsibly, which includes restrictions on some activities and in some areas with the preservation of the land's environment. For the water quality, for the wildlife habitat, for all of those fundamental reasons, we enjoy our public land base. But we should not sit here so snidely as to suggest that a Federal agency has the right to say you may enter or you may not enter the land. Yet more and more forests and public lands of our country are now receiving those kinds of restrictions. 
   Some people like to hike in our back country, others like simply the peace and the solitude, while others prefer to ride ATVs in the woods. Some prefer to camp 
   in a more developed facility, while others prefer primitive spots. 
   The point is, the recreational opportunities on our public lands should be as diverse as America's public interests. On the same note, we can use the natural resources we need in an environmentally responsible manner and still have plenty of opportunities to recreate. In fact, recreation and resource interests can team together to help each other. 
   In my own State of Idaho in the Clearwater National Forest we have seen a dramatic decline in our elk herds in large part because of a lack of habitat. This is a massive amount of public land. Yet by its management--the suppression of wildfires, the inability of the Forest Service to manage using controlled burns but changing the habitat and the character of the land itself--one of the Nation's largest elk herds collapsed. In the winters of 1996 and 1997, thousands of elk starved to death simply by the mismanagement of our public lands by a Forest Service that would not seek the diversity of landscape that is so critically necessary to maintain those unique elk herds and the vibrancy of the land itself. 
   Rather than fight each other, elk conservation groups, the Forest Service, and the timber industry are coming together to develop a plan to mechanically thin some of the areas and use prescribed burns and others to treat nearly a million acres to increase elk habitat. Yet on the outside there are some conservation groups that say even thinning a tree is cutting a tree and should not be allowed. How absurd. 
   Why deny the right of good stewards to manage land in a way that creates diversity and balance so that Idaho can reclaim its heritage of having a large elk herd, and at the same time having more than 4 million acres of wilderness, and at the same time having a vibrant Forest Service products industry, while at the same time having growth within the State as one of its No. 1 economies tourism and recreation. That is a wise and balanced approach toward managing our public lands instead of this single attitude of ``lock 'em out, preserve, and deny'' the ability to manage public resources in a diverse and balanced way. We need all of our public lands to be used in a way that appeals to all of our citizens, not to just a single, relatively narrow-minded group. 
   Public land management, because of this, is now embroiled in fights, in appeals, in litigation. Every decision made by our public lands managers ends up in court, oftentimes fought out over weeks, months, and years. While all of that has been going on, the Congress of the United States has sat idly by and watched, simply hoping it would play itself out when, in fact, the fight seems to have intensified. 
   Differing interests have to come together to realize we all have one common goal: To use our land in a responsible manner, in a sustainable manner, in a balanced manner, in the kind of way that will meet most of our interests, and do so to assure a quality environment and an abundant wildlife habitat. I believe all of those things can be done. 
   Over the last several years, I have held over 50 hearings on the management of the U.S. Forest Service and why it can't make decisions, and when it does, why those decisions are in court. Why has it become largely the most dysfunctional agency of our Federal Government? Yet it has a phenomenally great legacy of appropriate management and responsible caretakership of the land.  
   As a result of that, I have introduced S. 1320, a comprehensive reform on the public land laws primarily governing the Forest Service but also reflecting on the BLM. However, until we all realize there is room for everyone on our public lands instead of just ``lock 'em up and keep 'em out'' solely in the name of the environment; that we can utilize our resources in a wise and sustainable manner; that we can continue to accept these lands in a way that offer a resource to our Treasury, along with a resource to our mind; then I think we will continue to be in litigation. 
   Successful management of our public lands realizes a balanced approach, a diverse approach, and one that I think our country can take great comfort in the legacy of the past. In all fairness, we ought to be a bit embarrassed about our current situation. 
   Last Saturday was National Public Lands Day. It shouldn't be viewed as just one that talks about the quality of our parks and recreational areas. It should be reflective of the millions and millions of acres of public lands in my State and other Western States that by their own diversity assure an abundant resource, abundant revenue, and opportunities not only for recreational solitude but economic opportunity in the communities that reside on and near those public lands. I hope a lifetime from now our public lands will be as vibrant as they are today, but will be managed in a much more diverse and multiple-use way than it appears we are heading at this moment. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to rise today to pay tribune to one of Idaho and America's finest veterans, H. Melvin ``Mel'' Napier, of Boise, ID. 
   There is no question Mel Napier is a true American patriot and a leader,  from his participation in the military, to his work on behalf of veterans, to his contributions in the community. The Air Force has a very special tradition in Idaho, and Mel has long been part of that tradition. Enlisting in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean conflict, Mel served 4 years on active duty and 8 years in the Air Force Reserves as a meteorologist. He has also been a stalwart veteran advocate. His active membership and leadership in the American Legion led him to be selected to be National Vice Commander in 1982-83. In 1983, Mel began his service as State Adjutant for the Legion, and he has served in that capacity until this September. 
   Mel's service to our country makes it clear that he has never been afraid of challenges, hardships or hard work. Idaho is privileged to have Mel and his family as residents. I am honored to stand before the Senate today and tell my colleagues about Mel; however, I do this with mixed emotions. Mel Napier recently stepped down as State Adjutant for the American Legion, a position he held for 16 years. It is a special individual indeed who commits to that kind of service on behalf of all the men and women in uniform who have proudly served our great nation. 
   In sum, I would like to thank Mel for his tremendous contribution to our country, and most of all, to America's veterans. I know that Mel will not be leaving the American Legion, or ending his service to veterans because he will no longer serve as State Adjutant, but I do think that this is a very appropriate time to give Mel our thanks and show our gratitude for his service. 
   Mr. Napier, thank you, congratulations, and Godspeed.

   Mr. CRAIG. As we refocus this debate on the issue of royalties, obviously the Senators from Nevada and Massachusetts and California were focusing the issue of royalties on public land resources on education. There was a critical vote in the Senate last week which they strongly opposed--and some of them spoke against it--that directly associated resources with education. That was the issue of timber, timber cuts, stumpage fees flowing back to local schools. 
   Will the Senator respond to that? We are talking out of both sides of our mouths if we are saying that royalties are all for education, and yet just this last week, they voted against education in timber-dependent communities across this country that have had their budgets cut 50 and 60 percent. The Senator from California voted that way, and the Senator from Nevada voted that way. Will the Senator from Wyoming respond to that? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-craig-id-3-19990923</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. The point I am making is, every time the Forest Service is allowed to cut a tree off public lands, 25 percent of that stumpage fee goes back to the local school district to be spent for schools.  
   For good reasons, we have reduced the timber program by 70 percent in the last 7 years. I have a school district in my State that is not feeding its kids today and asking them to bring brown bags because the vote of the Senator from California, along with the Senators from Nevada and Massachusetts, denied them the right to cut trees on the clear water forests in my State. 
   Can I get exercised about this? The Senator from Oregon supported me because he has a school district that is only 
   allowing its kids to go 4 days a week instead of 5. So if we are going to use oil royalties for that argument, quit speaking out of both sides of your mouth because just last week you voted that way. 
   We have always balanced our natural resources for the good of the environment and for the good of the public that is associated with them. The Senator from Wyoming knows that. We graze on Wyoming public lands and we take oil and coal from under Wyoming public lands--State and Federal lands. Some of that money goes back to the local communities. Yet this administration wants to decouple that. 
   I am glad the Senator from California is concerned about public land resources and local education, but you cannot be selective in this business. You have to share and associate. What I hear is a tremendously narrow and selective argument. 
   I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding because that is a bogus argument that is being placed by the Senator from California, unless she wants to stand up with the Senator from Idaho and say: I recognize the need to balance timber sales in northern California because the money goes to the schools in northern California, as they do in Idaho. That is called balance. That is called sharing. 
   I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding because you just cannot have it both ways in this business without someone such as me standing up and saying, foul ball, foul ball, bogus argument, unless you are willing to say: Wait a minute, I recognize your problem; we have it in the timberlands of Northern California. 
   Oil is an issue. It is an important issue. We want a fair return on that. The Senator from the State of Texas is trying to build that kind of fairness into this debate. 
   I thank my colleague from Wyoming for yielding. I yield the floor to him.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues from Oregon, Senator WYDEN and Senator SMITH of Oregon to introduce the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 1999. 
   Perhaps as much as any other state, our counties have suffered as federal forest lands have been beset with conflict, and as the receipts promised to counties for educational purposes have decreased dramatically. Senator Wyden's counties are also suffering, as are other counties throughout the West and the country as a whole. Today, we wish to propose a solution to this problem. 
   When the National Forests were withdrawn from the Public Domain at the turn of the century, they were established with a basic commitment to local governments. Gifford Pinchot and other visionary conservationists of that day persuaded often-skeptical Federal and local government officials that retention of lands by the Federal Government, the creation of forest reserves, and the sustainable management of these forests would be good for local people, good for local governments, good for the country, and good for the environment. 
   Pinchot and his peers based these assurances on the proposition that the proceeds from the sustainable management and sale of the fiber, forage, and other resources from these reserved Federal lands would be shared between the local and Federal Governments. Consequently, cooperative management between local governments and Federal land managers--both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management--has been a hallmark of good intergovernmental cooperation in many of our states, including Oregon and Idaho. In many cases, local governments have incurred costs from increased police, search and rescue, and fire protection associated with federally owned lands. 
   Our Federal forests have been crucial to the education of our children. Receipts from the sale of Federal timber and other commodities have been a vital component of county school and road budgets. In many cases, these funds have supported school lunches, special education, and a variety of assistance measures for disadvantaged children. In a very real sense, the bounty of our forests has allowed us to give a hand to our most needy rural children, including Native Americans and Hispanics. So this should be the one federal program through which concerns for the ``environment and education'' can be fulfilled by the same thoughtful actions. 
   However, we live in a different time, and federal forest management policies have become a source of considerable controversy. Timber sales have been reduced. Revenues both to the Federal treasury and the counties have decreased precipitously. Consequently, our rural school systems are in crisis. 
   Unfortunately, rather than coming together to forge a solution to these problems, the extremes on both sides of the equation are moving further apart. And they are placing our school children in the center of the controversy. One group seems to want to hold our school children hostage--to use the diminishing receipts and the deteriorating school systems as leverage to advantage their side of the forest management debate, favoring increased timber harvests. The other extreme would make our rural school children orphans--sending them out into the wilderness with no secure financial support in order to expedite the achievement of their goal of eliminating federal timber sales. 
   Senator WYDEN and I reject both of these extremes. We reject the notion that we cannot provide the school systems with additional support, without increasing timber harvesting. At the same time, we reject the proposition that we should completely ``decouple'' the support for rural schools from any responsibility on the part of the federal land management agencies, thereby totally separating local concerns from federal land management. 
   Gifford Pinchot articulately outlined the responsibility that the Federal Government generally, and the Forest Service and BLM specifically, assumed when the Federal forests were withdrawn from disposal or later retained in Federal ownership. In its simplest terms, this is a responsibility to provide local governments with a source of  revenue that they are otherwise denied as a consequence of their inability to tax federal lands. That responsibility is still as relevant today as it was at the turn of the century or during the Depression. It is still relevant today, irrespective of what options we choose for how to manage our Federal forests. 
   Indeed, the most telling flaw in the proposal to decouple county payments from timber receipts is the notion that this responsibility--willing assumed by the Forest Service at the turn of the century and BLM during the Depression--should be transformed into either the sole responsibility of the federal taxpayer, or no one's responsibility as it becomes another entitlement program which the Federal Government and taxpayers feel free to eliminate or reduce as their needs dictate. 
   Our proposal starts by establishing a set payment amount with which the counties can provide support for rural school systems. This set payment is based upon an average of representative years of timber receipts. In this respect, this proposal is similar to that offered by the Clinton Administration, and to H.R..2389 being considered in the House. 
   But here is where the similarity stops. We would not establish a separate appropriations line--which in all likelihood would be underfunded like the existing Payment in Lieu of Taxes System. Nor would we impose the responsibility to meet this payment on the Forest Service's or the BLM's annual budget. 
   Instead, we provide the Forest Service and the BLM with the authority to use any available receipts to meet these payments, and--only if these receipts fall short--to make up the difference from unobligated funds in the General Treasury. The intent here is to retain an obligation on the part of the Forest Service and the BLM, but to provide some flexibility in meeting this obligation. 
   Based upon our experience with the Quincy Library Group, the Applegate Partnership, and elsewhere, we have come to conclude that the best, recent decisions concerning federal resource management have enjoyed significant, local input. That is why our proposal contains a unique element--Senator WYDEN's idea, actually--to foster both local consensus and federal accountability around the management of federal lands. 
   Only 75 percent of the money to be given to the counties is provided for the traditional school and road programs. The remaining 25 percent would be provided to the counties for federal land management investments. The counties may fund either commercial or noncommercial projects on the federal lands at the recommendation of local advisory groups, and with the agreement of federal land managers. Projects must comply with all environmental laws and regulations, and must be consistent with the applicable land management plan. Any proceeds from revenue generating projects will be split equally between the affected county and the federal land management agency. The county share will go to supporting schools and roads, while the federal share will go to infrastructure maintenance or ecosystem restoration. Any funds left-over because of a lack of local agreement will be reallocated to counties where agreement on resource stewardship priorities has been reached. 
   This proposal is as value-neutral concerning the resource debate as we could make it. It neither encourages nor discourages a particular resource management outcome. But it does have a very heavy prejudice that Senator WYDEN and I have become very passionate about. We are in favor of people of goodwill reasoning together to improve the quality of their lives and the quality of our environment. We cannot legislate an end to conflict. But we can use the legislative process to create an environment in which people are motivated to resolve their differences. That is what we think this bill does.

   Mr. CRAIG. I rise to seek clarification from the Chairman concerning a provision relating to spending flexibility for high priority transportation projects. 
   As you know, action taken during the 105th Congress established that the states of Idaho, Alaska, and West Virginia can each ``pool'' the state's obligation authority for high priority projects--a flexibility provided to Minnesota under Section 1212(m) of TEA21(m) of TEA21 (later redesignated in technical corrections legislation as Section 1212[g]). This enables federal funds to be directed to the high priority project or projects in the state which are ready to go, rather than ration out obligation authority proportionately to all high priority projects in the state, whether or not ready to go. 
   Section 336 of S. 1143 would provide to New Jersey the same flexibility. However, on page 170 of the Senate Committee report on the bill (S. Rpt. No. 106-55), at the point where the report shows changes from existing law, only the states of Minnesota and New Jersey are mentioned as having this flexibility in obligating high priority project funds. 
   Is it the Chairman's understanding that the flexibility granted to Idaho, Alaska, and West Virginia under Section 1212(g) of TEA-21 is still in force and effect, does not require yearly reenactment, and is unchanged by the amendment contained in the Senate bill?

   Mr. CRAIG. I rise to engage the Chairman in a colloquy concerning the use of the Public Lands Program funds. 
   In its report, the Committee has raised serious concerns--supported by findings of the General Accounting Office--about how funds have been awarded under the Public Lands Program. To correct this problem, the report gives several specific directions to the Federal Highway Administration and a list of projects that should be funded by the Secretary. 
   I would like to draw the Chairman's attention to a request made by the state of Idaho for $6.0 million from this program to make needed improvements to U.S. 89 from West Forest Boundary to Bishoff Canyon. 
   This project would improve safety and capacity of the highway, which provides the only significant access into the Caribou National Forest in the region for hunting, fishing, mountain biking, hiking, camping, and snowmobiling. Of the total project distance of 8.3 miles, about 6.6 miles (80 percent) is located within the forest boundary. The highway and also provides connections to Jackson Hole, Yellowstone Park, and Bear Lake. Timber sales in the area require logging trucks to negotiate a very narrow and slow speed route, inconsistent with safety and the route's designation as a National Highway. The Idaho Highway Needs Report shows multiple deficiencies for this segment of roadway, including pavement width, foundation, drainage, shoulder condition, accident rate, and overall combined rating. 
   The requested $6.0 million will complete the work presented under the 1991 ISTEA Demonstration project, supplementing $18.0 million in demonstration funds. The limits and scope of the ISTEA demonstration project are not being expanded. Additional funds are requested to cover the cost of moving almost 2 million cubic yards of unanticipated earth and rock. In fact, without supplemental funds, the original demonstration project would need to be shortened and limited.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, good morning. 
   I am not quite sure I know, for all of the Senators who are listening this morning or who will be asked to vote in about 45 minutes, how to capture the essence of this amendment--the first-degree and second-degree amendments--brought to us by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Oregon. 
   I guess the best way to do that is to kind of take a snapshot back to 1989 and 1990 when this country had a vibrant forest products industry and a green sale program on the forested lands, the forested public lands of our Nation. 
   I would be the first to tell you, as I have said over the years, that at that  time we were probably managing a level of cut on our public lands that was not sustainable. But it was at that time that the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act began to take effect on those lands. We saw some very dramatic reductions in logging. 
   Here is an example of the kind of reductions we have seen since 1989. The Senator from Oregon just spoke. In his State alone, 111 mills and 11,600 jobs. The Forest Service, by its action, in response to public policy shaped by the Senate, and interpreted by the courts of this country, caused this to happen by disallowing the availability of public saw logs to 111 mills. 
   My State of Idaho: 17 mills, 770 jobs. That is a comparable impact because of the number of mills. 
   I spoke yesterday about my community of Midvale--45 jobs in a 300-person community, a big impact. But that mill is gone, torn down, sent to Brazil to cut down the rain forest. 
   Literally this mill right here, Grangeville, ID, closed for lack of timber, lack of public timber, lack of public timber by public policy, not for the lack of growth of trees on the Nezperce Forest, torn down and sent to Brazil to cut rain forest trees. 
   We have struggled for a decade to try to transform public policy to meet the environmental sensitivity that all of us want the Forest Service to meet. The chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, Senator GORTON, has constantly worked where he could through the appropriations process to shape that new policy. 
   We have now reduced the allowable cut on the public forests of our country, from 1990 to today, by 70 percent, a precipitous drop. In other words, if that were the auto industry, GM and Chrysler would no longer exist. They would be gone. Their plants would be torn down and their people would be strewn across the landscape looking for a new job. 
   But it wasn't the auto industry, it was the forest products industry. We have recognized that and tried to reshape it to meet the environmental standards all of us want our Forest Service to adhere to, but also to wring the politics out of it. 
   So there has been a 70-percent decline in logging for timber harvest since 1990; 140,000 people were employed in that industry in 1990; there are 55,000 today. Think of that tremendous flip-flop. Many of those folks don't have jobs yet. When you come to the public lands-dependent communities and counties of the West and some places in the South and Southeast, the unemployment today is not nearly at full employment as are most of our urban communities. It is at 16 and 17-percent unemployment. These are former loggers, men and women who made their jobs in the logging industry--not cutting trees, but working in sawmills and selling the product. 
   So that is a snapshot of time. That has all happened since about 1989 to 1999. In less than a decade, we have seen the collapse of the forest product industry of this country, all in the name of the environment, while we are still growing more trees now than ever in the history of our country. We are growing more trees now than when European man came to this continent. Our forests, in some instances, are more healthy today, and in other areas they are devastatingly old, with 30 to 40 percent dead and dying. They create phenomenal fire potential situations when the climate goes dry, as they do in the Great Basin West about every 6 years. Yet we have Senators who come to the floor and want to reduce the 70-percent reduction again and again and again. That is exactly the intent of the amendment by the Senator from Nevada. 
   So I scratch my head most sincerely, and ask why. It can't be because we haven't reduced the program. It can't be because we are trying to build environmental sensitivity and shape timber sales so they are much different than they were a decade ago. It must be because the national environmental movement--and the Sierra Club is the best example--in a national policy shaped 3 years ago, said: zero cut of trees on public lands. We don't want to see another tree cut. 
   Somehow, other Senators seem to want to echo that and bring it to the floor. I have to believe that is the driving impetus behind this amendment. I know of no other reason--at least I can't come up with a good one--when you look at the history and recognize what the Forest Service has done. The Senator from Oregon and I are working together to shape policy. The Forest Service has lost its direction. It tried to deal with the National Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act, and as it tried to amalgamate these into the National Forest Planning Act and the national forest plans under which the forest operates. The courts have stepped in time and time again and said, no, you can't do it that way. The reason is that environmental groups have filed lawsuits. We have allowed the courts to become the managers of our public forested lands, not the U.S. Senate. 
   You and I were elected to shape public policy. The chairman of the Appropriations Interior Subcommittee is working to do that. The legislation we have here, which dramatically reduces the overall programs in spending, is to do that. Some instructive words are in there. Even the amendment here, while it is argued to do something different, actually goes out on the land to improve existing roads and make them more environmentally sound. 
   Now, it would be argued by some that these are going to be brand new roads out through a pristine forest. That is really not true in about 99 percent of the cases because the Forest Service is not opening up new land. They are going back now in the States of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho and recutting old land. So they are taking old roads and improving them and putting in culverts and graveling them and making them more environmentally sound so you don't get sediment creating runoff into the streams and damaging the fisheries. Ninety percent of the very money the Senator from 
   Nevada wants to take out of this bill will go to that kind of reconstruction of the roads. 
   Those are the facts. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, in the last 3 years, we have held 45 hearings on the U.S. Forest Service. We turned it upside down and we shook to try to figure out why it was the most dysfunctional agency of the Federal Government. Here is part of the reason why: Because the Congress of the United States, over the last two decades of shaping public policy, didn't blend the policy together and it collided, which caused the Forest Service, in large part, to crash because of lawsuits and very dedicated environmental groups who really do want to shut public timber cutting down. 
   For the first time, yesterday, the Senator from Pennsylvania spoke on this. You would not expect Pennsylvania to be involved in this debate. Yet they have National Forest lands, hard wood lands. They have the same problem. Now lawsuits are being filed there to disallow the cut of red cherry and other woods that are critical to the furniture industry and to about four counties in Pennsylvania. This amendment affects every State in the United States that has a National Forest so designated within its boundaries. In some form, it will impact every one of those States. 
   The second-degree amendment is simply to shift over a little over one-third of the $34 million that is taken out of the program by the amendment of the Senator from Nevada to do research. The Senator from Oregon will argue that it expedites an agenda. I am confident it doesn't because the Forest Service simply can't move that quickly. If they did, they would probably be sued and shut down again. 
   So we can argue on the floor, and we will vote; and it will be a vote on politics a lot more than on policy or substance, tragically enough. I hope the Senate will stand up and say, no, we have reduced the timber sales in the United States by 70 percent, and that is enough. We have to cut some for health reasons, to clean our forest floors, for our stewardship programs, for salvage purposes, get rid of the dead and dying in the bug-infested forests that oftentimes breed the kind of death that when the drought cycle comes and creates the catastrophic fires we have seen through the Great Basin, in New Mexico and Arizona, which we will see once again. This is what is at issue today. 
   I hope the Senate will agree with the chairman of the subcommittee, who spent a great deal of time with those of  us who are committed to shaping public policy on these most critical public land issues. I believe that is the substance of the amendments at hand. I know of no other way to tell about it or to understand it. So if you want to keep ratcheting down the cut to a zero amount on our public lands, then you want to vote for Bryan-Wyden because that is their answer. If you do that, we will still build homes, but we will import that lumber from Canada and Brazil's rain forests and from Argentina and Venezuela and all the other areas and even Norway, strangely enough, but it will not be cut here. Hundreds of communities across this country will die because they are dying now. It is just that we haven't gone to their funerals yet. The rest of these mills will close, and this country will not have something it ought to have, which is a balanced, multiple-use, environmentally sound stewardship program for its public lands, which includes some tree cutting where necessary and appropriate. 
   I retain the remainder of our time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to at least try to shape for the RECORD some of the facts and statistics that have just been brought out. Last year, commercial sales of logs by the Forest Service produced a profit of $14.7 million. Last year's stewardship sales, the kind that the Senator from Nevada is talking about, for the purposes of forest health, the kind that is going on in the Tahoe Basin, lost the Forest Service $57.4 million. Those are the facts from the Forest Service. 
   It is understandable because when you go in to clean up the dead and dying and to improve the general health of the forested lands, you are dealing with a less valuable stick of timber. But the reality is that what the Senator from Nevada advocates is, in fact, a losing proposition. But I support stewardship, as does the Senator from Nevada, because it improves the forest health, it improves wildlife habitat, and water quality when it is properly done. It is not a money-maker. It is something that will have to be subsidized. 
   Is the Senator from Nevada willing to say that the company that does the stewardship contract for the Forest Service is a subsidized business? He just finished talking about corporate welfare. Is that welfare or is that forest health? Is that an environmentally sound thing to do? I think we are getting our facts a bit mixed up. 
   The road maintenance program was not slashed this year; $10 million was added to it. The Senator from Nevada knows the President's budget, when it came to the Hill, was dead on arrival, and we did not really consider any aspect of it. They wanted more money. They wanted $20 million. We gave them $10 million. So the program was not slashed; it was added to by $10 million over last year's level. It was reduced from the President's recommendation. I believe that shapes the reality of the facts a bit differently. 
   Let me talk a little more about facts. The Forest Service timber program generated directly for personal and business incomes this last year over $2 billion. Personal and business income from the timber program has dropped by almost $5 billion since 1991, for the very reasons we have given, because the Forest Service has reduced its program by 70 percent. We are dealing with less than the 30 percent that remains, and even that produces an income for working men and women and businesses of around $2 billion. 
   The amendment will continue to reduce this. There is no question because you are not going to have the money to do the studies, to do the EISs, to produce the sales, and to recondition the roads necessary to gain access to that timber. There are over 50 timber-dependent communities that each receive over $10 million of personal and business income from the forest timber program. There are almost 150 counties that each receive over $1 million. This income is at risk with the Bryan amendment--no question about it--because he continues to reduce the program. 
   The timber sales program generated $577 million in revenue to the Government and returned $220 million directly to school districts and counties for their roads and bridges. That is the reality of the money from the timber program. 
   It is important to understand that when we talk of allocating tax dollars to the Forest Service, it is done for the purpose of maintenance and of stewardship. All of these create a healthier, more vibrant forest. 
   That is largely the timber sale program today. It is not the large green-cuts program of a decade ago. Still the Senator from Nevada says that is too much and even used phrases like ``corporate welfare'' this morning. I do not think he would say the companies that are in the Tahoe Basin today, thinning and taking out the dead and dying and improving the forest health and ultimately improving the water quality of that basin, are corporate welfare babies. They are industries hired by the Forest Service to improve the health of the forest. 
   The Forest Service timber program generated $309 million in Federal taxes in 1997. This kind of significant economic activity is only when we have a viable timber program. We have reduced it dramatically, the timber program contributed over $700 million in income taxes in 1992. Again, the Bryan amendment will continue to reduce that. 
   We have already talked of the loss of jobs. One-half of the timber program is stewardship or personal use. Sales are used, again, for the purpose of maintaining or improving forest health--thinning, cleaning, reducing the fire hazards and the fuel loads. These types of sales are always, as I have just said, marginally profitable, some of them not, but they are done as part of the responsibility of the Forest Service to progressively improve the general health of our forested lands. 
   We know that Mother Nature, left to her own decisions in forest management, takes a lightning strike where she takes it and oftentimes burns down hundreds of thousands of acres, destroying habitat and dramatically impairing water quality in that immediate area for several years to come. We know that the hand of man, properly directed, can assist in improving the forest health, and that is exactly what many of our programs are about today. 
   The amendment will penalize the Forest Service timber program by reducing activities that are improving the health that I have talked about and the ecosystems about which all of us are concerned. At the same time, the amendment will throw a monkey wrench into a program that is already in trouble and will not contribute increased dollars to the coffers of the Public Treasury. 
   Those are the general issues at hand. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains?

I was just informed, and I think it is reasonable, Mr. President,  to suggest if Hurricane Floyd sweeps up the coast and destroys some of our timberlands in the next few days, we are going to have the President come to us asking for emergency moneys in these areas to clean up the dead and dying trees in some of those areas, and yet here we are trying to cut it at this moment. I guess we will have to wait and see about Hurricane Floyd and forest health.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the other morning on the ``Today'' show--which many of us wake up and listen to as it relates to the morning news or the late-breaking events--there was a Puerto Rican terrorist who the day before had just been released from prison under the clemency that President Clinton had granted him. 
   During that interview, he was consistently asked if he was remorseful, if he was concerned about the lives of American law enforcement officers that had been taken by him and other terrorists such as himself. In all instances, he did not answer. 
   He went on to speak of the cause and the movement and why independence was more important than anything else--independence as it relates to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, not his personal independence. But never once did he speak in any tone that would suggest he was sorry, only that he was glad to be free. I think anyone who had been imprisoned by a court and found guilty would want that. 
   I listened to him and grew increasingly more angry--and I must use that word ``anger''--at a President who is at this instant once again trying to have it both ways on an issue that I know the Presiding Officer and I are very concerned about--and that is the misuse of second amendment rights in our country by citizens of our country. And oh, by the way, that Puerto 
   Rican terrorist is an American citizen, is a citizen of the United States by birth in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. He was not a foreigner who knew nothing about our law; he was an American citizen who violated a Federal firearms statute. 
   When I say I speak with a certain amount of anger in me that we have a President who is living up to his double standard reputation once again in the twilight days of his administration, he is coming to the American people and saying: Give me more Federal firearms laws so I can enforce them and make the streets of America safer. If we have  heard it once, we have heard it five times from the bully pulpit of the White House in the last 6 months: And oh, by the way, to all you Americans who did not catch my sleight of hand, I want to release a bunch of terrorists who were accused and found guilty of violating Federal firearms laws and give them clemency. 
   Mr. President, the American people and this Congress are simply not that dumb. We know you live a double standard and that you speak it oftentimes for political purposes. And on this one you got caught. But, because of the power of the office, you moved ahead and done it anyway. 
   For that I am sorry and wish we could pull that back. But at least, as a Senate, we can speak loudly, as the House did, and force this President to be honest with the American people, if not for just a moment because he has not been honest with us. 
   So, Mr. President, if you want to offer clemency, when somebody is found guilty of the misuse of Federal firearms laws, then do not come to this Senator or this Senate and ask for more Federal firearms laws with which you can play. 
   I find myself on the floor more often than I would like defending the second amendment. But I find it necessary and responsible as a Senator who takes an oath of office to uphold our Constitution because I believe the second amendment is, in fact, a constitutional right in this country. But I have been very cautious in directing or steering the Senate in the crafting of new Federal firearms laws to make sure that we do not take away from those fundamental constitutional rights, and yet the President wants sweeping new power in those areas and then wants to arbitrarily and politically decide when to forgive and forget. 
   Sorry, Mr. President, this time you do not get it both ways. Fool me once, my fault; fool me twice, no, I think not. That is what is happening. I am glad the American people have finally caught on. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, as we debate the Interior appropriations bill--and now the amendment and the substitute amendment offered by Senators BRYAN and WYDEN--I guess I can say at the outset that the only thing I arrive at in trying to consider a $34 million cut in a very essential program to the U.S. Forest Service, especially when the advocacy of the cut comes from the two Senators from large public land Western States such as Nevada and Oregon, is ``frustration'' over the lack of understanding by a Senator from Nevada who is responsible for representing his State which is predominately a public lands State where grazing on public lands and mining the natural resources from those public lands are two of the primary economies of that State, that he would not be supportive of programs within the U.S. Forest Service that deal with public land resources in an appropriate and responsible way. 
   I say that before I get to the specific issues of the amendment because I find it fascinating that in a publication called ``Public Lands Forests, What We Get, What We Pay For''--an interesting publication from the Political Economy Research Center which deals with the subject that the Senator from Nevada knows a great deal about, and in fact knows a great deal more about than I do as the chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee. That the Tahoe Basin, a beautiful and unique area in his State that is being dramatically impacted at this moment by a lack of forest management in a responsible way as we begin to see a relatively affluent urban interface grow around Lake Tahoe and into a forest that is dramatically different than what it was 40, 50, or 100 years ago. 
   Let me quote from this article. I am trying to set a tone for my frustration over why the Senator from Nevada is doing what he is doing and the Senator from Oregon would join with him. Let me quote from this publication, and the title to the article is called ``One Spark From Disaster.'' 
   I quote:  
   As the road dropped out of the Sierras into the Lake Tahoe basin below, the scenery made an abrupt change from healthy, green forests to dead and dying stands of timber. The congressmen on their way to the June 1997 Presidential Summit on the problems facing the lake and surrounding basin were taken aback by what they saw. Later, during a session on forest health, U.S. Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada exclaimed, ``This fores looks like hell!'' It appeared as if someone had drawn an imaginary line across the landscape and then nurtured the trees on one side, while destroying those on the other.  
   What the Senator was experiencing was what many are now experiencing on a Forest Service landscape across our Nation where we have constantly put out fires over the last 75 to 100 years and have not gone in and done selective logging or fuel reduction on our forest floors. We have literally created jungles--jungles that some would like to portray as beautiful, sweeping landscaped timbered vistas when it is quite obvious they are jungles that in the right environment--and the Tahoe Basin gets that environment every so often--could explode into total disaster of the landscape by the kinds of fires California has experienced this year and as have other parts of the country. Those of us more to the North in the Pacific Northwest have been fortunate enough this year in that our relatively unmanaged forests--and mismanaged in some instances--have been wet enough that we haven't had the fire threat. 
   The article goes on to say:  
   Ironically, forest management practices on surrounding federal lands have put at risk the very qualities they were supposed to preserve: the integrity of the forest and the clarity of the lake below--  
   Talking about the beautiful Lake Tahoe--  
   Environmental regulations have delayed some management actions and restricted timber harvests for forest treatments.  
   It has resulted, of course, in the situation that I described around the Tahoe Basin. 
   Of course, the reason the Senators from Nevada are appropriately concerned about the Tahoe Basin is not timber production per se because I don't think you would view the Tahoe Basin as being an area where you would expect timber production, but it is the recent interfacing of resort homes--summer homes, many of them going in the millions of dollars--that use Lake Tahoe and find Lake Tahoe to be a marvelous place to live and, of course, coupled with the thousands of tourists who come there on an annual basis to see this tremendously beautiful high mountain alpine lake. 
   Why, then, would a Senator from Nevada want to cut a program where the money is utilized to do the necessary surveys and the preparations for the kind of fuel unloading or fuel decreases that Tahoe Basin would need because most of our timber sales are no longer green sales, they are sales of dead and dying timber. They are sales that are a product of forest health and not an ongoing aggressive timber program of the kind that brought the environmental outcry of a decade or two ago. 
   I must say the Senator from Oregon has a bit of a different circumstance. He and I joined ranks on the floor last week on a very critical issue. As you know, when this administration came to town a few years ago, they were faced with the situation of a timber industry imploding in the State of Oregon, imploding as a result of a spotted owl decision that took a tremendous amount of the timbered landscape of that State--both Forest Service and BLM timber--off the table, or at least had locked it all up in the courts. 
   This President, with the right intention--with the right intention--went out to try to solve the problem and basically said: Let me reduce your cut by 80 percent and for the other 20 percent remaining, or something near that, we will focus all of our intent there, all of our energy, and do the finest environmental assessment possible, and that you will be able to log. 
   We know the court decisions have gone well beyond the intent of the Endangered Species Act--reasonable and right surveys--and basically even stopped all of that logging. 
   I can understand why the Senator would want to try to divert money to solve his problem. 
   But he also probably  fails to recognize that, in that diversion, he is affecting timber sales or timber management programs everywhere else in the country because while he is supporting taking 34 million dollars out of that sales and preparation base and putting some of it over into surveys, he is denying the States of Arkansas, Idaho, and others the very resources they need to keep their people working and to keep an industry that is now staggering to stay alive on its feet. 
   That is what brings Members to this point. Yes, we come to the floor now after having dramatically reduced these programs in the name of the environment--and in many instances appropriate reductions--and say we have to notch them down even more. 
   For the next few moments I will talk about the adverse effects on rural communities and jobs that the Bryan-Wyden substitute will have. That substitute takes money away from the program that supports good family jobs. I am talking about good-paying jobs. The two Senators plan to redirect funds out of the timber program into wildlife surveys and road maintenance, which I think will be counterproductive because we are already putting millions of dollars into that program. 
   For me to oppose their amendment does not mean we oppose the surveys. We know we have ramped up the amount of money that goes into those surveys and, of course, in ramping up the surveys, added costs to every timber sale. Then the Senator from Nevada can come to the floor and talk about these timber sales being too expensive and we ought to eliminate them. The reason they are expensive is that the court and some in the environmental community are demanding the money be transferred over to do the surveys. 
   It is a Catch-22. We shove these costs off on to the price of a timber sale. We escalate it to the point it is not a cost-effective timber sale. Therefore, we give some Senators a basis to come to the floor and argue we ought to eliminate them because we can't make money at them when, in fact, the politics have pushed the cost of the surveys well beyond what would be reasonable, appropriate, and responsible, for the purpose of cutting those trees. That is the ultimate Catch-22 in forest management today that has nearly laid the State of Oregon low and has dramatically impacted the State of Idaho. 
   Regarding the timber funding and the Forest Service that prepares the administrative forest activities, the committee already has an appropriate amount for wildlife and for road funding. Redirecting funds, as I have said, will harm the timber program. It will not be consequence free. It will cost jobs in Arkansas, in Idaho. It could cost jobs in other forested States across the Nation where there remains a struggling timber program. 
   The President traveled this summer to several sections of the country suffering from poverty. I applaud him for dramatizing where poverty still exists in a country today that is nearly at full employment. It is almost ironic that in nearly the same breath it could be said that we are at full employment yet we have in certain areas high degrees of poverty. Most of that poverty exists in rural areas today. Most of that poverty exists in rural areas where those communities of working men and women are tied directly to the public lands and tied to the resources of those public lands. 
   Nearly one-third of the counties adjacent to national 
   forests suffer poverty levels that are at least one and a half times higher than the national average. Let me refer to a fascinating chart that comes from the U.S. Forest Service's TSPIRS employment figures. 
   I refer to the solid bars on this chart showing employment from the harvesting and processing of national forest timber between 1989 and 1997--just over a few years--has dropped from 140,000 working men and women to 55,500. Let me repeat that. That is more dramatic than any other employment sector in our country, except in the making of buggies and buggy whips, and no young person on this floor even knows what I am talking about because that industry died a long time ago. In a decade we have lost from a 140,000 high down to 55,000 jobs for working men and women. The Senator from Nevada wants to take that down even further by the action he proposes today. 
   I am not quite sure I understand why, but let me show the very real impact. I am tremendously familiar with this because not only in my lifetime but in my tenure in the Congress, from when I started serving in 1981 until today, what I speak of has happened. I have watched it happen. I have been to the locations. I went to Grangeville, ID. I watched grown men sit on stacks of lumber and cry, literally, tears rolling down their cheeks because there were no more trees to cut under the Federal forest plan and they had lost their job. The mill was going to be unbolted, placed in shipping containers, and sent to Brazil to cut the rain forests because the environmentalists decided that the Nez Perce Forest in Idaho was no longer producing trees--although it was growing 10 times more trees than it was cutting. 
   What happened? Here are the very dramatic figures from a tremendously narrow period of time. The State of Washington, 1989 to today, 55 mills closed and the loss of 3,285 jobs; Oregon, 111 mills closed and the loss of 11,600 jobs; Montana, 13 mills closed and 1,083 jobs lost; Idaho, 17 mills and 707 jobs lost. 
   Let me talk about Midvale, ID, my hometown. If I am a little sensitive today, I should be. I used to go to that mill and buy lumber. It employed 45 men. The attitude on the floor is: What is the big deal? It is only 45 jobs. But it was 45 jobs and 45 homes in a community of 300 people--not 30,000, not 50,000, not 100,000, but a community of 300 people. To lose 45 jobs is to lose a lot. That mill has closed. Why? Because on the Payette National Forest, argumentatively, at least by national forest standards, there were no more trees to cut. 
   That is why I can responsibly and legitimately turn to the Senator from Nevada today and say: Senator, your bill destroys jobs. Your bill destroys high-paying jobs, $35,000, $45,000, $55,000-a-year jobs for men and women, important jobs in rural communities, in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, California, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alaska. 
   In talking of mill closures--and I referred to the dramatic numbers--let me also quote the Western Council of Industry Workers, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. It is their people, in many instances, who are losing these jobs. They say:  
   Legislative efforts to reduce funding for forest management programs seriously jeopardize the livelihoods of our members and tens of thousands of forest products workers nationwide. Job loss within our industry has been severe, as the timber sales program has been reduced by 70 percent since the early 90s.  
   A 70-percent reduction in the timber program, a reduction in jobs from 140,000 to 55,000, and the Senator from Nevada wants to cut it even deeper. 
   It is pretty hard to understand why, especially when you look at the new environmental standards of today and what the Forest Service is demanding of a timber sale as it relates to the survey and the kind of mitigation plan that comes because of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act and, of course, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act and all of those kinds of rules and regulations and processes and procedures that by law are required. I am not sure I understand why. 
   I do know several years ago the National Sierra Club developed as one of their policies, zero cut on public lands. I know that is what they believe. I know that is what they advocate. I know they are champions of this kind of amendment because if you cannot stop logging altogether, you stop it a little bit at a time until it is all gone, even if the health of the forests are at the point of explosion from wildfires like those being experienced in California today, and even if the Tahoe Basin runs at a high risk, with the risk not just to the trees but the loss of hundreds of multimillion-dollar homes where the wealthy come to play and reside in the urban/rural interface. That is the issue at hand. 
   I will go on to quote from those men and women who work in the industry. They say:  
   More than 80,000 men and women have lost their jobs as that timber program has reduced by more than 70 percent since 1990.  
   We know that is real. The Senator from Oregon knows it is real. The Senator from Idaho knows it is real. I have  attended the mill closures. My guess is, so has the Senator from Oregon.

   Mr. CRAIG. Unemployment in rural timber-dependent communities is in double-digit figures despite rosy employment figures in the rest of America. The Senator from Oregon and I visited similar communities--he in his State, I in my State--over the August recess. I can go from my community of Boise where there is near zero unemployment--it is a growth community, it is a high-tech community, it is doing very well--and I can drive 100 miles to a community that has 14 to 16-percent unemployment. Why? That community is right here. That community is right here. That is because they were dependent upon the public lands and our Government and the politics of the public lands said: Stay off the land. Don't cut a tree. The mills closed or the mill is closing or the mill is at risk. Those people are unemployed. 
   They cannot identify with a job in the high-tech industry. Why? Each of them would have to move 100 miles and uproot their family and they would have to be retrained and educated. A 45-year-old man does not want to do that. He cannot understand, if we are growing five times more trees than we are cutting, why we cannot at least create a balance in a program that will afford him or his son, who is graduating from high school and does not want to go on to college, a job in the forest products industry. 
   While the national average unemployment rate hovers at around 4 percent, more than 30 forest-dependent counties have three times that rate. Over a dozen forest-dependent counties have an unemployment rate of 16 percent. I believe the Bryan amendment will bring even further economic harm to the people of those rural areas. 
   When I first got here in 1981, there was a mantra about the debate on the forest products industry and about forest management: Take away a few jobs and we will replace them. We will replace them with tourism and recreation. It was America wanting to go to the public lands to enjoy the environment of the public lands. 
   To some extent that has happened but only to a minor degree compared to what was projected during the decade of the early 1980s. But remember, while some of it happened, the kind of jobs that were created were fundamentally different jobs from those $30,000, $40,000, $50,000-a-year jobs that I am talking about in the forest products industry. A maid or waitress or a gas station attendant or a tour guide does not make that kind of money. They work at slightly above minimum wage. They have no health benefits. They have no retirement program. Their work is seasonal. They are oftentimes out of work 4 or 5 months out of the year. And, yes, they are on welfare. And, yes, they qualify for food stamps. 
   I must say these once were the proud men and women of the forest products industry that we politically destroyed. We politically destroyed it. We are here today for politics. We are politically trying to destroy what remains of a responsible way of managing our forests today, not because it is the right thing to do from a management point of view but because it is the right thing to do politically. I know of no other reason. I cannot understand why the Senator from Nevada, who comes from the great public land State that he does, would want to turn his back on one segment of the economy of a public land State such as Idaho or Nevada. 
   He and I stand arm in arm together on mining issues. I was in Elko, NV, last week in a community that 15 years ago was 5,000 people; today, 25,000 people, not because of the 
   high-tech industry but because of gold, gold in the Carlin Trend; mining, high-priced jobs being paid to thousands of men and women in the mining industry. So when we battle on that issue, the Senator from Nevada and I stand arm in arm. But when we try to work on a reasonable and responsible forest management plan that allows some tree cutting, I am tremendously frustrated the Senator from Nevada and I cannot stand arm in arm on that issue also. 
   It is an issue of jobs. It is an issue of right and responsible ways of managing our forests. It is political. I am saddened that it is. 
   The substitute amendment transfers $10 million of the reduction that I have talked about, $34 million in timber funds to pay for surveys on rare species. I do not think that is responsive to the problem of the unreasonable wildlife survey requirements in the President's Northwest Forest Plan, which we discussed in this body last week. 
   First of all, the Forest Service timber sale budget is what pays for the surveys. Thus, rather than a $10 million increase for this purpose, the net effect of this proposal is a $24 million decrease. So we give them not even a half a loaf. We give them a quarter of a loaf. 
   Second, the Clinton administration has agreed that many of these surveys should not be done; indeed, many cannot be done. That is precisely why the administration is writing an EIS in an  attempt to change these requirements. Unfortunately, timber sales are enjoined until the EIS is completed. 
   I happen to agree with the editorial statement this past Sunday in the Portland Oregonian, the largest and most respected newspaper in Oregon. The Oregonian correctly notes that: 
   The surveys of rare species of animals and plants required in the Northwest Forest Plan are ``technically impossible'' and [they use the right word] ``preposterous.......'' 
   The Senate didn't use the word ``preposterous,'' but last week the Senate said no to the judges; they are not going to let the judges in the Eleventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit write policy. That is our job. That is what we are elected to do. They are appointed to interpret the Constitution and not to write timber policy. The Oregonian calls it ``preposterous.'' The Oregonian further describes the requirements as:  
   ..... a poison pill--a way to block all logging and prevent the plan from working as it was designed.  
   Yet we want to put more money into that. It makes no sense to spend $10 million for a prescription for a poison pill or for preposterous survey procedures. This Congress should not spend 10 cents in what I believe is a most inappropriate fashion. 
   That is the foundation of the debate as I see it. I believe that is a reasonable interpretation of why we are on the floor today. I know of no other. At a time when we have reduced the overall timber program in this country by 7 percent, we have reduced employment by almost 50 percent, 
   and we have dramatically transformed the rural landscape to communities of unemployed people and empty homes. That is the policy of this Government at this time. And somehow we want to perpetuate that or increase it? I think not. 
   The only explanation possible that I believe is reasonable and right is the politics of it. We are on the floor today because the National Sierra Club and others said we ought not be cutting trees on public lands at all, zero, end of statement, not to improve health, not for fire prevention, not to create vibrant and youthful stands just do not cut them at all; let Mother Nature be our manager. 
   That is not good business. We know that is not good business, especially when man, for the last 40 or 50 years, has put out all the fires and not allowed Mother Nature to manage. Now when she has an opportunity to manage where there are 50 trees instead of 5--that would have been true 100 years ago--we create monstrous wildfires that not only destroy the stands but scald the land and make it sterile and nonproductive for decades to come. That is where man has to step back in as a good steward, a right and responsible steward, for all of the environmental reasons, the water quality reasons, and the wildlife habitat reasons for which we manage a forest. 
   I yield such time as is required to the Senator from Arkansas.

   Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Oregon. We have worked closely together for the last number of months to try to resolve a variety of timber issues and conflicts that have brought some of our rural communities to their knees. 
   Those are communities that not only in many instances have lost jobs in the sawmills that I have talked about in my opening comments, but these are communities that also lost their moneys to run their schools. 
   My colleague from Oregon has communities that only go to school 4 days out of 5 days of a week because they have no more money to run their buses and to keep their schools open. I have communities in my State that are now debating over whether to put their money in the hot lunch program or athletics and ask all of their high school and grade school students to brown bag all the time. 
   You say: What does this have to do with this debate? What does this have to do with cutting trees in the national forests? It has a great deal to do with these communities that are timber dependent because 25 percent of the stumpage fee that comes from a Federal timber sale goes to the local communities for their schools, their county roads, and their bridges. 
   That is historically what we believe is a fair treatment of those communities that oftentimes house the loggers and the mill employees and the executives of the timber companies and the Forest Service but have no private land base because all of the land around them is public land, and they should share in the revenue flowing from that public land. Those are what we call timber-dependent communities. 
   The Senator and I worked to try to resolve that issue. We are very close to what I think is some tremendously positive and creative thinking that results from, hopefully, minds coming together out of conflict to bring resolution. I am fearful this amendment does not do that. I say that because while the Senator suggests that he prescribes deadlines by which EISs ought to be done, this administration and this Forest Service isn't talking anywhere near that. They are suggesting the deadline for a draft EIS ought to be in February and that the final ought to be in June for the EISs we are talking about for these sales. Whether you could expedite that, I am not sure. 
   The one thing we want to be very careful about in light of the environment in which we are doing these kinds of EIS's and studies is that the work be done right. As the Senator from Oregon and I know, the judges and the environmental communities will be like vultures hovering over each one of those efforts to fine pick every bone to make sure the work is done well. 
   Accelerating some of those studies could put at risk--I am not saying ``will,'' but I think we need to be very cautious at this moment as we try to wrestle through this very difficult policy issue between whether the Eleventh Circuit is right or whether this Congress will finally get aggressive enough to lead in changing the law in a way that we will not have our judges administering forest policy through their own whim, be it law, or, in many instances, be it their politics as applied to the law that causes Eleventh Circuit or Ninth Circuit judges to do what they have done recently 
   that the Senator from Oregon is so worried about, and that I, not only as the Senator from Idaho but as chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, literally go into the tank because the Congress of the United States has been unwilling to lead in this area and establish well-based policy that we can effectively defend and are willing to defend. That is part of  the problem we are dealing with, and I hope the work of the Senator from Oregon and me results in that. 
   Let me make a final comment to the Senator from Nevada. It was not my intent to make an inaccurate statement. As chairman of the Forests and Public Land Management Subcommittee, I have spent the last several years and 45 hearings looking at every aspect of the forest management of our country to try to understand it. I have examined, not in person and not on the ground, but all the studies of the Tahoe Basin problem. I recognize the basin problem is a combination of things, particular to forest density, that has resulted in dead and dying timber and drought environments of the kind discussed. This has created the negative habitat today that changes the character of the lake's water quality because of the runoff. I also understand that this creates phenomenal bug problems with dead and dying trees because the ground cannot support the base. 
   As the Senator from Nevada and I know in looking at computer models, before European man came to this continent, many of the acreages we are talking about were sparsely timbered and were much more pastoral. That was partly because of fire moving through the habitat, creating a mosaic of young and old alike. The Tahoe Basin changed when we became the stewards of the land and put out the fires. 
   The Senator from Nevada and I both agree on the condition of the Tahoe Basin. The point I am trying to make: What the Senator is doing is, in fact, taking money away from the ability of the Tahoe Basin to manage itself because the Tahoe Basin money is not a single-line item issue. 
   Let me explain. The Senator is amending an account that is divided into three categories. I am looking now at Forest Service management program reports. In the timber revenues and expenses, there are three categories. There is the timber commodity program component, there is the forest stewardship program component, and the personal-use program component. Those are the three that make up the account the Senator has amended. 
   The last report we have is 1997. In that year, in the first account, the timber commodity program account, the Senator is absolutely right, the Tahoe Basin had not one dollar of revenue or expenses because it is not a timber-producing area. In the stewardship area in revenues produced by actions, about $377,000 and $1,383,000 spent on stewardship programs--the very kind the Senator wants to see that begins to change the culture, the environment, of the basin area. There was approximately $39 million in revenues from the personal-use program and about $181 million in expenses. 
   I believe I am right. It was not my intent to mislead or to distort the Record. The Senator and I should clarify this. This is the document from the Forest Service. The account the Senator amends and takes $34 million from is the account from which the stewardship programs from the Tahoe Basin are funded. There is not a line item specific to the Tahoe Basin that I know or that we can find in any research. If the Senator would clarify that--I think by accident he may well be cutting out the very moneys he has fought so hard to get to begin to ensure the forest health or the improved health of that basin area. 
   In our stewardship analysis of the basins that are in trouble around the Intermountain West, and primarily the Great Basin environment of the West--because that is where fire is a critical tool--let me read again from the article ``One spark from a disaster.''  
   On adjacent lands just above the national forests the trees remain vigorous and healthy with a similar history of early forest clearing followed by fire suppression. These stands have escaped the bug infestation and the high mortality of the lower basin area [which is Federal land]. These privately owned timber lands were intensively managed to ensure vigor and high productivity. Unlike the Federal forest lands, private timberland managers responded to the bottom line and protected their forest assets over time.  
   My point is, what the Senator has appropriately advocated in getting into the basin, to change the way it is managed, to bring stewardship programs to do the thinning and to do the selective burn, absolutely has to be done to restore the vigor, to create an ecosystem that is less dependent on moisture, so it can handle itself through the kinds of droughts that we in the West experience--especially those in Great Basin States. 
   If the Senator could clarify that for me, I would appreciate that. It is my knowledge at this moment that the account his amendment pulls money from is the very account from which the stewardship program for the Tahoe Basin finds its funding. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for responding. 
   It is important to understand that one third of that fund still goes to stewardship. That is not just commercial activity. That is thinning and cleaning. 
   Also, it is important for the Senate and the Record to show we increase road maintenance by $10 million this year over last year. There was a recommendation of $20 million; we increased it by $10 million. There has been an actual net increase of $11 million, and a fair amount goes to the Tahoe Basin. 
   So the Forest Service is responding. We believe the committee and the appropriators were responsible, going in the right direction. What I think is important to say is that there were no cuts. We did not cut the program. We raised the program by $10 million. While some suggested it ought to go $20 million, it is a net increase over last year's funding level of $10 million.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for coming to the floor this morning and asking his colleagues to come with him to discuss what is one of the most fundamental arguments and debates this Senate has had, and that is the debate over taxes and how much our government should rightfully take from the American worker and the American family to fund and finance the services of government. 
   When I first came to Congress in 1981, we were rapidly spending into deficit, and I said at that time my goal would be to balance the Federal budget. 
   I well remember that some of the old-timers who had been in Congress then for 30 or 40 years laughingly said, ``Not in your lifetime, young man.'' ``Not in your lifetime.'' They also repeated that it really wasn't in the character of our Government or in the good of the Nation that we should ever balance the Federal budget and that deficit spending was appropriate and right for Government to stimulate the economy. I was of a different school of thought, as were many. 
   In the early 1980s, I joined with Democrat and Republican who agreed with me to introduce balanced budget amendments and to begin to educate Americans that balancing the Federal budget--the annual operating budget and keeping it balanced--would reap this country great dividends. 
   If you can flash back to the early 1980s, it was also at a time when our deficits were building in the Federal Reserve. At that time, Paul Volcker was saying to us: If you will get your fiscal house in order and I can get my monetary house in order, and we can keep them in balance, we can diminish inflation, lower our interest rates, and cause a tremendous economic growth in our economy. 
   Congress in those early days chose not to listen. We continued to deficit spend. Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, basically took it on himself, as did the Federal Reserve, to kill inflation in this economy. It was a very costly task. It threw thousands and thousands of people out of work. It bankrupted small companies. It destroyed farming and ranching communities. It was a devastating thing to do. But it happened. 
   Some of us have already forgotten 21 percent interest rates at one point and high levels of unemployment. Why? Because the fiscal and monetary policy of this Nation's Government was out of sync. We continued to deficit spend. We continued to mount those deficits until 1994. The American people said enough is enough, and we will listen to a conservative Republican Congress, and we want you to balance the budget. So they changed our country significantly by electing a more conservative Republican majority in Congress. The rest of the story is, while difficult at times, quite simple; that is, we balanced the budget. We did so by restricting the growth of spending at a time when new technologies in our economy were exploding on the scene. The economy and the fiscal policy and monetary policy began to go into balance. We have seen the most phenomenal economic renaissance literally in the history of this country, if not the history of the world. 
   Our economy today drags the rest of the world's economies with it. Our workforce has never had more options, generally speaking, and opportunity for employment in the history of our country, except, as the Senator from Georgia knows, in rural agricultural communities and some of our resource-based communities where agricultural policy or Government policy is not in sync at this moment, and where we have a unique phenomena around the world such that our biotechnology has expanded around the world to the point of creating tremendous surplus because of the balanced budget. 
   Because of the fiscally responsible Congress, we are now experiencing the politics of surplus--not deficit but surplus. The politics of that surplus is really quite simple. For those who like to spend, they lick their chops and rub their hands and say, look at all we can do more than we are doing for the American people. 
   For those of us who really believe we are doing enough and that the American people best know, as the Senator from Georgia said, where and how to spend their money on their families, the politics of surplus is the opportunity to reward the American people for their wisdom in requiring their Government to balance its budget and to return to the American family the money that is rightfully theirs in the reality that we are, in fact, overtaxing the American workforce for the amount of money necessary to run Government. 
   We knew coming to this session of Congress that what we wanted to do for the American workforce and the American taxpayer in returning to them their money would be a difficult task at best. The first sounding of the alarm came with the President's State of the Union Message when he not only proposed in a time of surplus 80-some new spending programs but even proposed a tax increase. I mean, my goodness, Bill. We are talking about potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of surplus and the argument is that we are probably overtaxing the American people and you want more money and you want to tax more. That really was the beginning of the battle that we have engaged in for about 7 long months. 
   It was also quite obvious from the very beginning this President would have an ally. That ally would be the liberal press that, from the very beginning, was always asking people such as me and the Senator from Georgia: Well, but what about the President's position? Don't you think that is the right position? 
   In essence, they were saying: My goodness, you are surely not going to give back this money when you can spend it on all of these programs. 
   Here is how all of that refines itself into headlines. I was fascinated by it. 
   In February, I asked the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, who all of us respect greatly, to come to speak to the Republican policy luncheon. He said: What do you want me to speak about? Quite simply, I want to ask you one question: What do you do with surplus? Alan Greenspan came. And he said: Let me suggest that  you reduce marginal rates, you pay down debt, ``but, most importantly, you don't spend it.'' 
   ``Most importantly, you don't spend it.'' 
   He said the reason is quite simple. Don't send a message to the economy of this country that you are going to lift the caps and start spending money. He said it will be a most negative message because the available resources of this country are now dedicated to growth and job creation in the private marketplace. And if you suggest that you are going to increasingly take more of it and spend it in Government, you will send a more negative signal. Don't do it. 
   Before the August recess, after we had shaped a tax bill and we were in the final days of debating it and getting ready to send it to the President, the headlines in the papers were ``Alan Greenspan not in favor of tax cut.'' 
   The reason I use that example is because it typifies what we knew very early on--that we have many enemies out there as did the taxpayers have in pushing this message. Enemy No. 1, Bill Clinton; No. 2, a collective press that would not fairly write to the American people the broad base of this argument. 
   Let me tell you what Alan Greenspan said that extrapolated itself into headlines as ``not in favor of tax cut.'' He said, and I am not going to extrapolate; I am going to quote:  
   My first priority, if I were given such a priority, is to let the surplus run. As I have said before, my second priority is if you find that as a consequence of those surpluses they tend to be spent--  
   In other words, Alan Greenspan is consistent with February and late July--  
   Then I would be more in the camp of cutting taxes because the least desirable is using those surpluses to expand outlays or to spend.  
   Greenspan continued:  
   I give great sympathy to those who wish to cut taxes now to preempt that process, and, indeed, if it turns out that they are right then I would say moving on the tax front makes a good deal of sense to me.  
   Do you know that Alan Greenspan is right? Already the forces of the idea that the President will veto this package are at hand saying: Can we have another $10, $15, or $20 billion? 
   Can we have all of the surplus that will be generated out of the general fund and spend it because the priorities are so important? 
   If we send a signal to the American economy, and Bill Clinton helps it with a veto of this tax bill that will go to him next Tuesday, that we are turning on the spending machine, I am not so sure that a year or two from now we will see near zero unemployment in our country; we will see the vibrant economy; we will see the investment capital; we will see the job creation that has given the American people more reason for optimism than anything we have done or we could do as a government in the last good many decades. 
   I am suggesting what the Republican Congress has done in proposing a very broad-based tax cut is responsible, consistent with our economy, fair, and it is intended to help people. It is intended to say to the American family: Taxpayers are entitled to more than 50 percent of what they earn, to save, to invest, to buy a new home or a car, to do what is truly a part of the American dream; and that is to not consistently have government take away more of it. That has always been the great energy of our society. 
   After Alan Greenspan was at the policy committee, I asked him about this phenomenon in the stock market and this high-tech economy. I said: How do you read this one, Mr. Greenspan? He said: I am not sure I can, other than to say the genius of the American people turned loose in a private marketplace is beyond imagination. 
   Today we have seen that genius simply because we have reduced the level of intensity of government upon that genius. And we want to reduce it a little more. Of all the surplus moneys that will come rolling into government over the next 10 years, we are saying, for every dollar, we only want to give one quarter of it back--not all of it, one quarter of every dollar. Three quarters of it stays in government to shore up Social Security, to reform Social Security, to protect new and future Social Security recipients, to spend a little in selected areas when we find it necessary. 
   Yet one would think, from listening to folks on the other side of the aisle, that this tax cut would destroy government as we know it. I heard a Democrat Senator the other day say it will destroy all the environmental programs; it will destroy all the educational programs; it will destroy all of the welfare programs. After listening to that, my only thought was: Get a life. Where are you coming from? 
   We are talking surplus moneys, not current moneys. We are talking surplus moneys. We are only talking about giving a quarter of it back out of every dollar and keeping three quarters of it to do much of what that Senator was talking about. 
   The reason that Senator was in such an illogical, untruthful panic was that over the August recess Republicans, led by the Senator from Georgia, went home to hold town meetings and press conferences and to visit with our taxpayers and our voters and explain the package. All of a sudden, the numbers started shifting because the national media didn't have control of the message. All of a sudden, the tax bill moved up into the high fifties and sixties as something the American people thought was probably the right thing to do. Still frustrated, they want the debt paid down. But when they found out that over the course of the life of this tax bill we pay down about $2 
   trillion in debt, they said that is fair and reasonable. 
   Of course, when agricultural America, where the Senator from Georgia and I were visiting with our farmers, saw what we had done for them in farming and in the tax package to help production agriculture, they said that makes sense, that gives us tools to survive and to be productive. 
   I am absolutely amazed this President blindly, without listening, reading, or sensing the character of the American people, but only the politics of his party, says ``veto'' from day 1, ``veto'' from day 2, ``veto'' from day 3, instead of saying we have an opportunity to keep this economy growing to allow the private sector to thrive, to hold down the influence of government over the private sector, and, most importantly, allow the American family to pursue its dream. 
   That is what this tax package is all about. It is all about the right things. It is about fairness, responsibility, helping people, and controlling government. 
   I thank my colleague from Georgia for his leadership in this area, for helping send the messages out unfettered, clear and simple, to the American people so they can make up their own minds. They are making up their minds. It is very clear to me where they come down. They come down on the ``no spending'' side, and they come down on the side of splitting the differences between a tax cut and paying down the debt. That is right and responsible. I hope the President will listen as that bill comes to him this coming week. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as we work to pass Interior appropriations, of course, because this is a piece of legislation that is key to so many important areas of our States, whether they be east or west, it is also an opportunity to attempt to change what is standard law or practice or belief in many of our States. The Torricelli amendment on trapping is just that kind of amendment. 
   My guess is there are few Senators on the floor who have actually ever trapped. I grew up on a very rural ranch in southwestern Idaho, and at age 6 I began to run a trapline and I used legholding traps to catch coyote and bobcats. That was done largely for the purpose of raising money, but it was also to protect our domestic livestock herds in the springtime when our cows began to calve and would find themselves, oftentimes, having their baby calves harassed and killed by coyotes. 
   I was taught how to trap, but I was also taught an important lesson in trapping. I will not dispute in any way what the Senator from New Jersey might try to suggest is an inhumane approach, but I will suggest it can be used in a right and responsible way. The thing I was taught by my father and by an elderly gentleman who lived on our ranch who taught me how to trap was that you check your trapline daily, so if an animal is caught, it will not suffer. Of course that is exactly what I did, and that is exactly what good trappers do throughout the West. 
   The reason I was allowed to do that and the reason trappers around the country are allowed today to trap when and where necessary under the appropriate circumstances is that responsibility always rested with State governments--State fish and game departments and State agencies. And because I believe, as most Senators do, that State agencies are much closer to the people and can more quickly respond to the needs of a State or a given locale, that that is where that authority to determine policy ought to be--not with a Senator from New Jersey who would not understand Idaho or any other Western State where the abundance of wildlife sometimes is such that it needs to be managed. He would not understand the State of Idaho or Montana or Wyoming or Alaska works very closely with their fish and game department to make sure laws and regulations fit the need and the desire of the area under concern. 
   Historically, this Government, our Government, the Federal Government, has said it is the responsibility of States to govern and manage wildlife populations. They have said it for the very reason I have just given, because a Congress and a Senate cannot really be in tune with what is necessary in Juneau, or out from Juneau in Alaska, or out from Jackson Hole in Wyoming, or out from Midvale in Idaho. They don't really understand the circumstance if there is an infestation or large buildup of coyote, a killing of domestic livestock herds, and a reason to moderate and manage that wildlife population. That is why we have allowed trapping and why States have consistently allowed it. We have constantly erred on the humane side, of being responsible in the management of our wildlife, as we should. 
   We have the responsibility of good stewardship. That is my job, that is every citizen's job, to be a good steward of their public land resources. But it is not our job here to try to fine tune and micromanage because some interest group comes to us and suggests this is a good and right political thing to do, because it will sell well in suburbia New York. It has no impact in New York. It has no impact whatsoever in that State. But what might sell well and be a good, warm, touchy-feely, ``I care'' kind of vote in New York causes all sorts of problems in a rural Western State such as mine. 
   That is why, again, we have tried to take the emotions out of these issues and say there are categories of responsibility on which we ought to err and on which we ought not. This is an amendment that really should not be debated on this floor. We have 
   a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They make every effort to be responsible in the effective management of our wildlife. And they, while they have broad authority, work directly with State fish and game departments. Historically, they have always had a right and proper relationship, erring on the side of the State and on the side of the area or  local fish and game management experts when making the kinds of decisions that I believe arbitrarily the Senator is attempting to make with his amendment. 
   That is why it is interesting that after this amendment passed the House, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wrote a letter to all of us saying they would not support the House amendment. It was only when the politics caught up with it that Bruce Babbitt, our Secretary of the Interior, came out and said that is not the position of the administration. The reason it has not become the position of the administration is because of a set of environmental groups that came forward and said this is our national cause and we need to make it a national cause, totally ignoring what is good policy or what is a reasonable relationship between a State government and a State agency and the Federal Government and a Federal agency. 
   Interestingly enough, even with the position of the Secretary of the Interior, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has not changed its position. It still believes the Torricelli amendment is the wrong amendment, and the right thing to do is what they have done historically with State fish and game agencies. 
   What do I hear from my citizens? They want the right to trap. They accept the responsibility and they accept the regulations that the State fish and game agency would put upon them. But an outright ban is not the way to manage this, and I hope those of my colleagues who focus on this issue will cut away from the idea that this is an easy, free vote that somehow demonstrates their humaneness toward a population of wildlife. 
   What they ought to err on the side of is allowing their State fish and game agencies to make those determinations and allow the State agencies and the Federal U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that kind of a relationship. I hope they will err on the side of good government instead of warm, feely, and touchy politics because that is all this is. It is a feel-good vote that ends up being pretty bad government in the end. 
   Sometimes, I suggest to my colleagues, it takes a little bit of strength and a little bit of backbone to stand up and say, no, this is the wrong thing to do and then be willing to go home and explain it, if you erred on the side of the State capital and the fish and game agency of that State in making the decision and you trust your State legislators because they are the closest to the people, to make sure fish and game regulations and fish and game management in their State is done in a fair and humane way. I believe it is today, and I believe it will continue to work well that way when we allow our national U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to work closely with our State agencies, erring on the side of primacy, or primary responsibility, at the State and local level. It has worked well in the past. It will work well in the future. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CRAIG. I yield such time to myself as I may consume under the unanimous consent agreement. 
   I sat through most of the debate on this very important amendment that the senior Senator from Illinois has proposed. If I could speak to the senior Senator from Illinois for just a moment, there is a very real difference but a similar responsibility between the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Illinois. 
   When I went home during the August recess, I held meetings with the agricultural community. The Senator from Illinois has a good many farmers, but there was a different kind of person in my meetings than could possibly have been in any meeting he would have. 
   That was a public land rancher. Because the Senator from Illinois knows he doesn't have ranchers and grazers on the public lands of the State of Illinois. But the Senators from Idaho and New Mexico and the Senator from Iowa do--thousands of them. Their livelihood depends on access to the public lands and a perpetuation and a continuation of that access, to keep their ranching operations alive. The Senator from Illinois understands that. He has already expressed that as it relates to financing and banking. 
   What is important here--and I wish to express something that probably no one coming from a public land State would miss--is that there is a very different word, a single word in his amendment that does not exist in law today and should not be put in law. That is the word ``may.'' 
   It has been the public policy of this country that, under certain conditions and in the right areas, grazing is a responsible use of our public lands and that we shall allow grazing as a right in responsible use of our public lands if the following conditions are met--the conditions of the National Environmental Policy Act and the conditions that are established by the regional advisory groups that were appointed by this Secretary of the Interior. That is the law that establishes the permanency and the relationship that the Senator from Illinois said he speaks to, but in fact he does not. 
   Having said all of that, the law of this public land is the National Environmental Policy Act, and from that the rules and regulations by which ranchers graze that public land are established. We have said as a Congress, and as a part of public policy, that with the renewal of those permits there should be an analysis of the condition of the rangeland that the permit is tied to. The Senator from Illinois understands that. That is within the law. But, because of costs, because of personnel, because of the time involved, not all of these permits have been able to be analyzed and therefore gain their impact statement in time for that renewal. 
   Is that a fault of the rancher? It is not. Is that a fault of BLM and the Federal Government? It is. Last year we extended for 1 year the right of renewal while the studies went on. But we also understand--and what Senator DOMENICI's addition to the Interior bill clearly states--after the analysis is done and the terms and conditions of the permit are established, that permit will be allowed and shall exist under those conditions to be met--not ``may be'' but ``shall be.'' That is very important. 
   If the Senator from Illinois were truly dedicated to the continuation of grazing on public lands under these environmental conditions, then the word ``may'' would not be there because that is the word the financial community looks toward to see whether they ought to lend money to this rancher to continue his or her ranching operation. They could not continue that ranching operation without access to the public grazing lands. The map the Senator from Wyoming displayed is the very simple reason why. 
   Idaho's No. 1 agricultural commodity is cattle--not potatoes but cattle in total dollar volume sold. Mr. President, 80 percent of that amount, 80 percent of the cattle in Idaho, have to graze on public lands at some time during the year for them to exist in our State. Throwing that in jeopardy is like suggesting to the Senator from Illinois we are going to wipe Caterpillar out of Peoria or we are going to throw it in such 
   jeopardy that the banks won't continue to finance it. But that will not happen to Caterpillar in Peoria because they are not dictated to by the Government and they are not operating under governmental regulations, except safety and all of that, but their very livelihood does not exist on a ``may'' or ``shall'' piece of language in a Federal bill. 
   That is what is important here. We want the environmental analysis done. We want the public lands to retain a high quality of environmental values. 
   The Senator from Illinois held up some pictures, one from Utah and one from Arizona. The reason he did not show Illinois is that the issue he is talking about doesn't exist in his State, so you will have to go elsewhere to find a problem, if a problem exists, if you want to debate this bill. Those problems do exist on public lands but much less than they ever have. I am extremely proud of the laws we have changed to improve the rangeland conditions in my State and in large, western public land grazing States in this Nation. We should not be throwing extraordinary roadblocks in the way. We ought to be facilitating the BLM in this area. 
   The BLM will not take a position. But when the Director of BLM was in my office several months ago, prior to his confirmation, he said: If you keep the general language in the bill that you had last time, we can support it. That is because they need that flexibility to go ahead to do their analysis  in a right and proper way. That is what is important. 
   So when the Senator from Illinois says that none of these rules can apply, this locks in a standard and the BLM cannot come back and make the changes, I must say, in all due respect to my colleague from Illinois, that is not correct. The BLM does govern these lands. The BLM can make these changes. And the BLM has the right under the law to do it, even if the permit is issued. The BLM has the right to amend the permit if there is major environmental degradation going on. 
   So what the Senator said, and I quote him, ``they could not achieve''--that was in the beginning of his statement, and at the end of his statement he said, ``it would be very difficult for the BLM to achieve changes in the environmental standards allowed under the permit.'' The truth is, the BLM can change these standards. They can rewrite the permits if there are major grazing changes. 
   Another factor the Senator from Illinois would, I am sure, appreciate knowing is, when ranches are brought and sold, while I do not like what the BLM is doing at this moment, they are actually stepping in midway now and saying change some of the regulations. And right now, under this administration's regulations, anyone from the outside can step in and say: We don't like the character of the regulations because the regulations have failed to address certain needs of the land that are not consistent with the grazing permit. 
   Those are the realities with which we are dealing. That is why the Senator from New Mexico thought it was extremely important to offer some degree of certainty to the process. That is exactly what BLM needs because they have not done their work well. They have a huge backlog. In fiscal year 1999 there were 5,360 grazing permits and leases expiring, and, according to the BLM's latest statistics, only 2,159 of these expiring leases--permits or leases--have been analyzed and renewed. So they have a giant task before them. We encourage them to do 
   so. We finance them so they can. 
   Because I am proud of the western legacy of public land grazing, I want it done right. I want it done to assure riparian quality. I do not want our cattlemen run off the public land, the people's land, where the Congress has consistently said it is a right and proper use to graze these grasslands. It is a way to return revenue to our Government while at the same time ensuring quality wildlife habitat, water quality, and all those natural things the Senator from Illinois talks about. 
   Oh, yes, the Senator from Illinois has a right to talk on this issue. Absolutely he does, because these are public lands. But I have tried to discuss today the sensitivity I hope he understands is important, where these lands become a major factor in the economy of my State--not the economy of his State--where it is critically important that we maintain a high quality of grasslands to assure a high quality not only for the environment but for the very users of that environment, in this case the public land grazing in the West. 
   So I hope my colleagues will join me and the Senator from New Mexico and other western legislators in tabling this amendment. 
   We are not saying don't do the study. We are saying do it and do it right, do it properly, and make the amendments and make the changes where necessary, protect the riparian zones, make sure that all of that happens as it should. But do not put a black cloud over a third-generation ranching family who must have a relationship with that land to exist and to ensure their financing on an annualized basis. 
   I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

I am extremely pleased that he listened with great attention to the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Montana, and that he will listen to this Senator from Idaho whose State is 63 percent owned by the Federal Government and whose policy as to how those lands are managed is determined on the floor of the Senate by this Senator, the Senator from Virginia, and others. 
   I listened to the Senator this afternoon as he offered his amendment to strike section 329. I must tell you that I listened with a degree of frustration, certainly in no disrespect to the Senator, but to what I sensed was a lack of understanding of what has brought us to this issue and why the Appropriations Committee found it necessary at this moment in time to speak out and to clarify public policy that the Senator from Virginia is trying to undo. 
   The Senator from Montana, the Senator from Oregon, myself, and others from large public land and forest States have grown tremendously frustrated not by just this administration but by public policy that puts all of us at odds. That arguably does not provide the kind of environmental protection many of us would like and that would allow the balance between environmental protection and under that important umbrella the effective use or utilization of our resources like timber. 
   So we had a judge in the Eleventh Circuit who probably really has never been West, nor does he understand the West, make a ruling on a ground-disturbing activity of the Forest Service on its lands and say that you haven't studied thoroughly enough how that activity contributes to the demise of a plant, a fungus, a slug, a snail, or an exotic animal. This judge went against decades of science, and even nine court decisions that had largely said the Forest Service was doing an adequate job in its overview of the endangered species responsibility under the Endangered Species Act through an environmental impact study. 
   The Senator from Oregon was talking about the judge's decision in the Eleventh Circuit being picked up by the  judge in the Ninth Circuit, and without any real consideration, just arbitrarily spreading across the pages of his decision: Well, if it is good enough in the Eleventh Circuit, it is good enough in the Ninth. 
   Ironically, in the Ninth Circuit, what the Senator from Oregon was talking about was the most comprehensive, above the level of science that has been practiced, reviewed, and mandated under the President's own forest plan. There was a comprehensive effort between the Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries that all aspects of the disturbance would be studied before these timber sales or other activities would go on. 
   As a result of that, I think it is tremendously important for the Senator from Virginia to understand--I serve on the Appropriations Committee--we did not attempt to do anything extraordinary. We just tried to say in public policy that what the judge in the Eleventh Circuit had done, what the judge in the Ninth Circuit was doing, and what a judge in Texas has already picked up on is really outside science. 
   A committee of scientists empowered by this Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, just this last year reported back to the Department of Agriculture and to the U.S. Forest Service that the science they were using that the judge in the Eleventh Circuit knocked down was the right science--that you use indicator species, that you didn't need to get out on the ground and count every plant, or animal, or microorganism. 
   It was unnecessary to do this to determine the kind of impact that a ``Ground disturbing activity'' would have on the ground. But it was very important for the state of the science involved to use the indicator species concept that had been used and upheld in nine different court decisions as the right approach. 
   I guess what I am saying to the Senator from Virginia tonight is how long do we fight? How long do we see this kind of conflict that stops all kinds of activity before the Senator from Virginia is willing to stand up with the Senator from Idaho and do what is our responsibility, and that is crafting sound public policy that disallows the courts and the judges from being the public land managers of our States. 
   Yet the Senator from Virginia tonight says: I want the judge to decide. 
   But he didn't really quite say it that way, and it would be unfair. What he is saying is, let the process continue to go forward. 
   I am extremely disappointed that the chief of the Forest Service is not in the gallery tonight saying to the Senator from Virginia: You shouldn't be doing this. 
   What the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, put in this legislation allows the Forest Service to continue to do what the courts and a team of scientists said is the right thing to do: That is, when you are doing these surveys use the appropriate science, the indicator species, in making the determination as to how to mitigate for a surface-disturbing activity. However, the chief of the Forest Service isn't here tonight nor was he willing to stand up and speak out loudly. 
   What this administration I think is saying, and I trust that it has to be as reasonably disturbing to the Senator from Virginia as it is to this Senator from Idaho, is continue to work through the court process. We think we can work this out. 
   Ironically enough, their working it out means they have already lost 3 lawsuits, they have already lost 3 times. They are still saying: Trust us, we know how to work it out. 
   Even the forest plan that the President himself staked his public land reputation on is in the tank out in Oregon, Washington and northern California. Thousands of people will be out of work this winter because this President wouldn't stand up and ask his chief of the Forest Service to fight for what he originally said he thought was right. 
   He says: Let us work through the court process. 
   How long will it take? We don't know. A year, until after the next election? Possibly. 
   What is most important for the Senator from Virginia to understand is that what is in 329 is not outside the law. Let me read the language:  
   The Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service shall use the best available science and commercial data in amending and revising resource management plans for and offering sales, issue leases or otherwise authorizing or undertaking management activities on, land under their respective jurisdiction.  
   Where does the language come from? Not out of the mind of the Senator from Washington who is the chairman of the Interior appropriations subcommittee. It comes out of endangered species law. It comes out of the act itself. It is the operative language that drives the Endangered Species Act. It is not new language. It is not new law. 
   Then we go on to say,  
   Provided that the Secretaries may at their discretion determine whether any additional information concerning wildlife resources shall be collected prior to approving any such plan, sales, lease or activities.  
   Full discretion to the secretary, to the managing agency. Not new law. Empowering them to do the right thing with their scientists and their expertise. That is what we are doing. We are empowering Bill Clinton. We are empowering Mike Dombeck, the chief of the Forest Service. Yet they are saying, just work this out through the courts. What if they lose the fourth time and it is a year from now and nobody is in the mills and nobody is working and thousands of people are out of work in Oregon, Washington and northern California? 
   Or should we talk for just a few moments about the activities on the George Washington and the Jefferson National Forests in the home State of the Senator from Virginia? Not much timbering in his home State, but there is a lot of ``people'' activity, a lot of trails, a lot of management and road building. Flood control in the Cascade National Recreation Area, a contract involved with 
   repair and construction of four bridges and relocation of portions of the trail and stone structures and retaining walls. All of it is surface-disturbing activity; all of it because someone didn't like it, a lawsuit is filed, and a judge stops it because the Forest Service doesn't know how to do these kind of things. 
   No, not at all. Because the Forest Service didn't examine whether repairing an old trail wall disturbs a lichen or a moss on the wall of stone that was originally put there by man himself. That doesn't make much sense, does it? But that is exactly what striking section 329 will do. 
   I wish the Senator could stand up and say let's abide by science, let's not play this out in the courts anymore. Let's empower the chief of the Forest Service and the assistant secretary of agriculture and the President himself. I don't find myself on the floor of the United States very often defending this President. I don't think he has had good public land policy. But in one area where he really tried, now he himself will not even defend his effort. His chief of the Forest Service is trying to avoid the pressure by environmental groups who see this exactly the way the Senator from Oregon spoke to it this evening: A way to turn the forest off. 
   They will not only stop logging, they will turn your forests off. They will attack any surface-disturbing activity, even if it is a trail, a trail head, or a campground that may facilitate the very citizens of the State of Virginia who enjoy their public lands and their two national forests. 
   As the Senator from Virginia knows, in the mid-1970s we passed the National Forest Management Act. That was to direct the most comprehensive review of every forest in the United States. From that was to come a management plan and a way to execute that plan. The Senator from Virginia knows as do I that he and I and the taxpayers spent nearly a quarter of a billion dollars developing those plans. It was the most comprehensive land-planning exercise in the history of the world. We developed computer models. We looked at every aspect, every watershed, all of the character and the nature of this public land. It was right that we did so. Our forests now operate under those plans. Every activity was viewed through a grid that determines whether they are endangering a species of any kind. That is what I spoke to a few moments ago. However, that whole effort cost a quarter of a billion dollars, or near that. 
   What the amendment of the Senator would do, and if the courts were to win--not the policy makers that we  were elected to be, but a judge, an appointed judge who does not know one thing about the forests in Oregon or Idaho because he is reviewing an activity in a forest in the State of Georgia, he is saying get out there on your hands and knees with as many scientists as you can muster and count and look at every little tidbit. 
   The Senator from Oregon went through that litany of mosses, snails and critters tonight. It is estimated, just estimated, that to do that kind of an evaluation on an acre-by-acre basis across the landscape of the public forests of our country would cost 5, 8, or $9 billion dollars. The Senator from Virginia knows, as do I, we will not appropriate that money. That kind of money doesn't exist and that kind of money should never be spent on this kind of activity. The scientists who are good scientists--not judges, and not environmentalists who want to see the world shut down--are saying that the standards and the tests and the indicator species and the work that is being done today is thorough, adequate and responsible. Yet the amendment of the Senator denies that because that is the exact language that was put in this section of the appropriations bill. 
   Why is it important we do it now? We heard from the Senator from Oregon. I have been to John Day and I have been to Roseburg. Those are mill towns. Those are little communities with millions of acres of public timber land around them. The people who live there make their livelihood from logging. It has changed some because logging has diminished dramatically in those areas. 
   But what the action of the Senator from Virginia is doing, if he is successful, is it turns off those timber sales, nearly 500 million board feet of timber that would keep those mills operating through the winter and into the spring. Because no longer do we operate on a 3-year pipeline, they call it, where you have timber adequate in the pipeline for a 3-year period. That ended with the Clinton administration. Now we are on nearly a timber sale by timber sale basis. 
   Yet, remember the reduction in timber sales that the Senator from Oregon talked about? We are not talking about cutting anywhere near previous levels. We have an 80 percent lower cut in 8 years. And even that which this President said was adequate, right, responsible and environmentally sound, a judge now arbitrarily has taken away. So that is why we are on the floor this evening. This is one of the most time sensitive amendments, directly relating to jobs and people's well-being, that is in this legislation. 
   Let me close by one other analysis. I was in one of my communities, Grangeville, Idaho County, Idaho, a big county right in the heart of my State, with 70-plus percent, 80 percent public lands. In one of those communities they started their school year with no hot lunch program. Why? Because a huge portion of their budget came from timber sales, the Twenty-Five Percent Fund. The Senator may be familiar with it. For every tree that is cut, the counties and the schools got 25 percent of the stumpage fee. We are not cutting trees in that area anymore, even though there are millions of acres of trees there. As a result, the school had to decide whether to have an athletic program or hot lunch program for the kids. They are struggling, taking donations from the community to have hot lunches. I don't know whether that's happening anywhere in Virginia, taking donations to have a hot lunch program to feed kids. But the Senator's amendment has an impact on that kind of caring event. 
   I wanted to personalize this because I don't think, when the amendment to strike came to the floor, there was an understanding of the immediacy of the impact of this kind of decision. It was just some neat environmental vote that we would have because that is what a lot of the environmental community wants. This is a test vote of some kind. 
   It is not a test vote on anything other than a political idea. It does not bear out consistently good policy because we have good policy in this area. We have scientists from around the world saying we do it better than anyplace else. Yet a judge simply said no, you don't. You don't do it the way I think it should be done, and therefore I want you to do it differently. 
   That is the crux of the debate. There are all kinds of opinions around it. But I must say, to an administration that has three times lost this battle in court, for them to step up now and say, trust us, let's work it out, without an alternative plan, with the idea we will work it out and get to the point and they lose another lawsuit and we are 12 months down the road and the people in Roseburg or John Day are not back to work? 
   It is not impacting my State at this moment. But here is what happens in my State. It is like a West Virginia-Virginia relationship. If they are not cutting trees in Oregon, even under the President's plan, and these mills are deprived of trees and people are out of work, that mill operator comes into Idaho looking for timber sales. He bids up the price well beyond where it ought to be, takes a timber sale out of Idaho, puts those logs on a truck and heads them west over the Cascades into Oregon just to keep his people working. 
   So my mill in Orofino, or a place like that, is with less timber at a time when we are hardly cutting any timber. And we have simply pitted one against another. That is not good policy either. But ultimately that is what can happen and that is what will happen in my State, even though this judge's decision at this moment does not impact us. 
   But failing Congress' ability to establish and clarify this policy issue, some group will file a lawsuit and argue on the premise of the judge from the eleventh and the judge from the ninth circuit, that those kinds of effective studies were not done on a given disturbing activity in my State. Then it will apply further into my State. 
   Those are the issues. I hope our colleagues are listening tonight. I understand we will debate this tomorrow some, but we will vote on it. 
   To reiterate, I oppose the amendment by Senator ROBB that would remove Section 329 of the Interior Appropriations bill. This effort is misguided and I strongly urge my colleagues to understand the need for this Section if our national forests are going to continue to function. The Section simply clarifies that despite recent circuit and district court decisions, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior maintain the discretion to implement current regulations as they have been doing for nearly 2 decades. 
   During the past two decades, nine separate court decisions have backed the way the Forest Service has been conducting their surveying populations by inventorying habitat and analyzing existing population data. 
   On February 18, 1999, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the Forest Service must conduct forest-wide wildlife population surveys on all proposed, endangered, threatened, sensitive, and management indicator species in order to prepare or revise national forest plans and on all ``ground disturbing activity''--not just timber sales. Never before has such an extensive, and frankly impossible, standard been set by the courts. 
   Another ruling on August 2, 1999, in Federal District Court in Seattle, on a similar case, jeopardizes the President's Northwest Forest Plan, and has already begun to stop most if not all ground disturbing activity in the Northwest. 
   These rulings result in paralysis by analysis. It would require the Forest Service to examine every square inch of the project area and count every animal and plant--even every insect--before it approved any activity. 
   The cost to carry out such extensive studies--studies which have never been required before--could be approximately 9 billion dollars. How do we do this? Because the Forest Service does contract for population inventorying on occasion. A population trend survey requires two studies. If we extrapolate from the $8,000 cost of one plant inventory, we reach $38.1 million for the 864,000 acres within the Chattahoochee National Forest where this decision originated. If applied to the 188-million acre national forest system, the cost reaches $8.3 billion. 
   We appropriate roughly $70 million for forest inventory and monitoring. Are we prepared to shift the $9 billion necessary for this new standard? If not, this recent interpretation forces the Forest Service to shut down until the Agency can apply the new standard. 
   The purpose of Section 329 is not to change the court decisions or set a  new, lower standard. It is simply to clarify that the existing regulation gives the discretion to the Forest Service and the BLM when determining what kind of surveys are needed when management activities are being considered. 
   Some of my colleagues would argue that this is an issue for the authorizing committees to deal with. I agree. This is an issue that absolutely should be dealt with by those committees. They need to determine whether the agencies have been correctly interpreting their regulation for the past 17 years. They need to determine whether it is sufficient to inventory habitat, rely on existing population, consult with state and federal agencies and conduct population inventories only for specific reasons. 
   But I argue that the appropriations process should not be made to bear the burden while the authorizing committees study the question. All section 329 does is to preserve, for the next year, the status quo as it existed on April 8, 1999. Otherwise, our already limited resources will be further overwhelmed if we are required to fund this new standard. 
   I urge you to oppose this amendment and support sensible management. 
   We are appropriating roughly $70 million for forest inventory monitoring this year. There is only $70 million in the Federal budget. Yet it is now estimated that this will literally cost us billions of dollars if the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Idaho cannot stand up and look some of our radical friends in the eye and say: That is not good policy. You are not the policymaker and your lawsuits and your judges are not either. We are. We were elected to craft policy. The Senator from Virginia and I are responsible only if we take that kind of leadership position. 
   That is the kind of leadership position that Senator GORTON took in the appropriations bill. He did not go outside the law and he did not go outside practice. He mandated and requested the Forest Service of the United States act responsibly, under the Endangered Species Act, and gave them the guidelines to do so. That is what section 329 does. 
   That is leadership. Falling back into the arms of the judge and simply seeking the will of the courts is not. I hope my colleagues would join with me tomorrow and oppose a motion to strike. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. Let me thank him for the tremendous work he has done in the last several months to produce a tax package that is here on the floor. 
   Let me turn to my colleague from Louisiana first. I wish the President would follow that Senator's leadership, for if he had followed his leadership, we would have a Medicare package and be working on it right now. But the President chose to politicize Medicare and to walk away from his Democratic colleagues whom he placed onto the Commission to do the work that they did so well in a bipartisan way. 
   And we are here today without a fix for Medicare because the President did not awaken to the responsibility he had in that regard and the opportunity that the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from Nebraska had helped create in the Medicare Commission. I wish the President had awakened, but he chose not to. 
   We are here today debating a tax relief bill for the American people, a relief bill that, in my opinion, is responsible, reasonable. In all fairness, given the total picture of our budget and our projected revenues, it is, in fact, modest tax relief. 
   Some would be surprised by that statement on the modest size of this tax relief package if they were to listen to the rhetoric from the other side of the aisle. But that is the truth. It is responsible tax relief, within the responsible budget plan which we passed earlier this year. 
   Under this plan, we use three-fourths of the total budget surplus to pay down the public debt by nearly one-half over 10 years and completely protect the Social Security system. For the first time in the history of our Government, our budget commits us to reserving all of future Social Security surpluses and all future Social Security revenues exclusively for Social Security beneficiaries. That is a first for all of us; it is an important and responsible first. 
   If we continue to hold the line on new spending, that discipline plus some of the leftover surplus funds, also will allow us to accommodate prudent Medicare reforms, meet emergencies, and address additional priorities that we may face, also all within that three-fourths of the surplus that we are setting aside. 
   This tax relief bill draws on the remaining one-fourth of the total surplus. This is hardly not reckless, like some have said. It is responsible, reasonable, and modest to take just one-fourth of the total surplus and return it to the American people. 
   These facts seem to go unrecognized on the other side of the aisle. After we safeguard Social Security, meet the true and real responsibilities of Government, account for Medicare and other priorities, what we do in this bill is say to those whom we have overcharged, those who have overpaid their income taxes, we are going to refund to you a little of your own money. 
   Too many in Government and the press seem to miss this fundamental question: Who earns the money in the first place? Whose money is it? I am always fascinated by the debate on taxes when the other side seems to think that nearly everything the working person owns is the Government's. And if we are providing tax relief, somehow in our generosity, we are turning to them and smiling, and saying: We are going to give you back just a little. 
   Are we, to quote some on the other side, ``spending'' this money on a tax cut? Are we giving it back? No. We are saying it belongs to the worker who earned it, and that he or she should be able to keep a little more of the fruits of his or her own labors. 
   What we are suggesting is that we don't take so much in the first place--that we have enough right now to fund Government in a responsible way, and we ought to recognize that it is the working person out there we are taking it from, and we ought to return the overcharge. 
   This tax relief is phased in, meaning future Congresses will have plenty of time to react if the economic conditions of our country change. That is also part of the argument why this bill is 
   responsible. 
   The bill represents only a 3.5-percent tax cut. That is modest, especially for the most heavily taxed generation in American history. 
   Some of the future tax relief won't even kick in unless the national debt is in fact being reduced. I think that is responsible. Yet we hear the mantra again of, pay down the debt, pay down the debt. 
   If you would read the facts of this tax relief bill we have put together, and the budget it implements, we are paying down a very substantial part of the debt--more than one-half of it. In fact, we already have paid down $142 billion in the public debt in the last 2 years. 
   Under our budget, and on top of this tax relief, we will pay down over $200 billion in debt more than the President's budget called for, even though he is one of those out there talking about debt reduction at this moment. 
   Let me make you a deal, Mr. President. You say you are going to veto the tax cut. Well, if you veto the tax cut, why don't you bring to us a lockbox proposal that puts all of the surplus in a lockbox to pay down the debt? A lockbox that makes a binding guarantee that not one cent of the surplus will go to new spending. You are not about to do that, Mr. President. But if you would, I would support you in it because debt reduction is important. It would help the economy of this country. 
   But one has to wonder if the President just flat isn't speaking with all of the truth that he ought to be. Look at his budget this year--tax increases and new spending. In fact, his own budget this year calls for spending the entire non-Social Security surplus, and then raiding the Social Security trust funds for some more new spending. I am sorry, Mr. President. What you say and what you do don't come together--they don't add up. What you say about new spending in your budget doesn't match what you say about debt reduction when you oppose this tax relief. 
   I don't think I would have to eat my hat on that kind of a promise to the President--that I would be willing to support him if he would take all of the surplus and put it in a fund to pay down the debt, because that is just not about to happen. 
   No, the real issue here is not tax relief versus paying down the debt. 
   The real issue is tax relief versus spending. We all know that. We were spending money yesterday. Frankly, I was helping spend some of it. That spending used some of the surplus and is going to relieve the current crisis circumstance in producing agriculture today across this country. I supported that agriculture appropriations bill because our farm families are facing an emergency. But I also know if we leave all the taxpayers' money in Washington, DC, all the surplus, it will get spent, and not just on emergencies. If we send it back to the people who earned it and own it, then it won't get spent by government. At least then, we would have to go back to the people and ask them for the right to spend more, by changing the tax structure to increase future revenues. 
   Who believes if Government takes in $3 trillion in surplus revenue over the next 10 years, that Government won't spend it? We know they will spend it. 
   The National Taxpayers Union Foundation does a little thing called ``Bill Tally.'' They tally up all of the new bills introduced by Members of Congress every year and what those new bills will represent in new and increased government spending. Mr.  President, 84 of 100 Senators--that means Democrat and Republican alike--last year introduced new legislation that would lead to an additional $28 billion in spending per year, on average. Not over the next 10 years but in one alone--Democrat and Republican alike. New ideas, new bills, new spending. It is the habit of Government. Of course, we know that. That represents about a $232 increase in spending from every American taxpayer that is already on the wish list of most of the Senate. 
   I hope and believe we can resist the temptation to spend the three-fourths of the surplus we reserve to pay down the debt, save Social Security, and reserve some for other future priorities. That is what we ought to be doing with it. That is what we promised in the Congressional budget we passed earlier this year. Yet, the temptation will be there to spend the remaining one-forth, and part of that three-fourths, as well. 
   The choice is very simple. The debate today is about bigger Government versus bigger household budgets--private citizen household budgets. I hope helping those American household budgets is what this Senate ultimately will support. I hope over the course of August we can convince this President that he really ought to be more on the side of the American taxpayer than on the side of ever-bigger Government. 
   This tax relief bill is fair. Yes, it is fair. I know we have heard the debate about tax cuts only going to the rich. The Senator from Texas did a marvelous job a few moments ago talking about how the folks on the other side of the aisle think it only goes to the rich. I am amazed and, frankly, frustrated that every time we talk tax relief, immediately Democrats run to the microphones and say it is for the rich, the rich are going to get the benefit of a tax relief proposal. 
   That just ``ain't'' so in this bill. The chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate deserves a lot of credit for focusing this bill right on middle America, right at husbands and wives, working and trying to raise a family out there in the market place, wage-earners who are paying the bulk of these taxes. 
   Every American who pays income taxes will receive some benefit from this bill. The middle class Americans who pay most of the income taxes will get, by far, most of the income tax reduction. That is the way it ought to be. 
   What we are actually doing in this proposal is making the tax code a little more progressive. Middle-income taxpayers will receive proportionately more relief, for the taxes they pay, than upper-income taxpayers. But everyone who pays income taxes gets income tax relief. 
   This bill is fair because it shows compassion for the most heavily taxed generation in American history. 
   Several of my colleagues have come to the floor to talk about that tax burden. But I am amazed my Democrat friends and colleagues don't seem to recognize it. Surely they do. In fact, somehow, they actually are allowing their President to propose more taxes, which he did in his budget proposal this year. 
   That heavy tax burden has hurt people. It has robbed a whole generation of the opportunity to plan their retirement. It has forced families into adding a second and third income, rather than spending time taking care of children or elderly parents. It has robbed Americans of a major part of their freedom. 
   Today's baby boomer family is paying, on average, 50 percent more in taxes at all levels, as a portion of income, then their parents did when they were raising their families. 
   Only one year in history, 1944, at the height of the largest war in the history of the world, requiring incredible financial sacrifice, saw the federal government take in taxes a larger share of the national income than we are now paying. 
   This tax relief bill will help real people with real needs. There are two ways we can help people: We can create bigger government, with more bureaucrats, with more programs and red tape, regulating more behavior, and hope we produce some more government checks for some beneficiaries. Or we can let Americans keep a little more of their own money and meet their needs without Uncle Sam as the middle man. We can provide broad-based tax relief. We can provide targeted tax relief and incentives for folks to use for specific, beneficial purposes. 
   If we really care about people, we care about helping them in the most direct, most effective way possible. 
   Here's some of how we do that in this tax relief bill: 
   Marriage penalty relief: It just isn't fair to force two individuals to pay hundreds of dollars more in taxes simply because they get married. 
   Death tax relief: It just isn't fair that working families sometimes have to sell part or all of the family farm or the family business just to pay taxes. I've seen family farms carved up because of the death tax. The other side would have us believe that this is a debate about the so-called ``estates'' of rich people. It's not. 
   Help for families with children: 
   It would allow more parents to afford child care, both because it increases and expands the child care tax credit. 
   It allows more modest- and middle-income families to make full use of the child tax credit we enacted in the 1997 Tax Relief Act. 
   It expands the tax exclusion for foster care payments. 
   Help for individuals and families with education: 
   It would make education more affordable and available to individuals and families. 
   It includes tax-free, qualified tuition plans; extends the employer-provided tuition assistance; makes our 1997 education tax credits more fully available to modest- and middle-income families, by taking it out of the Alternative Minimum Tax calculations; and includes the Coverdell-Torricelli education savings account. 
   Help with health care, long-term care, and eldercare: 
   It increases the affordability of prescription drug insurance; health insurance for those who aren't covered by a corporate plan; long-term insurance, both for those who must pay for their own and those with cafeteria plans. 
   Farmers, small businesses, and workers will benefit from making the self-paid health insurance deduction 100 percent deductible. 
   Help for farm families: America's farm families are in a period of economic crisis today. 
   It provides for increased expensing, to $30,000; create FARRM Accounts--Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts; and protect income averaging from the Alternative Minimum Tax. 
   Help for folks who need retirement security: It includes expanded IRAs, 401(k) plans, and other provisions too numerous to mention, that especially will benefit folks over age 50. 
   Help for disadvantaged individuals seeking work: The Work Opportunity tax credit is reinstated. 
   Help for charities and charitable giving: 70 percent of taxpayers receive no recognition of charitable giving--because they don't itemize their deductions. This bill would reward and encourage those middle-class taxpayers who benefit their community, help the less fortunate, and promote the social good, with an above-the-line deduction for charitable donations. 
   This bill is needed by the American people. 
   When the facts are known, I am confident they will send one message back to Washington, DC: Please Mr. President, sign this bill into law. Let us keep one-fourth of the surplus for our families, our communities and our future financial security, instead of confiscating it for more big government. 
   I conclude by saying this is a fair tax proposal. In all fairness, compared with the total size of the Federal budget and the Federal government tax burden, it is modest. I close by once again recognizing the chairman of the Finance Committee for the tremendous work he has done to build that balance and fairness into this bill. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Hope Anderson. Hope is a constituent of mine and recently graduated as the valedictorian at Lake City High School in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Her valedictory address touched many of those who heard it, so I would like to take a minute of the Senate's time to enter the text of her speech into the RECORD.  
   A pair of laughing teenage boys gunned down fourteen students and one teacher in Littleton, Colorado a few weeks ago. Many of you asked yourselves the question, ``How could such an atrocity occur?'' Now I want you to ponder the question, ``How could this NOT happen?''  
   Our nation was founded upon moral principles, but its moral fabric is being ripped apart. Our deviation from basic ethical principles has corroded our very foundations as a country. I believe it is a time to change: when our children are not safe in school; when our society deems it more important to be politically correct than morally correct; when we don't give the needy a hand up and instead force our government to give them a hand out; when the marriage vows ``I do'' mean ``I might''; when the most dangerous place for a baby is in its mother's womb; when political elections are often a choice between the lesser of two evils; when there is no such thing as absolute truth; and when In God We Trust is engraved upon our currency but not on the hearts of the people, that is  when America needs to change. That time is now. 
   I believe that our nation is not in a hopeless downward spiral. If we, as the class of 1999, take a stand and be leaders, replacing the wrong with what is right, we can help to turn the tide in our nation. We must have a vision to know what we desire for our nation, courage to put it into action, and discernment to make the decisions necessary. I have a vision for America: where a person is judged by his character and not the color of his skin; where our politicians are honest and honorable; where our political system encourages hard work; where our people are informed by a media that tells both sides of the story; and where the sanctity of human life is respected as the most fundamental moral value. 
   As graduates, we are nearing a point in our lives where the decision we make will determine the outcome of our lives. As a nation, we are also nearing such a pivotal crossroads. We can transform our society into what it can be, what it should be, and what it will be if we take a stand as leaders to return to our moral heritage and in the words of Winston Churchill, ``Never give up, never give up, never give up.''

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr President, I rise today to make a few remarks concerning dairy compacts. 
   When most people think of dairy states they think of Wisconsin, Vermont, or Minnesota--not California, Texas, or Idaho. However, Idaho is now sixth in total milk production,  just ahead of Texas. Dairy cow numbers in Idaho are projected to grow from 292,000 in 1988 to 398,000 in 2008. While potatoes are still ranked first as the top agriculture commodity in Idaho, dairy products are a close second. I tell you this so you know that dairy policy is important to me and my state. 
   Although I am speaking, in part, on behalf of the interests of Idaho dairy farmers, let me assure you that the national debate about dairy compacts is far more than just an old fashioned regional squabble between Northeast and Southern dairy interests, on the one hand, and the interests of the rest of the country's dairy farmers, on the other. This debate is all about whether the Senate will say ``enough is enough'' and put an end to an incredibly bad policy proposal. 
   In my 19 years in Congress I cannot remember any major farm legislation that has been as overwhelmingly contrary to the interests of farmers, consumers, public health, the U.S. economy, and our Constitution as the amendment to extend and expand interstate dairy compacts. This is a lose, lose, lose situation if there ever was one. It's bad for the country and it's bad for the Senate, which it is needlessly dividing along regional lines. 
   An expanded Northeast Compact and a new Southern Compact will combine to impose an enormous milk tax on consumers in compact states. If compact commissions raise prices to the limit allowed by the proposed amendment, the costs to Eastern, Mid-Atlantic and Southern consumers would be enormous. Based on USDA data and USDA's estimates of milk prices for the rest of this year and for next year, the costs could soar to as high as $2.6 billion a year. 
   It only gets worse. Higher milk prices there will reduce milk consumption and increase milk production. Consumers will lose in two ways; they will have to pay more and they will drink less of a calcium-rich product. That's not very good public policy at a time when the National Academy of Sciences is urging Americans to take steps to eliminate their dangerous calcium intake deficit. The scope of the consumption decline is suggested by a January 1999 study of the economic impacts of an expanded Northeast Dairy Compact and a new Southern Dairy Compact conducted by the University of Missouri's Commercial Agriculture Program. The study was endorsed by the federally funded Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, otherwise known as FAPRI. Findings of that study suggest that milk consumption could drop by more than 200 million gallons a year if compacts expand into the Mid-Atlantic and Southern states. 
   The damage doesn't stop there. It reaches into every corner of the nation. Because dairy farmers in compact states will get paid more, they will produce much more milk. If you doubt that, just look back to what happened when Congress pushed milk prices to unprecedented levels in the 1980's. Increased production and lower consumption will mean that the nation, which already had record milk production last year, will be awash in milk. 
   That impact is even worse for dairy farmers in states like Idaho, which are not covered by dairy compacts. First of all, their incomes will be drastically reduced because dairy compacts ultimately drive everyone else's milk prices down. As milk production increases and consumption drops in dairy compact states, the nation's milk surplus will grow and milk prices will fall. The University of Missouri study showed that dairy farms in states outside of dairy compact regions would lose $310 million in the first year alone. And that study was based on an unrealistically-low, minimum, dairy compact price hike. It also did not include all of the states covered by today's amendment. If all states are included and compact commissions boost prices as high as the proposed legislation would allow, the loss of income will be roughly four times as large as estimated by the Missouri study. 
   In addition, the overproduction in dairy compact states will flood the market in compact states with dairy products made from surplus milk produced in compact states. That means sharply less market access for low-cost, efficient dairy farms in the Upper Midwest, Plains, and Mountain regions. Just like all protectionist schemes, dairy compacts penalize efficiency and reward inefficiency. 
   If this seems hard to believe as we head into the 21st century, just remember this: by definition, dairy compacts prevent cheaper milk, produced by more-efficient farmers in noncompact states, from entering into compact states at less than the compact price. Dairy compact proponents argue that dairy compacts do not impose interstate trade barriers because they allow other states to sell milk into compact regions at the compact price. 
   Technically that's true. In practice, it's completely misleading. The problem with the argument is that the increased production caused by higher prices in compact states will virtually eliminate the local demand for milk from efficient producers outside of compact states. While the market remains open in theory, compact states will be saying to Idaho and other noncompact farmers, ``sorry, but we don't need your milk anymore.'' Let's face it, dairy compacts are nothing more than a mean spirited attack on other states, skillfully disguised as a cure for small dairy farmers. 
   If the regional inequities and schisms created by interstate dairy compacts are not reason enough for my fellow senators to reject this amendment, then I hope you will vote against it simply because it violates the basic premises of our Constitution. The establishment of regional trade barriers through interstate dairy compacts would undermine the interstate competition that fostered the birth of the nation and that has been so critical for the sanctity of our Constitution. No amount of repeating the unsupportable claim that interstate dairy compacts are a manifestation of states' rights will make it so. The Founding Fathers would surely cringe if they were subjected to that argument in defense of dairy compacts. They knew that the nation would not last if they permitted some regions to be walled off at the expense of others. That's why they rejected an Articles of Confederation and chose a Constitution anchored by the Interstate Commerce Clause. That's also why three Constitutional scholars who appeared at a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing last week testified against interstate dairy compacts. 
   If dairy compacts pit region against region in the Senate, damage dairy farmers in noncompact states, cause great harm to consumers, and undermine the Constitution, then why are we even having this debate? It should be an open and shut case. Perhaps it has to with the desire of some of my colleagues to do something for the small family dairy farmers in their states. That may be an important objective. However, make no mistake about it. Dairy compacts are a terribly inefficient and ineffective way of achieving that goal. If you want to help small dairy farms, this is the worst way to do it. 
   The chart on my right (left) makes this abundantly clear. Here are 14 of the 28 states that the proposed amendment would allow to join the Northeast and Southern Dairy Compacts. The chart shows that small farms--those with less than 50 cows--on average, would receive only between $1,100 to $5,200 a year from dairy compacts. This is hardly surprising since each farmer receives the same price increase for every gallon of milk they produce. Thus, the large farms receive huge subsidies, while the small farms receive only a drop in the bucket. The bottom line is that a few thousand dollars in extra income is not sufficient to ensure long-term economic viability for these small farms. 
   The Commissioner of Agriculture in Massachusetts, who is a member of the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission, seems to agree. Last October, he put before the Commission a formal proposal that would have redistributed the Compact's revenues away from big farms and to the small farms. The proposal, which was essentially dead on arrival, has never been adopted. Why? Because dairy compacts have nothing to do with saving small family farms. 
   For the sake of argument, however, let's assume that the primary goal of dairy compacts is to increase the incomes of small family farms. That would make sense since the Census of Agriculture reveals that in New England, Mid-Atlantic states, and the South, 76%, 86% and 88% of the farms  that have left the dairy business since 1982 have had less than 50 cows. Clearly, small dairy farmers are the most vulnerable ones. Let's also assume, for the sake of argument, as compact proponents insist, that dairy compacts keep small farms in business. 
   Then we can answer the question: is this a good use of the public's money. If we look at the table to my right (left), we can see how amazingly inefficient dairy compacts are at transferring money to small dairy farms. The relevant question here is: how much do dairy compacts cost consumers for each small dairy farmers saved? The answers provided in the table are alarming. For the 14 New England, Mid-Atlantic and Southern states it takes anywhere between $90,000 and $632,000 a year in higher milk prices to provide a single small dairy farmer with a meager subsidy of only $1,000 and $5,200. At the extreme, for every one dollar of subsidy the compact gives to a single small dairy farmer, it costs the public roughly $632 in higher milk prices! $632 dollars spent to achieve a one dollar impact! That is truly a public policy embarrassment! 
   Is this really how the Senate wants to force the public to spend their money? I certainly hope not! Dairy compacts give new meaning to the expressions ``bureaucratic ineptness'' and ``government inefficiency''. Remember the legendary stories about the Pentagon spending thousands of dollars for a toilet seat? When you take the time to look at the evidence, it becomes clear that dairy compacts make those expenditures look efficient by comparison. This is surely not the legacy that any members of this body will want to carry with them through their careers. 
   In closing, this is no way to legislate dairy policy. We need to work on a national policy that is fair to all farmers and that makes us more competitive on the world market. Dairy compacts are anti-consumer, regionally divisive, anti-farmer, contrary to the heart of the Constitution, ineffective and hopelessly inefficient. I urge Senators to vote no on the Jeffords amendment. 
   Mr. President, again, when we think of dairy, oftentimes we think of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Vermont. Let me tell you when we think that way, we are not thinking total because California, Texas, and Idaho are some of the leading dairy producers in the Nation. My State is sixth in the Nation right now and growing very rapidly into fifth place, and within a few years it could even be fourth place. 
   What is being proposed today is not good for our Nation's dairy industry. It is regionalism at its worst. It is establishing economic barriers that don't allow the reasonable flow of commerce, and while it is early on argued as good for producers, let me suggest that in the end when you create these barriers it is wrong and bad for producers. When we struggle to create agriculture policy in this country, we struggle to create uniformity. 
   In the dairy industry, uniformity is critically important for the growth and the overall strength of that industry, both for the producers and for the consumers. 
   I hope we will oppose the cloture motion. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a chart on the effects of the compact on small dairy farms.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in the course of the last 2 days, we have attempted to understand and define the situation in agriculture. The chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday did an excellent job of crafting a package that goes to the heart of the problem. 
   Yesterday, I had hoped we could include crop insurance in it so we could keep that management tool alive, shaping it so that it becomes more usable to farmers, so that we are not here again after a disaster occurs trying to define that disaster. As we have heard in conversation this morning, it is nearly impossible to define at this time. 
   This particular amendment offers $400 million to maintain the 1999 level for crop insurance premium write-downs. It also deals with speciality crops in a way that I think is very important in understanding farming diversity. At the same time, it still strikes that balance in working to limit well beyond what those on the other side had offered, and I support it.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to tell the Senators from New Hampshire and Arizona that this is a sweet deal, but I can't say that because they are obviously deadly serious and, in my opinion, are dramatically misrepresenting a program that has not slipped through the cracks at all. It was negotiated and put in the 1996 farm bill to benefit hundreds of growers in my State and in other States across the Nation. It is to develop a program that doesn't cost the taxpayers of this country one dime. 
   For the Senator from New Hampshire to say that a consumer goes to the marketplace and buys a candy bar, and therefore is paying a government tax is false on its face and false by its fact. They are paying what the candy bar company retails the product for. 
   Let me repeat for the record and for all listening, sugar farmers, cane or beet sugar raisers, in this country do not receive one Government payment. There is no subsidy involved. Instead, there are loan programs they can use for marketing purposes, and they pay them back with current interest rates. The Senator from Arizona knows that. That is the way the program works. He is striking that out, but he is leaving the assessment in place. So he is saying: You can't have a relationship to your Government where we are going to tax you if you raise or produce sugar in this country. 
   USDA estimates the sugar program saves taxpayers $500 to $700 million per year in deficiency payments on corn farmers and others who are paying an added 25 cents for the value of that product. These are the facts with which we are dealing. Governments of all sugar-producing countries have directly intervened in their production and have dramatically subsidized that production, driving down prices in the world market. Those are the facts that our growers deal with on an annual basis. American workers in 42 States benefit from the sugar policy. The sweetener industry has a positive annual impact of about $26.6 billion in the U.S. economy, and they add about 420,000 jobs to that economy. 
   Here is the strange fact: You are being told sugar producers are making lots of money and the consumer is paying for it. 
   When we passed this new farm program in 1996, from that time forward,  the price of cane sugar has dropped about 5 percent to the producer. The cost of beet sugar has dropped about 13 percent. 
   Now, it is interesting that sugar products have gone up 20 to 30 percent, so the consumer is paying more, but the producer is getting less under this program. So when you have a Senator standing on the floor saying the producer is making out like a bandit, well, if a 13-percent reduction in beet costs and a 5-percent reduction in cane is real--and it is--who is making out like a bandit? I guess it is the retailer or manufacturer that has nothing to do with this. It is the marketplace at work. 
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me close out the debate on this side of this issue by saying to Senators that you will have an opportunity to vote to table the McCain amendment in a few moments. It is an amendment that really does not face the reality of the situation today. While product prices across the country, are low, we have one program in agriculture that is working reasonably well. That is a program that, in value to the farmer, beet or cane, since 1990, has actually gone down. But it has not translated through to the consumer because the sweetener industry, and the confectionery industry have continually raised their prices. This is not a subsidy, nor is it a cost to the taxpayer. There is no net cost to the taxpayer. All of these recourse loans are repaid at current interest rates. It is important to recognize it is a way of marketing and effectively distributing the product of this agricultural producer. 
   It has also been clearly pointed out that you cannot compare current values and markets with world markets because most sugar around the world is sold on contract. That which is not is dumped to the bottom. So to compare that, it is not even apples and oranges; it is apples compared with nothing. 
   It is important this program be retained. We revised it dramatically in 1996 in the new farm program, and it has worked effectively since that time. I hope those who supported us in 1996 on a similar amendment will stand with us today, in behalf of the American producer, both cane and sugar beet and the American consumers. American consumers find themselves paying substantially less than other consumers, some nearly $1 billion less on an annualized basis than other comparable consumers around the world in developed nations that are large consumers of sugar. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to table the McCain amendment. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first I would like to thank Chairman COCHRAN and Senator KOHL for the hard work they have put into the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. It is a challenging process, and they have done an excellent job balancing competing interests within the confines of a balanced budget. 
   I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee regarding funding for the Greater Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee (GYIBC). There is currently a Cooperative State Federal Brucellosis Eradication Program to eliminate the brucellosis from the country. States are designated brucellosis free when none of their cattle or bison are found to be infected for 12 consecutive months. As of March 31, 1998, 42 States, plus Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are free of brucellosis. The presence of brucellosis in free-ranging bison in Yellowstone National Park threatens the brucellosis status of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana, as well as the health of their livestock herds, which are free of the disease. Reintroduction of the disease into a brucellosis-free State could have a serious economic impact on domestic livestock markets and potentially threaten export markets. 
   The Committee saw fit to allocate $610,000 for the coordination of Federal, state and private actions aimed at eliminating brucellosis from wildlife in the Greater Yellowstone Area. I would like to clarify how this money is to be allocated. Of the funds appropriated for the GYIBC, $400,000 is for the States of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana to participate in the GYIBC, with the understanding that 50 percent goes to the state that chairs the committee and 25 percent goes to each of the other states. The remaining $210,000 is for the State of Idaho to protect the State's brucellosis-free status and implement the Idaho Wildlife Brucellosis plan. Is it the intent of the Committee to use these funds as I have described?

It is a challenging process, and they have done an excellent job balancing competing interests within the confines of a balanced budget. 
   I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee regarding the appropriation for the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service plant protection programs and regulations.  The funds this bill makes available for plant protection are critical to protecting American agriculture from diseases, pests, and invasive plants. My own state of Idaho struggles greatly with noxious weeds, such as leafy spurge, which compete with the native grasses so essential for the raising of cattle. 
   Researchers at the University of Idaho and around the country are working diligently to develop mechanisms to use biological controls for weeds and to manage diseases of important agriculture plants. It is my understanding that current APHIS regulations require a permit for interstate transfer of a pathogen or plant infected with a pathogen from one research location to another. However, research and education facilities routinely transfer plant materials from one research location to another using good management practices. 
   To facilitate researchers' work on behalf of American agriculture, I ask that the Committee clarify its intent that the appropriations contained in this bill for the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service should be used to carry out plant protection programs and regulations that take into account the levels of risk presented by pathogens and to establish mechanisms to expedite or provide exemptions from any formal permit or certification processes for research and education facilities established under implementing regulations as the Secretary deems appropriate. Is it the intent of the Committee to use these funds as I have described?

I understand from researchers in my state that pathogens that might be considered for exemption or expedited processes include: endemic and naturalized pathogens for which there is extensive information and handling experience and for which management strategies have been developed; pathogens intended for educational, research, or reference use that are not to be released into the environment; or pathogens that present low risk because of their mode of survival, dissemination, or some other aspect of their biology. Is that the Committee's understanding?

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, is it the intent of the Committee that APHIS consult with relevant scientific societies as well as state regulators of plan pathogens and on-site reviewers of facilities where possible in modifying current regulations or developing future regulations regarding the movement of pathogens between research and education facilities?

   Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding the APHIS is moving in this direction already. APHIS recently requested that the National Plant Board review its Plant Protection and Quarantine program to make recommendations for changes and improvements in the framework for regulations. This review, which included representatives of universities and industry as well as the state regulators, resulted in recommendations that will soon be presented in a report called ``Safeguarding American Plant Resources: A Review of APHIS' Plant Protection and Quarantine's Pest Safeguarding System.'' This report will also recommend risk-based management of plant permits, including development of mechanisms to exempt from permitting or expedite permitting in certain low-risk cases. Thank you for your continued interest in this matter.

   Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Madam President. 
   For the last 20 minutes, I have listened to my colleague from North Dakota with some degree of clarity discuss the issue that is true in his State today and true in most areas of American agriculture. I will in no way attempt to modify or suggest any different kind of impact on the family farm, but I suggest that most family farms in Idaho today are multimillion-dollar operations, and we should not attempt to invoke the image of a small farm, a husband and wife, struggling to stay alive. 
   A husband and wife and family team in production agriculture today are struggling to stay alive in an industry that recognizes their investment in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars. 
   There is no question that the character of American agriculture has changed. While some are still caught  up in the rhetoric of the family farm--and there are still some small farming units--most of those who farm small units today recognized some years ago that their life could not be made there unless they supplemented it with outside income. That, of course, has been the character of the change in production agriculture for the last good number of decades--true in Idaho, true in North Dakota, true in Mississippi, true in almost every other agricultural State in our Nation. 
   How do I know that? That is what the statistics show. 
   But in 1965 and 1966, as a young person, I was given a unique opportunity to travel through our Nation on behalf of agriculture as a national officer of FFA, Future Farmers of America. I was in almost every agricultural State in this Nation speaking to young farmers and young ranchers. 
   I happened to have had the privilege of staying on many of those farms and ranches. For the course of 1 year, I saw American agriculture like few are given the opportunity to see it. I must tell you, it was an exciting time because I met wonderful people, I saw a unique lifestyle that is true in many instances today, and I did see and feel the heartland of America as few get the opportunity to experience. 
   While I was traveling, I gave many speeches. The speech oftentimes started like this: That a family farmer or a farmer in American agriculture today produces enough for him or herself and 30 other people. That was 1965. 
   Today, if I were that young FFA officer traveling the Nation, my speech would have to change, because I would say that that farmer or rancher produces enough for him or herself and 170 to 180 additional Americans. 
   Has the family unit changed? Oh, very significantly. In almost all instances, it is four or five times larger than it was in 1965 and 1966. But it is phenomenally more efficient and much more productive. Because of those efficiencies, instituted by new technology or biogenetics, we have seen great productivity. So it isn't just a measurement of crops produced against prices for those crops; it is a combination of the whole. 
   I think it is very important that we portray American agriculture today for what it is and for what it asks from us. 
   In 1965 and 1966, it was not just Government and politicians that suggested farm policy in this country ought to change; it was American agriculture itself that came to us in 1965 and 1966 and said: Get Government off our backs. American agriculture has changed. We don't want to farm to a program. We want to farm to a market. We don't want to be restricted in limited acreages. We don't want to be restricted in limited markets. We want the ability to be flexible to move with the market. 
   Congress listened. Out of that listening came the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, which is now called 
   Freedom to Farm. The Senator from North Dakota said it is a failure. The Senator from North Dakota is wrong. It has met every objective it was intended to meet--expanded markets, expanded production, with flexibility for the individual producer. All of those goals that were a part of Freedom to Farm have been met today. 
   Today, before the Ag Committee, we heard about a comprehensive study that said agricultural income in the decade of the 1990s will surpass any other decade, at a time when the number of farmers has gone down and productivity has gone up dramatically. That is all part of the good news of the story. 
   So it is not an abject failure, unless you did not vote for it because you did not believe in it in the first place, and you really do want Government controls, and you really do want a Government plan to which farmers farm instead of the market. My guess is, that is part of what the Senator from North Dakota was talking about. That is not what I am here to talk about today. That is where we differ substantially. 
   But we do not differ on the other issue. That is the issue of the current commodity price crisis in production agriculture across our Nation and across the world. That is very real today. Many of our commodities are finding their price in the marketplace at or below Depression-era prices. That in itself is a crisis, and that we should respond to. 
   Last year, we did not cast a deaf ear on production agriculture in this country. The taxpayers of this country, recognizing the plight the American producer in agriculture was in, gave handsomely. Billions of dollars flowed into production agriculture, and directly through to the farmer, and to the rancher in some instances. As a result of that, farm income was substantially buoyed. That will happen again this year. But it will happen in the context of Freedom to Farm. 
   We are not going to go in and start changing long-term farm policy until the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Idaho can agree that Freedom to Farm was an abject failure--when, in fact, I do not believe it was; and I think the Senator from North Dakota would be hard pressed, looking at the facts and the intent, to argue that it was either. 
   So we are here today not to talk about a long-term policy change but to talk about the current crisis. It is a crisis that is not just taking place within this country; it is a commodity crisis that is worldwide. 
   Let's talk about 1996, 1997, and part of 1998. That is when we crafted a new farm bill. That is when commodity prices were higher than they had ever been around the world, and we drained all of our reserves, and we were told never again would we see low prices. 
   But there were some things missing from that ``never again'' argument. We didn't anticipate a general downturn in world economies, especially the Asian economy, an Asian economy that had increased its overall import of agricultural foodstuffs from the United States by nearly 27 percent in the period of a 5- to 6-year span. Those imports are down by 11 percent today. Those are the facts. Is that a direct result of Freedom to Farm policy failing? I suggest that it isn't. I don't think the Senator from North Dakota would disagree. 
   Now, what has that caused? It has plummeted commodity prices in our country. We agree that there is a current farm crisis, and we agree that that crisis could extend itself for some time to come. We agree that Congress ought to respond to it so we don't lose those production units and the families and the human side of it that is so critical across our country and to smalltown Idaho just as much as smalltown North Dakota. 
   The difference, at least in the current situation of the moment, is the heavy hand of politics, tragically enough. Last year we were able to agree, and we worked at crafting a bipartisan package. This morning, while we were there in the Ag Committee holding a hearing with the Secretary, all of a sudden the committee room emptied. I wondered where they had gone. The chairman said: Well, they have gone out to hold a press conference with the Vice President. The heavy hand of Presidential politics now tragically plays at this issue. It shouldn't have to be that way and, in the end, it won't be that way, if we are to craft the right kind of policy to deal with a crisis that isn't Democrat or isn't Republican, but it is at the heartland of America's fundamental production unit, American agriculture. 
   The chairman of the Ag Subcommittee of Appropriations has struggled mightily over the course of the last several weeks to try to see if we couldn't arrive at a package that would respond. Our goal is not to add hundreds of billions of dollars to programs that don't have any sense of immediacy or any sense of getting money directly through to the farmer. Our bill is substantially smaller in that regard than the bill offered by the minority leader of the Senate. But our bill, when it comes to money to production units, money to farmers, and money to ranchers, is there. It is real and it is the same dollar amount. 
   I am willing to talk farm policy, and I am willing to debate it, but not in the short-term and not in the immediate sense of an emergency, because it is awfully hard to argue that the emergency at hand was produced by Freedom to Farm. 
   Let me read briefly from a report called ``Record and Outlook,'' put together by a very responsible group called the Sparks Company out of McLean, VA. This report is called ``Freedom to Farm, Record and Outlook,'' prepared for the Coalition for  Competitive Food in the Agricultural System. 
   Here is their analysis. Most people say that the Sparks Company is widely recognized as reputable and is nonpartisan in its analyses of those issues that it examines. 
   Here is what they say:  
   The recent slowing of the farm economy primarily reflects two major factors: Farmers response worldwide to mid-decade record high prices.....  
   In other words, what they are saying was those prices in 1996 and 1997 sent a message to American agriculture: Gear up your production. They sent a message to world agriculture: Gear up your production. Consumption and prices are here to stay. And that is what happened, and worldwide production is at an all-time record. They go on:  
   .....and the downturn in the economic and financial health of one region of the world, Asia, which also is the largest market for U.S. farm and food products.  
   I have already mentioned the tremendous ramp up in the increase in purchases of agricultural foodstuffs in Asia and now 
   the dramatic decline. 
   The study concludes that both the high record prices of 1995, 1996, and part of 1997, and the more recent readjustments, are the result of ``ordinary market developments and reactions, with some unusually good weather patterns helping boost output, while the economic downturn in Asia and elsewhere has weakened the prices. As a result, the current market downturn reflects temporary, rather than fundamental market changes.'' 
   Temporary problems, but a real crisis. Permanent problems? They say not so. So if you are going to change permanent policy, you ought to be able to determine that there is first a permanent problem. That is what I think the Senator from North Dakota has failed to argue, while he and I would agree on the sense of immediacy to the current crisis. 
   The report goes on to talk about modest shortfalls in harvests and yields during 1993 through 1995, during the time when these markets were ramping up. Output fell below the 10-year trend and stocks plummeted. In other words, storage and surplus. Strong world economic growth then stimulated demand and record high grain and oilseed prices; world planting and harvests above trends in the United States and worldwide during 1996 through 1998; also good weather and high grain and oilseed yields, especially in the United States, rapidly rebuilt depleted stocks in spite of significantly above-trend consumption during that period. In other words, we were pushing production, but the world was consuming. Significant increases in non-U.S. production competing for growing world markets largely in response to record high prices of the mid-1990s. For example, all of the very considerable above-trend wheat production has been outside the United States, while the share of increased production outside the United States has been 44 percent for corn and 35 percent for soybeans. 
   Lastly, they point out that the downturn in economic and financial health of key world markets, especially Asia, the largest U.S. export market, has increased pressure on U.S. prices, although world grain and oilseed use has been well above trend during the last 3 years. 
   What is the point of those comments? The point is that no matter how we would have designed the policy, we were working against a world situation, both economically and climactically, and productionwise that would have been very difficult to foresee. We did not foresee it, nor was it debated in 1995 and 1996, as we were crafting Freedom to Farm. We didn't recognize it in 1997. Toward the tail end of 1997, it became an indicator of problems to come. By 1998, it was very clear, and Congress responded. It is now 1999 and Congress will respond again, with a multibillion-dollar direct aid package to production agriculture. 
   I said before the Ag Committee today and before Secretary Glickman that I am willing, starting next year, to review Freedom to Farm. I don't think production agriculture is going to walk away from the freedoms and the flexibility it has. Is there a way of crafting a safety net or something that causes some adjustments over time? It is possible. I would not suggest that it isn't. But the rest of the story of Freedom to Farm that we have not successfully matched yet, but something that Congress, Democrat and Republican, agreed with and promised production agriculture with the passage of Freedom to Farm in 1996, were two other elements. 
   One was a risk management practice, better known as crop insurance. We have placed that money in the budget, but we can't yet agree on a package that is bipartisan in character, that meets the regional differences within our country, certainly the regional differences between the Midwest and Idaho or the Midwest and the South or the Northeast. If we had had a comprehensive risk management crop insurance package today, the very real drought that Washington, DC, and States east of the Alleghenies are in at this moment would have been dramatically offset if farmers had had that kind of risk management tool. But we have not yet agreed as to how to make it flexible and diversified in a way that meets those kinds of needs of specialty crops and the uniqueness of agriculture across this country. So a promise made; we have not fulfilled it yet. 
   The other area, of course, is the expansion of world trade. The Senator from North Dakota is right. We are not trading in world markets like we should. Let me tell you, Bill Clinton and company have been asleep at the switch now for many years. Do they have a division down at the Department of State that goes out and aggressively markets on a daily basis American agricultural surpluses? 
   No, they don't. We offered them and provided them the tools to move aggressively in the markets. There was a bit of a yawn down at the Department of Agriculture, and that yawn has continued for the last good number of years. So point the finger, I am; but I am pointing the finger at the very agencies of our Government that are responsible for breaking down those political barriers between a consuming market somewhere else in the world and a production unit here in the United States. We have not done that well, and we should. We promised it, in part. 
   Last year, I and Senators from the other side of the aisle stood together and were able to knock down the sanctions against Pakistan and India to move markets. This year, at our urging--and I applaud the President; now that I have criticized him, let me applaud him for bringing forth an Executive order that said that foodstuffs and medical supplies would not be subject to sanction. That was 3 months ago, and 3 months later, in the time of an agriculture crisis, they are just getting the regulations out. 
   Well, now, give me a break, Mr. President. You mean your bureaucracy takes 3 months to write a regulation that says farmers can supply a world market that they were denied? There is a lot of blame to be shared here, but, Mr. Vice President, you were on the Hill today talking about a farm crisis. Last I checked, the Department of Agriculture and State Department were under your watch, and for 3 long months you have sat and watched as the bureaucracy ground out regulations that allow access to world markets. I am sorry, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, there is blame to be shared all around. 
   Let me shift just a little of it to you, Mr. Vice President, and you, Mr. President. The spirit is in the right place, but couldn't you have cut to the chase? Couldn't we be moving grains, rice, and food commodities, and lentils into mid-Asian and the Central Eastern markets today like we should be? Well, we will be by fall and into the winter, thanks to a policy you put in place, Mr. President. But 3 months later, we are finally beginning to see its regulations. Late is better than none at all. I will accept that and we will move on. But, again, open the world markets. 
   It is political barriers that are out there, not market barriers. Those are political barriers that only governments can knock down. When it is nation-to-nation, our Government at the Federal level has to be responsible, and we fail to be. 
   My credit goes to the chairman of our Senate Agriculture Committee who, for several years, has been pushing legislation to pull down those barriers. Last year, he offered it on the floor. It passed. This year, it will pass this Senate again, and I hope it passes the Congress. I hope the President can  deal with it, and I hope he will sign it. Those are long-term provisions, but once in place, they are a legitimate and responsible role for Government to participate in. 
   Manipulating the market, shaping the price? Absolutely not. We have to let the marketplace work its will. But it is very important that Government play the role it should play, and that is in dealing with the political barriers of trade, most assuredly in times of need, providing some safety nets. We did that last year, and we are going to do it again this year. I hope in the end we can craft a crop insurance plan that will provide the risk management tools that we have said to production agriculture we would provide. 
   Well, those are the circumstances in which we find ourselves today. In the course of the next few hours, the Senate will have an opportunity to vote on two very different measures, in the sense of a total package. They are very similar in the dollars and cents that go directly to production agriculture. I hope that, in the end, out of this can come a bipartisan package. There is a great deal in the DASCHLE-HARKIN package that may be OK at some point down the road; but my guess is not without hearings held and no understanding of some broad policy changes that are at this moment 
   not necessarily justifiable in this time of dealing with crises, both a price crisis and the situation that deals with weather disaster. 
   Those are the circumstances as I see it. I hope my colleagues will vote with the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee in supporting his amendment and not allowing it to be tabled, so we can get at a clear vote and finalize this work today. If that can't be done, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join with us in seeing if we can make some adjustments in a final package. But I believe that the package offered up by the chairman is certainly in good faith and responds in an immediate way to need, and that the money can move directly to production agriculture, sending a very critical message to the families and the men and women engaged in agriculture in our economy that we care and we understand the importance of them and what they do for all of us as Americans, and Americans are responding by a substantial ag package of nearly $7 billion. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1429, the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. 
   This debate has been about numbers and surpluses and budget rules. To some extent, it has to be. But our efforts to provide tax relief are also about something more important: 
   People. 
   The kind of relief that both the Senate and House tax bills would provide is a matter of providing real help to real people who have real needs. 
   This tax relief is about returning some modest amount of liberty, some small measure of power, to the people. This is the most heavily taxed generation of Americans in history. Providing some degree of tax relief will return to individuals and families more power over their own lives, more ability to meet their pressing needs, and more of an opportunity to pursue their dreams. 
   I've looked at both the Senate and House bills. I think we can come up with a very good conference report based on these two bills--a conference report that preserves the best of both bills, and helps improve the lives of all Americans. 
   We are talking about a tax bill that removes some fundamental unfairness from the current system. 
   For example, it just isn't fair that two individuals should be forced to pay hundreds of dollars more in taxes simply because they get married. That's why the Senate bill ends the marriage penalty for two earners. I think we should go farther, which is why I've supported the Gramm amendment and the Hutchison amendment and hope we can do more in conference. 
   Mr. President, it just isn't fair that working families sometimes have to sell part or all of the family farm or the family business just to pay taxes. I've seen family farms carved up because of the death tax. The other side would have us believe that this is a debate about the so-called ``estates'' of rich people. It's not. 
   Death tax relief is a question of saving the family farm; maintaining the family business; and allowing people the fundamental freedom to dispose of their own property and their own savings as they see fit. The death tax imposes a double tax, because it confiscates property and savings built up from income left over after it's already been taxed one, two, or three times before. 
   But we know where the other side and the Administration are coming from. In fact, this Administration's former Secretary of Labor, in one of his books, called it a ``loophole'' for the tax code to allow parents actually to pass along some of their savings and possessions to their children. 
   I support the relief from the death tax in this bill and wish we could do more. That's why I've supported the Kyl amendment. 
   This tax relief bill is good for children. It would allow more parents to afford child care, both because it increases and expands the child care tax credit, also called the Dependent Care Credit, and because it allows more modest- and middle-income families to make full use of the child tax credit we enacted in the 1997 Tax Relief Act. It also would expand the tax exclusion for foster care payments. 
   This bill will help make education more affordable and available to individuals and families. It includes tax-free, qualified tuition plans; extends the employer-provided tuition assistance; and makes our 1997 education tax credits more fully available to modest- and middle-income families, by taking it out of the Alternative Minimum Tax calculations. 
   We should be doing even more to help families meet their educational needs and opportunities. This is why I've supported the Coverdell-Torricelli amendment to expand and improve Educational Savings Accounts. 
   The Coverdell-Torricelli amendment would give parents greater choice in how best to educate their children. The issue here is parental choice. Who knows best--parents or a distant government bureau in Washington, DC? In recent years, the focus has been entirely too much on growing the government and inventing federal programs. But much of that national government is far removed from the year-to-year and day-to-day decisions that parents must make, and work on with teachers and school boards, about their children's education. 
   This amendment would shift power and resources back to the most local level--Mom and Dad. The Coverdell amendment would allow more flexibility--and the use of more of their own money--as they face decisions about paying for things like tutoring, home computers, private or religious school, higher education, and vocational education. The amendment focuses especially on those who find it hard to pay for educational expenses now. In talking about public schools, supplies and activity fees are a burden on parents today. The Coverdell amendment would help families deal with those costs. 
   Mr. President, a few months ago, we passed the Ed-Flex bill. This law gives the state educational agency and the local educational agency the flexibility in how they spend federal dollars. Now, Mr. President, it is time to give parents similar flexibility in how they help provide for their children's education. 
   I hope we can do more to help families with their children's educational needs when this bill goes to conference. I hope we can include provisions that come much closer to the Coverdell-Torricelli amendment. 
   Besides helping families with the care and education of their children early in life, this bill also will help provide care in the twilight of life, through an additional deduction for providing in-home care for an elderly family member. 
   This bill takes a significant step forward in making health care coverage more affordable and available for millions of Americans. Small businesses and farm families, especially, will be helped by the accelerated, full deductibility of health care premiums, as will other workers not covered by an employer-provided 
   plan. More Americans would be able to plan for long-term care, a critical area of growing need, because of an above-the-line deduction for individuals and inclusion in cafeteria plans at work. 
   America's farm families are in a period of economic crisis today. That crisis should be, and will be, addressed in a major farmers' aid package a number of us are working on. But additional, much-needed help is provided in this bill, as well. 
   Besides self-employed health insurance and death tax relief, this bill would provide for increased expensing,  starting next year, to $30,000; create the new FARRM Accounts--Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts--that Senators GRASSLEY, BURNS, I, and others have been working on; protect income averaging from the Alternative Minimum Tax; increase credits for reforestation; and allow farmer co-ops more dividend flexibility. 
   Like farmers, small business, the over-taxed engines of job-creation, innovation, and economic opportunity in our economy, will finally receive some relief from many of these same provisions. 
   The Senate bill makes tremendous strides in retirement security. Today's baby boomers, the first generation to have spent their entire lives in the most heavily-taxed generation, are becoming increasingly anxious about their prospects for retirement security. Why is no mystery: Since the baby boomers were children, they have seen the average family's tax burden, at all levels, increase by more than 50 percent, as a share of income. When the government takes 50 percent more from you than it did from your parents, how do you save and invest for your own retirement? 
   All taxpayers, of all incomes and all ages, stand to benefit from expanding the use of Individual Retirement Accounts. In the past, IRAs were a simple, universally-understood, readily-accessible to save for retirement. One of the worst things in the 1986 tax bill was the confusing limitations placed on IRAs that, in fact, have discouraged many modest- and middle-income workers from using them. Farmers and small business owners and their employees, especially, have an important stake in more accessible IRAs, because they have no other large, employer-provided pension plan to participate in. 
   Mr. President, the tax relief bills moving through Congress will help real people. The real debate is over two competing visions of how the government can help people. Those of us who support tax relief say, we help people when we give them back the power and freedom to control their own destinies. The other side says, they think it would help people if the government made decisions for them, and dispensed dependency through an expensive bureaucracy. 
   You can confiscate more and more money from workers, savers, and families. That, in fact, has been and is the trend. Then the government can spend that money, grow the bureaucracy, write more rules, make citizens feel more like supplicants, and, in the end, hand someone another small government check. 
   Or we can let workers, savers, entrepreneurs, and families keep a little more of their fruits of their own labors, and let them apply that directly to taking care of their children, their parents, their health care needs, and their education. 
   We can, as this bill does by extending the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, tell employers they can keep a little more of what they earn, if they also provide jobs for disadvantaged, hard-to-place workers. 
   Today, 70 percent of taxpayers receive no recognition of charitable giving--because they don't itemize their deductions. We can, in this bill, reward and encourage those middle-class taxpayers who benefit their community, help the less fortunate, and promote the social good, by letting them keep a little more of their hard-earned income, with an above-the line deduction for charitable donations. 
   We are talking about a modest and reasonable package of tax relief. Both Houses are calling for a tax cut of only 3.5 percent over the next 10 years, or less than one-fourth of the total amount taxpayers have been overcharged by their government. 
   We are proposing a modest amount of tax relief that leaves plenty of room to safeguard Social Security completely. In fact, with the budget we passed earlier this year, for the first time in history, Congress has committed itself to reserving all of the Social Security surplus, and all future Social Security revenues, exclusively for future Social Security benefits. 
   Our tax relief is based upon huge over-collections of taxes from American workers and taxpayers. In other words, yes, it is based upon projections of budget surpluses--surpluses projected both by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the President's own Office of Management and Budget. It is interesting that the same critics who criticize the idea of basing tax relief on projections then make up their own, speculative projections about the cuts in future spending programs they claim would result from this tax relief. 
   In point of fact, we all agree that Medicare, Veterans programs, education, and other priorities must be maintained and improved in the future. The budget we passed earlier this year provides for that, and this tax relief package doesn't infringe on them. 
   I remember how, just a few years ago, some in Congress, the White House, and special interest groups made dire predictions of how spending on all kinds of essential programs would have to be slashed to balance the budget. 
   Since then, a new Congress came to town in 1995, committed to balancing the budget and reining in the growth of government. 
   We've still had increases in spending, but they've been more moderate. We do have some high priority programs to re-evaluate. Some increases are needed. In other places, we need more restraint, and even some cuts. 
   But a balanced budget and a significant surplus have emerged--along with an economy that is strong because the people who work, save, invest, and create jobs took us seriously when we said we would balance the budget and limit the growth of spending. 
   Now, Congress has taken the first critical steps needed to save and preserve Social Security for the current generation of seniors and those who expect to retire soon. We all agree the next step is to modernize it for future generations. Our budget, and this tax relief, is perfectly consistent with that commitment. 
   Most of us agree with the majority of the bipartisan Medicare Commission that we need to shore up that program as well, too. That will involve expanding or improving some of what Medicare provides, as well as expanding consumer choice, increasing market discipline, curbing waste and abuse, and finding savings. Unfortunately, the necessary super-majority of the commission didn't allow it to turn its majority views into what it could call its ``official'' recommendations. But we in Congress stand ready to work with the President on the responsible reforms suggested by that commission and others. 
   And this Congress remains committed to reducing the national debt. Under our budget, and including this tax bill, we will cut the public debt in half over the next ten years, and reduce the debt by more than $200 billion over what the President's budget recommendations called for. 
   Still, Mr. President, even as we tackle all these challenges, we do have the capability of refunding to the hard-working American taxpayers a little of what they have been overcharged. That's what this legislation, and this debate, are all about today. 
   The choice is simple: More government and more spending versus letting the people keep a little more of their hard-earned incomes and a little more control over their own lives. 
   Mr. President, I vote for this tax relief bill because I am casting a vote of confidence for the wisdom of the people, and a vote to help by removing some of the heavy tax burden they are bearing.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. It is obvious from the Senate vote we just had that we could only have delayed this process for several days, but we could not have stopped the ultimate result, which would be sending a flawed Senate bill to a conference with the House. Since that is the case, I see no reason to burn up good will by forcing the Senate to vote again and again with the same result on the various procedural steps that lie before us. 
   If this is where the Senate will ultimately make its stand, I am willing to let the process move forward. 
   However, some may be asking why we even made the attempt to stop this action. 
   Sometimes it can be unclear why a Senator cast the vote he or she did. 
   That's especially true for procedural votes like the cloture vote we just had. 
   So let me be clear why I voted the way I did--against cloture, against cutting off the debate on this measure, against moving this version of S. 254 to a conference with the House. 
   It's not because I oppose the juvenile justice bill. Quite the opposite: it's because I support good juvenile justice reform. 
   I support the many provisions of this legislation that truly address criminal violence, such as: Making sure violent juveniles are held accountable for their criminal actions; providing resources to states and localities to combat juvenile crime; toughening enforcement of the laws already on the books; helping communities promote school safety; helping parents and the media do more to limit the exposure of children to violence in the entertainment industry. 
   I support these reforms, and I could support the version of juvenile justice reform passed by the House. 
   However, the reason I opposed the Senate bill, and why I voted against cloture just now is because this is not a juvenile justice reform measure. It's also a gun control measure. 
   Gun control has nothing to do with stopping youth violence and crime. 
   Gun control of the kind proposed in this bill is not just ineffective--it is counterproductive because it would cut off lawful and beneficial uses of firearms. 
   And what may be the most important thing for anyone watching this debate to understand: gun control is something the House of Representatives has already said--with a bipartisan vote--it will not accept. 
   This is a set-up, folks. The House has said it will not accept gun control, and the Clinton-Gore Administration, along with its cronies in Congress, have said they won't accept a juvenile justice bill without gun control. 
   Does anybody else see a problem here? The problem is obvious. I don't see how the conference committee will fashion a version of juvenile justice that both the House and Senate can live with--but I can tell you one thing: whatever comes out of this conference won't have enough gun control in it for the Clinton-Gore administration. 
   In fact, I'm going to make a prediction here and now that whatever emerges from the conference committee will instantly be criticized--and maybe even threatened with a veto--because it doesn't have enough gun control 
   in it for Bill Clinton and AL GORE, and the folks who work with him. That is because they need gun control as a political issue, and they are not interested in juvenile crime unless they have their political issue along with it. 
   I said, folks, that is ``politics,'' and I mean it, plain and simple. 
   Since the day the Senate took its vote, and since the day the House has taken its votes, we have watched the political maneuvering down at the White House and with the Vice President on this issue. Their debate isn't about controlling violence and violent youth. It is about a narrow political agenda of the far left. 
   It was a campaign kicked off by the President when he blamed the Littleton, Colorado killings on--and I quote from the speech that was later released by the White House and printed on its web page--``the huge hunting and sport shooting culture in America.'' 
   What did the hunting culture and the sport-shooting culture in America have to do with the killings in Littleton, CO? In the mind of this President and this Vice President, it was politics. It was their entry once again into this debate. 
   That's right--the President wasn't talking about the cultural crisis that distresses all of us on all sides of this issue and the breakdown of families, the powerlessness of communities, the alienation of young people, the violence and brutality promoted by the entertainment industry. 
   It was all politics narrowly focused. No, what the President chose to blame was American hunters and spot shooters. 
   According to the Clinton-Gore administration, those who lawfully exercise a right protected by the United States Constitution--those people are responsible for the brutal, senseless killings at Columbine High School.  
   Shame on you, Mr. President. If you are one of the tens of thousands of adult volunteers who have helped train Boy Scouts and other young people in marksmanship, in one of the most successful youth sporting programs in history--according to the President, you're part of the problem. 
   If you take your family on an annual hunting trip, a ``bonding experience'' for yourself and your kids--according to the Clinton-Gore administration, you're part of the problem. 
   If you represented the United States of America in the Olympic shooting events, the gun control community wants you to know that you're part of the problem. 
   If you hunt for food to put on your table for your family, according to the Clinton and Gore administration, because of Littleton, CO, you are part of the problem. 
   But it wasn't enough to insult millions of law-abiding Americans by accusing them of responsibility for what happened in Littleton. The President went a step further to suggest that if these law-abiding citizens don't go along with his gun control agenda and give up more of their liberty, then they don't care about the lives of children. 
   I find that unbelievable. But that is what was implied very clearly by this President--the leader of the free world accusing those who uphold the law of being responsible for those who break the law, accusing those who would passionately defend their civil liberties as being bad citizens, accusing those who may have a firearm for the sole purpose of recreation or defending themselves and their families, accusing these people of not wanting to save children's lives. 
   And since that kickoff back in April, what have we seen? 
   We have seen an all-out public relations campaign headed by the White House against lawful firearm use. 
   We have seen political candidates of the left trying to outdo each other on gun control ideas. It is called have a gun control idea a week and somehow it may elect you in November of 2000. 
   Maybe this political campaign is scoring points with the gun control community. But I can tell you the people who I have been hearing from--the people outside the Capital Beltway who really have to deal with youth violence in their communities and in their schools--are saying gun control misses the point entirely. 
   They are saying the solution to youth violence is far more complicated than adding one more layer to the 40,000 gun control laws--40,000, that is right--that are 
   already on the books. 
   They are saying they need real help and real ideas from Washington, DC, and not a political placebo for the 2000 election. 
   They are saying it is time to stop pushing political agendas and start pushing a law enforcement crime control agenda. 
   The Senate had a choice today between a bill that focused on juvenile justice reform and a bill that serves a political agenda. 
   I think the Senate's vote today has made the job of the conference committee harder and perhaps impossible. 
   My choice would have been a clean bill that prioritized law enforcement and focused on solving the problem of youth violence. 
   That is the kind of bill I hope to see coming out of the conference. That is the kind of bill I will work for coming out of the conference--the kind of bill that I could support and I believe that America wants. 
   They don't want politics in this issue. They want safer schools and safer streets and they want to know their children are safe from violent juveniles who would otherwise make these environments unsafe. 
   I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for yielding. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me speak directly to the Senator from Illinois, the Senator from Massachusetts, and the Senator from Washington. I have heard statements from the Senator from Illinois that I know he means in good faith but I think are wrong. The record must be corrected in that regard. The law does not allow many of the things he has suggested might happen. 
   For example, tonight he suggested that the Craig-Reid amendment would allow unlimited surface land domain. That is simply not true. Let me repeat for the record, that is an inaccurate statement. 
   Here is what the law allows today and what the Reid-Craig amendment does: It simply reinstates the law as it exists today. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right as to what the 1872 mining law says as to the 5 acres per claim. However, what attorneys have said who were brought before the subcommittee that I chair, while that was the law, it was based on the concept of the Comstock Lode, which was the mining activity in the State of Nevada that generated the 1872 mining law. From that time forward to today, it was viewed in the law as a minimum necessary requirement. 
   What the Senator from Illinois did not say, which refutes the idea that this is some kind of unlimited land surface grab, is the BLM, the administrator of claims on public land, in the  process of working with a mining company that is establishing a mining operation establishes the 5 acres and additional acres as is necessary to conduct that mining operation. 
   What does that mean? That does not mean unlimited acreages. It means exactly what I said it means. It means that the Bureau of Land Management develops a mining plan consistent with the mining operation all inclusively consistent with the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act for a mining company to effectively mine the mineral estate they have established under the mine plan and with their permit. That is not unlimited. It is our Federal Government. The BLM under the law establishes the surface domain that a mining company can have 
   for the purpose of operations. 
   Is that unlimited? I repeat to the Senator from Illinois, no, it is not. It is restricted by the character of the process and by 127 years of operation. That is what it is. That is what we are attempting to reinstate. 
   The Senator from Illinois went on to say: Why didn't they go to the courts? Why have they come to Congress? The reason they have come to Congress is because the act of the Solicitor would be automatic and immediate. The Senator from Nevada earlier spoke to the consequence of this decision. 
   Mining stock in this country dropped by a substantial percentage point on the stock exchange because the Solicitor's opinion was saying if it were fully implemented both prospectively and retroactively, it would dramatically halt existing mining operations and cost mining companies that were operating under good faith, the law, and the historic practice as prescribed by the Forest Service and the BLM, by their manual, and by their current handbooks, it would have simply stopped them, and they would have waved literally hundreds of millions of dollars in the process of developing a mining plan that was environmentally accurate and environmentally sound. 
   I know the Senator from the State of Washington is upset because the crown jewel mine in her State was, by her own State's environment director, announced to be the best ever; that they had met all of the environmental standards; they were complying with all the Clean Air and Water Act and somehow the Solicitor stepped in and stopped the process. 
   The senior Senator from the State of Washington and the supplemental appropriations bill this year said it is just blatantly unfair for a company to operate in good faith under the law and under the environmental laws of our country. For the Solicitor, an appointed bureaucrat, to step in and stop them without any public process is against the very character of the law we create on this floor. 
   So the senior Senator from the State of Washington was right in doing what he did. At that supplemental appropriations conference, while I was trying to do exactly what the Senator from Nevada and I have just done with this amendment, we said: No, let's not do that. 
   I chair the Public Land Subcommittee, the mining subcommittee. Let's hold hearings on this issue. Let's see if the Solicitor is right in doing what he has done. We brought in mining authorities, lawyers who practice this law professionally full time before the committee, asking if the Solicitor was right in doing what he did. Their answer was absolutely not; 127 years of practice would argue that the Solicitor reached out in thin air and grabbed an opinion that he knew would bring the mining industry to its knees. 
   Why would he know it? Surely, he wouldn't do it arbitrarily or capriciously. Surely, he wouldn't do that for political purposes. Want to bet? Let me state why he did it. Let me speak to Members in Mr. Leshy's own words, words written in his own book, called ``Reforming the Mining Law: Problems and Prospects.'' This Solicitor knew exactly what he was doing. He did it for political purposes. He did not do it for the kind of benevolent, benign, environmentally sound reasons that the Senator from Illinois suggested. 
   The Solicitor said:  
   A hoary maxim of life on Capitol Hill is that Congress acts only when there is either a crisis or a consensus.  
   The Solicitor at the Department of Interior attempted to establish a crisis in the mining industry with the mining law. 
   He went on to say:  
   Currently there is no genuine crisis involving hardrock mining--  
   although the Senator from Illinois worked for about an hour to gin one up--  
   but with a little effort crises sufficient to bring about reform might be imagined.  
   That is what the Solicitor said when he was a private citizen environmental advocate against mining. 
   So then he went on to say:  
   At the extreme, it might even be appropriate for the Interior Department and the courts to consciously reach results that make the statute unworkable.  
   The Solicitor himself in a former life, in 1988, said: You know what we could do? We could create a crisis and make the statute unworkable, and we would force the Congress to change the law. And then all of a sudden John Leshy was no longer private citizen, environmental advocate; he was public citizen appointed Solicitor of the Department of Interior. And what did he do? He followed his own words and his own edicts. He attempted to create a crisis. And a crisis it was, and we have spoken to it already, the crisis that tumbled mining stock dramatically in the stock markets of this country. 
   A message went out to the mining industry: You are not only unwelcome on public lands, we are going to try to run you off from them. That is a hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars industry, with tens of thousands of employees across this country, yet the Solicitor, a nonelected public official with no public process, did this. The Solicitor's opinion was not subject to public comment or review. The Department of Interior failed to provide a forum for interested parties to express their views. The Solicitor's opinion is a change in the law that the administration made without any kind of review. It just simply said: That's the new law. And I say ``new law'' because for 127 years the Department of Interior, the BLM, and the Forest Service operated under the law that Senator REID of Nevada and I are attempting to reinstate this evening. That is what the Solicitor did.

   Mr. CRAIG. The Solicitor went on to say:  
   Some particularly dramatic episode that highlights the particular anachronisms of the Mining law might also encourage Congress to perform surgery on the Law.  
   That is what the Solicitor said, and that is what the Solicitor did. 
   What John Leshy failed to say is that over the years he and I have met around the country, debating, and he has wanted to change the mining law in such a dramatic way that the mining industry of this country simply could not operate. 
   The Senator from Illinois suggested we ought to change the law. You know, he is right. As chairman of the Public Lands Subcommittee and as chairman of the mining committee for the last 5 years, I say to the Senator from Illinois, we have tried to change the law. We even brought it to the floor once, passed it in a supplemental, and guess what happened. President Clinton vetoed a major change in the 1872 mining law. What did that law have in it? Major reclamation reform. It had within it a hard rock mining royalty that would have funded that reclamation reform so if mine industries went bankrupt, there was a public trust provided by the mining companies to do that kind of reclamation reform. But this President and his Solicitor will not allow that kind of reform to happen. 
   I have worked in good faith, and, I must say, the Senator from Nevada has, for the last 5 to 6 years to make significant change in the 1872 law. We recognize the need for its modernization. That is not denied here. But what you do not do is the very backdoor, unparticipatory, nonpublic effort of the kind the Solicitor did. 
   The Senator from Illinois talked about the degradation that happened in his State. What the Senator did not say is, it does not happen anymore. The reason it does not happen anymore, and the reason he should not use it as an example, is that there is a law that disallows it today. There is full mine reclamation on surface mining, especially in the coal industry.  
   So let me suggest to the Senator from Illinois, let's talk today and not 50 years ago, when he and I would both agree those kinds of practices now are unacceptable. They may have been acceptable then, but they are not acceptable now. In fact, the Senator from Illinois held up a picture. He did not quite know where it was. I will tell him where it was. It was in the State of Montana. I have been to that site. I have traveled and seen these problems. Three times we tried to get that issue in Montana cleaned up. Environmental groups stepped in and sued. 
   You kind of wonder if they do not want the issue instead of a resolution to the problem. We have worked progressively with them to try to reform the 1872 mining law, and in all instances they have said no. Here is why they said no. They said: We don't want you to have the right to go find the mineral if you find it in a place in which we don't want you to mine. 
   That is an interesting thesis because gold is, in fact, where you find it. It is not where you might like to have it for environmental reasons. What do we do with a thesis like that? We say OK, gold is where you find it, silver is where you find it, but because of our environmental ethics and standards 
   today, you have to do it in an environmentally sound way. 
   That is what you have to do. You have to comply with the Clean Air Act. They did in the State of Washington. You have to comply with the Clean Water Act. They did in the State of Washington. You have to meet all the State standards--tough standards in the State of Washington. You have to meet all the Federal standards--tough standards in the State of Washington. 
   That is what the Crown Jewel Mine did. And yet, at the last moment, in the 12th hour, by pressure from environmental groups, Mr. Leshy came out of his closet and said: No, you can't. And the senior Senator from the State of Washington said: Wrong, Mr. Leshy. That is not the way a democracy works. That is not the way a representative republic works. If they played by the rules and they played by the law, then they must have the right to continue. That is the issue we are talking about. We are talking about dealing fairly and appropriately with the law. 
   Let me go ahead and talk about Mr. Leshy some more because he is being talked about tonight as the savior of the environment. Let me tell you what he is really out to do. It is not to save the environment but to destroy the mining industry. He has worked for decades with this goal in mind. What did he say in this book he wrote in 1988? What he said was:  
   Bold administrative actions, like major new withdrawals, creative rulemaking or aggressive environmental enforcement, could force the hand of Congress.  
   Mr. Leshy is right. He forced the hand of Congress. The Senator from Washington and I discussed this briefly in the Appropriations Committee. 
   I do not stand tonight to impugn the integrity or the beliefs of the Senator from Illinois or the Senator from Washington or the Senator from Massachusetts. But it is important that when you say unlimited withdrawal of surface, I say it is wrong, because it is not right; that is not what the law allows. The Department of Interior does not allow that unless it is within the plan, unless it is bonded, unless it meets all the environmental standards, and it is proven to be required by the mining operation as appropriate and necessary. 
   Those are the laws as we deal with them today. 
   I suggest the Senator from Montana was absolutely right. I am talking about reforming the 1872 mining law. It is a location and a withdrawal law. It is not an environmental law. Modern mining companies must adhere to the law, and that is the Clean Air Act, and that is the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and all of those that are tremendously important. That is what we debate here this evening, and that is why it is critically important that we deal with it in an upfront and necessary manner.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield in a moment. 
   I would like to reform the 1872 mining law, and I would like the Senator from Illinois to help me. The Senator from Nevada has stood ready with me for now well over 5 years for that purpose, only to be denied it by this administration. They kept walking away from the table. They would very seldom come and sit down with us. I must tell you, I do not know why. I ultimately had to draw the conclusion that they preferred the issue over the solution because it was our effort in the State of Nevada, a very important mining State for our country, and my State of Idaho, a very important mining State, that we resolve this issue. That, of course, is why I think it is necessary. 
   A mining claim is a parcel of land containing precious metal in the soil or the rock. That is what a claim is. 
   A mill site is a plot of ground necessary to support the operations of a mine. That is what a mill site is. 
   Mill sites are critical to mining because, amongst many uses, they hold the rock extract, that which is brought up out of the ground from the diggings of the mine, containing milling facilities that extract valuable minerals from the ore and provide a location to house administration and equipment and repair and storage facilities. 
   Let me suggest a comparative to the Senator from Illinois. If I bought a half acre of ground in downtown Chicago for the purpose of building a 50-story building, and they said I could go down 50 feet and establish parking, but I could not go up any, and I was not given any air rights, then I could not build the building. I could acquire the property and I could dig down, but I could not go up. 
   That is exactly what the Senator is suggesting tonight, that you can gain a mining claim under the law but you cannot build a mill site because 5 acres, I think as most of us know, is a fairly limited amount of ground, and that is exactly what the Federal Government has recognized for 127 years. 
   As a result of that, what the Government has said is, if you meet these standards and you incorporate it in a mining plan, you can have additional acres we will permit you for that purpose. Is that unlimited? I say to the Senator from Illinois, it is not. To suggest to anybody in the BLM, including this administration's BLM, that they give carte blanche acreages of land to mining companies is, in fact, not true. That is the reality of working with the BLM. Whether it is a Republican BLM or a Democrat BLM, both administrations, all administrations, have adhered to the law. It is important that the law not be misrepresented. 
   I suggest to the Senator from Illinois that mining is not necessarily a clean business. Digging in the ground is not necessarily a clean business. It is not environmentally pristine. That is the character of it. There are few businesses where you disturb or disrupt the ground that are. It is how you handle them after the fact with which I think the Senator from Illinois, the Senator from Washington, the Senator from Massachusetts, and I would agree. I hope they do not want to run the mining industry out of our country. We already have substantial exodus from our country because of costs of mining based on certain standards. They all attempt to comply. 
   The greatest problem today is access to the land. The Senator from Illinois does not have any public land in his State, or very limited amounts. My State is 63 percent federally owned land--your land and my land. I am not suggesting that it is Idaho's lands, nor would the Senator from Nevada suggest that only Nevadans ought to determine the surface domain of the State of Nevada. We understand it is Federal land. 
   Nevadans and Idahoans and Americans all must gain from the value of those resources, but we also understand that they must be gained in an environmentally sound way. We have worked mightily so to build and transform a mining law for that purpose. I must tell you that the Solicitor, both as a private citizen environmental advocate and now as a public citizen Solicitor, has fought us all the way, because he wanted a law that fundamentally denied a mining company the right of discovery, location, and development unless it was phenomenally limited. Those are the issues that clearly we deal with when we are on the floor. 
   Let me say in closing, Mr. President--and it is very important for the Senators to hear this--we are not  changing the law. We are simply saying: Mr. Leshy, you do not have it your way until policymakers--the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Idaho--agree on what the law ought to be. That is our job; that is not John Leshy's job. Ours will be done in a public process with public hearings and public input and not 
   in the private office of a Solicitor down at the Department of Interior who, in the dark of night, slips out and passes a rule and the stock market crashes on mining stock. 
   I do not think the Senator from Illinois would like that any more than we would if we did it to major industries in his State, because he and I are policymakers and we should come to a meeting of the minds when it comes to crafting reform of the 1872 mining law. That is what I want to do. I hope that is what he wants to do. 
   Are we legislating on an appropriations bill? No. We are saying: Mr. Solicitor, you do not have the right to change the law. We will leave the law as it is, as the current 1999 or 1998 handbook at BLM says it is, as the current handbook down at the Forest Service says it is, and that is the handbook a mining company uses to build a mining plan, to build a mining operation. He said at the last hour: The handbook is no good even though we wrote it, even though we OK'd it, and even though that is the way we operate. 
   I do not think so. We now know why. Because, for goodness sake, we read his book, the book he crafted in 1988 saying: Let's create a crisis, let's bring the mining industry to its knees, and just maybe then we will get the Congress to move. 
   I heard John Leshy in 1988 and again in 1990, as did the Senator from Nevada. We worked mightily to change the law, and we are still working to do it. We have not been able to accomplish that. I hope we can, and we will work hard in the future to do that. But I hope my colleagues and fellow Senators will support us tonight in leaving the current law intact and not allowing this administration, or any other one, through their attorneys, to arbitrarily change a law without the public process and the public input that the Senator from Illinois and I are obligated to make, and yet tonight he defends the opposite. I do not think he wants that. I do not think any of us want a private process that will deny the right of public input.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, at this time we are taking a close look at the Boxer amendment. I have visited with the Senator from California. She is being very straightforward with this amendment. No one out there wants to suggest that anybody in the legitimate business of selling guns in a legal fashion should sell one to an intoxicated person. 
   I am concerned about the section of the code she is amending as it relates to penalties. I certainly do not believe any of us would suggest that anybody in a retail business who sells guns within the context of the Federal law becomes an alcohol expert or has breathalyzer equipment or any of that kind of thing at the point of sale. We want to make sure that is clear, because that is asking a nonprofessional to make a professional determination that could ultimately put them in tremendous liability, up to 10 years in prison. We want to make sure that is perfectly clear. 
   I said to the Senator from California we will work with her to assure that going into conference, that section of the code is clarified so her amendment is as clear as, obviously, she intends it to be. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my colleague, the Subcommittee Chairman, regarding a specific funding provision in this bill within arms control treaty verification. I have been concerned for some time that our arms control efforts have been focused on treaty negotiation at the expense of treaty verification. The Committee report expressed the same concern. As a result, technological advances in arms control verification made at the national laboratories are not being fully applied or exploited. Accordingly, this bill provides $10,000,000 for this purpose. I want to be absolutely precise about what the Committee has directed in this area so I will quote from the Committee's report accompanying this bill. The report states the following: ``the Committee recommendation provides a $10,000,000 increase over fiscal year 1999 for verification technology.''  
   Mr. President, I think the plain meaning of this language could not be any clearer and I think my colleague the Subcommittee Chairman would agree with me. That is why I was puzzled to hear from my staff that, in informal conversations, State Department personnel have expressed confusion over how to interpret this language. If my understanding is correct, some in the State Department have expressed their belief that the $10,000,000 increase is intended to be applied first to the President's priorities for increased funding--costing approximately $8,000,000--and that only the remaining $2,000,000, left over after the President's priorities are funded, would be applied to the treaty verification work. 
   Mr. President, I certainly hope that the information I have about the interpretation of agency officials is incorrect. I certainly hope that the State Department would not disregard the abundantly clear direction provided by the Committee. I ask my colleague if my interpretation of the Committee's direction comports with his own, as Chairman of the Subcommittee.

   Mr. CRAIG. this past weekend Senator CRAPO, Congresswoman CHENOWETH and I conducted a public meeting in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho where federal, state, local, tribal officials and citizens give statements and responded to questions concerning the federal, tribal and state governments' involvement in a Superfund site in North Idaho known as the Bunker Hill site. 
   To date there has been approximately $200 million spent on cleanup. Significant progress has been made, but there is a great deal of debate going on between the parties concerning what other areas in the Basin need to be included in the cleanup. I believe the State of Idaho, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and the federal agencies can work out these questions and resolve the conflicts that have gone on over this issue in the Coeur d'Alene Basin for over a decade. 
   I feel the Department of Justice, Idaho and the Nation as a whole would be well served if the DOJ and the other parties involved in litigation were to work among themselves parties to resolve the issues rather than to continue to litigate.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my colleague from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, regarding an issue associated with the implementation of the Kyl, Domenici, Murkowski amendment. This amendment creates a new semi-autonomous Agency for Nuclear Stewardship within the Department of Energy by collecting together various national security programs and nuclear weapons laboratories and facilities into a new agency. My state of Idaho hosts two Department of Energy laboratories--the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory West. Since these laboratories do not meet the definition of nuclear weapons laboratories, they are not included in the amendment, but I want to raise for my colleagues some of the complexities of implementing this new organizational structure. 
   As I said, the laboratories in my state are not included in the proposal for the new agency but it is important to understand that Idaho's laboratories are making significant contributions to national security. Just as my colleagues from New Mexico have mentioned earlier in this debate, that we  must do nothing to impede the continued contribution of the weapons laboratories to the critical civilian missions of the Department of Energy, I want to emphasize and confirm my colleague's agreement that the non-weapons laboratories shall continue to contribute and have their capabilities made available to the national security programs of the Department of Energy. 
   To clarify this point, I would like to use a specific example from the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The Advanced Test Reactor, or ATR, in Idaho is the only world-class test reactor left in the United States. I do not state this as a boast, but as a fact. The ATR has a vital role in both improving the operation of the nuclear Navy and supporting our nation's future nuclear energy research and development endeavors. In addition, this important facility has the potential to attract significant international interest and investment. I am concerned that this amendment, which moves the Naval Reactors program from under the umbrella of DOE's nuclear research and development program to the new agency, will also reassign responsibility for this reactor. 
   Reassigning the responsibility for this reactor to the new agency would be harmful from two perspectives. First, our Naval Reactors program is a user of this facility but should not be burdened with its operation and maintenance. Second, moving responsibility for this reactor out of the nuclear research and development program could inadvertently endanger its use by the U.S. civilian and international research community. Since this latter use is growing and very important to our future civilian nuclear research activities, could I ask my colleague from New Mexico to confirm that it is not the intent of this amendment to move responsibility for the Advanced Test Reactor when moving the Naval Reactors program to the new agency?

   Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague for that clarification and assurance. The Naval Reactors program has a proud history in Idaho. All spent naval nuclear fuel is sent to Idaho for examination and storage pending its permanent disposition. Although Idaho's facilities are not included in the new agency, I am assured that the many ways in which Idaho's laboratories contribute to our national security will continue under this new organizational structure.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate this morning to report a sad event to my colleagues. This past Saturday, July 17, I received news of the untimely death of Kenneth Christopher Foss, one of the analysts on the staff of the Republican Policy Committee, of which I am chairman. He was 29 years old and had been a lifelong sufferer of diabetes. 
   Since assuming the RPC chairmanship in 1996, I had gotten to know Ken very well. Most recently, I had worked very closely with him on legislation affecting Second Amendment rights. As anyone who knew Ken can attest, he was not a man to compromise on principle. He was an extraordinary individual who stood on solid moral and conservative principles. In an age of relative values and indifference to truth, he will be sorely missed. For Ken, devotion to principle was not an option, it was an imperative. 
   Ken's achievements during his all-too-short time in the Senate and on Earth were truly remarkable. He began his career with former Senator Dan Coats, first as an intern and then as a staff assistant. He moved over to the RPC during the chairmanship of my predecessor, Senator DON NICKLES. 
   Many of my colleagues may not fully be aware of Ken's contributions to the operation of the committee's in-house cable television facility, channel 2, which we all know is an indispensable tool for Senators and their staffs to keep abreast of floor action. This past year, Ken was the backbone of channel 2 as its manager. 
   In addition, he had shouldered the increased responsibility of a constantly growing list of issues as a policy analyst, including guns, education, alcohol and tobacco, drugs, immigration, American flag protection, census ``sampling'', prosecutorial ethics and asset forfeiture, and adoption, among others. 
   For Ken, these were not just a list of bureaucratic responsibilities at the RPC--they were to him truly a passion, objects of his deeply held commitment to justice, the rule of law, and the truest values of the American Republic. I might add, his passion extended to the issue of Puerto Rican statehood, where his position was diametrically opposed to mine. Though he was gentleman enough not to be obvious about it, it was very clear to me where he stood. 
   Whatever he worked on, he was meticulous and thorough. Whatever his task, he was the first to volunteer for the heavy lifting, to collect all the background, to consult all the authoritative sources, to do all the detailed reading and analysis, to become a walking library on the issue at hand. As anyone who has been to what we call the ``big room'' at the RPC or down to his basement station at channel 2 in the Capitol, known as ``the cave,'' Ken's desk was a veritable archive, testimony to both his devotion to duty and to his active mind. 
   I want to mention two matters in particular that define Ken and his work in the Senate. To say that Ken was devoted to defending American rights under the Second Amendment is a masterpiece of understatement. As one of the bumper stickers displayed on his desk puts it: ``A man with a gun is a citizen; a man without a gun is a subject.'' For Ken, those were words by which to live. Ken had a keen devotion to the concept of ordered liberty under constitutional government and the reciprocal rights and duties of the citizens, especially armed citizens. Whatever the gun-related issue--concealed-carry laws, instant background checks, mandatory trigger locks, or any other efforts to circumvent our founders' clear words--Ken was Horatio at the bridge. His assistance to me during the recent debate on gun show restrictions was invaluable. He will be sorely missed by me certainly, and by the Nation. 
   Second, it would be impossible to talk about Ken Foss without mentioning his devotion to the unique cultural heritage of the South, and especially his native State, the Commonwealth of Virginia. In all he did, in his stubborn unwillingness to forsake a cause that he thought was just, he was constantly following, and consciously following, in the footsteps of famous Virginians of the past upon whom he looked as role models: George Washington, Patrick Henry, George Mason, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson. Philosophically in agreement with the antifederalism of Mason and Henry, Ken really did believe that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, and his tireless work reflected that conviction. 
   His love of Virginia and of the South extended from honoring and emulating the great names of the past and ``Sic Semper Tyrannis,'' the motto of the State of Virginia on the screen-saver on his computer, to his fondness for Allman's barbecue down in Fredericksburg, southern rock music, and Alabama football. 
   Ken prized the distinctive heritage of his State and his region and was afraid that in our modern, homogenized world, we were losing an irreplaceable part of a precious cultural patrimony. In his passing, Virginia and the South have lost a true son, and the Nation is, I think, poorer for it. 
   Ken is survived by his parents, Gary and Andra Foss, and by his brother Eric. I am sure I speak for all my colleagues in expressing our condolences to his family. Ken's father, Gary Foss, is director of the Fredericksburg Christian School. 
   In closing, I should mention that Ken's dedication in his nonprofessional life extended no less to the principles of Christian education and the Reformed tradition. For Ken, service to God, to his church, to his parents, to his fellow man was an expression of the same qualities he demonstrated in his professional life. Whether it was the Ten Commandments or the Constitution, Ken knew his duty and inspired others to respond to the call. 
   This is how I remember him, and this is how I believe he will be remembered. We will all miss Ken Foss. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator COVERDELL of Georgia for asking for a special order this morning to talk about taxes, where we are with taxes in our country, and where the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee are at this moment as we begin, within a few weeks, a very important national debate on reducing the overall tax burden for the American people. 
   For a few moments this morning, let me talk about that tax burden and try to put it in context with other times in our history when the American people cried out for tax relief and the Congress heard them and the Congress respectfully responded. 
   Today's total tax burden is the highest since World War II, according to the Office of Management and Budget. I know when I came here in the 1980s, the World War II tax level was always used as the index. It was less than we had to pay during the wartime tax of World War II. At that time, that was the highest ever registered in our Nation. But now we have broken that mark. I will repeat that. The OMB now says that the peacetime tax burden of the average American taxpayer is higher than it has been at any time since World War II. 
   Tax receipts as a percentage of the gross domestic product amounted to 20.5 percent last year, will grow to 20.6 percent this year, and will reach 20.7 percent next year. 
   Recently a new administration estimate predicted the largest budget surplus in the history of our country, with the highest taxes ever, and the highest budget surplus ever. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed this optimistic forecast. 
   According to the President's estimates, last year's was the largest surplus in history. It will be larger this year, and will extend for the next 15 years. 
   That is a lot of optimism. But even conservative economists suggest that the budget surplus, as we now know it, is going to extend well into the future. 
   Over the next 10 years, a non-Social Security surplus will be at approximately $1.1 trillion. Over the next 15 years, the non-Social Security surplus could get as high as $2.9 trillion. Once again, these are reasonably conservative estimates on reasonably conservative growth in the Federal budget. Growing surpluses, but still no net tax cut? That is what our President is saying. Look at all of this money we are going to have to spend beyond what would be considered a reasonable level of spending at the Federal level. President Clinton won't recognize the income taxpayers' burdens, despite a $2.9 trillion overpayment over the next 15 years. 
   I am not going to talk about surpluses anymore. I am going to talk about overpayment. The American taxpayer is overpaying what they should have to pay for the Government they are getting at this moment. Yet from the White House there is not one word about reasonable and responsible tax relief for the American taxpayer. That is why our Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee are fashioning tax reductions at this moment. 
   The income taxpayers' burden is the heaviest in history, in terms of a total tax burden. The personal income tax burden stands at 9.9 percent of the gross domestic product, and, that is not just the highest since World War II, but the highest ever. It is higher than the 7.9 level when the President took office. It is higher than the 7.8 level of the gross domestic product when John Kennedy, a new President, came into office, and said: Let's stimulate the economy by producing a major tax cut. Of course, we remember the history of that. It was not unlike the model that Ronald Reagan brought to office and convinced the Congress to produce a tax cut to stimulate the economy. 
   Our President thinks this economy is so good that you don't need to do that. That is not the issue. Our economy is strong, and we want to keep it strong, growing, and providing jobs. The way you do that is to insure that you don't drain the American public of their ability to spend for their families, and to save and invest in the growth of that future economy. 
   The tax burden we have today is higher than the 9 percent level Jimmy Carter left office with, which produced the tax cuts, or at least the stimulus for the tax cuts, that Ronald Reagan brought to this Congress in the early 1980s. 
   It is the highest level since World War II, and that was 1946 when it was 7.2 percent, and we were taxing at a high level to finance a war effort, the most major war effort ever conducted in the history of this country. 
   According to Clinton's own budget office, his 9.9 percent level is the highest recorded level of personal income tax receipts ever reached in the history of this country. Clinton is the undisputed champion of personal income tax burden. 
   You are the undisputed champion of that personal income tax burden and not one word from you, Mr. President, on a right and responsible level of tax reduction on the highest burden ever in the history of our country. 
   Under President Clinton, personal income tax receipts have 
   grown at an average annual rate of 9.7 percent. That is 75 percent faster than the economy's average annual growth rate of 5.3 percent. That is faster than the wages' and salaries' average annual growth rate of 5.6 percent. In other words, Mr. President, your tax rate increase is outstripping all levels of growth in this country--both personal and public. That is faster than personal income's average annual growth rate of 5.2 percent. That is faster than payroll taxes' annual growth rate of 5.6 percent. That is 4 1/2 times faster than the 2 percent average annual growth rate of gross private savings of this country. 
   Highest surpluses in high history; highest non-Social Security surplus in history; highest non-payroll tax surplus in history; highest personal income tax receipt burden in history. 
   What should we do? Cut personal income taxes, is what we ought to be doing. Yet, Mr. President, not a word from you. 
   What about the marriage penalty that the Senator from Missouri was talking about a few moments ago? What about death tax relief? Every time I walk off from a plane in my home State of Idaho, I hear from the small businessperson, or a farmer, or a rancher, who are at a time in their lives when they want to transfer the ownership of their life's work to their son, or to their daughter, and can't because the Federal Government steps in and destroys the American dream by saying: Give me at least 50 percent of the value of the life's work, and then I will let you pass the rest of it on to your family; and, in doing that, the son, or the daughter, or the son-in-law or the daughter-in-law spends the rest of their life trying to pay once again for that business, for that farm, for that ranch, and, in the end, they have to sell it just to pay the tax. 
   Mr. President, please. What about the American dream? Join with us in eliminating the death tax. 
   The fact that we have a $2.9 trillion surplus totally apart from Social Security means we can still protect Social Security and buy down the public debt. In addition to these things, we could cut income taxes and return income tax surpluses to the overburdened taxpayer. 
   Everyone can see this connection. It is not a difficult thing to understand the highest income tax burden and the highest surplus in our country's history. When I say it is easy to see, that is everyone except President Clinton. Right on this Hill, his defenders won't even talk about a tax reduction.  
   Clinton wants to raise taxes. Understand me. Here is the President, after all of the statistics and facts I have just given you, who brings the budget to the Hill this year, and in it are tax increases. According to the Congressional Budget Office, President Clinton's budget raises $96 billion in new taxes over the next decade. I mean, Mr. President, where in the heck are you coming from? With surpluses unlike we have ever had before, certainly in this Senator's history, and you want to raise taxes? That is roughly a 10-percent surplus surcharge over the next 10 years on the American taxpayer. 
   In case you haven't forgotten, let me give you a little of the Clinton tax history. It is important the Senate understand this is a President who campaigned in 1992 on the promise to cut taxes. Then, in 1993, once elected, he raised taxes by $240 billion. After that, in 1995, President Clinton confessed--I was not in the room at that time, but here is the quote: ``People in this room are still mad at me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much.'' 
   His own quote: ``Well, it might surprise you to know I think I raised them too much.'' 
   That is the inconsistency of this President on this issue, and now with 2 years of a budget surplus under our belt, and with $2.9 trillion over the next 15 years in non-Social Security budget surpluses, Mr. President, join us in reducing the overall tax burden on the American people, and work with us to give a strong, responsible tax reduction to the taxpayers and to the economy of this country. 
   Bill Clinton breaks promises to cut taxes and makes promises to raise them. 
   No wonder Bill Clinton is the undisputed champion of personal income taxes. 
   Bill Clinton may have a choice--whether to keep his word or not, whether to raise taxes when there is a surplus or whether to veto a tax cut when there is a surplus. 
   For this Congress there should be no choice. 
   This Congress should cut taxes on the overtaxed American people. 
   We should do it if we had to cut spending to do it--as we have before. 
   We do not even have to cut spending to cut taxes when there is trillions more than is necessary to run an already bloated government. 
   When not one cent of this surplus comes from Social Security. 
   We have nothing short of a moral imperative to return the money to the taxpayers who sent it. 
   While it may be Clinton-able, it is unconscionable to do otherwise.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me, first, thank one of the true leaders in the Senate on the issue of health care for yielding me time, and to say how much I have appreciated his work in the last month and in the last few days during this critical debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I am pleased the Senate is, once again, debating the issue of health care reform. I am pleased because here we have an opportunity, I think, to reclaim for the American people their right to control their health care. I am excited we have this opportunity to talk about medical savings accounts, restoring patients rights, and making health care insurance affordable--or at least this should be the essence of the debate. 
   I must tell you that I am disappointed to see only one side is interested in truly talking about patients' rights instead of more regulation, more government, and, somehow, more control. While Republicans are talking about giving all Americans access to health care insurance and letting them control their medical health care, our Democrat friends are talking about driving up costs, canceling health care coverage for millions of Americans, and putting American health care under the control of more Federal Government. 
   I am aware my friend, the Senator from Connecticut, has an amendment on the floor. I will speak to that amendment in just a few moments. But I think it is important to set that amendment in the context of the debate on the bill yesterday, today, and the balance of the week. 
   First, I want to look at what it is our Democrat friends on the floor of the Senate are asking us to swallow. I believe this will help us better understand the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. 
   We have heard a lot of talk about the cost of the Kennedy bill--some of it on this floor. Yesterday we even saw our colleagues parade out the President of the United States to downplay the cost of the Kennedy bill. Our Democrat colleagues have a mantra when it comes to the cost of the bill. Over and over again, they say, well, it is less than a Big Mac; it is less than $2 a month. 
   Let me look at this chart for a moment, and maybe you will join with me in it. It is ``less than a Big Mac.'' That is what Senator KENNEDY said. They even say the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says this bill will cost less than a Big Mac. 
   If you look at the Congressional Budget Office report--and I recommend you read it in its entirety--you will see it says nothing about a Big Mac. But this is what it does say: According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Kennedy bill will increase premiums an average of 6.1 percent over and above the normal inflationary costs of health care. 
   For instance, let's read from the CBO report because an awful lot of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be confused about what the Congressional Budget Office has said about this bill. 
   I am quoting the CBO report:  
   Most of the provisions would reach their full effect within the first 3 years of its enactment. The CBO estimates the premiums for an employer-sponsored health plan would rise by an average of 6.1 percent in the absence of any compensating changes on the part of the employer.  
   What are the ``compensating changes''? There is a clear history in health care that, as costs go up, people either leave or are dropped from the system. 
   The CBO says of the Kennedy bill on compensating changes:  
   Employers could respond to premium increases in a variety of ways to reduce their impact. They could drop health care insurance entirely.  
   Yes, that is an option. CBO says it is. 
   ``Reduce the generosity of the benefit package.'' 
   That is quite typically what happens. They keep narrowing the scope of the coverage. 
   ``Increase cost sharing by beneficiaries.'' 
   We know what that means--the consumer pays more of the bill. 
   Or ``increase the employee's share of the premium.'' 
   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think the CBO had a nice thing to say about their bill, I suggest they read the entire report. ``They could drop health insurance entirely'' is a quote. This is perhaps the most frightening part of the Kennedy bill to any American family. So many families across America are struggling to get by--we know that--even in prosperous times. There is a very large chunk of America that does not share totally in that prosperity. They depend on their health insurance to protect them when things go wrong. 
   Yet every Democrat Member of this Chamber has thrown their support behind a bill that would take protection away from an estimated 1.9 million Americans. That is one estimate. Here is another estimate commissioned by our friends at the AFL-CIO. They indicate that the Kennedy bill could cancel health care coverage for approximately 1.8 million Americans. 
   I suggest a new slogan for my colleagues when they talk about the bill. I am talking now about ``golden arches.'' Over 1.8 million Americans are uninsured by the Kennedy bill. That is a Big Mac attack directly at the American consumer and directly at the American family. 
   A few weeks ago when I made the same comment on the floor of the Senate, my colleague from North Dakota--who happens to be on the floor now, Senator DORGAN--made a very remarkable statement. I don't think I have heard it yet in the debate. My friend said the Kennedy bill might actually increase coverage because it would make health care so attractive that people who are now uninsured would sign up to get its coverage. I say this is a remarkable statement for a very obvious reason. First, my friend seems to think we in the Senate can repeal the law of supply and demand. Raise the price, and more people are going to come and get it? I doubt it. History shows quite the opposite. 
   So instead of demand decreasing as price goes up, consumers will buy more of the product because it is more pricey and, yes, it does have more benefits or possibly more? I don't think so. 
   Divide the dollars each family spends. They have to put food on the table; they have to take the risk when it comes to health insurance. 
   While 14 percent of the public want Congress to reform 
   medical care or to reform managed care, a whopping 82 percent of America wants Congress to make health care more affordable. That is what we ought to be about: Extending coverage, protecting the patient, and while doing it, certainly not raising costs but hopefully making it more affordable. 
   That hardly fits my friend's description of a ``public clamor'' for a more expensive health insurance program. 
   Finally, if my colleagues know so much about health care insurance and how attractive they can make it to the consumers, I suggest they resign from the Senate and go run a health care insurance company because obviously they know a new formula and they could make a killing. 
   Enough about Big Mac attacks. That is what the Kennedy bill ought to be called--a Big Mac attack. We have seen the number of uninsured Americans rise from 32 million to 43 million in just 10 years. Since 1995, the uninsured in my home State of Idaho has risen from 15 to 18 percent of the population. That is higher than the national average. Every year we add 1 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured. The Kennedy bill would speed up that process instead of slow it down. What the Senate ought to be about right now and what our Government ought to be about is trying to slow it down and make it more affordable. 
   My colleague from Connecticut has offered an amendment that he says will improve access to cancer treatment. Before we vote on this amendment, I will discuss the impact of the Kennedy bill and what it would do in the context of this amendment in our fight against cancer. 
   We have heard from my colleague from Florida who, thank goodness, survived cancer. Most Members have not  had to go through that trauma. What he said was critically important. The 1.9 million Americans who would lose their health care coverage under the Kennedy bill represent more than 1 out of every 100 Americans with private coverage. Private health care insurance in this country pays for millions of Americans to undergo cancer screening meant to catch the deadly illness quickly, when it can be treated and defeated. 
   The Centers for Disease Control say every year private health insurance pays for 33 million American women to undergo exams meant to detect breast cancer. The Kennedy bill would cancel coverage for, it is now estimated, 189,000 such breast exams every year. I don't really believe that is what they intend, but that is the unintended consequence of this kind of legislation. Mr. President, 189,000 women could go without breast exams if the Kennedy bill became law. 
   The Centers for Disease Control say each year private health insurance pays for 9 million American women to have a mammogram. The Kennedy bill would cancel coverage for 53,000 of those mammograms on an annual basis. Run the statistics, run the percentages, run the figures. If you are going to take 1.8 or 1.9 million Americans out from under coverage, statistically I am accurate. 
   Yesterday my colleague from California, Senator BOXER, said, ``Republicans are turning their backs on America's women.'' She was on the floor just a few moments ago repeating that. I want to know how Senator BOXER and all sponsors of the Kennedy bill reconcile their commitment to women and women's health with the fact that they are supporting a bill that could cause thousands of malignant lumps to go undiagnosed every year. 
   The Centers for Disease Control says each year private health insurance pays for 41 million women to have pelvic exams and 24 million Pap smears. These tests are meant to detect ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancers. Yet the Kennedy bill would cancel coverage for 238,000 pelvic exams and 135,000 Pap smears. That is every year, according to the statistics, according to CBO, and according to the examination and study by the AFL-CIO. 
   I want to hear the Kennedy bill supporters begin to reconcile these numbers, if their mantra is to fight cancer. We are talking about access to the system. We want people to have these tests. We want them protected. Yet if you shoot the cost up, people will take the risk. There are only so many fungible dollars in every citizen's life. They have to make real choices. My friends, that is the marketplace. I am afraid that is the unintended consequence of the Kennedy bill. 
   It does not harm just women. The Kennedy bill could and would cancel--if you run the statistics, there it is again--23,000 prostate exams every year. 
   As a final example, the Kennedy bill could cancel coverage for 439,000 skin cancer exams every year. 
   I say this is a final example because the list is not exhaustive. It would be impossible to track all the ways the Kennedy bill threatens the health of 1.9 million Americans who it would leave without protection from the life-threatening diseases they will face. 
   When my Republican colleagues raised the cost issue yesterday, I believe my colleague from Massachusetts called it a red herring. If this passes, I wonder what he will say to the women and the men who will lose their fight against cancer because they did not get the early detection. Because they did not have the money, they did not have the coverage to walk through the door and get the exam.

   Mr. CRAIG. I will not yield. 
   I find it astounding that this is what my colleagues have contributed to the debate on patients' rights. How can a patient have a right if a patient cannot have access? Every study shows a 6.1-percent increase in premiums above inflation will drive 1.9 million Americans out of health care. 
   My Republican colleagues and I support a different approach, a substantially different approach. We have a bill that puts patients in control of their own health care and that makes health care simply more affordable. Our bill achieves it by giving all Americans access to medical savings accounts, along with all of the other kinds of health care insurances that are now available. 
   Since we introduced the limited MSA, or the Medical Savings Pilot Program, something really very wonderful in health care has happened. I know the other side does not want to recognize it. I am so frustrated, trying to understand why they would ignore that the General Accounting Office estimates that 37 percent of medical savings account buyers previously had no coverage whatsoever, and 82 percent of the American public rate the high cost of medical health care coverage their chief concern. Medical savings accounts meet that concern. Our bill has that in it. That is not driving people out of the system. That is reaching out, bringing people into the system, into the system for their Pap smears, into the system for their pelvic exams, into the system for early detection of cancer. There is the difference, driving people out or encouraging people to come in, making health care more affordable. 
   A medical savings account gives you 100-percent coverage, 100 percent of doctors to choose from. My Democratic colleagues have gone to great lengths to say our bill does not generate direct access to specialists; that our bill does not generate direct access to OB/GYNs; that we do not guarantee access to pediatricians; that we do not let patients choose their doctors; that we do not ensure that medical decisions will be made by a patient and that patient's doctor. They could not be more wrong. 
   If you own a medical savings account and you own insurance, you choose your own doctor, always. If you feel you need a specialist, then you go to the specialist. If you need direct access to an OB/GYN, you have it. If you need direct access to a pediatrician, nobody is sitting there as the gatekeeper they like to talk about; you are the person in power. You have the direct access. 
   Once again, for mandatory referral, you are in control of your destiny and the destiny that comes in cooperation with your primary care physician. That is what we are talking about, 
   about personalizing health care and taking the Federal Government out of it. That is why Republicans have always supported MSAs. We are not saying everybody ought to have them. We are simply saying open up the option. Make it available as a matter of choice so you can choose between what you can afford and what has now become even more affordable. So we are not thrusting the Federal bureaucracy on the system and shoving up the cost by every legitimate estimator's estimation. We are, in fact, potentially driving those costs down. 
   A program that decreases the number of uninsured and gives patients direct access to their doctors is what this Senate ought to be about. If my Democrat colleagues truly want Americans to have affordable medical care that patients control, they should be clamoring for a medical savings account. 
   How can my colleagues stand up for a patient's right to greater access to cancer treatment when they are supporting a bill that leaves millions without health care coverage? I quoted the statistics, and they are very easy to extrapolate out of those figures. We are talking about hundreds of thousands fewer exams for potential cancer under what is now being proposed. 
   The answer is they really have not thought their bill through. They do not think the marketplace works, that somehow you can reform it and change it and control it by simply enacting a Federal regulation. Will costs not go up? We know they will go up. We know every time we have tampered with health care for the better benefit or for the less, we have had the direct impact on the marketplace that has driven health care costs up. Every time it is driven up, it is driven beyond the point of access by some Americans. 
   Why would they do this? I am not sure why they do this. I guess I could quote President Clinton at the defeat of health care last time, when he said:  
   Now what I tried before won't work, maybe we can do it another way. That's what we've tried to do, a step at a time, until eventually we finish this.  
   I think that is the essence of what the Kennedy bill does, one step at a time, toward a greater sense of Federal control driving the cost up so the American consumer says, OK, give me  Federal health care; I can't afford it any other way.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today represents a significant modification of S. 1253, which I introduced in the last Congress. This effort represents a large body of work--both oversight and legislative--to modernize the laws governing our stewardship over federally-owned, multiple-use lands. 
   For those of you who have just tuned in, this bill is the result of 15 oversight hearings that my Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management held during the 104th Congress. These hearings involved over 200 witnesses,  representing all points of view, and reviewing all aspects of the management of the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands. The overwhelming conclusion from all of these witnesses--developers and environmentalists alike, public and private sector employees alike--was that the statutes governing federal land management--the 1976 Federal Land and Policy Management Act and the 1976 National Forest Management Act--are antiquated, and in need of updating. These statutes were passed by Congress in the mid-1970s to help solve land management problems. Today, they are a large part of the problem. 
   I look at laws as ``tools'' for use by professional land managers and resource scientists that help establish priorities and make management decisions. These two tools are as antiquated as the slide-rule and computer punch cards that were the tools used by land managers at the time that these statutes were passed. 
   As a consequence of this oversight review during the 104th Congress, and subsequent oversight hearings since, I drafted S. 1253 and circulated it at the outset of the 105th Congress. That draft, and the subsequently-introduced bill were, in turn, the subject of six informal workshops and another eight formal, legislative hearings to review the concepts embodied in both the first draft and the introduced version of S. 1253. The ideas that emanated from the oversight hearings were modified to reflect the suggestions of witnesses, and in recognition of how resource management problems have subsequently evolved. 
   Also, during the course of the last eighteen months, we have held additional hearings, reviewed subsequent correspondence, and enjoyed additional dialogue about how to best modify the 1976 statutes. For instance, we held one hearing where all four of the former Chiefs of the Forest Service and one former Bureau of Land Management Director shared their views about the current state of federal land management, and where legislative action could assist their successors in discharging the public trust more effectively. 
   During this time period there has been at least one seminal decision from the Supreme Court. 
    In Ohio Forestry Association versus Glickman, the Supreme Court has, in my view, significantly devalued the importance of the land management planning process authorized under the National Land Management Act, and probably FLPMA as well. In that decision, the Court denied standing to challenge resource management plans, essentially on the basis that no real decisions are made. While properly decided on the basis of existing law, I believe that decision produced the wrong result insofar as effective resource planning is concerned. The bill I am introducing today would explicitly set a new course, reversing the effect of this decision in order to make resource management plans more meaningful documents. In various other ways of a less significant nature, the bill I am introducing today also reflects the product of court decisions that have been rendered during the period that we have been reviewing these issues. 
   The bill that I am introducing today is also the direct result of four important pieces of information. Let me describe each of these in turn. 
   First, we held an extraordinary pair of hearings with the President of the Wilderness Society as the sole witness. These hearings were significant in the sense that we were not limited to the usual, five-to-ten minute exchange to communicate with one another. Instead, we actually discussed the Wilderness Society's concerns and views about National Forest management for several hours. 
   Second and equally important was the assistance provided by the Society of American Foresters. The Society laudably took on the task of appointing a working group of resource scientists and professionals to review the current state of federal land management and the proposals that we made in the last Congress, and to offer suggestions for improvement. I commend their report as an authoritative guide to needed changes in the current system. Most notably, the Society is emphatic, as am I, that many, if not most, of the problems that plague federal land management today can be resolved only through a cooperative effort between the Administration and Congress to produce a revised legislative charter for the land managing agencies. 
   Third, we were in many important respects guided by Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman's, Committee of Scientists Report, also issued earlier this year. I commend this report to the attention of Senators as well. In many areas, we find ourselves in agreement with the Committee of Scientists, particularly with regard to defining a new mission for the Forest Service. We would submit that this is needed for the Bureau of Land Management as well--even though that was beyond the Committee's charter. One area where the Committee's views are unclear is whether or not these improvements can be made exclusively through the rule-making process. The Committee seems to be of two minds about this. It is clear to us that the kinds of changes the Committee seeks cannot be accomplished through regulation. They must involve fundamental statutory changes to the agencies' missions. Any other path is, in our view, doomed to failure. 
   Finally, we were informed at the time of the Administration's budget submission that the Administration would be sending forward a series of seven important legislative proposals governing federal land management. We were pleased that the Administration had at last come to the conclusion that legislative changes are necessary. This has been a source of intense dialogue 
   between myself, Secretary Glickman, Undersecretary Lyons, and others in the Administration for more than two years. Given this recognition on their part, we felt duty-bound to wait for these proposals before going forward. In the bill I am introducing today, we have adopted, in pertinent part, five of the Administration's seven legislative proposals. A sixth proposal is the subject of a separate piece of legislation that was introduced in the House yesterday (HR 2389). I am working on a companion Senate bill to introduce shortly. Thus, I found the Administration's proposals something that I could agree with, and want to be responsive to. 
   So, my work product is the result of a number of sources of information. It has taken at least six months longer to produce than I anticipated it would, but in the interest of: (1) securing the advice of Secretary Glickman's Committee of Scientists; (2) evaluating the Society of American Foresters' report; and (3) being responsive to the Administration's legislative proposals, I believe the wait was worthwhile. 
   We will now move forward with additional hearings on this proposal confident that we are on the correct path to improve the quality of federal land management and, through a variety of means, increase public support for the future management of our federal forest lands. 
   We invite both the Administration and Members on both sides of the aisle to join us in this effort. We move forward knowing that this proposal, like any other, is a working draft that will by necessity change, probably significantly, as we move forward. 
   However, we also move forward knowing that legislative change in this area is both inevitable and vital. It is clear to me that this area of public discourse vitally needs a vibrant legislative debate and a new legislative charter so that our federal land managers can be provided with tools a little more modern than the slide-rule and mainframe computer punch cards.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Wyoming who has expressed a frustration that I think many of us in the Senate hold and that a growing number of Americans hold as to the current tactic being used by Democrats to block an ag appropriations bill or to force an issue that is separate and apart from it. 
   We do have a responsibility in the Senate and in the Congress, and that is to pass 13 appropriations bills on an annual basis to fund the workings of our Government. And the one before us today is agriculture. 
   There is some $60 billion to be spent in many of the areas outlined by the Senator from Wyoming. They are critical to all our States, not just the agricultural community but for those people who are less fortunate, for their very nutrition--nutrition for women, infants and children, the Food Stamp Program, certainly the School Lunch Program. All of those programs are embodied in this appropriations bill. A tactic to push what now rapidly appears to be a raw political point for the purpose of upcoming campaigns against the normal and necessary workings of our Government is a bit frustrating to me. 
   I have made that assumption at this moment. Let's assume that I am wrong, that clearly the other side is dedicated to a concern on the part of the average citizen as it relates to his or her health care, and in being so concerned they have offered a Kennedy bill that some call a Patients' Bill of Rights. If I take it at face value, it is a bit of a frustration, and in the next few moments let me express that. 
   Chairman PATRICK KENNEDY in the House, a Democrat, of the Congressional Campaign Committee, was recently quoted and the national media is saying that ``we have written off rural areas.'' He means that Democrats politically have written off rural areas. 
   Is it by coincidence the Senator from Massachusetts chooses the ag bill on which to place his political agenda? There seems to be a unique coincidence that PATRICK KENNEDY, Congressman KENNEDY on the other side, says, ``We have written off rural areas,'' and Senator KENNEDY on this side says, ``I'm going to attach it to the ag approps bill; I'll bring the ag bill down if I can't have my political agenda for a Patients' Bill of Rights.'' 
   Let me look at the substance of what may be offered today, because it is my understanding that there may be an attempt, in an amendment, to offer a portion of the Kennedy health care mandates. 
   What would that do? That talks about what we now call medical necessities. It is a portion of the bill that I think offers the illusion of the patients being in control, by requiring health care plans and employers to pay for whatever care a physician recommends--without question. If that is what the physician recommends, without peer review or any observation of the total situation, it is paid for. 
   If that were the case, in today's medical climate, here is the reaction of the Barnitz Group. Who are they? They are an economic consulting firm that deals with health care and health care costs. They evaluate them. They make judgments as to how a given policy would affect the payment for health care for the individual. 
   Here is what they suggest this particular portion of the Kennedy bill would do. It could cost nearly $60 a year per covered household, per insured household. It could cost employers $180 a year per covered employee. In other words, it shoves the cost of health care up. Arguably, it might improve health care--I cannot debate that--by requiring that anything a doctor suggests gets funded. But it would cost more, or at least that is the observation. 
   In that cost--this is a marketplace we are dealing with out here--it could result in the loss of 191,000 jobs or it could result in the cancellation of coverage for 1.4 million Americans. That is a provision in an amendment that might be offered this afternoon. 
   Isn't it unique--I made some of this argument yesterday--that as we deal with ag appropriations, at a time when the chairman of the National Democratic Campaign Committee says, We write the rural areas off, that the Senator from Massachusetts would be offering a bill that would dramatically impact the uninsured by forcing more to be uninsured. 
   It just so happens that a very large number of the uninsured live in rural America. It just so happens, according to the Employees Benefit Research Institute, nearly half, or 43 percent, of all workers in agriculture, in forestry, and in the fishing sector of our economy have no health insurance. In other words, they have to provide for themselves. Now we are suggesting that we will drive the cost of insurance up for those who are uninsured instead of doing things that bring the cost of that insurance down so that the uninsured can find insurance more affordable. 
   Is this a coincidence or is there a relationship? I am not sure. But there is one thing that is for sure: The other side has decided to target ag appropriations with a bill that they think is extremely valuable politically. It is also an issue that we have come together on to say that there are some real needs and we are willing to address those needs in a bipartisan and timely fashion.  
   But let us allow the work of the Congress to go forward in the appropriations area. We will deal with health care, as we should deal with health care, but we cannot deal with it by driving people from it, creating a greater dependency on government programs, as inevitably will happen, as shown by every research institute that has looked at the Kennedy bill. 
   The Kennedy bill, without question, shoves possibly 2 
   million people out of insurance; I will be conservative and say at least 1 million, or 1.4 million by conservative estimates. 
   So let us get on with appropriating money for women, infants, and children for their nutritional needs, for the school lunch program, for food stamps, for ag research, for those things that are important to rural America. 
   I do not care if Congressman KENNEDY on the House side has written off rural America. This Senator will not write it off. We will pass an ag approps bill. We could do it today. We could finalize it this week and send a very important message to American agriculture that your work and your interests are important to us; that we will deal with you on a timely basis; that we will respond to your needs as best we can; and we will say to those less fortunate, we will feed you, and we will not use it as a political issue. We will do it in a right and responsible and timely way. 
   I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can agree with that. It is what they ought to be agreeing with. There is enough politics to go around. Let's take politics out of the ag bill. They put it in with the injection of the Patients' Bill of Rights. They now have the opportunity to remove it. 
   Our leaders have been negotiating for some time to establish a time certain so we can handle this issue and all sides can debate its fairness, its equity, or its lack thereof. We will have a lot more detail. But obstructionist attitudes, blocking the activity of the Senate, gain very few of us anything. And the American public scratches its head and says: What are they doing back there? Why can't they do the work of the people? Pass the ag appropriations bill. Deal with health care in a timely fashion. Move the other appropriations bills and complete the work of Government. 
   That is what the American people expect of us. That is what they should expect of us. I hope the other side will ultimately agree with that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Very briefly, I was a bit surprised last week when the Senator came to the floor and offered the Patients' Bill of Rights to the ag bill, because I know of his commitment to agriculture. I know of our joint belief about the farm crisis and the reality of it. 
   What this Senate has not done yet with the Department of Agriculture is shape the size and the scope of the farm crisis. We agree that crisis exists. You and I agree that it exists. The Presiding Officer comes from a farm State. We agree it exists. But we don't know the magnitude of it yet. 
   We have asked the President and the Secretary of Agriculture to engage with us. That is why it is not attached to this appropriations bill. We are not going to start legislating into a vacuum. We have to legislate because we are dealing with billions of dollars. And the Senator is right about farmers' and ranchers' incomes. That has to be done accurately. 
   But I am a bit confused. Being the farm State Senator that he is, he seems to be offering the Patients' Bill of Rights to this ag approps bill.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the last several days this Senate has been engaged in a fascinating exercise. I say that because last Thursday evening before I left the Senate I was approached by an individual in the media, a press person on Capitol Hill, who said: I understand the Democrats are about to slow the process down. 
   I said: What do you mean?  
   They think the Republican Senate is on a roll, you have accomplished a good many things this week, and they are about to slow you down.  
   I said: What is the strategy here? 
   That person said: We think they are going to offer the Patients' Bill of Rights to the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   Of course, we now know that is exactly what happened. Their tactic is to slow the process down. I am not sure why. Obviously, they are going to get ample opportunity to make their statements and to have their votes on the issue of a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Whether Democrat or a Republican, we can mutually agree that there is a very real problem in the health care community of our country specific to Americans and health care coverage. I am not sure we get there by punching American farmers in the face, or by acting as if they are of little to no importance and placing other national issues ahead of them. 
   That is what has happened. I am amazed some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle from dominant agricultural States and who have oftentimes led the agricultural debate on the floor would use these tactics to move their national agenda well beyond agriculture. 
   What is important is that we deal with the ag 
   appropriations bill, that we deal with it in a timely fashion to address those concerns of the American agricultural community within the policies of our government but also recognize we have a problem in the agriculture community today. We have turned to the Secretary of Agriculture and to the President to work with us to identify and shape that issue; we will come back with the necessary vehicle to address it beyond the current appropriations bill. 
   We are waiting for their response. 
   Agriculture issues have never been partisan. They shouldn't be partisan. I am amazed my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have used this dilatory tactic that all but ``partisanizes'' an agriculture appropriations bill, almost saying it doesn't count; our political agenda is more important than the policies of the government handled in an appropriate and timely fashion. 
   Our leaders are negotiating at this moment to determine the shape of the debate over a Patients' Bill of Rights. I hope they are able to accomplish that. The clock ticks. American agriculture watches and says, there goes that Congress again, playing politics with a very important issue for our country. 
   I will be blunt and say, there goes the Democrat side of this body playing politics with a very important appropriations bill that I hope we can get to. 
   I see Senator FEINGOLD on the floor. Our staffs have been working together on a very critical area of this bill, as I have been working with the Presiding Officer, to make sure that we shape the agriculture appropriations bill and deal with dairy policy in a responsible fashion. 
   I come to the floor to associate patients' rights and health care with an agriculture policy. Is that possible to do? Well, it is. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have attempted to do that. I hope my colleagues will listen as I shape this issue. There is a very important connection. 
   It will not be debated on the agriculture appropriations bill, but we all know that American agriculture--farmers and those who work for farmers--is within the sector of about 43 percent of all workers in America who are not working for an industry that insures them. As a result, they must provide for themselves. They must self-insure and provide for their individual workers within their farms or ranches. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to bring to the floor--and I trust their sincerity in wanting it to become law--will very much change the dynamics of the self-insured in this country. They do so in a very unique way. The average family premium in the individual self-insured market--I am talking about American farm families --is about $6,585 today. That is what it costs for them to insure themselves. Under the Democrat Kennedy bill, they are going to pay at least another $316. 
   Figure this one out: As my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about the worst depression in farm country in its history, with depression-era prices for commodities, in  the same breath they stop the agriculture appropriations bill and say: Hey, farm family, on our Patients' Bill of Rights, because we are about to increase your medical costs by an average of $316 a year, that is money you don't have, but we will force you to do it anyway. Your premiums will go up by the nature of the bill we want to fashion. 
   Some have stated this bill will cause over 2 million Americans to lose their health care insurance. This chart demonstrates a problem that all Members are sensitive to but a problem that we don't want to cause to be worse. 
   A phrase that has been used on this floor in a variety of debates in the last couple of months is ``unintended consequences.'' If we pass the Kennedy health care Patients' Bill of Rights, there is a known consequence. You can't call it ``unintended.'' 
   By conservative estimates it would add one million uninsured Americans to the health rolls. That is the conservative estimate. I said 2 million a moment ago. That is the liberal estimate. It is somewhere in that arena. The other side knows that America's farmers and farm families will have to pay $300 to $400 more per year in health care premiums because they are self-insured. 
   That is the nexus with the farm bill and the agriculture appropriations bill in its strange and relatively obscure way. But it is real. I hope our leaders can be successful in shaping the debate around the Patients' Bill of Rights that says we will have that debate, here is the time line, and here are the amendments that can be offered. 
   It is going to be up or down. We will all have our chance to make our points, but let's not play the very dangerous game of tacking it onto any bill that comes along that stops us from moving the appropriation bills in a timely fashion. We will debate in a thorough nature why their legislation creates a potential pool of between 1 to 2 million Americans who will become uninsured because of an increase in premiums. 
   On the other side of the equation is the Patients' Bill of Rights crafted by the Republican majority in the Senate. We go right to farm families. We say to farm families, we are going to give you a positive option in your self-insurance, and that is, of course, to create a medical savings account. 
   In States made up of individual farms--Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Iowa--already the meager efforts in creating medical savings accounts we have offered in past law have rapidly increased the coverage for health care at the farm level. 
   So if we want to create a true nexus between an agriculture bill and a Patient's Bill of Rights, it is the Republican version that says let's expand medical savings accounts, let's give small businesspeople, farmers, ranchers, the option of being able to self-insure in a way that will cost them less money and have insurance to deal with, of course, the catastrophic concerns in health care that we would want to talk about. 
   The reason I have always been a supporter of medical savings accounts is that it really fits the profile of my State. Farmers, ranchers, loggers, miners--small businesspeople make up a dominant proportion of the population of my State. Increasingly, many of them would become uninsured if the Democratic version, the Kennedy bill, were to pass this Congress and become law. The unintended, or maybe the intended, consequence would be to push these people out of private health care insurance and therefore have them come to their Government begging for some kind of health care insurance. 
   Why should we set up an environment in which we force people to come to the Government for their health care instead of creating an environment, a positive environment, that says we will reward you for insuring yourself by creating for you the tools of self-insurance and therefore create also a tax environment we want, where today health care premiums for the self-employed are fully deductible, as they are for big businesses which offer health care plans to their employees. 
   There is a strange, unique, and somewhat curious nexus between Democrats blocking an agriculture appropriations bill coming to the floor and the politics of the Kennedy bill on health care. It is that they would cause even greater problems in the farm community by raising the premiums, by forcing certain costs to go into health care coverage today. Our Patients' Bill of Rights would go in a totally opposite direction, creating an environment in which people could become more self-insured at less money, at a time in American agriculture when it is estimated the average income of the American farmer, having dropped 15 percent last year, could drop as much as 25 to 30 percent this year, with commodity prices at near Depression-era levels. 
   We need to pass the agriculture appropriations bill. We will then work with the Department of Agriculture and the Clinton administration to examine the needs, as harvest goes forward, to assure we do address the American farmers' plight, as we did effectively last year. But it should be done in the context of agriculture appropriations and a potential supplemental, if necessary, to deal with that. It does not fit, nor should it be associated with, a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I hope the end result today is to clear the track, provide a designated period of time for us to debate the Kennedy bill and a true Patients' Bill of Rights, as has been offered by the Republican majority here in the Senate, and then to allow us to move later today, this evening, and on tomorrow, to finish the agriculture appropriations bill and get on with the debate on that critical issue. 
   American agriculture is watching. I hope they write my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and say: Cut the politics. Get on with the business of good farm policy. Do not use us as your lever. 
   I hope that message is getting through to my colleagues on the other side. Let us deal with agriculture in the appropriate fashion. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the leader for yielding. 
   This is not an issue about steel. This is an issue about trade. The United States will be hosting the World Trade Organization's ministerial meeting in Seattle later this year. If this Senate voted out a quota bill at a time when we were expecting to engage the rest of the world in further discussion about knocking down trade barriers to give agriculture and other trade entities greater opportunity in the world market, this Senate and this Government would be sending the wrong message. 
   I am not going to argue with the Senator from Pennsylvania. There is no question the steel industry has been hurt. Agriculture is being hurt as we speak, but we do not close our borders and turn our lights out. We work to build a stronger and more fair trade organization around the world. 
   Furthermore, this act would violate our international obligations under the World Trade Organization and General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. By closing the U.S. Steel market, we would encourage other countries to follow our lead and undermine the system that the United States has worked so hard to establish. If we are to expect other countries to honor their obligations under these agreements, we must do the same. 
   Mr. President, raising barriers against steel imports will only provide the steel industry temporary benefits while the American consumers suffer long-term consequences. Products that are made from steel, such as cars, homes, and appliances, will cost more to produce and will become more expensive to consumers. For example, large U.S. companies, such as Cargill and Hewlett Packard, that have substantial business in Idaho would be adversely affected. This situation will cause American consumers to purchase less and put millions of American jobs at risk. These consequences far exceed the risks the steel industry is facing. 
   I yield the time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about a resolution related to Kosovo which was brought before the Senate late last Thursday evening and adopted by unanimous consent. 
   This concurrent resolution commends the President and the Armed Forces for the ``success'' of Operation Allied Force. I had reservations in supporting this resolution, but ultimately decided to do so because it provided an opportunity to honor the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line for this dangerous cause. 
   However, to term this operation a success, either now or in the foreseeable future, is an unconscionable stretch of the truth, at best. This mission represented a complete failure of the Clinton administration's foreign policy. This resolution also implies that the book has been closed on Kosovo, and peace will reign in the Balkans. I do not think it is necessary to remind the Senate of the bloody and tumultuous history of the region, or  the uncertainty of the future. And it certainly is not appropriate to mislabel this foreign policy mishap as a success. 
   The failure of the administration's policy was apparent from the negotiations at Rambouillet. It was one-sided from the beginning and Secretary Albright made no secret where the administration's loyalties lay: ``If the Serbs are the cause of the breakdown, we're going to go forward with the NATO decision to carry out air strikes,'' she threatened. It was NATO's way, or no way. It is little wonder an agreement was not reached. The arrangement provided no preservation of national sovereignty for Yugoslavia. NATO troops would have been authorized ``free and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access throughout the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia].'' There was also no guarantee, and indeed evidence to the contrary, that Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity would remain intact after NATO troops rolled into the country. The United States took sides in the negotiations, and then wondered why the Serbs refused to sign the proposed agreement. 
   Equally harmful to the peace process was the lack of historical understanding with which the administration engaged in the negotiations. Kosovo is the site of key historical and religious monuments for the Serbs. However, the President and Secretary failed to recognize this fundamental fact. It was both arrogance and shortsightedness which allowed the administration to proceed on this flawed course to disaster. I do not claim to be a scholar of the region myself; however, I am not arrogant enough to believe one can solve centuries-old conflicts with three nights of an air campaign, as the administration originally anticipated. 
   The administration ``policy'' was nothing more than a policy du jour. At first, the goal of the air strikes was to bring Milosevic to the negotiating table. Next, the strikes were to harm Serb military might. Then strikes were to force a complete Serb withdrawal from Kosovo. Regardless of what the strikes were supposed to do, they were never part of a methodical, strategic plan. Instead, they were a knee-jerk reaction to daily events. 
   Perhaps most disconcerting is the potential damage the operation may have inflicted on the NATO alliance. This mission marked the first time in the 50 years of the alliance's history that it was involved in an operation that had nothing to do with defending the territorial integrity of one of its members. The operation should be proof positive about the dangers of a ``new strategic concept'' that would expand NATO's missions beyond territorial self-defense to peacekeeping arenas outside its borders. NATO maintains a hefty burden in protecting members from an unstable Russian and Korean Peninsula, and the growing proliferation threat around the world without the burden of regional peace-keeping, or other humanitarian missions which have nothing to do with preserving the territorial integrity of members. 
   I point out these facts not to lessen the impact of the human tragedy that occurred in Yugoslavia before the bombing began, or to lessen the responsibility of Milosevic's role in that tragedy. However, I feel compelled to raise this issue in the Senate today because it is premature to hail the Kosovo agreement as a success. Today, the Balkans are far less stable than when the operation began on march 24. The lesson to be learned from this operation should not be that good intentions are good reasons for foreign policy whims, particularly when those whims risk the lives of our men and women in uniform. 
   The brave men and women of the Armed Forces deserve the praise and thanks of a grateful nation for serving with distinction and honor. I wholeheartedly join the Senate in thanking the members of the Armed Forces who served in the campaign in the Balkans. However, I am not ready to endorse this ill-conceived mission as a victory for the United States or NATO. Instead, this mission ought to go down in the history books as a lesson in what foreign policy blunders should be avoided in the future. 
   To recover from this blunder, the President must provide a comprehensive post-war plan for the region. Bringing true peace to Kosovo will depend on the development of a stable balance of power on the ground. Whatever course of action is pursued by the administration, it must be one that ultimately would help the United States and its NATO allies to reduce their military commitments in the Balkans, and avoid entangling the United States and the Alliance in another Kosovo in the future.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my colleague from New Mexico, the bill manager, regarding the need to change the name of one of the programs in the Department of Energy's appropriations. Within the Energy Supply account, there is an account called ``Nuclear Energy.'' Within the nuclear energy account, there is a program called ``Termination Costs.'' 
   For some time, the name ``Termination Costs'' has caused considerable confusion. In fact, in the past the Department of Energy has submitted its budget request for this program using a different name. They called it the ``Facilities'' program and the Senate last year even appropriated funding using  the name ``Facilities'' but the name change was dropped in conference. 
   The name ``Termination Costs'' is not an accurate depiction of the activities occurring under this program. I will quote from the Department of Energy's fiscal year 2000 budget request. The following items are listed as the program mission for the Termination Costs Program. (1) Ensuring the cost-effective, environmentally-compliant operation of Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology sites and facilities; (2) Maintaining the physical and technical infrastructure necessary to support research and technology development by U.S. and overseas researchers; (3) Demonstrating the acceptability of electrometallurgical technology for preparing DOE spent nuclear fuel for ultimate disposal; and (4) Placing unneeded facilities in industrially safe and environmentally compliant conditions for low-cost, long-term surveillance. 
   With the possible exception of the last item, No. 4, these important mission priorities do not fit the heading of ``termination.'' 
   Again, quoting from the Department of Energy's budget submittal, the stated program goal for the Termination Costs Program is, ``To contribute to the nation's nuclear science and technology infrastructure through the development of innovative technologies for spent fuel storage and disposal and the effective management of active and surplus nuclear research facilities.'' I think this is an enduring mission for DOE and therefore the moniker ``Termination Costs'' is misleading.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to explain my amendment to S. 1186, a bill making appropriations for certain Department of Energy programs. Among these programs is the radioactive waste management program which is responsible for developing a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, in Nevada. 
   This repository will, if successfully completed, one day hold the spent nuclear fuel from all of this country's commercial nuclear power plants, in addition to defense high-level radioactive waste left-over from the development of nuclear weapons. 
   It has been 12 years since passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1987, and I believe the Department of Energy's Yucca Mountain program is in serious trouble. In 1983, the Department of Energy signed contracts with every one of this country's nuclear power generators saying that the government would start taking their spent fuel for disposal in January of 1998. 
   Because of the Government's failure to meet that deadline, a number of utility companies, in conjunction with many State governments, are suing the Federal Government for failure to fulfill its contractual commitments. Many of these utilities are being forced, because of the Government's failure, to construct additional storage capacity at their sites. Many of these companies are seeking monetary damages from the Government. 
   Inheriting this situation from his predecessors at the Department of Energy, Secretary Richardson laid a proposal before the nuclear utilities last year. Secretary Richardson told the utilities that if they would agree to drop all future claims against the government, the Department of Energy would be willing to pay the utilities for their on site storage costs and that DOE would ``take title''--meaning DOE would take over ownership and all liability--for the spent nuclear fuel and store it at the nuclear power plants for an indefinite period of time. 
   It is safe to say--since this administration opposes my interim storage legislation--that we can expect spent nuclear fuel under their scenario to be stored at reactors until at least the year 2015, because that is when the repository is expected to open--at the earliest. 
   The amendment I offer today speaks to the heart of this issue. To be blunt, I think it is irresponsible to create some 80 new federal interim storage sites for spent fuel scattered around this country. And I think the Administration compounds their neglect of this crisis by depleting the funds collected for development of the permanent solution--the Nuclear Waste Fund, created by law in 1982--by dispersing these funds back out to the same utilities who paid them in the first place, only now they are being used as a ``band-aid'' to pay to store fuel at reactors. 
   Very simply put, my amendment prohibits the Department of Energy from using funds appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund for the purpose of settling lawsuits or paying judgments arising out of the failure of the federal government to accept spent nuclear fuel from commercial utilities. 
   Money in the Nuclear Waste Fund has been collected to pay for a permanent solution to our nuclear waste problem. Mr. President, I don't think we should be squandering these funds on band-aid schemes. My amendment prohibits this from happening.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, during the last 2 weeks, we have been hearing from our colleagues concerned about the lamb industry in the United States and the Section 201 trade action filed by them. I would like to join them in commenting on the situation and dispel some myths and confusion surrounding the Section 201 trade action filed by a coalition representing the domestic lamb industry. 
   The case now lies before the President, and I urge him to impose strong, effective restrictions that will curb the devastating surge of imports that has swamped the domestic lamb market and now threatens to drown an entire industry. 
   Some worry the nations of Australia and New Zealand may retaliate against the United States if we take action to protect our domestic industries. They won't because they can't--not for at least three years. That is because of the laws that govern the Section 201 case--laws that, let me be clear about this, are and have been a part of every single trade treaty this nation has signed since the Trade Act of 1974. That means all signatories to GATT also signed onto the Section 201 provisions. 
   Importers say they have not done anything unfair. The U.S. lamb industry never said they had. Frankly, the Section 201 rules don't pertain to unfair trading. It is never alleged, never argued, never considered. The only things that matter in a Section 201 case are whether imports have risen drastically over the recent time period. 
   There is also the question of harm. A section 201 case is a lot tougher to prove than dumping, or subsidies, or yes, unfair trading. The domestic industry is required to prove that imports are a ``substantial cause'' of significant injury or threat of significant injury. 
   You will hear arguments from importers about how their actions aren't to blame. About how their price undercutting, their deliberate decision to swamp the market with cheap, imported product, in the face of ample notice of the harm being done, isn't to blame for the financial ruin now snaking its way through the domestic lamb industry. 
   The International Trade Commission heard those arguments. They heard all about the Wool Act, about the coyotes, about grazing fees and organization. They heard it all, and those six Commissioners rejected those arguments. They rejected them when the Commission unanimously ruled that imports threaten the domestic lamb industry with irreparable harm. After that ruling, those arguments by importers are not a factor in this case. 
   You will also hear talk of cooperation. Of how the New Zealand and Australian industries want to work with the domestic industry. Let me ask you, why are we hearing about cooperation now? Where was the importers' cooperation when fourth-generation ranches faced bankruptcy? When processors were losing accounts left and right to cheap imports? When the leaders of the domestic industry publicly announced their intention to file the Section 201 trade case? 
   Nowhere, is the answer. As the domestic industry reeled under the unrelenting wave of cheap, imported lamb, the importers have been busy breaking records. Month after month in 1998, the imports flooded the domestic market, shattering records. When it ended, a record-making 70.2 million pounds of imported lamb had saturated the American market. But the importers are not finished yet. Even as the ITC conducted hearings, the level of imports were rising--in the first three months of 1999 alone, imports are up nine percent over 1998 levels, and an astonishing 34 percent above 1997 levels. If this pace keeps up, the record-making import levels of 1998 will be shattered, as will domestic sheep industry. 
   I urge the President to curb this devastating surge of cheap imports. The domestic industry won a fairly fought legal case governed by laws embedded in this nation's trade treaties. To do anything less than ordering strong, effective trade restrictions would signal to industries in the United States and abroad that our laws will not be enforced. 
   As I said before, the case now lies before the President. I urge him to act on the unanimous recommendation by the International Trade Commission for four full years of trade restrictions. This follows ITC's unanimous conclusion that the domestic lamb industry is seriously threatened by the deluge of imports that has swamped the U.S. marketplace and now absorbs one-third of all American lamb consumption. 
   The six Commissioners were unanimous in their recommendation for trade restriction, but offered three options on how it should be applied. The ITC's options range from a straight quota to a straight tariff to a tariff-rate quota. 
   The importers have already identified the one ITC recommendation which would do nothing to stop their already disastrous effect on the marketplace. A report of an interview with Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer identified the ITC's tariff-rate quota as likely to have ``minimal effect on present Australian exports.'' 
   Minimal effect. Esteemed colleagues, we did not create the 201 provision in our trade laws to have ``minimal effect.'' We did not create a provision that is tougher to prove that dumping, than unfair trading. We created the 201 provision as a just way for a domestic industry that has been injured or threatened by imports to turn to its government for help. 
   The ITC offered three recommendations. The U.S. lamb industry has studied those recommendations and found the ``common ground'' among them. 
   The industry needs strong, effective relief. Here is what they are asking for: 
   A two-tier, four year tariff rate quota program with tariffs both below and above a set level of imports. In year one, tariffs would be 22 percent on lamb meat imports up to 52 million pounds, with a 42 percent tariff on imported lamb beyond the 52 million pound mark. 
   Year two calls for a 20 percent tariff up to 56 million pounds, and a 37.5 percent tariff above the 56 million. 
   Year three involves a 15 percent tariff up to 61 million pounds and a 30 percent tariff above the 61 million pounds. 
   Year four, the final year, calls for a 10 percent below-quota tariff up to 70 million pounds and an above quota tariff 20 percent above the 70 million pounds. 
   I join my colleagues in urging the President to order this request into action. It provides desperately needed, strong, effective relief to both curb this unprecedented, record-breaking, surge of imports and the devastating price undercutting that accompanies it. 
   This case is important for this nation's agriculture community. It's being watched throughout our rural towns, farms and ranches. If the President does not implement an effective remedy for the lamb industry, which has followed our laws and proved its case, an unmistakable signal would be sent to agriculture and rural interests throughout the United States.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this morning we stand on the floor of the Senate in the wake of another shooting at a high school in America. My colleague from New York has just said in rather plaintive but appropriate terms: What's wrong in America? 
   We know there is something desperately wrong. Yes, we struggle with this problem here. I do not question the sincerity of anyone who comes to the floor today to debate this issue. But it is very important for some of us to stand and make as clear as we possibly can the differences between the amendments about which we are talking. 
   The reason there are an alleged 13 loopholes in the Craig-Hatch amendment is because there are 13 paragraphs, and the other side would suggest the whole thing is a loophole. That is simply not true--it has never been true--because, as the Senator from Oregon says, we are attempting to craft a very fine but important constitutional line between law-abiding citizens and their right to own guns unfettered by a Federal Government and the criminal who will seek and find a gun anywhere he or she wants and, of course, the disaffected youth of America who in some way find it necessary to express their frustrations or their sicknesses with the use of a firearm. 
   What the other side has not said, but what they whisper loudly, is: The second amendment is a loophole. Let's wink and nod at it and then try to close it up. 
   I cannot do that. I really do believe in our Constitution and I do believe that law-abiding citizens have rights. I must tell you, the other side is winking and nodding and saying: Oh, yes, they have rights, but we will close all of the doors up to that right and see if you can find the key to get through. 
   So we came to the floor a week ago and began to strike a balance, recognizing that those constitutional rights must stand supreme for the law-abiding citizen, because the law-abiding citizen, in owning a gun under that right, accepts the responsibility of that gun. 
   The Senator from New York is right; all he wants to do will not stop the criminal from getting a gun, because it never has. It is law enforcement that stops the criminal. It is the handcuff provision of this bill that says to Janet Reno: Put your cops on the street and arrest the criminal who uses the gun. Janet Reno, your record of law enforcement is dismal. You have winked and nodded at the law. And now it is time you wide-eyedly move to the streets and arrest the criminal who uses the gun. 
   That is what the juvenile crime bill says. It says it loudly. It says it very clearly. Let's not wink and nod at our Constitution. Let's go at the criminal element of our society. Let's not create the kind of provision that the Lautenberg amendment does. It is not 72 hours; it is the old 3-day waiting period. Even that side said, once we get instant check, that goes away. That is what the law said. Now they want it back, even though we tried to honor our legal citizens by providing an instant check system. 
   That is what the Congress has said for a decade: We will fund it. We will implement it. And we will demand that it be used. The law-abiding citizens, the gun owners of America, in gun-owning America, say: We agree. There is no argument there. 
   So as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee worked with his committee and here on the floor to craft a juvenile crime bill, it is so tragic that the other side tried to make it a gun control bill only. 
   Let's see what we did. We put juvenile Brady in the bill. We said to violent juveniles: You lose all of your constitutional rights when you act violently as a juvenile felon. 
   We have gone after gangs.

   Mr. CRAIG. We have gone after gangs. We have gone after the juvenile offender. We have built in youth protection. We are concerned about gun safety. 
   This Senate has put in gun laws. The Senator from Vermont said: OK, if you don't believe CRAIG and HATCH, let's say it one more time for the record: People who sell guns at gun shows will do background checks on those who purchase guns. 
   I am sorry I sound as if I am stuttering, but that is what the other side demanded, that we say it again. And we have said it again. We have not changed the law; we just said it again for the record. I hope that is enough. 
   We are going after crime control. We are giving our schools of America the tools of safety. If they had those tools maybe in Georgia this morning it might have worked. 
   So I hope we will withstand the vote on the Lautenberg amendment, vote it down, and let the Craig-Hatch amendment stand with its corrections----

   Mr. CRAIG. I would object, but I hope the Senator from California would not characterize that objection in the improper 
   fashion. Both the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking member, who are managing this bill, are not on the floor. The Senator from California knows that the leadership at this moment, both her leader and my leader, are trying to craft a unanimous consent agreement to allow the Senator from California and others to offer appropriate amendments. I am in no way attempting to obstruct. I say that I believe her offering is inappropriate and out of context of the way the Senate operates. Certainly, she knows, as I do, that we work through our leaders, and we also work through the managers of the bill. I do not oppose her arguing her point before the Senate in the appropriate fashion, but I certainly would object to the context under which she has offered it.

   Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from California. 
   Mr. President, it is important that I characterize in the appropriate fashion an amendment that passed the Senate that the Senator from California voted for, I believe. That was the Ashcroft amendment on semiauto assault weapons for young juveniles. She is wrong that it was tied to 18. It is tied to the 21 age limit that is already current law, as it relates to handguns and other restricted weapons. I helped craft that law, along with Senator KOHL, several years ago, and it became law, and we are very proud of it. 
   She is absolutely right to be concerned about juveniles having guns. That is why we were very restrictive. Any juvenile who brings a gun to school is breaking the law. If it is a handgun and they are under 21 years of age, they have broken the law. 
   What we are saying is that on private property, on a ranch or a farm where they are out hunting varmints, or if they are en route to a registered shoot, if they have permission from their guardian, they fall outside the law--guardian or parent. So what the Senator from California was talking about in her proposed amendment is, in part, not unlike what is in current law in many respects.  
   It is true what she has said about long guns after 18 years of age. No question about it. But it is not true of the semiauto assault weapons, if you include the Ashcroft amendment that passed the Senate and is now incorporated into the juvenile justice bill. 
   Mr. President, in the juvenile justice bill, as it relates to guns, we have crafted a juvenile Brady provision, a very important part of the bill. We have dramatically restricted gun shows and demanded, if this becomes law, background checks. We have now, with Senator KOHL and Senator HATCH, crafted a trigger lock provision that I think is an important piece of language and ought to become law. 
   As I have just said, we have prohibited juveniles from owning semiauto assault weapons with extended loading devices. If we pass this bill, that becomes law. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN was able to pass an amendment that restricts certain importations of extended loading devices or clips. If we pass this bill, it becomes law. 
   But if this bill becomes simply a gun control measure and not an extensive juvenile crime provision, it will not become law. I hope the Senator from California and others know that, that we ought to work cooperatively together to pass a much broader law and language to control violent juveniles and their actions than to play the politics of guns, because that is what we have heard for the last day on the floor, the last 3 days, is the politics of guns. 
   The Senator from California and I have voted for some new gun control measures. We believe those are extensive measures that craft a window and close the window that she and others were objecting to. But it is interesting that once we close a window, they redefine and create a new window and say, and now this and now this, and the goalposts constantly move. 
   Mr. President, if the goalposts are constantly moving, then there will be no juvenile crime bill because the other side will have killed it. I think it is tragic that, after two years in a bipartisan effort by the Senate Judiciary Committee to craft a much broader bill dealing with violent juveniles, we would see that prohibited by these actions. I hope we can get past that. I hope this afternoon we can craft a unanimous consent agreement for both sides to offer some reasonable amendments and that we can see final passage of this bill.

   Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from New York has pointed out consistently through the bill where there might be corrections or where in some instances there were deletions that were not intended. Last night he expressed there was a loophole. 
   I pointed out in the law that we had placed this new category directly into the law to comply with all of the law which included background checks. They were apprehensive. We went back and reviewed it and confirmed with many attorneys exactly what we believe to be true. 
   But this morning, in good faith, we have offered this. You can accept it or reject it at your will. But it is very clear what 
   we intend. I think the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has made that intention clear: Temporary  licensees, for the purpose of convenience and also security at gun shows, will do background checks. 
   Thank you.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Senators who just voted for the immediate past amendment have voted to clarify and limit advertising on the Internet, both for guns and explosive materials. Remember, the Internet is an advertising medium. Guns do not materialize through the screen of the computer if you order them. In fact, if you order a gun on the Internet, here is what American Guns says:  
   Please note, a buyer must first call the seller of the gun, confirm the price available, arrange for a Federal-firearms-licensed dealer in your State to receive shipment. Your FFL dealer must send a copy of their license to the seller.  
   The Senator from New York mentioned the 17-year-old Alabama boy. If that happened--and I am not saying it did not happen; he has the news story--three laws were broken. Three laws were broken. The teenager attempting to buy the gun broke a law. The person who trafficked the gun, transported it, broke a law--you cannot transport a gun through the mail service, through a common carrier. There has to be contact in these relationships or laws are broken. 
   I must also tell you, although I am not a constitutional attorney, he walks all over commercial speech. This is advertising. We have corrected those kinds of things in our bill to make sure we keep the Internet clean, but we went one step further, we went after the explosive materials and the kinds of devices that were used in Littleton. I think all of us want that corrected. That is what you voted for. Let's not trample on the marketing that goes on, advertising on the Internet. Let's keep this bill and the Internet clean and protect those kinds of rights. 
   I yield my time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for yielding. 
   I stand in support of what I think is a 
   very needed piece of legislation. While I stand always in defense of the constitutional right of law-abiding citizens to own guns, I also recognize the tremendously valuable linkage between rights and responsibilities and the ability of people to understand what those responsibilities are and to perform them in law-abiding ways. 
   The Senator from Missouri has recognized that in the laws we currently have, there is the potential, if not the reality, where we say to juveniles they cannot own handguns, up to a certain age, and that in fact we have seen there is a possibility, by definition of ``semiauto,'' that they could own one. 
   Certainly, in the case of Littleton, CO, the acts were illegal. That does not make the point. The point is, the law needs to be specific. That is what the Senator from Missouri is doing at this moment. He is making it very clear, as it relates to semiauto assault weaponry and the loading devices, that they be appropriately prescribed under the law as it relates to juveniles and that which we prohibit juveniles from possessing. 
   So I stand certainly in support of this. I encourage my colleagues to vote for it. I think it is the refinement of the laws of our country relating to gun ownership that clearly is deserving and appropriate in this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume in opposition to the Feinstein amendment. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from California and I over our years together here in the Senate have remained good friends even though we find ourselves on occasion in disagreement. This is one of those occasions. 
   I wish I could join with the Senator from California and the Senator from Michigan and those who have spoken on the floor, in the most sincere of ways, in creating a magic wand that would take violence out of our schools and violence off our streets, and proclaim that our Nation is a violence-free nation. If we could do that together, then we would not be here debating this and our Nation would react differently than it is at this moment. 
   All of us have mourned the loss of those marvelous young people in Littleton, CO. But it would be unfair for anybody to stand on this floor and portray that passage of the Feinstein amendment will solve that problem. It will not. It will not solve the problem of violence in our youth today or the feeling of disillusionment or the frustration which has produced these episodes of extreme violence in juveniles that this society has never seen in its history. 
   I stand in opposition to the Feinstein amendment today because it would undo a provision of the law that was created in an interest of fairness, because in July of last year, when the Senator brought this to the floor, we argued it and 55 Senators said we ought not change this provision of the law. That is because, in 1994, Congress debated banning the future importation and manufacturing of high-capacity clips with more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Frankly, I was one of those who opposed banning this ammunition because I felt it had nothing whatsoever to do with controlling crime. 
   Enforcement controls crime: Cops on the street with the ability to make sure, when they arrest somebody who uses a gun in the commission of a crime, that some attorney will not plea bargain them back to the street. Adult crime is going down today because we are locking people up, in part. And yet we are going to have a bill on the floor in the next few minutes which is going to make it even tougher for Federal prosecutors to walk away from their responsibility under the law; and that is to put people away who use guns in the commission of a crime. That is how you make the streets safer. 
   Well, at least that is how you make the streets safer in relation to also protecting a private citizen's right to own and to collect. 
   I think, however, even the sponsor has acknowledged it would be unfair to outlaw existing clips or some clips. She did in 1994. In all fairness to her, she has honestly said on the floor she made a mistake. I do not think she made a mistake at that time. I supported her in that, and we voted on it, and it became the law of the land. The ATF proceeded to do everything in its power to frustrate the law we had created. Specifically, it held up imports of legal clips for years, claiming that Congress only intended to grandfather domestic clips. 
   This reading of the statute was obviously so wrong that even the Justice Department went to ATF and said: Sorry, it is unenforceable. So ATF had to give in; they couldn't jawbone their way outside the law. 
   As a result of that, that importation was allowed as the law had designed. Consequently, the legal magazines finally were allowed to be imported years after the ban went into effect. 
   Today, those who wrote the law are now trying to undo it. Of course, that is the right of Congress--I do not dispute that--to change the law if they wish. But I hope they would have good grounds to do so. 
   I think the first provision of the Senator's law is the right thing to do. It is what the Senator from Missouri is doing, to tighten up on juvenile ownership and therefore force a greater level of juvenile responsibility. But hers is much broader than that, and I simply have to oppose it. 
   History is not the only reason that this amendment is unfair, however. It also is unfair because it would overnight make certain legal, lawfully owned firearms obsolete. These magazines are still being imported because there is a market for them, yes. She has spoken to that market. I think that is fair and responsible because of  the character in which we have tried to shape this particular market. 
   It was unfair in 1994 to ban these magazines, I believe. It is unfair today. Again, I hope the Senator and I can find that magic wand. Congress is struggling mightily at this moment, and this Senate is, with the juvenile crime bill, to change the definition of how we treat juveniles in our society and to change the law, to treat them more like adults, to look at other dimensions that we believe are causing these levels of frustration and violent outbursts, from movies to videos. 
   I wish we could even take our magic wand, if we found it, and make the parents of our society more responsible, but that won't happen either. We will try. In the end, I hope we can succeed. 
   It is my judgment, I believe a fair judgment, to suggest that the Feinstein amendment will not make the Littletons go away, or any other act of violence in this country, unless we bring a whole combination of things and change the way our culture thinks and reacts, as it relates to its children and its future. 
   I hope my colleagues will join with me this afternoon in opposing the Feinstein amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Hatch-Craig amendment package is a very broad-based package bringing greater enforcement, aggressive prosecution that this administration has been very reluctant in pursuing. It enhances penalties across a broad cross section of illegal activities to assure that the criminal simply is not going to fall through the cracks. 
   As my colleagues from Arizona and Oregon indicated, once we were able to defeat the Lautenberg amendment and establish some very clear parameters for creating the permanency of the national instant check system and the funding of that check system and assuring that we were not creating extraordinary liability for private citizens who wish to involve themselves in sales, then I thought it was right and appropriate that we begin to move to clarify and define gun shows and how guns are sold at those gun shows. 
   That is exactly what we have done this afternoon. I think it is a major step on an issue that has brought a great expression of concern across our country. 
   What is important to understand is that there is no placebo. Many would rush to the floor hoping we can pass a myriad of laws. As I said with the Senator from California a few moments ago, the world would become instantly and dramatically safer. We hope what we do today will change the thinking in America. Law-abiding citizens have and will always have constitutional rights to own and bear arms for a variety of reasons. What we don't want to do is create a huge Federal bureaucracy that has so many tentacles in its webs that private law-abiding citizens get caught up in them. 
   That is what would have happened in the Lautenberg amendment. Along with that was the fear that a promoter could be almost anyone who said they were in support of a gun show. They would have to become a licensed Federal firearms dealer. That is not the case nor should it be the case. 
   Like many people know, when you go to the local drug store today and you want to charge it, you bring out your Visa card, they pass it through the machine and tell you nearly instantly if your credit is good, if you can charge against the card. 
   What we want to be able to do to free up law-abiding citizens and to catch the criminal in the web, is to make sure that this instant background check is embodied in the law, and that the Justice Department and the politics of any Justice Department--be it Janet Reno or someone else, cannot manipulate the law. 
   That is to assure an instant computerized check system which assures that felons are on it and adjudicated others are on it, those who find themselves defined by the law as being not sufficiently responsible for the ownership of guns. That is what it is all about. That is what we are about here today--in the area of gun shows, that this be done. 
   Somehow, gun shows have been cast as some bazaar in which illegal criminal activity goes on. That is not true and everybody but a few politicians knows it is not true. Less than 2 percent of the guns sold through gun shows find themselves in criminal activity. We would argue that is too much. We are now asking law-abiding citizens to become involved with us in making sure that guns at gun shows, now that law-abiding citizen is protected, will not be sold to a criminal or to a juvenile. So we do that and I think we strengthen the provisions by doing so. 
   We also deal with another area my colleague from New York will be dealing with, potentially, later, and that is Internet sales. We are suggesting Internet transactions that are known to be legal activities or that could be legal activities are against the law. What we are not saying is you cannot advertise on the Internet. That is a first amendment right and I do not think the Senator from New York would want to infringe on the right of commerce, to speak out. 
   Let me correct for the RECORD a dialog that the Senator from New York, who is now on the floor, and I had yesterday. He felt, reading my amendment that was agreed to yesterday, there was a problem. That problem dealt with the potential of interstate transactions, that are now prohibited, being opened up. In all fairness--I said he was wrong. As he read my bill, he was reasonably accurate, because the bill had been mishandled in its typing. What we were trying to define was the temporary situation of a gun show, because when we do tracking and when we do background checks and records, we are dealing with addresses, permanent locations--permanent locations of a business, a dealer of guns. A gun show is not permanent, it is temporary. It is at the convention hall or the fairgrounds. In doing the typing, legislative counsel misqueued the wrong paragraph. 
   I must say, in all fairness, the Senator from New York was right. He found it. I agreed with him. We corrected it. We are now clearly back to Federal law being absolutely as it is. Interstate sales of guns are banned. Only under certain conditions of the Federal law can that happen. So we have corrected that also in this omnibus amendment, the Hatch-CRAIG amendment, that we think is right and responsible to do.

   Mr. CRAIG. I will not yield for a moment. Let me correct another area the Senator from New York and I had a disagreement on, but that is a gentlemanly disagreement. We still disagree. That deals with pawnshops. 
   In the Brady environment--that was the period of time in which we were building the national background check--a 3-day period was instituted, not to keep the gun from a person, but to check a person's background for the purpose of finding out whether it was legal for that person to own a firearm, whether the person was a felon or not. If, during that period of time, you pawned your gun at a pawnshop and then you went back to retrieve it, the pawnshop owner gave it back to you, no questions asked. It was your gun, your name was on it, you had the pawnshop ticket; as long as you could show ID, you got your gun back. 
   ATF and this administration are now interpreting this differently through instant check. They are saying you have to go through a background check again, and there are lawsuits out there in the marketplace today because of that. 
   It is very important for the RECORD to show what happens. If I am the person who takes a gun to a pawnshop and I pawn my gun, if I have my pawn ticket, within 24 hours the pawnshop owner must not only report the pawning of that gun to the local law enforcement authority with the serial numbers of the gun and my name--that is what goes on today in the law. So there is a background check, per se, because if my name happens to come up the name of a felon, I will never get that gun back; the law enforcement can go and collect it. 
   But what is happening now is that I go in 3 months later to get my gun. I have my money and my ticket and my record is clear. The ATF, and this administration, are saying: Foul. You have to go through a background check. 
   We are saying that is wrong. We are reinstating the Brady environment during the period of the 3-day waiting period.

   Mr. CRAIG. No, it is not because you were right. It is because there was a section misqueued that was not included that was intended to be included. 
   If I can go forward, because you deserve this explanation and you deserve this clarification because you raised the question in all fairness and honesty, all the immunity and exceptions within this section are tied to gun show transactions. It is very important to understand that. We are not talking about an environment outside gun shows; we are talking about an environment inside gun shows. 
   The pending exceptions that the Senator from Vermont raised in question is a unique situation at a gun show. You and I go to a gun show. You are from Vermont, and I am from Idaho. We wish to transact the sale of a gun, but the gun is not there. It is at home in Vermont. You are selling it to me. You and I cannot do that under the law, because we cannot transact business interstate. So we go to a dealer at the gun show, and we agree that the dealer will handle the transaction. That dealer will do a background check on me, the purchaser, because you are selling it. You send the gun to the dealer, and the dealer sends it to me. 
   That is the way it is currently being done in a voluntary way so that you and I do not find ourselves astraddle the Federal law on interstate transactions. That is what this section deals with.

Think of the box of a gun show and gun show activities and the definitions therein of a special registrant and a new licensee. I am suggesting that we are trying to encourage people to become active in background checks and become increasingly legal by that.

   Mr. CRAIG. Here is what we are saying. We are saying in this law that the people who abide by the law have done nothing wrong. If they go through the background check and do all the legal things, they have done nothing wrong; they are within the law. If the gun happens to fall into the hands of a criminal and is used in a crime and somebody wants to trace it back to them and make them liable, we are saying, no, no; you were a law-abiding citizen. You cannot say that they were wrong because their gun at sometime in the future fell into the hands of a criminal and was used. The Senator knows today those kinds of lawsuits are going on out there.

   Mr. CRAIG. Want to make darn sure it does not fall into the hands of criminals. If we go through the background check as we sell it and the guy or gal is pure, we are OK. What if down the road the gun falls into the hands of a criminal and here comes your city or a city that says: You are liable because you are the seller we can trace to because of your record. I can say to you under this: Because you did it in a legal way, you are not liable. That encourages you to pursue legal activities. It does not deal with manufacturer liability. That is another issue for another day, not addressed anywhere in these amendments.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   A lot of people have had a lot to say since the shooting in Littleton, CO. Much of it was sad, but some of it was thoughtful and even inspirational. So it was particularly unfortunate when a couple of weeks ago President Clinton added some comments to the mix that were not just unfair but outrageous and downright unforgivable. I bring this up this evening because even though his rhetoric and some of the rhetoric here on the floor has changed in the last 2 weeks, his sentiments are alive and well and regrettably evident on the floor of the Senate in this debate. 
   I am referring to the President's comments on April 27, when he laid the blame for the Columbine High School tragedy on our culture. Except the President was not talking about the same cultural crisis that we are talking about here today and tonight--the breakdown of families, the powerlessness of communities, the alienation of young people, and the violence and brutality promoted by the entertainment industry. No, what the President chose to blame was, and I quote from the speech that was later released by the White House and printed on its web page, ``the huge hunting and sport shooting culture of America.'' 
   He proceeded to talk about ``Americans' rights to responsible hunting and sport shooting'' and said that the:  
   movement will evaporate [w]hen people from rural Pennsylvania and rural West Virginia and rural Colorado and Idaho start calling their congressmen and saying, hey, man, we can live with this, this is no big deal, you know?.....We would gladly put up with a little extra hassle, a little wait, a little this, a little that, because we want to save several thousand kids a year.  
   That was the President's quote. Now, where do you begin to list what is wrong with those comments? Well, let's start with the concept that all gun owners live in rural parts of the country or that the second amendment protects the right of hunting and sport shooting. Excuse me. I misspoke. The President limited it to responsible hunting and shooting. I am not sure what that means, but it probably involves new Federal regulations. What is more clear is the President's suggestion that those who take their individual civil liberties seriously are ignorant rubes who need reeducating in their responsibility to what he calls ``the larger community.'' 
   All of this would have been merely insulting to the tens of millions of Americans who own and use firearms for legitimate reasons, but then he gets to the truly unforgivable part. What is truly unforgivable is that he insinuated that law-abiding Americans are somehow responsible for what happened in Littleton and, worse, that if they refuse to tolerate encroachment upon their liberties, they do not care about the lives of children. 
   It is a sad day in America when a President of the United States speaks to and implies that thought. That is right. The leader of the free world accused those who uphold the law as being responsible for those who flaunt the law. He accused those who would passionately defend their civil liberties as being bad citizens. He accused those who may have a firearm for the sole purpose of defending themselves and their families, 
   accused these people of not wanting to save children's lives. Now, that is what is unbelievable. 
   I can only say shame on him for attacking decent, law-abiding citizens, and shame on any in this Chamber who would follow his lead. To say that the hunters and sport shooters of America are responsible for what happened in Littleton is to say that safe drivers are responsible for the road-crazed, road-raged killers who drive others off the road. But it is worse than the automobile analogy, because unlike an automobile, a gun has the capacity to save lives as well as take lives. A firearm is a tool. In the hands of a criminal, it is used for evil. But in the hands of a law-abiding citizen, it can save lives. And it does save lives--an estimated 2.1 million times per year, generally without a shot even being fired. Of the 65 million Americans who own firearms, more than a fair number purchase them not for hunting, not for sport shooting purposes, but self-protection. 
   They live in parts of the country where they really feel they need protection, and they have an American  right of self-defense. They arm themselves for that purpose in a legal, law-abiding way. While hunters may do it for sport or they may do it to put food on their tables still in rural America, there are many Americans who own guns to protects themselves. It is in this area of self-protection that the question of encroachment on second amendment rights becomes not just a political question but one of life and one of death. 
   Unlike President Clinton, the woman in a crime-ridden inner city does not have a personal security force protecting her night and day. Some choose, and women are choosing in increasing numbers, to obtain a firearm in a legal way to protect themselves. The obstacles to firearm ownership the President talks about--``a little wait, a little this, a little that, a little extra hassle,'' are to the woman, to the oftentimes single woman of America who chooses to go out and buy a gun for her self-protection. 
   Think about it. She is doing it to prevent harm to herself and, if she is a single mother in a crime-ridden neighborhood, she may be doing it to protect her children. If you are wondering why law-abiding gun owners think gun control is a big deal, that is why. It is not because they are ignorant, nor have they been duped by the NRA or stampeded into making up horror stories. It is because they understand the purpose, the legitimate purpose, the constitutional right and purpose of the legal and appropriate use of firearms. 
   A gun is a great equalizer. It enables the feeble, the disabled, the old, the small to defend themselves against a more powerful aggressor. But with the right to keep and bear arms comes a solemn, a very solemn responsibility to use those arms safely and within the law. 
   Those who do should be celebrated for their exercise of civil liberties in the great tradition of our country--not make the tragedy one of a cowardly cheap shot from the White House and the President. 
   Let me say this about hunters and sports shooters in America, not to mention the collectors and the skilled crafts people who enjoy the history and artistry of firearms as a hobby: They have already been plundered, in some instances, by gun laws. Again and again in the past, when some effort to grab headlines was made, lawmakers reacted with another restriction, and another and another and another. Yesterday, when the Senator from New Jersey and I were debating an important issue, I talked about 40,000 gun laws. Many of those were the result of an illegal action and a political reaction. 
   I am not saying that all of them are bad. But 40,000 at the city, county, State, and Federal levels? Do these 40,000 gun laws, stacked one upon another, make America a safer place? Well, in Littleton, CO, tragically enough, 20 of those 40,000 gun laws were violated by those 2 young men, and some by other people who got guns for them. Some of those people have been arrested. Some of those are working, as they should, and those are the kinds of laws I support; law-abiding citizens support them, and guns rights defender organizations support them. But we haven't stopped violent crime and we have only piled all of these problems one on top of another. 
   Perhaps it is time for a sea change in our thinking. Instead of forcing law-abiding citizens to put up with inconveniences, as our President might suggest, or outright erosion of their civil liberties, perhaps we should demand that this administration's inconveniences are the armed criminal. By prosecuting them, by going at them, as the juvenile crime bill does, and as the Hatch-Craig amendment does, to strengthen the hands of the law enforcement officers to make sure we enforce at least some of the 40,000 gun laws we have--that is what we should be doing, and that is what the chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate is trying to do--to build on and strengthen the body of law that can be enforced, and to say to our U.S. attorneys: Enforce the law. Get out in the field and put those people behind bars who are breaking the law with the use of a firearm. 
   So as we move through this debate, let's not follow the President's lead. Judging by the calls and letters and visits I am getting in the wake of the President's speech, the movement to secure the second amendment is not going to evaporate anytime soon. Law-abiding gun owners in America flatly reject the argument that the only way to control crime is through putting more burden on the exercise of their rights. 
   Any Senator who takes his or her constitutional responsibility seriously should carefully consider what a vote for more gun control is going to do. What is it going to do? Prevent crime? On rare occasions, it might. But it will be a political pill, so that we can go home and say we did the right thing. Yet, Littleton happened. I suggest that we have the opportunity to make changes, and they are here tonight, they are here in the juvenile crime bill. It is outrageous and unforgivable to suggest that anybody in this body needs to vote in favor of more gun control in order to prove that he or she cares. 
   Why don't we make changes in what our children are doing, in the access they have to violence on television, in the movies, in videos. That is what we are trying to do in ensuring that those who would prey upon others with the use of a gun in the commission of a crime be locked up and put behind bars. That is the message I am told Americans want to hear. That is the message my citizens in Idaho want to hear. They want to know that those who violate the laws will be arrested and, most assuredly, that the criminal element will be denied access to firearms. 
   If you vote for the Hatch-Craig amendment, that is what you vote for. If you vote for the juvenile crime bill, as amended, you broaden the entire arena of changing the way we have done business in the past in dealing with violent juveniles and crime in America. We turn to this administration and we turn to the Attorney General and we say: Enforce the law. Go after the criminal. Make this country safe for those who are willing to defend their civil liberties and who believe strongly in their constitutional rights. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me clear up a point the Senator from New York made this evening before I discuss the amendment that is before us. 
   He has made the allegation that the special licensee we have created in our amendment for dealing with gun shows is somehow not going to have to do background checks. Language in the bill says, referring to the special licensee, ``shall conduct his activities in accordance with all dealer record keeping required under this chapter for a dealer.'' 
   We go to that chapter, 18922, and he falls within that chapter, and that is the requirement of the background check. 
   So it is our intent. We believe we have covered that intent. 
   Let the record show that is what we believe the law to be as we proposed it in this form. 
   I am happy to sit down with the Senator tonight or tomorrow, but I believe we have covered it adequately. There is no question of our intent here. It is not a loophole. The special licensee is a dealer. We put him into the dealer section with all other gun dealers. We will leave it at that for the evening. 
   Very briefly; I want to get out of here.

   Mr. CRAIG. Let me talk about the Internet for a moment. 
   Somehow in the last day and a half we have heard this marvelous new word ``loophole.'' Everything has a loophole in it. Somehow through a loophole we are cramming everything today. It is a great mantra. I think Bill Clinton coined it in one of his phrases lately--handgun control loophole. Tonight we have a loophole in the Internet. It is called ``beam me up a gun, Scotty,'' except the Senator from New York, being the remarkable fellow he is, has not pioneered Star Trek technology to deal with guns. 
   The Internet is an advertising medium. It is not a medium of exchange. You advertise on the Internet. 
   Now, I am not a very good Internet surfer, but I know I can't push a button and see a gun come out from the screen. The Senator from New York knows it, too. In fact, he refers to Guns America Web Site. We pulled it up while he was talking. This is what it said:  
   Please note, as a buyer you must first call the seller of the gun, confirm price and availability, and arrange for an FFL dealer in your State to receive shipment. Your FFL dealer must send a copy of their license to the seller.  
   My point is quite simple: If you buy a gun on the Internet, it somehow has to make contact with you. 
   He referenced a young fellow who acquired a gun on the Internet and his mother intercepted it because a common carrier had brought it to their home. The common carrier violated the law. It is against the law in America today to send a gun through the U.S. mail or to allow one to be transferred by common carrier to be delivered to a recipient. 
   I guess that is my point. He may not like the style of advertising or the rhetoric around the advertising, but there has to be a point of contact. How do you make the contact? How does the gun move from the seller to the buyer? Therein lies the issue here. 
   If I believed what is being said were true, I would be alarmed. I don't think any of us want a gun show in our kiddie's bedrooms. It is great rhetoric tonight. The gun show isn't in the kiddie's bedroom. There is advertising on the Internet. The child can access the Internet. The child can't touch the gun. He cannot receive the gun. And the example that he applied was a violation of the Federal law. Again, one of those laws that we stacked on the books and somehow somebody 
   slipped through it. That is what happens with laws some of the time unless we have this huge web of law enforcement. 
   My guess is the common carrier is libel in this instance. I don't know the total story, but I do know the gun got delivered to the home and it had to come through some form of common carrier. We believe that to be a violation of the law. 
   The impact of this amendment is to simply restrict gun sellers to 19th century advertising technology. That is, newspapers and fliers. 
   On a more serious note, the amendment would be an extraordinary and unprecedented restriction on commercial speech. That is called a violation of the first amendment. 
   I am not a constitutional lawyer and I am not going to debate that this is a constitutional violation. But my guess, if it were to become law, it would rapidly get tested in the courts because I believe it could be that. 
   Our laws have never required an advertising medium to become part of the business that it advertises. For example, we don't require a newspaper to get a State liquor license before carrying alcohol ads. But in any event, that would be well beyond anything this Congress ever contemplated. 
   In fact, Federal law confirms exactly the opposite: The Firearms Owners Protection Act, which became law in 1986, specifically confirms the right of individuals to make occasional sales, exchanges, and/or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection, for a hobby, or to sell all or part of a personal collection of firearms within their State or their residence. 
   I do not quite understand what the Senator from New York is talking about tonight about expanding beyond the boundary of a State. Yes, the Internet is national; it is international. But for a gun owner in New York to buy a  gun out of California would be interstate activity, and that would be against the current law. I think the Senator from New York knows that. 
   What we are suggesting in our amendment, because we do address the issue of Internet activities, this Congress would not want anything illegal going on in the Internet. If you use the Internet to offer a firearm to a felon, and you know it, you broke the law. That is what we are saying. If your intent is to sell to anybody on the Internet and not require the checking, you are breaking the law. That is what we would say. 
   The Hatch-Craig amendment makes it a crime to knowingly solicit--that is what you are doing on the Internet, you are soliciting. You are not transporting guns, you are not putting them in the hands of kids, you are soliciting--to knowingly solicit an illegal firearm transaction through the Internet. That is what we do. 
   We go a step forward and talk about explosive materials. There is a very real concern on the Internet today about bombs--not material, because you can't transport it, again, but the diagrams to build a bomb. I am opposed to that, too. But at least you have to go out and acquire the material to build one because the Internet doesn't ``beam it through to your home, Scotty,'' nor does it beam the gun. 
   That is the reality. Our amendment is simple. We think it addresses the issue. I hope our colleagues tomorrow would vote for the Hatch-Craig amendment that covers all of these issues very clearly, very succinctly. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CRAIG. We can conduct more dialog on this tomorrow. 
   Under current law--in other words, we are talking about ``the law,'' not a vacuum but the law, let me read what Guns America says: ``As a buyer, you must first call a dealer.'' 
   The reason you have to do that is the gun is transferred through the dealer, not through the mail. Because the 15-year-old cannot----

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, scare tactics may boost your ratings, but they won't do much for your credibility--especially when you advertise fiction as fact. This weekend, NBC will air a miniseries that is so far from plausible it is indeed laughable. The plot for this hyped up film revolves around a horrifying nuclear accident stemming from the transportation of nuclear weapons and hazardous waste on a train from California to Idaho.  
   Could this really happen, as the network originally advertised? Should you be staying up late at night to worry if your daily commute will include a rendezvous with spilled nuclear waste and Rob Lowe? Unfortunately, this movie only perpetuates Hollywood's warped depiction of all things nuclear. Because of past hype, Americans envision nuclear waste as a glowing green mass causing human and environmental meltdown on contact--not unlike the demise of the Wicked Witch of the West in the The Wizard of Oz. However, nothing could be farther from the truth. 
   If and when Hollywood comes out with another ``scary'' nuclear waste film, they might remember a few lessons NBC forgot. First of all, nuclear weapons are not transported by train, nor are they ever armed en route. They are moved by specially crafted 18-wheelers with the latest security and safety technologies and armed Federal agents. Even if an accident should occur, U.S. nuclear weapons are all designed to survive without detonation if jolted or engulfed in flames. 
   The plot of Atomic Train originally depicted the mutual transportation of both a nuclear weapon and nuclear waste, but NBC has changed any references to nuclear waste in the movie to ``hazardous'' waste. Wrong again. Federal regulations prohibit hazardous waste and nuclear waste from traveling along with nuclear weapons. 
   Secondly, nuclear waste is not green, glowing, or horrific to look at and great care is taken in its transportation. Spent nuclear fuel is solid, irradiated uranium oxide pellets encased in metal tubes and is non-explosive. It is transported in metal casks which will survive earthquakes, train collision and derailment, highway accident or fire. 
   To give credit where credit is due, the movie's trailer was right on one count--nuclear waste is transported far more frequently than most Americans realize. This is because the threat to both public and environmental health has been minimized by stringent safety protocols and close to 34 years of fine tuning. The possibility of radioactive materials harming the public en route is slim to none. Since 1965, more than 2,500 shipments of spent nuclear fuel have been transported safely throughout the U.S. without injury or environmental consequences from radioactive materials. That's a pretty good track record to go on. 
   Materials contaminated by radiation are also transported across the country. In fact, the first shipment of transuranic nuclear waste was safely and uneventfully transported from Idaho's own National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico last month. It was carried in DOE certified containers and tracked by satellite during the 1,400 mile trip. The Western Governors Association worked for years to develop the safest route possible and notify all emergency responders of shipment dates, routes, and even parking areas. Such shipments will become a routine matter in the years ahead. 
   INEEL celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year, and was the birthplace of harnessing the atom for electrical generation. Close to twenty percent of our electricity comes from nuclear energy, and remains one of the safest energy sources our country has available. Yes, nuclear waste requires special handling and precautions, but so do all of the chemical and industrial waste byproducts of our vibrant economy. 
   Due to the outcry over NBC's, ``this could really happen,'' trailer, the broadcasting company has made the wise decision to pull the ads, make last minute script changes to fix some of the more blatant inaccuracies, and post a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie. Yes, this is a piece of fiction, and it is predictable that Hollywood would stray far from the truth, but it is downright irresponsible of the network to create mass hysteria to boost ratings. I can only hope that future films will promote a more intelligent plot line.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I hope that those of our colleagues who are not on the floor this afternoon will take time to watch this debate and listen on television, because today we have very clear comparatives of something that works, that lessens the impact of Government, lessens the creation of a bureaucracy, and something that doesn't work which creates a very large bureaucracy against a substantial American pastime and an American business activity in this country. We are talking about gun shows. Some 5,000 gun shows across America are attended today by between 4.5 million and 5 million people annually. They are not in some back room or in some dark alley creating the environment for clandestine meetings between criminals. They are at fairgrounds, large convention centers and hotel lobbies. They are something that many Americans attend today because most Americans who attend gun shows are legitimate law-abiding citizens who have disposable income and wish to collect firearms as something they do in their pastime. Those are the true dynamics of a gun show. 
   Let me read to you what the President of the United States --and I am afraid what my colleagues have tried to generate this afternoon is that it may be some evil activity. This is a radio message from the President of the United States, November 7, 1998, speaking of gun shows.  
   ..... illegal arms, bazaars for criminals, and gun traffickers looking to buy and sell guns on a cash-and-carry/no-questions-asked basis, entirely without background checks.  
   That is the rhetoric that has imbued this issue and came up with this neat little quick phrase called a ``loophole.'' That is the basis from which we come this afternoon to this debate. Five million people are clandestine criminals going to gun bazaars across this Nation? Five million? I doubt that very much. 
   In fact, the National Institute of Justice, which is an arm of the Justice Department of this administration, said this about gun shows:  
   Less than 2 percent of the guns used by criminals may have come from gun shows.  
   Less than 2 percent. So those are the dynamics and the realities of this debate. I don't know how you paint it any other way, except by using bright red and black paint, because other than that, you have to deal with the truth and the facts at hand. 
   What is this great loophole that my colleagues are talking about at this time? The loophole, they would have you believe, happens to be the Federal law. That law is a very straightforward  law. That law of several years ago defines what a gun dealer is and what a gun dealer isn't. It is the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Firearm Owners Act of 1986. In there it is clearly defined what a gun dealer is and what a gun dealer isn't and, most importantly, what a private citizen is allowed to engage in in an occasional sale or exchange or purchase of a firearm for the enhancement of a personal 
   collection, or for a hobby and/or to sell all or part of a personal collection of firearms within their State of residence without obtaining a dealer's license. 
   What the Senator from New Jersey has not talked about are the laws that govern gun shows. Mr. President, 98 percent of those who are there are dealers licensed under Federal law who must keep records and have those records inspected by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. That wasn't mentioned. Maybe it was simply forgotten. But there is no question, the Senator from New Jersey is right; there are private citizens who come to gun shows and engage in discussions with other private citizens and decide to buy or sell their gun or guns. Is that a loophole? No. It is provided for in the 1986 law. It is something this Congress has already decided is right and proper to do as a private citizen--to engage in the sale of his or her private property. And we have been very clear in tightening it up so they could not get beyond the law. But we have also talked about legitimate collectors, and they are very definable within the law. 
   But what is important is that we make sure can clarify even the 2 percent. My amendment works to do that. There are people who collect guns, and now and then want to sell more than just one or two of their guns. Guess where they would go. They would probably go to a gun show where there are a lot of people who are interested in guns. And we would say in my amendment that we would allow them a special license category, that they could become a licensed gun dealer for a short period of time for either the sale of their guns, or for gunsmithing, or for a firearm repair business. This would be a new category of license in the Federal law. 
   This term of ``engage in business'' would not necessarily fit because they were not businesspeople. They didn't make their living from the sale of firearms or firearm equipment or gun cleaning equipment or loading equipment or all of those kinds of things that are the hobbies of millions of Americans. But we recognize that we ought to give them a category, and in that category, in selling their guns, they would be required to keep records. They would be required to keep records, and they could keep them at their homes. Those records must be available for inspection by the ATF because they don't have a business. 
   Remember, those in business keep copious Federal records, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms can inspect them at any time. People who are involved in the sale of guns, and certainly in the importation of guns, all of those kinds of things today, under the 1968 and 1986 laws, are clearly well defined and controlled. But we are saying in these special instances we want to make sure these people do it right. 
   Now, this is more than just to protect the person who purchases; we want to protect the person who sells, because if that gun were to end up being used by a criminal in a criminal act, and an independent person sold it, they could be liable under local law, under State law, under Federal law. Remember, there are 40,000 gun laws in America today--city, State, county and Federal laws--40,000 gun laws. I would like to adjust it a little, and the Senator from New Jersey wants to add one more so that we would have 40,001. 
   We also do something else. We spent a lot of time with Brady, and out of Brady we came up with the national instant check system. We created a large computerized system by which when a 
   gun dealer sells a gun, he can check the background of an individual to see whether he or she is a convicted felon, or if they have some adjudication against their personality that would cause them not to be able to own a gun. We will create a special class of register to be at a gun show so that people engaged in the legal, private sale of guns under Federal law can go to that person and say: I have this individual who wants to buy one of my guns. Here is his or her Social Security number. Run it through your system. 
   Now, what does it do if you comply with these two areas? It creates a safe haven against liability because you have been within the law. But what the Senator from New Jersey didn't say is that if you sell to minors at a gun show, you are breaking the law. If your sale at a gun show went to a felon and it is proven, you are breaking the law. I am talking about private citizens. It is as if he suggested that gun shows are big black holes that criminals congregate in because they can traffic in illegal gun sales. That is false, Mr. President. I don't know of any other way to say it more clearly and abruptly in order to catch the ear of my colleagues. It is not true, and there is no loophole, unless the Senator from New Jersey wants to say that the laws he voted for are loopholes. 
   I doubt that he would want to do that, because I think at least he was here for the passage of one of those laws. I can't honestly tell you whether he voted for or against it. But it did restrict the rights and activities of individuals as they relate to guns. My guess is that he did. But I will let him speak to that issue. 
   What we are talking about here is continuing to shape and refine the gun laws--all 40,000 of them. 
   If my amendment passes, and we create a special new license for a temporary person, or if we create a registrant for gun shows so that private sales can have a background check, under either of the new license or the special registrant, which would be optional--I don't argue that because I don't want to infringe on the right of private citizens under the 1986 law; congress has already spoken to that--it would provide a very clear incentive to individuals to participate as I have suggested. 
   Why? Because, as I have mentioned, if the firearm was later used illegally and caused harm, they would be immune from the civil liabilities of that action, except for a lawsuit based on negligent entrustment, or the negligence per se. That you will never get away from, nor should you. 
   So I think therein lies the difference. 
   Let me talk to one other thing about my colleague's amendment that concerns me a great deal. 
   On page 4 of his amendment he tries to define what a gun show is. I must tell you, very frankly, it demonstrates to me that he doesn't understand collectors, and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans who own well more than 50 guns, from antique, Civil War weapons to World War II and 
   World War I weapons, Revolutionary War weapons, are collectors. It doesn't define any of them; it just says 50 firearms or more. 
   What it says to me is that he has suggested by his law that he is going to move from about 35,000 gun shows a year to hundreds of thousands of gun shows. 
   What do I mean by that? 
   If two collectors happen to get together and they happen to own more than 50 guns, and they decide to trade a gun or sell a gun between themselves, they are in violation of the Lautenberg amendment. 
   I think we have to be careful of that, because it says, ``at which two or more persons are offering or exhibiting one or more firearms for sale, transfer, or exchange.'' I know the law, or at least I know this language. I know that when ATF gets through interpreting it, it won't be any narrower than this; it will be considerably broader. 
   What about a gun show promoter? 
   Is that Marriott Corporation, which happens to be housing the gun show for participants next to the convention center, which has a sign up: Gun show participants, come stay at the Marriott, promoting the gun show? I think they would be, by definition of the Lautenberg law. 
   In other words, what I am asking my colleagues today to do is to read the fine print--which is really not so fine at all--for the term ``gun show vendor.'' 
   What I am suggesting is, we don't change the law, that we strengthen the law at hand, that we give some options to the private individual, who still should have the right as a private citizen to sell his or her guns to other private citizens if those actions do not fall within Federal law where they are  businesspeople making a profit and are not therefore licensed dealers under the law. 
   It was interesting when the Senator from New Jersey quoted Handgun Control. They got involved in this issue, and they cranked up Americans, talking about this issue some time ago. They talked about ``unlicensed dealers.'' But, all of a sudden, they found out they couldn't use that term, because all of the dealers are licensed by definition of the Federal law. They had to back off. 
   In other words, they were more interested in the political impact than the legality and the correctness of their debate, and how tragic that is. So they backed away from that. But they kept the term ``loophole,'' because somehow it conjures up this idea of this dark escape hatch through which criminals pass. That is not the case. It is not the case in 5,000 legitimate, publicly promoted gun shows which nearly 5 million Americans attend annually in city parks, in legitimate hotels, in State convention centers, and in State fairgrounds around this country. 
   My amendment and the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey are distinctly different. We honor the right of the private citizen. But we give that private citizen options to protect themselves and to access the information system that the taxpayers of this country have spent millions and millions of dollars building so we could have an instant background check to make sure guns didn't get into the hands of convicted felons or other citizens who have adjudicated problems. 
   I have supported that and have strongly fought for it, even though this administration was dragged, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century of computer background checks because they 
   wanted the right of control. 
   Therein lies the ultimate difference between these two pieces of legislation. 
   I hope in the course of the debate we can hear a much clearer definition of what a gun show is, because now I have a lot of friends. If I walk into their home and they discuss the idea of trading a gun or selling a gun to me, I might be in a gun show, and that citizen and I would be engaged in an illegal act. Yet, up until now, that would have been a legal act, because of the right of the private nondealer citizen to engage in those kinds of activities. 
   There is no loophole. It is only in the minds of those who see guns to be the evil instead of the problems that citizens have either abiding by the law or dealing with their own frustrations. 
   We have offered a clear alternative, and I think an appropriate alternative, to deal with the question of the 2 percent of sales at gun shows that may on some occasions find themselves in the hands of criminals where that gun was used in illegal activity. Therein lies the difference. 
   I hope it is clear to my colleagues, the importance of sustaining the gun laws we have and guaranteeing that private citizens have the right to engage in gun sales from their private collections and their private ownership, on a limited basis, clearly described by the law, without having to become a federally-licensed firearms dealer, as many would care not to be. 
   I retain the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. President, while the Senator from California is on the floor, I think it is important we understand the facts about which she talks. She is referencing a recent gun show in California where State justice department agents were involved. What she did not say is that every private sale in California, by State law, must be run through the department of justice background check. In other words, the very thing that she wants is now available in California but doesn't work. 
   What is wrong? Why didn't it work? I guess she will have to answer that question. I am not sure. She is saying she wants what the Senator from New Jersey is offering, but they have it in California as State law and it doesn't work.

   Mr. CRAIG. I will allow the Senator to debate this on her own time. 
   It is important we keep the record very clear. She said there are no background checks at gun shows. Only 98 percent of the transactions are background checked. She cannot come to the floor and make a broad statement that says there are no background checks. That is within itself a clearly false statement. 
   In the State of California, the very gun show where there were found to be some violations of State law--and probably Federal law--somehow the State of California can't control it, either. Or should they? Therein lies the question. 
   In the case of my legislation, private transactions would be given the opportunity of sanctuary, and it would be a tremendous incentive. I think what we need to do here is create incentives. In the State of California there are no incentives; there are mandatory laws, and apparently those laws were broken, at least in some instances. 
   It is important the record show that it was instances of probably less than 2 percent. It is important the record show that well over 98 percent of sales at gun shows--not by ATF but by the Justice Department's own figures--are background checked. Those are the facts. They shouldn't be just intentionally generated for this debate. They come from the Justice Department itself. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CRAIG. I yield myself time. I want to make a correction to one of the statements I made just a minute ago. Because I insist others use right figures, I must use the same rules. I said 98 percent. I am wrong. It is about a 60-40 percent relationship at gun shows; about 60 percent are sold by licensed firearm dealers that require background checks. By the estimation of ATF and the Justice Department, there appears to be about 40 percent of sales that are private by definition of the law. That is a much more accurate statement than the one I just made. But it is clear the State of California does have a law that requires all private sales, all transactions, to be subject to background check. 
   I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is important that facts be facts. The Senator from New Jersey and I did negotiate on the spousal abuse issue because there were some differences. When those differences were worked out, we agreed. So it is not correct to characterize on the floor that I opposed him. He and I agreed, we shook hands, and we voted for it. And I do not run from that vote at all. So let's set that one aside. 
   Let's talk about the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which the Senator said some minutes ago had endorsed his legislation. We called the National Sports Shooting Foundation today, and they said they do not endorse the Lautenberg legislation. 
   Just last Monday, the president of NSSF said the industry supports backgrounds checks at gun shows provided the FBI does not maintain the names in violation of the law and the White House agrees to a more aggressive prosecution of felons turned up by the background checks. That is what they said. They did not, by my checking today, support the Lautenberg amendment. 
   I am also told by Governor Bush's office here in Washington that his office has now called the Lautenberg office to say they do not support, nor have they endorsed, the Lautenberg amendment. That is possibly why that placard a few moments ago that said George W. Bush supported the legislation has been taken down. I do not know that to be a fact. I have not talked with Governor Bush, but it is my understanding at this moment that that is the case from the Governor's office here in Washington. I will set that one aside. 
   Let's talk about the facts. The facts are that there are 40,000 gun laws in America. Twenty of those were violated at Columbine High School in that tragic event which all of us mourn. We are here today in a juvenile justice bill trying to create a much stronger environment in which to deal with juveniles who act in violent and illegal ways. That is what we are trying to do. That is what the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has worked for over 2 years to do. 
   We are going to be treating violent juveniles more like adults--a significant change in our society and in our culture. And we should. We must. 
   Well, then, why are gun shows a part of it? Because every time some people get an opportunity to talk about opposing guns, they take that opportunity. I do not deny them that right, but what is important is that we deal with the character of the law in the right and appropriate way. 
   Private citizens are allowed to sell guns in private transactions--at gun shows, in the middle of the street, or in the privacy of their home. That is what the law says. There are liabilities to that. If you sell to a minor, that is against the law. If you sell in an interstate transaction, that is against the law. If you sell to a felon, you better be careful; you will be liable. Those are the laws that exist today. 
   If you are a licensed dealer of guns, making your living from guns, then the laws are manyfold and you walk a very tight rope. You keep records, as you should, and you do background checks to deny felons access to guns or those who have an adjudicated problem that would make them unstable in the ownership of guns. 
   Those are the laws today with which we deal. There are some 5,000-plus gun shows annually that nearly 5 million people attend across America, where 60 percent of the gun transactions are done within the context of federally licensed firearms dealers, and 40 percent are not. We are saying something distinctively different than the Senator from New Jersey, who says: Federally controlled, federally defined, in a bureaucracy of recordkeeping that puts the private citizen at a tremendous liability, even though they are law abiding and do all the right things. We are saying we ought to allow background checks to private citizens if they are involved in those transactions. Our amendment would do that, would create a special registry to access, for that citizen, the NICS, instant background check system of the FBI. 
   That is right, and it is proper, and it will go a long ways toward dealing with illegal activity--some exist; I cannot deny that. But clearly even the Justice Department says that of the guns that are sold at gun shows, less than 2 percent are found to be in illegal activities. That is this Justice Department. That is Bill Clinton's Justice Department. Yet, Bill Clinton, our President, who tried to characterize gun shows as being a bazaar for criminal activity, is wrong, and he knows it. But when he can play politics with this issue, he runs to do so, even though his own Justice Department would argue that the statistics are substantially different. 
   We also provide for a unique status of licensure. But what we do most importantly is we do not increase the liability or the recordkeeping responsibility of the private citizen. No tripwires here, no failure to dot the ``i'' or cross the ``t'' of a Federal process for which the ATF can come into your home and find you liable. That is not the way it should be. Private citizens have rights in this country, and they even have rights to own guns within the law and under the Constitution. That is what  we guarantee here with clearer definition and clearer process. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, one other area that concerns me a great deal is the definition by the Senator from New Jersey of ``gun show.'' I have spoken to that to some extent. But I am tremendously fearful that law-abiding citizens, who are legitimate collectors of guns, all of a sudden will find themselves, where more than one should meet, automatically by definition of the Federal law a gun show. 
   That is wrong. It should not be that way. But certainly if it becomes that way, their liability to even talk about guns and trade guns or exchange guns amongst their friends who are collectors is dramatically curtailed. 
   Also, I do not think the Senator from New Jersey has done an effective job of refuting what ``gun show promoter'' means. Because he says that the term ``gun show promoter'' means any person or organization that plans or promotes and operates a gun show. These are the people who find themselves not only liable but having to get Federal licensure to do so. Does that include the Marriott Hotel next to the Convention Center with a sign out front: All gun show exhibitors stay here. We promote gun show X in city Y or Z? It could. Because we all know that what we mean here as legislative intent oftentimes becomes vastly different once interpreted by the Federal bureaucracy. 
   Those are my concerns as they relate to these issues. I hope my colleagues will clearly understand those before they take the opportunity to vote this afternoon. 
   I retain the remainder of my time and relinquish the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, you are being asked to table the Lautenberg amendment and to vote up or down on the Craig amendment. 
   There are very real differences in these two amendments. First of all, there are 40,000 gun laws spread across America. There are 5,000 gun shows and 5 million people attending them on a regular basis. 
   The question is, Is there a loophole in the law through which illegal activity is going on? If the 1986 gun act is right --that many of you voted on--that says that private citizens have the right to engage in legal transactions, then there is no loophole. In fact, this Justice Department says that less than 2 percent of the guns found in criminal use were sold at gun shows. 
   What do we do about it? There were 20 laws broken in Littleton, CO. Many people are dead. Laws were broken and now people are being arrested for having violated those laws. 
   What I offer is a reasonable way to begin to shape gun shows and allow law-abiding citizens the right of access to the FBI instant check system so if they are engaged in the sale of a gun they can make sure that they are safe in that sale. Therefore, we provide an instant check capability at a gun show. 
   What the Senator from New Jersey did not say is if you are selling at a gun show and you are a licensed dealer, you already come under Federal law. No child, no juvenile walks into a gun show and buys a gun. It is against the law in this country and it is against the law in every State. Nothing should be represented to say anything different. That is the law. 
   There is a 40-percent sale at a gun show between private citizens, private citizens who are protected under the 1986 gun act who do not engage in gun sales for business purposes. 
   The Senator from New Jersey goes on to say when two people meet and there are 50 guns present and they exchange a gun, that is a gun show. You have a lot of friends and neighbors that are gun collectors and all of a sudden they find themselves libel. 
   He also goes on to say promoters must register. Who is a promoter? How about the Mariott Hotel across the street from the convention center of the gun show that has a sign on the marquee; ``Gun sales. People attending the gun show stay here.'' Is that a promotion? 
   I don't know how to define that definition. 
   These are the realities of the issues we deal with. I have a much more aggressive, voluntary approach that rapidly begins to tighten down while at the same time protecting the civil liberties of our citizens.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have to deal with the facts and we have to deal with what is in print. Is there a liability exemption? Yes. If you are a new registrant, and you do a background check, and you play by the rules at a gun show, or if you are a new licensed dealer at a gun show, those are the incentives to get there. We are not exempting anybody. What we are saying, by definition--on page 14 it clearly spells out 
   what a qualified civil liability action is. 
   What the Senator from New York just said is not true. I have not changed any Federal law except to deal with gun shows. I am sorry he has misinterpreted it that way. You cannot have it both ways. If you are a registered firearms dealer, and a Federal dealer, you have to meet those standards and qualifications. You do not ramble around the country. You do not do interstate sales. That is against the law. And he knows it.  
   But what we are saying, to encourage background checks, to encourage participation at a gun show--under the legal status now, remember, these guns that are sold by individuals without background checks are legal under the law, but we want to tighten it up. So we say, we will protect your liability, not your negligence but your liability, if you get a license and become registered and do background checks and keep a record. 
   And if you choose not to do that, but you still want to protect yourself, we are putting a new registrant in each gun show qualified by the ATF and the FBI, and you walk over to them and say: I want to sell gun ``X'' to person ``Y.'' Run a background check on them to find out if they are a legal citizen. That is the new law. That is the incentive. 
   If you believe in the right of free citizens to own a gun, but you want to create incentives to create the kind of thing we are talking about here, then you vote for this amendment. But you do not change the law; you do not create interstate trafficking. That is against the law now, and it will always be. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize teachers across America for the vital work they do. I come from a family of educators, so I have seen firsthand the grueling work teachers go through every day--not for their own gain, but because they care about each and every one of our children. Teachers are not the highest paid people, they are not in the most glamorous profession--but they are, and should be, among the most respected people in our country. That is why it was so important that we declared this week as the 14th Annual Teacher Appreciation Week and that we recognized May 4, 1999, as National Teacher Day. 
   Mr. President, the resolution that we passed yesterday states that education is key to the very foundation of American freedom and democracy we all enjoy, that teachers have a profound impact on the development of our children, and that much of the success we enjoy here in the United States can be attributed to our teachers. The resolution also states that while ``many people spend their lives building careers, teachers spend their careers building lives.'' 
   Mr. President, I want to take a couple of minutes to recognize a teacher from my home state of Idaho who has truly spent her career building lives. Judy Bieze teaches first grade in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Judy got her start with a bachelor's degree in elementary education from Illinois State University, began teaching elementary students in 1971, and hasn't stopped since. For the past 14 years, she has blessed the children of Idaho. 
   She is an active member of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the International Reading Association, the Panhandle Reading Council, and the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. She is a lead teacher in her school and has received numerous grants to do everything from providing books for parents and children to check out and read to underwriting a district-wide inservice training in spelling. 
   Somewhere amongst all of this, Judy finds time to teach some of Idaho's children. In fact, Judy humbly reflects that her greatest accomplishments come in 6- and 7-year-old bodies. 
   It is no wonder. Judy practices some techniques in her classes which some may call innovative, while others call them back to the basics. For instance, during the course of the year she takes time to recognize each child in her class as the ``Special and Unique'' person and works each day to recognize each child's accomplishments. Furthermore, she believes that parents must be actively involved in their child's education. From encouraging parents to be involved in classroom activities to weekly letters home to detail what their child has been doing in school, Judy recognizes that parents are first and foremost in a child's education. 
   Judy has stated that each day she is ``rewarded by the large and small accomplishments of the children entrusted to my care.'' Last year, Judy's peers recognized these accomplishments and her commitment to the education of our children by choosing Judy Bieze as the Idaho State Teacher of the year for 1998-1999. 
   Judy believes that each child is a unique, unrepeatable miracle. On behalf of the great state of Idaho, I am glad that Judy chose to come to Idaho and work her miracles with our children. I am proud of the work she does, and am pleased that I have the opportunity to recognize her accomplishments today. It is my hope that other  teachers will see what she has done, see how she cares for our children, and strive to follow her lead. With teachers like Judy leading the pack, I have great confidence in the future of our country.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Noxious Weed Coordination and Plant Protection Act of 1999''--a comprehensive bill which will focus the effort of federal agencies in fighting noxious weeds and other plant pests. 
   In January I introduced the Plant Protection Act, S. 321. This bill generated a lot of discussion and several suggestions for improvement, much of which is reflected in the bill I am introducing today. The Noxious Weed Coordination and Plant Protection Act of 1999 retains most of S. 321 but includes a section on federal coordination of noxious weed removal.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to join with my colleagues in an expression directed by House Concurrent Resolution 92, which deals with the situation that occurred in Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. 
   I come this afternoon with no answers, and I wish I had some. Like most of us, I have thought a great deal about the crisis from the moment we watched it unfolding on national television late last week. I guess in all of this, I have been struck by how quickly some people rush to explain what happened and offer solutions to prevent such a terrible crime from ever happening again. I wish I had a crystal ball and could do that. But that is not what has occurred; I don't have a crystal ball that can show all that clearly. 
   The investigation of the crime is not yet completed, and the community is still in shock. My guess is it is only natural to react by trying to make some sense out of all of this, to locate the exact point where something terribly, terribly wrong happened, to tell everyone to stay away from that point, and to pass a law that would keep everyone away from that point, so that it would shield us and our kids and our communities from harm. While it may be natural, my guess is that at this time it would be a mistake. 
   It would be a mistake to designate the point and rush to judgment, because that judgment may be different tomorrow, based on the facts that are now unfolding. 
   I don't believe there is a Senator on this floor who has all of the answers. I am impatient to have more information, and I hope it will come out, because I would like to think that Columbine--the situation that happened in that high school is a point of time we will all stop and think about and deal with as an issue which we will never allow to happen again. 
   I just came off the Capitol steps a few moments ago from speaking to a marvelously beautiful group of students from Payette, and Parma, and Middleton, ID. They asked me, ``Senator, what can you do to make our schools safer?'' I said, ``You know, I am not sure I know what to do, because those young men at that high school in Colorado broke 17 laws, State and Federal''--laws that say it is against the law to possess a destructive device, or a bomb; laws that say that manufacturing a destructive device is wrong and against the law; laws that say the use of an explosive or incendiary device in the commission of a felony is against the law. They broke all of those. The law was there and it didn't stop them. 
   How about setting a device designed to cause an explosion upon being triggered? That is against the law. It is a violation of State law in Colorado. It didn't stop what happened there in Littleton. There is a law regarding the use of a firearm or destructive device to commit a murder that is prosecutable in a Federal court. That is against the law. Yet, those two young men defied the law. The use of a firearm or a destructive device in relation to other activities is against the law. 
   I could read all 17 of these laws, and not one of them saved one child or that teacher, that coach, at that high school. Maybe if you had stacked all the laws against the front door, in book form, you would have blocked the entry of those kids with their bombs for just a moment in time, and that school might have been saved. But nobody did that. We could rush to judgment today and pass a lot more laws and take those books of laws and stack them up against the schoolhouse door. My guess is that not one more child in America would be safer. 
   Laws are important, and I am not suggesting they are not. They direct a civil society to, hopefully, do better things. But they need to be carefully-thought-out laws. My guess is that the breaking point is at hand, when America as a culture had better turn and look at itself and ask, ``Why?'' 
   When those kids asked me what I could do this afternoon, I asked them, ``What are you, as students, prepared to do?'' It ``ain't cool'' to rat on a fellow student. Peer pressure is such that young people don't talk about another young person with their principals or superintendents--even if the young person said, ``I am going to kill somebody,'' or do something else wrong. It isn't cool. Yet, if you don't do something, maybe it is Columbine that happens. 
   I would like to see our schools become zones for education. Drug-free? Absolutely. Gun-free? Absolutely. But zones for education, not primarily socialization and the mixing and all of the kinds of things that go on in schools. Let's set some rules. How about a dress code? How about random inspection of lockers? If you are going to educate and you are going to make a safe haven for education, maybe it is  time you bring discipline back to schools and you say to the bad actors: You are out. 
   I don't know that that is the answer, but I think it is time our society talks about it, because we have passed a lot of gun laws in the last decade in this Congress and children died last week in Littleton, CO, in spite of all those gun laws we passed, all those bomb laws we passed. 
   I don't think there is a Senator on the floor who is going to rush out and say it is against the law to buy a pipe--nor should they--or against the law to go out and buy a propane canister to 
   fuel your barbecue. But those were tools used in bombs in Littleton's high school. There is no Senator who will do that, because there may not be any political bounce in it and it just would not make common sense. 
   So let us let the survivors mourn in Littleton, CO. Let us let that community heal. Let's let the law enforcement people try to make sense of what made these young men tick, by their diaries, by their web page, by their play-acting, by the evil that invaded their hearts. Then maybe we, as public people, can help reshape our very wonderful culture. 
   Yes, maybe it will take some changes in law. There is no disputing what I represent, and most people in this body know I am a strong supporter of second amendment rights. I am also a strong supporter of first amendment rights. I am not going to trample on those rights, and I am going to supply formidable debate and opposition to anybody who will on this floor try to reshape them in the name of safety and security. But I am willing to put those rights on the line, and I am willing to say--to a culture that has failed to recognize that along with rights comes responsibility--that it is now time to get responsible. 
   That is what I told those young people a few moments ago on the steps of their Nation's Capitol--that I was going to fight to secure for them the kind of freedoms my forebears had fought to secure for me; that I had accepted the responsibility that came with those rights and they, too, must; that passing laws in the U.S. Congress does not a safer world make, unless the laws are enforceable and unless people genuinely agree with them. 
   So I think it is appropriate that our leader has asked us to take pause, not rush to judgment, not play to the politics of the moment, but to take a deep breath and think awhile, let a community heal just a bit, speak to it in the form of the resolution that is now before us, allow the investigators to patch together this weird and terribly evil story. And then let's examine it as a Congress, as an American culture, and say to ourselves we must become more responsible--responsible as legislators, responsible as parents, responsible as a culture, in taking our rights in a way that demonstrates the responsibility that goes with them. 
   I say to the citizens of Littleton, CO, how terribly sorry I am. My wife and I mourn with them. We have three beautiful children and a grandbaby, and we are so glad that they are safe and happy today. We know there are parents in Littleton, CO, who have lost something that can never and will never be replaced. So I am pleased that today, as a Congress and as a Senate, we are speaking to the people of Littleton, CO, and then we will step back and allow the healing process to begin as the investigative work is completed. Then, and only then, is it right and proper that we engage. And I will not be a vehicle to obstruct that engagement. That would be wrong. But we will soon have a juvenile crime bill on the floor. That is the appropriate place to talk about how to deal with this issue, and from sound information make quality judgments about how we may help our culture reshape itself in a responsible and caring fashion. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators MURKOWSKI, HAGEL, BYRD, and others, in introducing the Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999. I commend Chairman MURKOWSKI and Senators HAGEL and BYRD for their leadership on this very important legislation. 
   Sufficient scientific information and public interest exist to justify the encouragement and acknowledgment of responsible actions by private entities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even though all scientific, technological, economic, and public policy questions have not yet been resolved. 
   The global climate issue presents profound questions in these areas that require comprehensive, integrated resolution. Current scientific research, experimentation, and data collection are not adequately coordinated or focused on answering key questions within the United States, as well as internationally. 
   Moreover, public access to scientific, economic, and public policy information is severely limited. The public's right to know is not being satisfied. Open and balanced discussion leading to public support for best approaches to climate policy resolution is urgently needed. 
   This measure does not depend on future regulatory mandates, an approach preferred by the current Administration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also provides a valid alternative to S. 547, the Credit for Voluntary Reductions Act, introduced recently by my friends and colleague Senator JOHN CHAFEE. The key difference between Senator CHAFEE's bill and our bill is that our bill is not dependent on the Kyoto protocol or any other regulatory mandate. 
   It is my belief, Mr. President, that voluntary measures should be encouraged through incentives rather than in anticipation of future domestic or international regulatory mandates. 
   Mr. President, I am also very concerned about the Administration's strong desire to drastically cut carbon and its seeming willingness to do so by whatever regulatory measure available. Demonstrative evidence of the Administration's thinking on this issue is contained in the April 10, 1998, EPA General Counsel memo to Carol Browner, describing EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act. 
   This memo, in my opinion, clearly overstates EPA's authority to regulate pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Moreover, this memo is indicative of the Administration's penchant 
   for finding regulatory fixes for problems. Its allies in this campaign are those in the international community who are either indifferent to, or against our economic interests. we all know, or should know, that at this moment in history, when you cap carbon you cap economic growth. 
   We need a whole new paradigm for handling this serious political issue. People care about it on all sides, and now Congress will be involved in this issue during this session. Let's get serious about the science and fully inform the American people so that whatever the outcome, they'll know that their government was working for them and not against their important economic interests. 
   Let's force the current Administration to stop politicizing science and get to the point where the issue is confidently understood. There is simply no compelling reason for our government at this time to force Americans to take preventive measures of uncertain competence against a problem that may or may not lie in the earth's future. 
   It is for these reasons that I, along with Senators MURKOWSKI, HAGEL, and others, are continuing to work on the next step in this very important response to the climate change issue--a more comprehensive proposal that will include provisions that address:

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will certainly be happy to try to respond to the Senator. The Senator has been here a good deal longer than I, has spent a good deal more time on this issue than I, but he also understands the term ``the debt held by the public.'' Any time you decrease the debt held by the public, you increase the ability of Government to pay their obligations to Social Security. Because those obligations will not be ingrained in new spending--be it discretionary or entitlement spending--we set it aside and we do not obligate it except for, as you would have in this instance, a reduction of debt and a decline, therefore, of interest paid on debt. 
   That specifically is what the language does. I think it is quite clear and it is quite obvious that we are not obligating Social Security trust funds anymore to entitlement spending or to discretionary spending. And, therefore, when the obligations of the trust fund come due, you have money available because you did not obligate it. Therefore, this Senator and I do not have to go to the public to raise taxes to pay for a system for which the public had already been taxed. 
   I am not a budgeter, nor am I on the Finance Committee, but I have worked with the chairman of the Budget Committee in the crafting of the language. I find it quite clear, not very confusing at all.

   Mr. CRAIG. It creates an obligation to repay because it is taken out in the form of Treasury notes and interest paid, and certainly there is an obligation to pay back. Whether it is an obligation to pay back or a debt, then that is a game of semantics, but it is an obligation. If I had an obligation to pay, as the Government does, to the trust funds of Social Security, I would consider that a debt burden and something I would have to pay. And I am quite sure my accountant would want me to put that in the ``debt'' column of ``bills outstanding'' or ``money to be paid'' or ``owed to'' a particular payment scheme. I call that debt.

   Mr. CRAIG. They have borrowed it by law, as was prescribed in 1935, from the trust funds. That is the only way the money can be held in the trust funds to generate interest on the account. That is correct.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the debate today on the floor on S. 557 is not a fraud; it is a real shakeup with reality that a lot of our Senators and some Members of this Congress don't want to face, because for years we have had the tremendous flexibility in this country of borrowing money from the Social Security trust fund and spending, and spending, and spending. 
   I think the American public is suggesting to us that that time ought to come to an end. There is no question that, in 1994, it began to come to an end. Some Senators can't face the reality of the changes that occurred then. But the American economy did, and it responded robustly when Government curbed its appetite to progressively spend a greater amount of the gross domestic product of this country. And it is now with a balanced budget and a surplus, generated by Social Security payroll taxes, that we have an opportunity to turn to the American people and, for the first time in a long while, say to the American people that we can not only ensure your Social Security without a new tax increase, but we can modernize it for future generations so that it will be a reliable and an earning annuity of the kind that most people would like their retirement account to be. 
   At the end of this fiscal year, the Social Security trust fund will hold an estimated $853 billion. This year alone, it is projected to run a $127 billion surplus. The Social Security trust fund's $853 billion balance equals roughly half of the total Federal budget for this year. It equals America's total income tax payment for this year. Every cent of every dollar that every American pays in income tax will just equal the Social Security trust fund balance. Yet, how much actual money has been set aside for Social Security's $853 billion balance? Not one cent. Not one cent. 
   Why are we, then, arguing about the concept, if not the reality, of an idea that begins to set it aside? Now we are starting to split the hairs on how it is set aside. I don't think it is time for that anymore, because I believe the American people no longer trust us. You cannot argue Social Security from 1935 to today and say, ``Trust us,'' because the American people have said, ``You spent the money, you indebted the country.'' We are saying that time should stop. 
   Of course, the White House is playing one of the most phenomenal double standards that I have ever seen a White House play, because, as we know, President Clinton proposes quite the opposite today from what he proposed a year ago. I have not seen the Senator from South Carolina, in any way, try to defend what his President is talking about--and I am glad he isn't--because what the President talked about is raiding Social Security this year, when last year he said that every penny of it ought not to be spent, except for Social Security. 
   What we are suggesting to the President is that he honor his first commitment instead of his latter commitment. What was it called? Save Social Security first. This year, he wants to spend $158 billion of the surplus, and he just sent up a bill for $6 billion more. Perhaps the time has come when defending the definition of ``is'' really isn't worth defending because what was last year isn't this year. 
   The American people are very wise to the man in the White House who says one thing one day and contradicts himself the next day with a straight face. President Clinton's proposal reminds me of St. Augustine's confession on having prayed for chastity-- ``but not just yet.'' 
   Over the last holiday, I traveled home to my State of Idaho. I spoke to hundreds of people across my State about Social Security. I called it ``seniors to seniors'' town meetings. I asked the high school teachers to send their seniors from high school, and I asked the AARP and the senior centers to ask if their seniors would attend. We had the charts and we had the graphs of Social Security, and where it is, and where it is from the 1983 act, and how it will be solvent to 2014 or 2015, and then by 2034 it is in trouble. Everybody sat and listened and anticipated. 
   Then we talked about the surplus and the opportunity to modernize, as a result of that, to transition ourselves generationally into the 21st century with the true annuity program that not in any way blights the American economy but probably creates the kind of energy and driving force it deserves. It was not where we just played the old pyramid, Bismarckian game of Social Security where you had 1 retiree versus 8 or 10 at the base paying. 
   The Senator from South Carolina is right when he talks about the working person today and that response, because in 2034--I think I might be around then--I am going to be a Social Security recipient. I am going to be getting more than $1,000 a month in Social Security. There are going to be two people out there working, each one of them paying $500 out of their hard-earned money so I can live well. That is a travesty. 
   I have a feeling that my grandkids are going to turn and say, ``Grandpa, we can't afford you anymore. You are a liability to us because we can't afford to put our kids in college because your Social Security is costing us too much.'' 
   So what does that have to do with the debate this evening? It has a great deal to do with this debate, because what we are talking about is a generational opportunity. I am not going to debate Reagan economics. That would be like debating FDR and blaming him for the big Government we have today, and forgetting Congresses from FDR to today that could have made those changes. 
   We have changed a lot since Ronald Reagan and George Bush. My guess is, decades from now we will change a lot more from what the Senator from  South Carolina or the Senator from Idaho will do or would be about to do. That is the way our Government should work. It is not stagnant. It is not static. It is dynamic, sometimes for positive and sometimes for negative. 
   But today and tomorrow, a balanced budget and a true surplus on the operating accounts means we have a generational opportunity to make a change like none I have seen in the years I have had a chance to serve Idaho in the Congress. 
   Idahoans find it hard to believe that the President and future Congresses can resist the temptation to raid future surpluses and spend them. Why should they trust us? That is what we have done in the past. Sure enough, we have a balanced budget, and now we are at war in Kosovo, and here comes a new bill for $6 billion. What are we going to do? My guess is we could tighten our belt just a little bit, guarantee the stability of Social Security and the integrity of the trust fund, and recognize the priority of war, as past Americans did, over certain kinds of domestic spending, and spend accordingly. 
   That is going to be the test of this Congress in the coming days, and it is a legitimate test, it is a responsible test. 
   So I thank Senator ABRAHAM, Senator DOMENICI, Senator ASHCROFT, and others who, like many Americans, said, you know, we have an opportunity, and let's build a lockbox safeguard to assure that we can make this generational shift to modernize Social Security for the 21st century, to guarantee it to those who are receiving today and those who will receive from this system in the near future, but possibly--just possibly--create an environment where we can make some changes for the future. 
   I say it is nothing short of historical. I believe it to be 
   true. For the first time since Social Security began over 60 years ago, we would set aside all its moneys for all its intended purposes. This would amount to about $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. 
   The Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft proposal would require 60 votes for the Senate to dip into the Social Security surplus. And it would require the money be set aside by instituting and then lowering a limit on the public debt. It is a legislative money belt for Social Security. It is not a straitjacket for government. We recognize there are true emergencies. While as much as 29 days ago we would not have recognized ourselves in war, we now must recognize that we are at war. So we have shown the flexibility for that concern. 
   It would allow an exemption for real Social Security reform. It would save not only Social Security money but Federal money too. 
   Setting aside Social Security surpluses also means retiring Federal debt. I don't care how the debt was generated. The public holds the debt in a general sense. It may have been generated by defense spending or social spending. Government borrowed the money and spent it. The debt is not categorical to each area of government. We all know that. 
   So I think it reasonably unfair to debate it in that manner. That is why we focus on the debt as debt held by the public. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, compared to spending that $1.8 trillion, as has been done until now, setting it aside would reduce Federal interest payments $468 billion over the next 10 years. 
   Some Senators want to talk about a tax increase to fund the largess of Government. How about running the system right so we save that kind of obligation and outlay? $468 billion worth of savings in 10 years is pretty darned good. It can be done, and we should do it now with a balanced budget and a surplus. 
   We save Social Security's $1.8 trillion surplus for its modernization of the system, and we save $468 billion in interest payments as a result. 
   Guaranteeing Social Security and guaranteeing savings--who wants to be against that? 
   Now there are going to be some who will find rather unique arguments to say we have to vote ``no'' against this. It is a political trap for the year 2000. How about a political reality for the 21st century? That is what this legislation is all about--guaranteeing Social Security and guaranteeing savings. 
   Who wants to be against that? The same people who wanted to raid it for $158 billion this year. I would expect the American people do not find that too surprising. 
   John Dillinger hated bank vaults. It made his job harder. 
   Big spenders in Washington will hate this lockbox because it leaves their appetite for spending without food. 
   In last year's State of the Union Address on the other side of this very Capitol, President Clinton said:  
   I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that's every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.  
   What a difference a year makes, or a word, or the opportunity to focus the American public in a different direction. Now he proposes not to keep his promise. But, rather than admitting he opposes it because of his desire to keep his hand in the Social Security cookie jar, he uses the same old scare tactics to which he has always resorted when cornered. 
   The administration has sent us a veto threat on the Social Security lockbox. That has been about the 40th or 50th veto threat we have had from this administration in a reasonably short period of time. 
   It is also out of date--remarking on a proposal that is far different from what we debate here today, because that veto threat had the question of money management in it. And that was taken care of by the authors of this bill. 
   Why did President Clinton claim to oppose the security lockbox? 
   First, he claimed that it would hurt in times of recession. 
   If we are in a recession, we can declare that to be an emergency and we all know that. However, the proposal before the Senate would not even apply in a time of recession. We have taken that safeguard. 
   Second, President Clinton claims it would limit the Treasury's ability to manage the Government's normal cash flow. This, however, has been addressed in the legislation now before the Senate. In addition, limits already exist on Treasury's ability to borrow and have since 1917. Listen to your Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. President. Does President Clinton want us to abandon the statutory debt limit that now exists? I presume, under his Treasury's twisted logic, that he would oppose the existing legal limits if it were now being offered for the first time. 
   It is ironic that he uses his Treasury Secretary to make his opposition for him. This is the same Treasury Secretary that just 3 years ago circumvented the existing statutory debt limit by raiding Social Security trust funds for billions of dollars. Let me repeat that: The President who appoints a Secretary of the Treasury and says leave every dime in the trust funds is the same President whose Secretary of the Treasury just 3 years ago moved the law around existing statutory debt limits by raiding Social Security trust funds for billions of dollars. 
   They called that disinvestment. ``Scheme'' is a better word. I call their opposition now disingenuous, because if that was disinvestment, what they say today is truly disingenuous to what this Congress wants to do and what the American people have demanded and are now asking for. 
   Other than these, President Clinton offers no reason with any justification to argue opposing the lockbox. He claims it will not help the Social Security trust fund, and others are now claiming that, too. Yet saving the surplus is what he proposed just a year ago. I guess now that we are proposing it, it is not a good idea; when he proposes it, it is a good idea. 
   Does he claim that his spending of $158 billion of the Social Security trust fund over the next 5 years will help Social Security? President Clinton also claims, again, that his phony transfer scheme would help Social Security. I could go on in those details, but other Senators are waiting to speak on this issue. 
   There ought to be no schemes or gimmicks this time. This is a very straightforward proposal. I guess it is honesty that frustrates the other side. It is clarity, it is easy to understand by the American people. The idea that you just cannot spend at will anymore, you have to balance your budget and you have to face the hard truth of spending,  and maybe the honest truth that if you are going to spend more, you have to tax more. Then you give the Congress a choice: Should we cut spending to balance the budget, or should we shift our priorities in a time of war, while assuring to the American people that their pensions, their retirement, their security will remain stable and that the Congress will not raid it. That is what the issue is here. 
   It is not a matter of quoting history anymore. It is a matter of looking into the future. It is a matter of taking the unique opportunities today that we have to move forward. 
   In those town meetings that I held across Idaho less than 3 weeks ago, I think senior citizens left feeling that Social Security for themselves was intact; they also left recognizing that probably their grandchildren did not expect it to be there for them, that they would pay three or four times more money into it and get three or four times less out of it. I think it is time that we think about all generations of Americans, young and old alike. 
   I voted for the 1983 Social Security Reform Act. I am proud that we built that strength and that stability into the system, but I am not at all proud of the way this Congress spent the reserves in those trust accounts and built the debt that it built. While there is a lot of fingerpointing as to how that debt got there, 
   there is one easy way to solve it; that is, to vote no. 
   Finally, we have a Congress that is willing to face up to it. Out of that Congress comes a balanced budget. Out of that balanced budget comes a surplus. Out of that surplus comes the unique opportunity to strengthen and modernize Social Security. We do that by assuring to the American people that we will no longer borrow it off into all branches of government, but that we will lock it up, we will pay down debt, we will increase the strength and the financial stability of our government and we will honor the trust funds' commitments to recipients of Social Security. That is what the debate is about today. That is what we have created with S. 557. No more, no less. 
   We don't need to quote a lot of history. The American people know what we have done. Most importantly, they are extremely excited about what we are proposing to do. For the first time, there is a strength of honesty and stability to their government with balanced budgets and surpluses that they have not seen for a long while. They are not fearful of debt anymore because debt begins to decline. More importantly, we begin to pay it down so that we have the strength to honor our commitments in the future. 
   That is what S. 557 is all about. I am amazed it finds opposition. I think it ought to be bipartisan. It is, without question, the way to save Social Security: Honor its commitments and project its strength and its modernization into the 21st century. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the conference report on the budget resolution. I extend my sincere congratulations to the chairman of our Budget Committee for the work that he and that committee have so successfully completed in the last number of weeks. In fact, I am extremely pleased with where we are as a Senate at this moment in time. 
   Many of our constituents around the country were frustrated as the Senate convened this year to start with an impeachment process of the President, fearing that we would be so bogged down in that that we would not get to the work of our people and get to the work of Government and to processes like the budget resolution. 
   Quite the opposite has happened. The Senate responded in a timely and constitutionally proper manner to the impeachment issue and then moved rapidly into its work. As a result, we are here today voting on a budget resolution which will be adopted as a conference report. It will be the second earliest date of adoption of a budget resolution in the 23 years of the Budget Act. That is why I think the chairman of our Budget Committee deserves the congratulations of the Senate and why the American people ought to at least be assured that we are here and at work and doing what we should be doing in behalf of them to make sure their Government responds appropriately to the needs of all of our taxpayers. 
   This budget demonstrates that we can and should have a balanced fiscal program that addresses our Nation's major priorities. If we and future Congresses and the President follow the plan that is now laid before us in this budget resolution, we will pay down the public debt. There will be $463 billion more in debt reduction than the President's budget offered us over the next 10 years. 
   I have had the privilege of serving in Congress for a number of years. I tell my colleagues, I have watched the debt grow, and I voted against most of that growth. Today to be able to vote for debt reduction is a very positive move for this Congress and laying the course for future Congresses to do the same. One-half of the debt held by the public can be paid off in the next decade if we follow the general outlines of the budget that Senator DOMENICI has put before us. We will make sure Social Security revenues are reserved exclusively for Social Security benefits. We will safeguard the current Social Security system for today's seniors and for those who plan to retire in the near future. 
   Mr. President, I, like you, have just returned from my State and from the Easter recess. While I was there, I held what I think is the beginning of a series of town meetings that I will hold across the State on Social Security and its need for modernization. I invited seniors in high school and senior citizens to attend, and they did in large numbers. I was extremely pleased not only by their turnout but by their willingness to listen and react and give me ideas about what they see the Social Security system being and what it ought to be. 
   I told them that we, by our budget here and by balancing the budget and producing surpluses, are providing the country with a generational opportunity to maintain a strong Social Security system while at the same time offering a modernization package that can take young people entering the workforce and paying Social Security through a lifetime of developing an annuity program that would be much like a positive retirement program that they could take with them when they retired and would be substantially more than if they were in the current Social Security system. More importantly, it would not have to address substantial tax increases in Social Security in the outyears beyond 2034 and 2035. 
   So for the first time since 1960, the budget will be balanced without counting Social Security surpluses. We will provide a reasonable and necessary amount for tax relief for working Americans and their families. You heard the Senator from Washington and others in just the last few hours talk about an American taxpayer that is paying his or her taxes today, being taxed at the highest level ever in the history of our country. We are turning that around. 
   I am pleased to be able to be here on the floor today, on a day when most people are going to the post office to pay their taxes, or at least to file their tax returns, to say that we are going to change some of that. While this is a tax cut, I also agree with my colleague from Washington, Senator GORTON, that we ought to be looking at tax reform in the near future that will simplify the Tax Code and make it much less intimidating than it is today to all of us; those who are relatively sophisticated and those who are less sophisticated find it all very intimidating and difficult to comply with. 
   All tax relief will be provided out of the onbudget surplus, that is, the non-Social Security surplus. And $778 billion over 10 years sounds like a lot of tax relief, but it is a tax reduction of less than 3.5 percent. So when some of our colleagues come running to the floor wringing their hands about giving tax breaks when we ought to be spending all this money, as the President wants to do for new programs, let me say to them that we are only offering a 3.5-percent tax reduction against the highest taxes in the history of our country, and we are offering it over a 10-year period. Frankly, it is nowhere near what I hoped it would be, but it clearly moves us in the right direction. 
   This budget continues. The American people demanded fiscal discipline and responsibility in 1994 when they changed the character and culture of the Congress and they said quit building deficits and get your fiscal house in order and control the size of Government. So we abide by the budget caps adopted in 1997 in a bipartisan balanced budget agreement. It continues the spending restraints we began in 1995, a product of that 1994 election and the 1994 Congress--the first Republican Congress in 40 years, which has helped produce the balanced budget and the projected surpluses. 
   This budget fully funds and protects the solvency of Medicare. In that respect, it stands in clear contrast to what the President has proposed, which actually proposed to cut Medicare funding and promised only General Treasury IOUs for the future. I am amazed that that has missed the attention of the press and a lot of the American people since our President proposed it. But it really was a first-class shell game, probably one of the best I have seen produced by this administration, when they said they were doing one thing when, in fact, they were actually doing another. 
   To hand this next generation a whole fist full of IOUs after mounting the hugest debt in the history of our country just doesn't make a lot of sense. So we are not doing that in this budget. We won't do that. It would not be fair, and most important, it would not be responsible. Of course, Medicare still needs the attention in the long term, and Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike--have stepped up and said we ought to do so. Democrat Senator KERREY of Nebraska and Democrat Senator BREAUX of Louisiana worked hard to work with us on a bipartisan, long-term Medicare plan, and it is necessary. 
   Congress ought not to go home this year without doing it. But my guess is that we will because of the politics of it. That should not happen. 
   The fact that a bipartisan Medicare Commission broke down because the President's appointees would not walk up to the line and do what was right--I am not sure why, but my guess is they would like to perpetrate another ``medi-scare'' as a tactic going into the next political cycle. It is pretty unconscionable that anybody would want to do that. But there is really no other explanation for why they failed to do what had to be done because those of us who face the electorate and understand the complications of Medicare  stepped to that line and said reform is necessary and offered a reform package, Democrat and Republican alike. I have mentioned several of those Democrats. So that work is yet to be done. Medicare reform is yet to be dealt with, and I hope we can do it because it is necessary. 
   This budget strengthens America's defense forces too long neglected under this administration. Yet, this is an administration that has used our defense forces more than nearly any other President in a peacetime era. It is time that we make sure that America's sons and daughters who put themselves in harm's way in the protection of our Nation have their interests served. When I speak of their interests being served, I mean making sure that we back them up with equipment and technology, compensate them adequately, and give them the dignified quality of life that anybody in that service deserves. This budget meets the challenges of the 21st century with positive initiatives in agriculture, child care, and education. 
   What I am telling you, Mr. President, is I think this is a pretty darn good budget. It is sound and it is a conservative budget. It recognizes the value of balancing, and it recognizes the reward to the taxpayers that a balanced budget ought to offer. It is good for the economic security of the American family by recognizing that we are going to let them keep some of their hard-earned dollars instead of cycling them to Washington and try to get them back. 
   All of the money that we spend here comes from somebody's hard work, somebody who gets up every morning bright and early and goes to work and works hard for 8, 10, 12 hours a day. They willingly pay a very large chunk of their income to Government. Now that we have balanced the budget, why should we be chasing new Government programs, or bigger Government programs, or programs that ultimately take freedom away from people and their choice? Why should we not be rewarding the taxpayer by saying that we have enough and we are going to send some of it back to you, and we are not going to take it away from you in the future, unless we come to you and ask you for it because there truly is a national need. That is the way good Government works and, very frankly, I think this is a pretty good Government budget. I strongly support it. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote with us for it, and I urge my colleagues to work with the Finance Committee and with the Senate to devise a tax package that is fair and equitable across the board, that recognizes issues such as the marriage penalty, that recognizes an issue such as small family business owners who grow too old to operate their business and want to pass it through to their children and are being denied that because the children would have to sell it to pay the taxes on it. 
   That is a great tragedy in the American dream--how our Government ever got crosswise with the idea of a family being able to pass down through the generations a business that they have built and has grown over the years and now have to sell to pay the inheritance tax, the death tax. 
   Now, I am not suggesting that if it doesn't move in the family and it is simply sold at the end of a generation, it ought not to receive some tax. But when we are talking small, privately held businesses, farms and ranches, Main Street small businesses that make our country work so well, and then find out that mom and dad can't hand it to a son or daughter without the Government taking nearly all of it, or the son and daughter then spending their lifetime to buy it back, 
   frankly, that is wrong. I and others have worked a long time to reduce the death tax. We have been able to do some of that. Why don't we just eliminate it, or deal with it in a way which says that if that asset moves out to be sold in the marketplace as an asset for sale then it comes under the normal tax of the income of an individual with the proper considerations against depreciation and all of that? That would be fair. That would be just. We should deal with our countrymen in a way that says we recognize that those who work for the American dream ought to be allowed to pass that dream forward to the next generation. That is one of those kinds of tax reforms I hope we can get at this year. 
   There are a good many others that our colleagues are working on and that will be embodied in the tax relief package that is placed in this to this budget resolution. 
   Once again, let me praise the chairman of our Budget Committee, and that committee and the will of the Republican Congress that says that a balanced budget is something we will keep and continue to work for and that surpluses should be handed back as rewards to the American taxpayer instead of spent. That is what this budget does. I am proud to have been a part of it. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is with mixed emotions that I offer this congratulatory statement to George R. Stephens, a long-time GPO liaison to the Senate Republican Policy Committee, on the eve of his retirement. George has been a part of the Policy Committee family for so long that we've practically forgotten he's on a different payroll. In fact, his tenure with the Committee long precedes my service as Committee Chairman. 
   But, let's start at the beginning. George R. Stephens began his employment with the Government Printing Office in 1969, following in his mother's--and his grandmother's--footsteps. George's mother, Ella Stephens, joined GPO in 1950 as a ``clerk-typist.'' George's first GPO job was a Linotype operator. After a short stint in the private sector, George returned to work at GPO's headquarters for about 10 years. In January of 1981, he began his 18-year service as a GPO liaison to the U.S. Senate, assigned to the Republican Policy Committee (RPC) as a printer/proofreader. The position included aiding the RPC in publishing its Record Vote Analysis, a publication the Committee has provided continually since its inception in 1947. 
   George has served under four Policy Committee chairmen: John Tower of Texas; Bill Armstrong of Colorado; DON NICKLES; and now myself. It must have been a challenge for a nonpartisan federal employee to work in the single large committee room that houses the dedicated, outspoken, and decidedly opinionated RPC staff, engaged in near-constant discourse about how to solve the problems of the day. To his credit, George's professionalism and nonpartisanship never wavered, yet he is accepted as a full-fledged member of our Policy Committee family. I think it's fair to say he appreciates our party's dedication to keeping government in its place--that is, good government, but not Big Government. 
   George has certainly been an energetic advocate for the good government work of his employer, Congress' printer. In a letter to the editor to Roll Call in 1995 responding to that newspaper's call for increased privatization of GPO services, George wrote, ``..... There isn't another printing company on this earth capable of producing such large jobs so quickly and with the high standards to which Members have become accustomed. Newcomers to Washington quickly learn that GPO prints and delivers the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and the Federal Register on a daily basis. They also learn that its ability to have printed bills and other documents available within hours of their drafting is essential to the  smooth and timely operation of Senate proceedings.'' 
   George's years of service with the GPO span an era of unprecedented growth in technology. From typewriters and hot metal typesetting, to so-called cold press, to computer desktop publishing, fiber optics, CD-Rom's and online publishing, George has witnessed truly revolutionary changes to the world of printing. However, one thing has not changed: our government's commitment to assure public access to government information. George is part of that proud tradition. 
   While some witnesses to a revolution turn and run in fear of the unknown, George has embraced each development along the way. His eagerness to keep up with changing technology has been an asset to our Committee, but his eagerness is not limited to technology. This is a man who loves his job. With a record that likely competes with any postman, George travels 60 miles each way every day to arrive at work on time, no matter the weather or traffic conditions. His dedication is commendable. 
   But George will not be remembered simply for his work as our Committee's GPO liaison. He's also an avid ham radio operator, and for 13 years has served as president of the Capitol Hill Amateur Radio Society. The club was formally established in 1969, and, at the urging of Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, it established a station in the Russell Senate office building. That station has been maintained on a voluntary basis, without any government funds, ever since. Over the years, the club has stood ready to provide communications in the event of a disaster, and to help connect military personnel overseas with their friends or family members. In one of its many accomplishments under George's leadership, the club in 1991 hosted a commemoration of the bicentennial of the birth of Samuel F.B. Morse, by reenacting Morse's historic 1844 message, ``What hath God wrought!'' from the Nation's Capitol to Baltimore. The telegraph instruments used for the re-enactment were loaned by the Smithsonian Institution, and because the society's members are proficient in Morse code, the re-enactment was historically accurate. 
   Yet, things have a way of changing. Like hot metal typesetting, ham radio is truly a phenomenon of the 20th century. The advent of the computer and the Internet age have reduced ham radio's appeal. And so now, when George goes, so too goes the Capitol Hill Amateur Radio Club. On George's last day of government service, April 30, the club will disband, the equipment will be donated to a foundation, the antenna removed from the Russell roof. The callsign ``W3USS'' will remain alive but inactive. This marks the end of a remarkable era. 
   So, let us look to the future. George and his wife Bea live in a little southern Maryland town called Avenue. His house is right on the water, but George doesn't own a boat. He says he's never had time for boating. Now, he's looking at buying a nice little 24-foot or 30-foot ``party boat'' so he can host friends in an occasional leisure-filled afternoon on the lower Potomac. Perhaps, after that little purchase, he won't miss us all quite so much! 
   In closing, on behalf of myself, and of the current and former staff of the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, I wish to offer heartfelt thanks for George's many valuable years of service, and our hopes that he and his wife enjoy many happy and healthy years of retirement. We truly cannot give enough thanks to someone who has dedicated himself to making sure we Senators--literally--dot our `i's' and cross our `t's'.

   Mr. CRAIG. I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   My amendment would require that new mandatory spending programs be paid for with savings in existing mandatory programs, and it would establish a 60-vote point of order. We have known--since we have had limits on discretionary programs as the chart beside me demonstrates--a progressive reduction in the overall size of the discretionary spending within our budget. 
   My amendment does not affect any existing mandatory program. My amendment does not impact any current or future beneficiary of existing programs. What I am talking about is new mandatory, new direct spending programs, and it doesn't eliminate them, either. It simply requires that any Senator who brings that kind of program to the floor must experience the support of at least 60 of the Members of the Senate to be able to withstand this point of order. 
   My amendment will not prevent a tax increase and its use of debt and deficit reduction. That is simply not the case. It simply puts on equal footing new spending in mandatory areas, along with current discretionary spending. 
   My amendment institutes a milder version of the same spending restrictions that have applied to appropriated spending programs since 1990. I think it is easy to understand. Last year we received 54 votes. It is a bipartisan effort. Senator KERREY will speak to it. Senator ROBB and 
   Senator BYRD have supported me in this effort, and have indicated their continued support in that area. It is that very effort that limits the kind of growth in our budget that we have always tried to do in creating balance. 
   Senator KERREY has arrived on the floor, and I yield him the remainder of our time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Let me conclude using my 30 seconds to say that it does not impact, as the Senator has just said, current programs. We are talking new creations, new ideas, new entitlement programs--not Social Security, not Medicare, not those kinds of critical programs that this Congress and this Senate attempt to strengthen and protect. 
   I am talking about the new ideas that come along. It doesn't limit them, either. It simply says that you have to gain the 60-vote majority here in the Senate; you have to find new revenue sources for them or pull revenue from existing mandatory areas. 
   As the Senator from Nebraska has so clearly spoken, it brings on balance in our budget new mandatory programs with current discretionary programs. 
   Here is the simple relationship: The red on the chart shows the progressive decline in discretionary spending since we have had pay-go enforcement there. This has been the kind of growth in mandatory when we had none of that budget authority, and, therefore, budget restriction. 
   That is the issue of this amendment. I encourage my colleagues here in the Senate to support it.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska, Senator KERREY, and I have joined together in our effort to control the overall growth of government. We are asking that the Senate apply a 60-vote requirement to any new entitlement program--not new spending in existing entitlement programs, but new entitlement programs--exactly as we treat any growth in discretionary spending. It would take a 60-vote point of order for us to add new entitlement programs and spend new money. 
   I think it is a requirement that this Senate should have. Last year, 54 Senators voted for it. It is bipartisan in its character to control the overall growth of government. We think it is appropriate that it be spent that way. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that ensures the public will have a say in the management of our public lands. I am pleased that Senators MURKOWSKI, LOTT, STEVENS, BURNS, GORDON SMITH, CRAPO, SHELBY, HAGEL, and BENNETT are joining me as original cosponsors. 
   After President Clinton's proclamation of four years ago, declaring nearly two million acres of southern Utah a national monument, I introduced the Idaho Protection Act of 1999. That bill would have required that the public and the Congress be included before a national monument could be established in Idaho. When I introduced that bill, I was immediately approached by other Senators seeking the same protection for their state. This bill, The National Monument Public Participation Act, will provide that protection to all states. 
   The National Monument Public Participation Act amends the Antiquities Act to require the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to provide an opportunity for public involvement prior to the designation of a national monument. It establishes procedures to give the public and local, State, and federal governments adequate notice and opportunity to comment on, and participate in, the formulation of plans for the declaration of national monuments on public lands. 
   Under the 1906 Antiquities Act, the President has the unilateral authority to create a national monument where none existed before. In fact, since 1906, the law has been used some 66 times to set lands aside. It is important to note that with very few exceptions, these declarations occurred before enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which recognized the need for public involvement in such issues and mandated public comment periods before such decisions are made. 
   The most recent use of the Antiquities Act came on September 18, 1996, with Presidential Proclamation 6920, Establishment of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Without including Utah's Governor, Senators, congressional delegation, the State legislature, county commissioners, or the people of Utah--President Clinton set off-limits forever approximately 1.7 million acres of Utah. What the President did in Utah, without public input, could also be done in Idaho or any other States where the federal government has a presence. That must not be allowed to happen. 
   My state of Idaho is 63 percent federal lands. Within Idaho's boundaries, we have one National Historic Park, one National Reserve, two National Recreation Areas, and five Wilderness Areas, just to name the major federally designated natural resource areas. This amounts to approximately 4.8 million acres, or to put things in perspective, the size of the state of New Jersey. Each of these designations has had public involvement and consent of Congress before being designated. As you can tell, the public process has worked in the past, in my state, and I believe it will continue to work in the future. 
   In Idaho, each of these National designations generated concerns among those affected by the designation, but with the public process, we were able to work through most of the concerns before the designation was made. Individuals who would be affected by the National designation had time to prepare, but Utah was not as fortunate. With the overnight designation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the local communities, and the State and federal agencies were left to pick up the pieces and work out all the ``details.'' 
   The President's action in Utah has been a wake-up call to people across America.We all want to preserve what is best in our States, and I understand and support the need to protect valuable resources. That is why this bill will not, in any way, affect the ability of the federal government to make emergency withdrawals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). If an area is truly worthy of a National Monument designation, Congress will make that designation during the time frame provided in FLPMA. 
   Our public lands are a national asset that we all treasure and enjoy. Westerners are especially proud of their public lands and have a stake in the management of these lands, but people everywhere also understand that much of their economic future is tied up in what happens on their public lands. 
   In the West, where public lands dominate the landscape, issues such as grazing, timber harvesting, water use, and recreation access have all come under attack by this administration seemingly bent upon kowtowing to a segment of our population that wants these uses kicked off our public lands. 
   Everyone wants public lands decisions to be made in an open and inclusive process. No one wants the President, acting alone, to unilaterally lock up enormous parts of any State. We certainly don't work that way in the West. There is a recognition that with common sense, a balance can be struck that allows jobs to grow and families to put down roots while at the same time protecting America's great natural resources.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the bill I introduce is the Hydroelectric Licensing Process Improvement Act of 1999. As its title suggests, the purpose of the bill is to improve the process by which non-federal hydroelectric projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
   I introduced a similar bill late in the 105th Congress after hearings on this issue in both the House and Senate. Hydropower represents ten percent of the energy produced in the United States, and approximately 85% of all renewable energy generation. This, Mr. President, is a significant portion of our nation's electricity, produced without air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions, and it is accomplished at relatively low cost. 
   The Commission for many years since its creation in 1920, controlled our nation's water power potential with uncompromising authority. However, since 1972, a number of environmental statutes, amendments to the Federal Power Act, Commission regulations, licensing and policy decisions, and several critical court decisions, has made the Commission's licensing process extremely costly, time consuming, and, at times, arbitrary. Indeed, the current Commission licensing program is burdened with mixed mandates and redundant bureaucracy and prone to gridlock and litigation. 
   Under current law, several federal agencies are required to set conditions for licenses without regard to the effects those conditions have on project economics, energy benefits, impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and values protected by other statutes and regulations. Far too often we have agencies fighting agencies and issuing inconsistent demands. 
   The consequent delays in processing hydropower applications result in significant business costs and lost capacity. For example, according to a September 1997 study of the U.S. Department of Energy, since 1987, of 52 peaking projects relicensed by the Commission, four projects increased capacity, and 48 decreased capacity. In simple terms, those 48 projects became less productive as a result of the relicensing process at the Commission than they were prior to relicensing. Ninety-two percent of the peaking projects since 1987 lost capacity. 
   In addition, faced with the uncertainties currently plaguing the relicensing process, some existing licensees are contemplating abandonment of their projects. This is of concern to the nation because two-thirds of all non-federal hydropower capacity is up for relicensing in the next fifteen years. By the year 2010, 220 projects will be subject to the relicensing process. 
   Publicly owned hydropower projects constitute nearly 50% of the total capacity that will be up for renewal. The problems resulting in lost capacity, coupled with the momentous changes occurring in the electricity industry and the increasing need for emissions free sources of power, all underscore the need for Congressional action to reform hydroelectric licensing. 
   Moreoever, the loss of a hydropower project means more than the loss of clean, efficient, renewable electric power. Hydropower projects provide drinking water, flood control, fish and wildlife habitat, irrigation, transportation, environmental enhancement  funding and recreation benefits. Also, due to its unique load-following capability, peaking capacity and voltage stability attributes, hydropower plays a critical role in maintaining our nation's reliable electric service. 
   My bill, which is currently co-sponsored by fellow Idahoan Senator MIKE CRAPO, and Senators CONRAD BURNS and ROD GRAMS, will remedy the inefficient and complex Commission licensing process by ensuring that federal agencies involved in the process act in a timely and accountable manner. 
   My bill does not change or modify any existing environmental laws, nor remove regulatory authority from various agencies. It does not call for the repeal of mandatory conditioning authority of appropriate federal agencies. Rather, it requires participating agencies to consider, and be accountable for, the full effects of their actions before imposing mandatory conditions on a Commission issued license. 
   It is clear to me and many of my colleagues here in the Senate that hydropower is at risk. Clearly, one of the most important tasks for energy policymakers in the 21st Century is to develop an energy strategy that will ensure an adequate supply of reasonably priced, reliable energy to all American consumers in an environmentally responsible manner. The relicensing of non-federal hydropower can and should continue to be an important and viable element in this strategy.

   Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I am here to join my colleague from Alaska and others who have spoken with great concern about the situation in Kosovo, and as it transpires, some of our feelings and concerns about what this country might do, and most importantly, what this country should not do. 
   The Presiding Officer and I, on a weekly basis, engage ourselves in a telephone/radio conversation with a news program in Boise, ID. I was involved in that program yesterday morning, speaking about the atrocities in Kosovo, when I used the expression ``human hatred.'' This is not a difference in policy. This is not even a difference between Serbia and Kosovo in territory. This is a difference spelled out by 300 years of hatred, hatred that had boiled up out of differences of religious beliefs, and it is a hatred that has prevailed in the region so long and had cost so many lives that it is almost incalculable. Certainly in this American's mind it is. I have never known hatred of that kind. 
   After that radio conversation was over, the emcee of that program asked if I would stay on the line and we visited privately. He reflected to me about how he and his wife had in their home an exchange student from Serbia. He said, ``You know, Senator CRAIG, you were absolutely right to use the term `hate.' '' He said, ``When we broached this subject with this young exchange student,'' I believe a junior in high school, he said, ``we were astounded by the hatred that rolled up out of this young man. Because he believed that the only solution to the problem in Kosovo was to kill the Kosovars or to simply run them out of the country, and that if his forefathers had done that, they would have a peaceful nation today, and the only solution for peace in greater Serbia was just that.'' 
   That is exactly what Milosevic is doing as we speak. The term, for diplomatic reasons, is ``ethnic cleansing.'' It is quite simple, what it is. It is: Either get out of my way or I'll kill you; or get out of my country or I'll kill you, even though the country you are being asked to leave has been your 
   country for 4, 5, 6, 10--20 generations before you. 
   I think the current Presiding Officer and I would be hard put if somebody said: Idaho is not your home and you have to leave or we will kill you. That is what we are caught up in, those kinds of human dynamics. I must tell you, as an American I am drawn to the humanitarian arguments. It makes it very simple if you are drawn totally to those arguments to justify putting our men and women in uniform at risk. 
   But I am not totally drawn to those arguments because, if I am, then what the President is proposing to do at this moment might be justifiable if he would follow certain procedures. It is those procedures I think we must talk this morning. It is those procedures the Senate will vote on, or about, within a few hours. We are talking about U.S. military activity over and on the soil of Serbia, an independent, autonomous nation. That nation is at war at this moment. It is a civil strife over the province of Kosovo, which would be like the State of Idaho within the United States of America. We would not call that a world interest, if Idahoans were fighting the rest of the United States for Idaho's independence. I think the country would react violently if Great Britain or NATO or Russia, for that matter, sided with Idahoans against the United States if we were attempting to break loose from the United States of America. 
   Is that a reasonable parallel? Yes, I think it is, because that is the character of the political profile and the international structure in which we are about to engage ourselves. Kosovo is a place that most Americans could not find on a map, a place in which there is no direct American interest. I have defined its structure from a legal point of view, international point of view--a state sovereignty point of view. President Clinton has made it clear for some months that he will intervene there with an open-ended occupation force, perhaps preceded by airstrikes. That has been the context of the debate for the last good many months. Now we are associating ourselves with NATO as a partner of NATO. It appears that airstrikes may be imminent. 
   He has made it clear that he does not think he needs congressional authorization for such a mission. Why? The treaty relationship; our presence in NATO. That is the argument that he  makes. I will have to tell you, though, I think we should not make the mistake of simply arguing that is how you justify a certain approach of the kind that this President is taking. The U.S. airstrikes would be an attack on a sovereign nation. The administration has, in fact, admitted that. The State Department Under Secretary Thomas Pickering confirmed that Kosovo is sovereign territory of Serbia, and that attacking the Serbs because they will not consent to foreign occupation of a part of their territory would be an act of war. Again, hearkening back to the relationship: If Idaho were attempting to break away as an independent State from the United States, that would be called a civil war within the boundaries of the greater United States and this country would look with great concern if a foreign nation were attempting to involve themselves on the side of Idahoans. 
   I have to think this administration's policy is inconsistent with constitutional government and the rule of law. Let us not forget the Constitution of the United States gives the sole power to declare war to the Congress, article I, section 8--not to the President, but to the Congress. Nothing in the laws or the Constitution of the United States suggests 
   that a determination by the United Nations Security Council or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a substitute. 
   The proposed mission in Kosovo is contrary to the principle of national sovereignty and is a major step toward global authority. Just last year we debated the expansion of NATO. I opposed that expansion. I opposed it for the simple reason it did not begin to disengage the United States from an ever-increasing, larger presence in the European Continent. Quite the opposite, it seemed to be expanding our presence. Russia, at that time, was quite concerned that they saw an international organization growing on their border. Now, they were appeased by us saying: Remember, by treaty NATO is a defensive organization. Only if the nations of NATO were attacked would NATO respond. Yet, today, NATO is proposing a major offensive effort against the nation of Serbia, a longstanding friend and once a part of the greater Soviet Union. It is not by accident that the armaments that we would go up against are largely Russian armaments. 
   Now what are we to say to the Russians, ``What we said about NATO last year is not true; NATO has become an offensive force, driven by a certain set of politics or international attitudes as to how the rest of the world ought to look''? 
   Can we justify an American national interest because this war might spread beyond the boundaries of Serbia? I am not sure we yet can do that. I am not sure this President has yet justified that or clearly explained to the American people, as he must, the role that the men and women of our armed services might play and the role that they would play in risking their lives. That is the issue at hand. 
   So, what kind of a precedent are we going to set with this action? All actions establish precedents, especially if they appear to be outside established law or proven law. 
   What country are we going to claim the right to attack next, if we determine that its behavior within its own boundaries, its own territory, is not up to some kind of international test or international standard? Should we attack Turkey to protect the Kurds, China to protect Tibet or Taiwan, India to protect the Muslims in Kashmir? It is reasonable for me to ask those questions on the floor, because today the President is contemplating participating in an attack on Serbia in behalf of the Kosovars. 
   Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and now Kosovo, these missions are profoundly damaging to our legitimate defense needs. This is not just a question of money or stretching defense dollars too far, although that factor will be considered as we debate defense budgets in the near future. Worse, it is an insult to the personnel in our Armed Forces who volunteer to defend America, not to go off on every globalist, nation-building adventure that our President appears to be willing to send them to. No wonder America's best are frustrated by the ever increasing changes in the role of our Armed Forces. 
   Putting American troops in a quagmire is something I know a little bit about. The Presiding Officer and I grew up in a period of American history where Americans were bogged in a quagmire in Southeast Asia, a quagmire that we finally simply had to drop our hands and walk away from, because we could no longer sustain it politically as a nation and we could no longer justify that another 1, 2, or 3 American lives should be lost, added to the list of over 60,000 young men and women of our age who lost their lives there. 
   I am not suggesting that Kosovo is that kind of fight, but I am suggesting that any long-term effort in the greater 
   Yugoslavia that dramatically increases the role of the American soldier could put us at that risk. 
   Mr. President, I have asked some profound questions today and, I think, reasonable questions as to the role of this country in foreign policy and as to the role of the President as the Commander in Chief of our country. 
   Today we are debating and today we will vote on the right of the Congress to express its will to work with the President in shaping foreign policy. I understand how the Constitution works. I understand that our President is the chief foreign policy officer of our country. But when his foreign policy is questioned in the way that it is now being questioned, I think he has the responsibility not only to argue it clearly before the American people but to be willing to argue it here on the floor of the Senate. 
   Some of our leadership are at the White House as I speak, and they are listening to a President who is trying to convince them not to have the vote today here in the Senate. Quite the opposite should be happening. The President should be saying, let us debate this issue, let us vote this issue, and, more importantly, I will go to the American people and sell to them why America ought to be involved in Serbia or in Bosnia, that there are American interests there. He, the President, should lay them out, define them, clarify them and, therefore, justify the potential taking of American life that military adventure can always result in. 
   That is the responsibility of the Presidency, not to simply negotiate with NATO as a treaty organization and then come home to America and say: But we have already debated this, we are already involved in this, we can't back up now or it would implode NATO. Maybe NATO ought to be imploded, if it is becoming an offensive organization. Maybe it ought to step back and say: Wait a moment, we are by treaty only defensive. We should not become adventurists for the sake of a greater international philosophy on how greater Europe ought to be operated. 
   Having said all of that, let me close where I began. There are human atrocities. They are real, and they are horrible. We should engage ourselves in every way possible to help stop that kind of human atrocity, but then again, we didn't do that in Africa on many occasions, all just within the last 4 or 5 years. I am not sure why this is now so important when others were not. Is it because our allies have convinced us? 
   By the way, if we fly aircraft over Serbia, 58 percent, or a very large portion, the majority, of those aircraft will be ours. Is it because we are the ones who have the power and our European allies have convinced us to use that power in their behalf to stabilize their backyard? I am not sure. 
   I, like most Americans, am reasonably confused. I, like most Americans, have had to study to try to understand where Serbia is, where Kosovo is, what the politics of this region are. Those are the issues at hand. 
   This is not a vote that should be taken lightly. This could be the beginning of a very lengthy process, a very costly process, costly in human lives, American lives, and certainly in tax dollars. 
   Those are the issues at hand, Mr. President. Why should you shy from your responsibility as Commander in Chief of going to the American people to debate this and causing your people to come here to debate this, instead of in a close-door session at 
   the White House, pleading with us not to take a vote on this issue? 
   Nobody should be embarrassed by an up-or-down vote. Nobody should be embarrassed by this kind of debate. It is  our responsibility as a country. We cannot walk away from it. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of Senator HUTCHINSON'S bill to protect the states' claims on the funds from the settlement that they negotiated with the tobacco industry, I oppose the Harkin-Specter amendment. 
   I am not a lawyer, and maybe that's why I'm not particularly impressed by all the legal hairsplitting we've been hearing from the government's lawyers about their claim to these funds. But you don't have to be a lawyer to recognize unfairness when you see it. 
   In fact, I think my little granddaughter would recognize the story that's unfolding in Washington today: it's called the ``Little Red Hen.'' As my colleagues probably will recall, this story is about some people doing all the work and other people, who didn't lift a finger to help, wanting to share in the product of that work. 
   In this case, we have the states who initiated lawsuits against the tobacco industry, who took all the risks, who received no assistance from the federal government in making their claims, and who ultimately succeeded in negotiating the historic Master Settlement Agreement last November. Now that the work has been done by these 46 little red hens, and the other four who negotiated individual settlements, the federal government wants to sweep in and take over. 
   Mr. President, I do not think what we have here is an attempt to assert legal rights, but an attempt to assert control. Quite simple, the federal government wants to direct the spending of these funds by the states, despite the fact that this effort is likely to provoke more litigation, which in turn will only prevent the funds from being used to benefit the health or welfare of any state's residents. I do not think the federal government has the law on its side, and I know it doesn't have the equities or even common sense on its side.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today Senator BINGAMAN and I join to introduce a very important piece of legislation, the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act. I'm pleased to have the support of a number of Senators in introducing this legislation: Senators MACK, THURMOND, MIKULSKI, SNOWE, DASCHLE, COLLINS, JOHNSON, CRAPO, DORGAN, HOLLINGS, REED, and CONRAD. This bill simply expands Medicare Part B coverage to give seniors access to medical nutrition therapy services by registered dietitians and other nutrition professionals. Currently there is no direct coverage for services provided by registered dietitians, and, because they are uniquely qualified to provide medical nutrition therapy, beneficiaries are essentially denied access to this cost effective and efficacious form of care. 
   Nutrition is one of the most basic elements of life. From the moment we are born to the moment we die, nutrition plays a critical role. It influences how we grow, how our brain develops, how we feel, and how our bodies prevent and fight disease. For decades we have known that nutrition can influence the most serious life threatening diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and high blood cholesterol. 
   Experts have proven that proper nutrition may not only help prevent disease, but also is central to controlling and treating disease. 
   Medical nutrition therapy plays a major role in treating some of the most threatening illnesses. It significantly improves the quality of life of seriously ill patients. It also saves health care costs by speeding recovery and reducing the incidence of complications, resulting in fewer hospitalizations, shorter hospital stays, and reduced drug, surgery, and treatment needs. 
   Because medical nutrition therapy is not currently covered by Medicare Part B and because more and more health care is delivered on an outpatient basis, many patients are denied access to the effective, low-tech treatment they need, resulting in an increased incidence of complications and a need for higher cost treatments. 
   Medical nutritional therapy is an integral part of cost effective health care. 
   Our legislation would remedy this defect in Medicare Part B, improving health care and lowering costs. I invite all our colleagues to join Senator BINGAMAN and myself in working for this important reform.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator BAUCUS in the introduction of legislation to reform the federal agricultural crop insurance program. Like legislation introduced earlier this month by Senator ROBERTS, KERREY, myself, and others, this bill aims at bringing about common sense reform to the program and will assist farmers through the economic hardship they currently face. 
   The bill addresses several concerns farmers from my state and I have about the current crop insurance program. Specifically, I am pleased that the legislation includes provisions to reform the noninsured crop disaster assistance program, or NAP. NAP is used by farmers who grow ``specialty'' or ``minor'' crops across the nation. 
   Idaho's great agricultural economy is based on minor and non-traditional crops. We lead the nation in the production of such crops as potatoes, winter peas, and trout. Idaho is second in the production of seed peas, lentils, sugar beets, barley, and mint. Furthermore, we are in the top 5 states in the production of hops, onions, plums, sweet cherries, alfalfa, and American cheese. The needs of these producers are just as important as those of more traditional farm commodity producers. 
   I believe this bill to be an important step toward meaningful and sweeping  reform and includes changes that are long overdue. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Agricultural Committee to enact these important reforms and give farmers the risk management tools they need.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing along with Senator MURKOWSKI, the National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1999. This is an act that has been very beneficial to the Nation and deserves to be reauthorized. 
   The National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Act (NCGMA) was originally signed into law in 1992. The purpose of this geologic mapping program is to provide the nation with urgently needed geologic maps that can be and are used by a diverse clientele. These maps are vital to understanding groundwater regimes, mineral resources, geologic hazards such as landslides and earthquakes, geology essential for all types of land use planning, as well as providing basic scientific data. The NCGMA contains three parts; FedMap--the U.S. Geological Survey's geologic mapping program, StateMap--the state geological survey's part of the act, and EdMap--a program to encourage the training of future geologic mappers at our colleges and universities. 
   StateMap is a competitive program wherein the states submit proposals for geologic mapping that are critiqued by a peer review panel. A requirement of this section of the legislation is that each federal dollar be matched one-for-one with state funds. Each participating state has a StateMap Advisory Committee to insure that its proposal addresses priority areas and needs. The success of this program insured reauthorization of similar legislation in 1997 with widespread bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. 
   According to a recent poll conducted by the Association of American State Geologists, the 50 states have produced over 1,900 new geologic maps since the program authorized by this legislation started. There are an additional 300 maps currently being completed. Also, the states have digitized 650 existing geologic maps (1:24,000 scale) so they can be used as a computer data base. All of these maps have been submitted to the U.S. Geological Survey for inclusion in a national geologic map database. One of the purposes of this database is to eventually provide a digital geologic map of the entire nation at a scale of 1:100,000. This national database will assure that future maps will be easy to use by anyone. 
   The Edmap and Fedmap sections of the legislation support mapping projects led by Universities and regional mapping projects that address needs for geologic information to deal with land, water, mineral resource, natural hazard mitigation and environmental protection issues. Fed map projects are coordinated with State and university mapping portions of the program, through regional meetings, liaison groups and national reviews of ongoing projects. 
   Mr. President, the National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act benefits numerous citizens every day by assuring there is accurate and usable geologic information available to communities and individuals so better and safer resource use decisions can be made. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and am committed to its timely consideration.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with my colleague, Senator FRANK MURKOWSKI of Alaska, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Senator ROD GRAMS to introduce the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999. 
   Once again, Congress must clarify its intention toward the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. It is for this reason that I introduced the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, which passed with broad bipartisan support in this body last year, as did similar legislation in the other body. It is why I am an original cosponsor of the legislation this year. 
   We must resolve the problem that this Nation faces with disposing of nuclear materials. Congress must recognize its responsibility to set a clear and definitive nuclear material disposal policy. With the passage of this legislation in the last Congress, the Senate expressed its will that Government fulfill its responsibilities. This legislation makes one significant change to the course we are currently on by directing that an interim storage facility for nuclear materials be constructed at area 25 at the Nevada test site and that the interim facility be prepared to accept nuclear materials by June 30, 2003. 
   The President and the Vice President do not support this provision. They do not support an interim storage facility at one safe, secure location in the Nevada desert. What they do support, according to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, is an interim storage at 70 some sites spread across this Nation. They support storage near population centers and major bodies of water, but not at a site located right next to a permanent repository, a site where hundreds of nuclear explosions have already been detonated over the last 50 years. 
   In an announcement last month, the administration proposes to federalize storage of spent fuel at commercial reactors around this country by having the Government come in and take responsibility for each site. But do not worry, folks, because they promise to come and pick up the waste eventually, or at least that is what they have been promising for a long, long while. Well, I have some experience with the DOE and its promises, as many of my colleagues have, especially in the area of nuclear waste over the last number of years. 
   In 1995, the Secretary of Energy promised the State of Idaho, and signed a court enforceable agreement, that transuranic waste in Idaho would be headed out of the State to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant no later than next month. Now DOE says they can't meet that deadline. Why? The Environmental Protection Agency has said that the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is safe and ready to receive waste, but the State of New Mexico won't issue a permit for the disposal and that the court won't lift its injunction. 
   Now, I do believe our Secretary of Energy is trying in good faith to honor his commitment to the State of Idaho in moving that waste, but, once again, on issues of this kind of political sensitivity, our Government has shown no willingness to lead on this issue, and this administration is the prime example of a government without leadership. 
   I know something about the politics of nuclear waste. I know something about DOE's broken promises. I mentioned the example of WIPP as a misuse of environmental regulation to subvert the will of Congress. It is this kind of game playing that we must eliminate. 
   I guess my bottom line advice to those living next to one of these commercial nuclear reactors is, when DOE says they will come in and take responsibility for spent fuel and move it later, do not be fooled. You need a centralized interim storage facility and you need this legislation to make it happen. 
   This administration has said that interim storage in Nevada will prejudge the repository site investigation now going on at Yucca Mountain. I think it is important to note that this legislation calls for beginning operation of an interim storage facility in the year 2003, 2 years after DOE will have recommended the repository site to the President and 1 year after DOE will have submitted a license application for the repository to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This can hardly be called rushing ahead recklessly on interim storage. What it is is sealing the deal, trying to build credibility with the American people on this Government's responsibility and dedication toward the appropriate handling of high-level nuclear waste. 
   In addition to the billions of dollars that utility ratepayers have contributed to the disposal fund, taxpayers have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the disposal program for the removal of spent fuel and nuclear waste from the Nation's national laboratory sites. This legislation will make good on the Government's commitment to the communities which agreed to host our defense laboratories--that cleanup of these sites will happen, that it will happen sooner rather than later, and that defense nuclear waste, our legacy from the cold war, will be disposed of responsibly. 
   Just this past week, before the appropriate Appropriations Committee, I and Senator DOMENICI heard at length what this administration is doing to help Russia get rid of its cold war nuclear waste legacy. While we are going headlong to help them, it is ironic that we cannot help ourselves. This administration has promised and yet, in 6 years, has delivered nothing and finally gave up on its promises and found itself in a box canyon with a lot of lawyers lining up in lawsuits, because they are now out of compliance with an act that this Congress passed in the mid-1980s to deal with nuclear waste.  
   This bill will assure that the spent fuel from our nuclear fighting ships and submarines, currently stored at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, can be sent to the interim storage facility beginning in the year 2003. This is good news for both the Navy and for Idaho. Our nuclear Navy ought to be concerned that DOE is still playing games with the real hard fact that sooner, rather than later, they must have a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel coming from our Navy vessels. 
   Spent nuclear fuel will be moved out of Idaho well before the agreed date of the year 2035 called for in the agreement between Idaho Governor Batt, DOE and the Navy. This legislation will provide assurance that nuclear waste now in Idaho for permanent storage will eventually be disposed of at the repository. The tragedy here, of course, and we understand it, in the building of safe facilities, is the long lead time necessary. That is why this legislation is important now, to construct an interim storage facility ready to receive by the year 2003. 
   Critics of this legislation will attempt to distract you over the issue of transportation. In just a few months we will hear on the floor of the Senate the term ``mobile Chernobyl.'' This is just so much politics or political statement. There is absolutely no fact or record behind that statement other than a scare tactic that some of my colleagues will attempt to use to support an absence of fact. The fact is that there have been over 2,500 commercial shipments of spent fuel in the United States and that there has not been a single death or injury from the radioactivity nature of the cargo. In my State of Idaho, there have been over 600 shipments of naval fuel and over 4,000 other shipments of radioactive material. Again, there has been not one single injury related to the radioactive nature of these shipments. 
   This is a phenomenal safety record, but it is a real safety record, because this Government has insisted that the appropriate handling of our spent nuclear fuels and waste long term be dealt with in the right way. The proof is in the reality and the responsibility that this country has taken for years in the transportation of its waste. Those are the facts as I have related them. 
   I know that many people would prefer not to address the problem of spent nuclear fuel disposal. Some of my colleagues are probably fatigued at the prospect of debating this issue once again in the 106th Congress. Unfortunately, as long as this administration continues to stick its head in the sand, sand that is now going to cost millions of dollars in legal fees, my colleagues and I have no choice but to address this issue once again for the sake of our country, for the future of energy production in our country from radioactive materials, and just the tremendous responsibility we have in making sure to our public that all of it is done well and safely. 
   As this legislative body sets policies for the Nation, the Congress cannot sit by and watch while key components of the energy security of this Nation, the source of 20 percent of this country's electricity--and that is coming from nuclear powerplants--risk going down simply because we cannot manage our waste. 
   The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999 will address what neither the 1982 nor the 1987 Act did, and that is to provide a cost-effective and safe means to store spent fuel in the near term while we continue to investigate and provide for the ultimate disposal. 
   I thank you, Mr. President. I see my colleague, the chairman of the full committee, has joined me now on the floor. I yield my time.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the senior Senator from Missouri. He speaks so clearly about the frustration that exists at local levels today of decisionmaking for education, in that sometimes what might work in New York City just does not seem to fit down on the farm or near the farm in Missouri or in a rural school district of Idaho, and that is the reason for a demonstration program of 12 States. That is why we have determined that a greater amount of flexibility is necessary in the area of education. 
   For the life of me, I cannot understand why Democrats want to block this bipartisan bill in the name of education. There is adequate time to debate other issues in education. I hope they will work with us. Coming out of the impeachment process I thought we were going to get a bipartisan environment from which to move the Nation's business forward. The Nation, I hope, is listening today. The Nation's business is education. And it isn't moving forward. It isn't moving forward not because of Republicans but because of some folks on the other side of the aisle who think their agenda of larger Federal involvement and greater Federal control is an approach to educate our young people. Let the parents, the educators and the school boards decide. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friends and colleagues Senators ROBERTS and KERREY as a cosponsor of legislation being introduced today to reform the Federal agricultural crop insurance program. I am proud to stand with these leaders in purposing sweeping legislation to bring back some normalcy to our Nation's farm economy and expand the risk management tools available to our farm and ranch families. 
   The bill addresses several concerns farmers from my state and I have about the current crop insurance program. Specifically, I am pleased that the legislation includes provisions to establish an APH history adjustment for beginning farmers and multi-year disasters. In addition, removing the exclusion for livestock coverage is long overdue. 
   By cosponsoring this legislation today, I do not wish to imply that our search for meaningful crop insurance reform ideas has been completed. Just the contrary--I see this bill as a reasonable and appropriate first step toward our long-term goal of providing real risk management tools to our farmers and ranchers. 
   While I am pleased that the bill includes provisions that allow the Risk Management Agency to develop policies for ``speciality'' or ``minor'' crops and for crops in under-served areas, I look forward to working with my colleagues to develop even stronger and more beneficial risk management tools for these producers. Idaho's great agricultural economy is based on minor and nontraditional crops. We lead the nation in the production of such crops as potatoes, winter peas, and trout. Idaho is second in the production of seed peas, lentils, sugar beets, barley and mint. Furthermore, we are in the top five states in the production of hops, onions, plums, sweet cherries, alfalfa, and American cheese. 
   The needs of these producers are just as important as those of more traditional farm commodities. I want to assure my colleagues that I will continue to work for the resolution of this and other matters as our effort to reform Federal crop insurance progresses.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Missouri and others who have spoken on the floor in relation to the legislation that we will begin to debate next Tuesday, I believe, Senate bill 280. We are calling it the Ed-Flex bill because of a demonstration project that has now gone on in 12 other States in our country where school districts have demonstrated that, given the flexibility to move dollars around, they can accomplish great things for the young people they are responsible for educating. 
   So for the rest of our country, I think the Senator from Missouri and I want to see a similar kind of flexibility. 
   What does it mean? It is very clear what it means. It means that when it comes to educating the young people of our country, we basically trust parents a great deal more than we trust bureaucrats. 
   For a long time, we felt that the promotion of education in our country would come only if you could have a national department of education, and from that would flow all good things to the rest of the country, and they would serve as the leaders to project our States and our school districts into the dynamics of improving our public education system. We found out that while there is a department of education necessary on occasion, that the real energy comes from a local school district, or a State, or a group of parents who do not like what they see, or the direction their children's education is heading in, and they want to make changes. 
   I am not at all opposed to public education. How could I be? I, my wife, and all of our children are the products of the public education system. And we are very proud of it. In Idaho we have a very good public education system that could be a great deal better. The Governor of the State of Idaho, former Senator here in this body, just elected, has recognized in our State that one of the greatest needs is in the area of reading. Should he be allowed, along with local school districts, to shift to more concentration on reading from the first grade through to the fourth or fifth grade? If that is what Idaho needs, that is what he should be allowed to do. Even within that context, in some school districts in our State reading has already been a higher priority, and those students are doing better. 
   In the State of Texas, which has been able to operate under this demonstration project that we now want to send nationwide, the students there are outperforming others, because once again school districts are allowed to focus, to target, and on their standardized test scores they are moving up faster than they are in other States. 
   In Maryland, students are receiving a one-on-one tutoring--again, a demonstration on the part of the school districts that in Maryland they needed to focus on reading. That one-on-one relationship might otherwise be denied under the concept that a one-size education program fits all which would not have allowed the students to do so. 
   There are a good many stories out there. It is from those stories, those clear examples of understanding, that we bring S. 280 to the floor. I think it has the kind of dynamics we ought to be involved in. For some time we Republicans have recognized that bureaucracies just don't educate. They burn up a lot of 
   money. They direct a lot of very well-meaning people sometimes in the wrong directions. 
   Where it works is when the money gets to the local levels where parents, along with their educators, can determine what the needs are in a given area. That, of course, has always historically produced one of the most dynamic public systems in the Nation, in the world, and that is our public education system, stalled out in a good number of years simply because it did not have the flexibility to respond. 
   At this level we are going to put more dollars into education. We believe that is a high national priority. Unlike those of the past where money should have come from the State and local units, we are committed in our opportunity of surplus years to put some of those dollars into education, and in so doing, we don't want them to get hung up here where 25 or 30 percent will be spun over into bureaucratic inertia. We want them to flow directly to our units of education at the local level. 
   Ed-Flex, Senate bill 280, offers us that opportunity. We begin to debate it next week. I hope we can have strong bipartisan support in what is an extremely valuable initiative. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
   Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is my distinct privilege to rise today to thank Brigadier General Randall M. ``Mark'' Schmidt for his service as commander of the 366th Wing, Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. General Schmidt has been at Mountain Home since August of 1997, and will soon move on to reassignment as commander, Joint Task Force, Southwest Asia. 
   I have long been proud of the 366th Wing. The Wing's motto is, ``Anywhere, anytime,'' Mountain Home is unique because it is the Air Force's only air intervention composite wing. The 366th is ready to deploy on a moment's notice with its own integrated command, control, communications, and intelligence capabilities. The Wing is a composite force already built and trained, ready to fight and intervene anytime, any where. However, it is clear that the reason this concept has been a success is because of the dedicated patriots who have had the privilege to serve at Mountain Home. Commander Schmidt has exemplified that tradition. 
   By all accounts, General Schmidt's service has been nothing short of extraordinary. He has made the goal of ``one community'' a reality at Mountain Home. He has integrated every airman, regardless of rank, to be part of the 366th team. He puts his words into action. The biggest testiment to his talent is the fine work of men and women who are part of the 366th. Indeed, Mountain Home and Idaho have been fortunate to have him. 
   However, Commander Schmidt's talents do not come as a surprise to me. As a Westerner, a former rancher, and a history buff, I have always been captivated by the pioneer spirit. It is that spirit which brought many of our ancestor to America, and some of them across America to settle in the West. It is that same spirit that isn't afraid of challenges, hardships or hard work, which can be measured and found throughout this great nation, and is at certainly home in the men and women of the United States Air Force. 
   In addition to saying thank you, let me also take this opportunity to congratulate Commander Schmidt. Secretary Cohen has selected him to be one of a small, select group of Brigadier Generals nominated for promotion to Major General. As he prepares to leave for the desert to serve on joint command, I hope and believe that he will always consider himself an Idahoan. 
   General Schmidt, thank you, congratulations, and godspeed.

   Mr. CRAIG. I promised to share with the people of Idaho and the nation what comments I made in the closed session of the Senate deliberating on the impeachment of President Clinton. 
   What I told my colleagues as we deliberated was this: 
   If we were in a church, the minister would admonish us from the pulpit to hate the sin and forgive the sinner. But we're not in a church. 
   If we were in a court of law, the judge would tell us to hate the crime, and punish the criminal. But we're not in a court of law. 
   We're part of a constitutionally-directed impeachment tribunal, and our job is to love the Constitution and protect the office of the president. Our decision should not be about saving or rejecting William Jefferson Clinton, but about protecting the office of the president and keeping our Constitution strong. 
   I believe he committed the crimes and acts charged in the articles of impeachment, and I will vote to convict and remove him from office. 
   That was my statement to the Senators in closed deliberations, and I stand by it today. 
   But this statement was not the full explanation of my vote and my reasoning that I believe is owed to the people of Idaho and the nation. Therefore, let me take a few moments now to clarify why I voted to convict President Clinton on the articles of impeachment. 
   First, I believe the House made its case on the facts. I was persuaded by what I saw, read, and heard that the president deliberately lied under oath in the case brought by Paula Jones to enforce her civil rights. I was also persuaded that he encouraged others to lie under oath and committed other acts designed to obstruct justice. In reaching these conclusions, it was important to me that the Senate is not bound to a specific constitutional or statutory standard in judging the evidence; instead, each Senator is left to his or her own experience and conscience. That is both the political and judicial nature of the impeachment process prescribed by the Constitution. 
   However, reaching this conclusion about the facts does not trigger automatic conviction and removal of the president. A Senator must still resolve two questions: whether the acts committed were the kind of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' warranting removal from office, and whether the interests of the nation are served by removal. Impeachment by the House expresses that chamber's opinion on those two questions, but it is up to the Senate to render final judgment. 
   And it is these two questions that have caused the most perplexity in this impeachment process--not to mention the most furious debate, hand wringing, and logical contortions. 
   For example, we have heard much during these proceedings about proportionality--in other words, about ensuring that the punishment or sanction fits the crime. Some of our colleagues have suggested that while the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice may rise to the level of impeachable offenses, that conclusion is not inevitable on every set of facts. More to the point, they argue there is something in this particular case that diminishes the seriousness of the offense or renders it a private, as opposed to public, crime: perhaps the context of the misdeeds, or the subject matter of the perjury, or the motive behind the obstruction of justice. 
   Yet considerations such as these have not prevented the government from prosecuting citizens who committed such crimes. Furthermore, while we are not bound by statutory definitions of crimes here, these arguments frustrate the very goal our Founders had in mind when they established the extraordinary remedy of impeachment: to protect the executive office and the nation from a lawless president. The Framers of the Constitution believed that governments are established in the first place to protect the rights of the governed. It follows that the most serious breach of duty in public office--the most serious threat to the order of society itself--is for the enforcers of the law to break the law. How much more grave that breach becomes when it is committed by the one individual in the nation who personifies the federal government: the president. How much more abhorrent it is when, in covering up his crimes, that president exploited the very public 
   trust he betrayed. 
   There is no question in my mind that perjury and obstruction of justice are the kind of public crimes that the Founders had in mind, and the House managers have demonstrated these crimes were committed by the president. As for the excuses being desperately sought by some to allow President Clinton to escape accountability, it seems to me that creating such loopholes would require tearing holes in the Constitution--something that cannot be justified to protect this president, or any president. 
   This brings me to the final question: whether the public interest will be served by the president's removal from office. Let me say there are those in my State who have been seeking this result ever since the president was elected, because they simply don't agree with him. I, too, generally disagree--sometimes loudly--with President Clinton's approach to public policy. 
   However, political and policy differences are emphatically not the focus of this question. Instead, the Founders intended us to focus on the safety of the nation. That is a very high threshold, appropriate to the serious impact of the vote we must case. In this case, many are arguing that our nation is not at risk; we're prosperous; the government is not collapsing; there is no immediate or external threat to the country. 
   But I would submit that if a generation of young people are taught by our actions in this case that a lie carries no consequences, then the nation is at risk. If our citizens conclude that lawlessness in the highest office is acceptable, that their elected representatives are complicit in that corruption, and that nothing can be done to stop it, then the nation is at risk. If future presidents think they can go further in lying or obstruction of justice when they apply the ``Clinton Indicator,'' then the nation is at risk. If the Executive Office of the President is occupied by an individual who is generally believed to have lied and betrayed the public trust--if the symbol, the icon of the presidency is compromised, the nation is at risk. 
   Some have suggested that removing this president from office would put the nation at risk. That is false argument and something no one should fear. Instead, we should place our faith in the Constitution and the wisdom of its Framers, who provided a roadmap for a peaceful, swift, and orderly transition of power to the vice president. That transition poses no threat to the nation. 
   On the other hand, I believe exonerating President Clinton with a vote for acquittal does create a threat to our nation. In short, I am convinced that the nation is at risk today--not because of the possibility of the president's removal through the impeachment process, but because of the damage he has caused to the Executive office of the President, and the damage that continues to be done by his remaining in office.  
   For all these reasons, I believe my vote to convict and remove this president from office is an appropriate response, a necessary response, a constitutionally-compelled response. 
   I said at the beginning of this process that it would be my goal to ensure that we proceeded in a fair and constitutional manner. I believe we have done so--and managed along the way to generally rise above partisanship and the politics of the day. While I fundamentally disagree with many of my colleagues in the final result, I salute them for their sincerity and the seriousness of their purpose. No matter what the result, the Senate discharged its constitutional duty well. 
   However, reluctant as I am to say it, I do not believe this sorry chapter in our history is closed. On the first day of this trial, as I watched the Chief Justice take the chair, I was angry--profoundly angry that this president had brought this nation to this point because of his own self-gratification, setting what was good for himself above what was good for the nation. It is unconscionable what the president has put the country through, continues to put the country through, and will continue to put the country through for his own personal and political ends. My differences with the president on this point transcend party or policy; I am saddened that this sorry chapter will continue, that the book will be open and the pages of this chapter will be turning as long as this president remains on office. Our young people, our citizens, our Constitution deserve a better end to a better story.

   Mr. CRAIG. Is my understanding correct that your motion would keep this session of deliberations closed, except for those Senators who would choose to have their statements become a part of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, and that it would be the choice of the individual Senators, and that the deliberations of the closed session would remain closed unless otherwise specified by each individual Senator, specific to their statements; is that a fair understanding?

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Montana, Mr. BAUCUS, today to introduce the Congressional Award Reauthorization Act of 1999--a bill to reauthorize the Congressional Award program for another five years. 
   The Congressional Award program was first authorized and signed into law in 1979. Since then it has received the support of Congress and Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton for one very simple reason--it helps encourage and recognize excellence among America's young people. 
   The program is non-competitive; participants challenge only themselves. Young people from all walks of life and levels of ability can work to earn a Congressional Award. Participants range from the academically and physically gifted, to those with severe physical, mental, and socio-economic challenges. 
   The Congressional Award is an earned award; young people are not selected for it. Participants strive for either a Bronze, Silver, or Gold Award. At each level, 50% of the required minimum hours to earn the Award are in Volunteer Service (a minimum of 100 hours for Bronze, 200 for Silver, and 400 for Gold). Since the inception of the program, the minimum number of volunteer hours for recipients has exceeded one million hours. All of this time was spent improving individual's lives and each of our communities. 
   Congressional Award recipients receive no material reward through the program for their efforts except for the medal and certificate which are presented to them in recognition of, and thanks for, what they have done. 
   There are currently around 2000 young people from across the country pursing the award, with more entering the program each day. Each of these young people exemplify the qualities of commitment to service and citizenship that our country embodies, and which we promote through our own service in Congress. We believe the least we can do for them is encourage them in their efforts and recognize their achievements through the Congressional Award program. 
   The program is one of the best investments Congress can make. It requires no annual appropriation--all of its funding is raised from private sources--yet it does so much for so many people. 
   The authorization for the Congressional Award program expires this year. The bill I introduce today will reauthorize the program for five years and make two minor changes in the way the program is administered. I encourage each one of my colleagues to show their support for every young person who has received or is working on a Congressional Award by supporting this legislation.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you. And let me thank Senator COVERDELL for chairing the special order today to talk about a very important debate which this country is now just beginning to engage in; and that is, the debate over the Federal budget for the  next fiscal year and for the near future of the next 10 years. 
   The reason I say it is an important debate--and I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from New Hampshire--if not the most important debate we will become involved in in this decade is that it is long term. What we do in this budget sets a trend line, clearly establishes a standard of performance for how Government operates and how taxpayers are treated in our country. 
   So for the next few moments I am going to dwell on that, because I can't deal with the specifics of this budget yet, not in the detail that the Senator from New Mexico, who is the chairman of the Budget Committee, is going to in a few moments. He is the expert. He teaches me what is in this budget. And I listen very closely. 
   But let me tell you, there are some fundamentals that I hope the public will come to recognize as this debate goes on, that within the budget surplus there are two surpluses. About 62 percent of that surplus is generated by Social Security tax, Social Security tax revenue. And that 62 percent the President of the United States and the Congress of the United States agree ought to be dedicated to reforming and strengthening the Social Security system. So if you will, that is surplus I. 
   There is a second surplus, and that is a surplus that is generated by other taxes, including the taxpayers' income tax. And that represents about 38 percent of the Federal budget. It is on that percentage that this Republican Senate at this moment is proposing, amongst other things, a significant tax cut for the taxpayers of the country. 
   I am very proud to stand on the floor, along with a lot of my colleagues, and say that a decade and a half ago we began an argument to force our Government to balance its budget. We were told at that time, in the early 1980s, that wasn't going to happen, just wasn't going to happen in my lifetime. In fact, I had an elder statesman in the House--I was serving in the House --after I delivered this House speech on balancing the budget on the floor, tap me on the shoulder, and he said, ``Kid, you ain't gonna live long enough to see a federally balanced budget.'' And then he went on to say, ``Why would you want to do it? Look what you can do with Government spending to expand the economy, to create all these neat things.'' And I looked at him and smiled and said, ``To reassure your reelection.'' 
   Well, that was less than 20 years ago. In fact, that was about 14 years ago when that statement was made. And today the budget is balanced. Today we are now arguing over how to spend the potential trillions of dollars of surplus that will be generated by that budget. 
   When I was arguing the balanced budget idea in the early 1980s, along with a lot of my colleagues, there were some fundamental reasons why we were doing it: No. 1, to control Government. Because we saw an all-increasingly expanding, powerful Federal Government as a damper on the rights and freedoms of the citizens of our country. More Government, less freedom; more programs, less control, less opportunity on the part of the average citizen. So that was one of the reasons. The other reason was to turn this economy on. 
   In all fairness, Mr. President, I don't think any of us ever knew how much you could turn the economy of this country on if you did just two things: If you balanced the Federal budget, that is called fiscal policy, and if you kept monetary policy in line with it; and if you rewarded the workers by allowing them to keep more of their own money called taxes. 
   We have been able to do all of those things in combination. And what happened? We turned this economy on. We fueled it in a way that was really beyond our imagination. 
   In fact, a lot of us are looking at this strong economy today and saying, how can it last? Why is it so strong even in light of all the things that are going on around us in a world economy that is dragging it down to some extent. 
   The reason it is strong is because the Federal budget is balanced, because monetary policy is in line with the Federal Reserve. Now the next step is to keep it strong and even stronger and to take overtaxed American taxpayers and make sure that they keep an ever larger part of their hard-earned money. That is the real difference between what the President proposes and what we are talking about. 
   Oh, yes, we have the fundamental disagreements on Social Security reform that the Senator from New Hampshire, who is now presiding, has just talked about, and those are fundamental differences. But with that 38 percent that is left, the President plans to spend it all in one form or another. In fact, if you listened to his State of the Union in his budget message, he was like somebody handing out gifts in the form of government programs. A little here and a little there, going to benefit this, going to benefit that, going to expand here, and in the end, the world is going to be a happier place, and the President is going to be a more popular guy. Or so it went. 
   What he didn't say was that he actually was growing the potential of a Federal debt and deficit in combination again and that he was not offering substantive reform in the long term that would really benefit Social Security recipients, and most importantly, the young people of our country. 
   There is another premise with Social Security: No matter what we do we are going to protect the elderly. But what we have to do is assure that the young people of our country have a good investment in the future because Social Security today for a young person entering the work force is a lousy investment. There is very little returned for their money. So those are some of the dynamics of the debate at hand. 
   Mr. President, let me close with this thought--and I believe it sincerely, as somebody who has fought for a balanced budget, as somebody who is proud to see a balanced budget gained, and as somebody who has been very surprised over the strength of an economy that can be generated by the balanced budget and good, sound, monetary policy. It is simply this: I believe the President squanders the reward of a balanced budget. I believe the President squanders the hard work that we have done here to assure that the taxpayers of our country can have back even more of their hard-earned money. He not only squanders it in bad ideas, he squanders it by simply creating a greater liability on future earnings of our government or future taxes by our citizens. 
   We are standing at the threshold of a unique time in our Nation's history, a true opportunity to fix Social Security, to reform it, and to change it into a positive investment for the young people of our country while still continuing to hold safe and reward the elderly of our country for their hard-earned days, but also to assure long-term economic growth in our country that keeps our work forces working, that keeps our taxpayers happy, and that strengthens our country among other nations in the world. 
   That is an opportunity that can be accomplished with this budget. That is why I think what we are standing for today is the right direction and course for this country to take. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Hope for Children Act, which is also being introduced today in the House of Representatives by Congressman TOM BLILEY of Virginia. 
   I think all of us--no matter what party or philosophy--share the hope that every child in the world has a loving, permanent home. The Hope for Children Act is aimed at making that hope a reality for more children, by making it possible for more families to open their homes and hearts to a child through adoption. 
   In the past few years, Congress has taken a number of steps to promote adoption in this country. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers for their dedication to this effort. As an adoptive father myself, and co-chair of the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I've been pleased to see more and more American families formed through adoption, and I sincerely believe the work of Congress has been a contributing factor. 
   However, we have some unfinished business to take care of, and that's what I'm here to talk about today. 
   Many of my colleagues will remember back in 1996, we succeeded in enacting a tax credit for adoption expenses. We did so, because we realized that adopting families face extraordinary challenges: not only must they forge a new family unit while navigating a labyrinth of legal or regulatory requirements, but they also have financial challenges above and beyond the usual expenses of caring for and raising children. The cost of adoption can easily push into the tens of thousands of dollars, counting legal fees, travel, medical bills and other expenses. All too often, it is the financial challenge that becomes an insurmountable obstacle to bringing a child who is alone in the world together with a loving family. 
   We knew the adoption tax credit wouldn't eliminate the expense of adoption outright, but would only allow eligible adoptive families to keep a bit more of their own hard-earned income to devote to those expenses. As a result, adoptive parents may be eligible to receive a tax credit of $5000 to help cover out-of-pocket expenses related to each adoption, or a $6000 tax credit for the adoption of a ``special needs'' child. 
   If the comments I've been hearing from families across the nation are any gauge, the credit has helped make adoption a reality for a lot of children. As more individuals explore the adoption option, they are finding the credit a small but significant cushion against the financial impact. Even so, I've received a number of constructive suggestions from families as to how the adoption tax credit could be improved, to make it more effective in promoting adoption in the United States. 
   Furthermore, back in 1996 when we originally debated this matter, there were political and fiscal considerations that caused Congress to include a sunset provision for the adoption tax credit. Unless we act soon to extend this enormously helpful tool, it will expire. 
   For all of those reasons, I am introducing the Hope for Children Act. It builds on the work done by our previous Congress, to improve and extend the adoption tax credit. 
   Specifically, it would make the tax credit permanent, and adjust it for inflation. It would also exclude the credit from calculation of the alternative minimum tax. The full credit would be available for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes under $150,000; those with adjusted gross incomes between $150,000 and $190,000 would be able to take a reduced credit. No credit would be available to those with adjusted gross incomes of more than $190,000. 
   I should say at this point that I do not think this bill is the final word on the subject. I intend to work with interested groups and individuals on additional legislation that will promote adoption--perhaps most important, that will do more to promote the adoption of children with special needs. 
   There are so many children in the United States and the world who can only hope for the loving, permanent home that should be their birthright--I invite all Senators to join me in supporting the Hope for Children Act to help make their dreams a reality.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in introducing the State and Local Government Participation Act. 
   This legislation would amend the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to provide the opportunity for State, local, and county agencies to participate in land management decisions by identifying them as cooperating agencies in the NEPA process. 
   NEPA was passed in 1969 to, among other things, ``declare a national policy which will encourage harmony between man and his environment.'' I support the intent of NEPA, to protect our public resources from environmental degradation. However, in the last twenty years, the NEPA process has become a very time consuming and cumbersome public process. In almost every instance, an Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessment must be completed under NEPA before any action can take place on the public lands. 
   My state, Idaho, is 63 percent federal land, and management of those lands is of vital importance, especially to the communities that are economically dependent on the public lands. In far too many instances, land management decisions are being made without allowing those most affected by a land management decision or in many cases, those most knowledgeable about the resource, to play a meaningful role in the NEPA process. 
   In the Pacific Northwest, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are currently working on a comprehensive ecosystem management plan for the Columbia River Basin, the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Plan (ICBEMP). This plan, in the form of a draft EIS, has been in the works for four years at an expense of more than $40 Million. County governments and state officials in my state feel alienated by the process to date. The situation has gotten so bad that in last year's omnibus appropriations act, I worked to have report language encouraging the administration to include affected state and county governments in this process as cooperating agencies. 
   I would submit that every western Senator has at least one horror story involving a public land managing agency that ran roughshod over the local government in the NEPA process. Rather than legislating that Federal agencies must work with the local governments on a case-by-case basis, this bill would provide the opportunity to fix a problem that has arisen with the original NEPA legislation.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Plant Protection Act of 1999''--a comprehensive bill which will focus the effort of federal agencies in fighting noxious weeds and other plant pests. 
   Noxious weeds are a serious problem on both public and private lands across the nation. They are particularly troublesome in the West where much of our land is entrusted to the management of the federal government. A ``slow burning wildfire,'' noxious weeds take land out of production, force native species off the land, and interrupt the commerce and activities of all those who rely on the land for their livelihoods--including farmers, ranchers, recreationists, and others. 
   The bill I introduce today will focus the efforts of the federal government to better fight this wildfire. It organizes and expands the functions of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and appoints it as the lead government agency in this fight. 
   The bill was drafted with the assistance and advice of APHIS as well as several national agriculture organizations such as the American Nursery  and Landscape Association, National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, National Christmas Tree Association, National Potato Council, and American Farm Bureau Federation. The Idaho Department of Agriculture and many concerned citizens from my state have also helped me shape the bill I introduce today. 
   Similar legislation will be introduced in the House of Representatives some time next month by Representative CANADY of Florida. The two bills have only one difference. The bill I introduce today lacks the section on federal preemption included in Mr. CANADY's legislation. This is an issue that will have to be addressed during the legislative process. I will admit that APHIS will not endorse the legislation without the preemption section. However, I am confident that, working together with all of those interested in fighting noxious weeds at the federal and state levels, we can resolve this matter in a way we might all agree to. 
   Working together is what this entire effort is about. Along that same vein, I know of several Senators with an interest in this issue, including Senator AKAKA who introduced legislation on this matter earlier this month, and I hope we can work together in finding a solution we can all support. In addition, I might mention that it is my understanding that the President and the Secretary of the Interior have expressed interest in noxious weeds and may be planning their own announcement. I invite them--indeed, I invite everyone interested in this matter--to work with me to find an approach which confronts this problem head on. 
   Mr. President, I believe we must focus our efforts to rid our lands of these noxious weeds and plant pests. We must reclaim the rangeland for natural species. We must return the acres of lost farmland to production. Doing so will require the combined efforts of the federal government, state governments, local weed control boards, and private land owners. 
   I believe the ``Plant Protection Act of 1999'' is the first step in this process.

    Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today, Senate Republicans are responding to America's number one health care concern: the high cost of health insurance and medical care. By granting all Americans access to tax-free medical savings accounts; by allowing self-employed Americans to deduct 100 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums; and by allowing workers with flexible savings accounts to keep some of the money in those accounts, our ``Patients' Bill of Rights--Plus'' will tear down the barriers that government has put in the way of affordable health coverage and care. 
   Our proposal stands in stark contrast to those offered by others in Congress. With millions of Americans unable to afford insurance because of the unfairness of the federal tax code, some members of Congress want to force consumers to buy government-prescribed benefits--including many that are giveaways to special interests--even if it causes millions more to lose their health coverage. 
   While other so-called ``patients' rights'' bills contain nothing but expensive mandates, hidden taxes and costly lawsuits, our bill will deliver quality health insurance to millions of Americans. Our bill will make a down payment on serious health care reform that puts patients first--not doctors, not lawyers, not insurance companies, and certainly not government bureaucrats. 
   Rather than support a patients' bill of rights minus access, I urge my colleagues to take a step forward by making health insurance accessible instead of taking a step backward by making it more expensive.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Nebraska and thank my colleague from Georgia for bringing us this special order as we attempt to analyze the President's State of the Union Message of last evening. 
   America tuned in, and so did we, to hear what our President would say about the State of the Union. And he said what we expected him to say, that the State of the Union itself at this moment in time is very, very good. But, what would a Presidency in crisis try to do at a time that the State of the Union is in excellent shape? My guess is that Presidency would attempt to appeal to his base in a very aggressive way, and to divert attention from the real issue at hand that will transpire once again on the floor of this Senate in less than an hour, and that is an impeachment trial of this President, this Presidency in crisis. 
   But, for a moment, let me talk about the speech and his effort to divert attention. The polls show he did just that. He got excellent ratings in the polls this morning in that snapshot of American opinion about what this President said. The problem in the snapshot is that there were no comparatives. The Senator from Nebraska offered comparatives, the Senator from Georgia has offered comparatives this morning, as to what this President has said in the past and done in the past versus what he said last night. About a year ago now, this President said the era of big government is over. We all cheered that. Most conservatives like myself for a long time have dedicated their energies to reducing the size of government and its impact on our daily lives as citizens and taxpayers of this country. And we have come a long way in doing that in the last several decades. So the President, once again appealing to his ratings in the polls, said the era of big government is over. That was 12 months ago. 
   As we all know, in the last 12 months a great deal has transpired as it relates to this President and his Presidency. Last night this President proclaimed a grand new great society. In fact, he probably proposed more new Government initiatives--75 or 80 new initiatives--more so than Lyndon Johnson did with his proposal for a great new society. He literally reached out and attempted to touch every American citizen to make them feel good. He is going to correct the schools and change the character of the schools, as to which the Senator from Nebraska referred. 
   Obviously, he is going to attack us on our second amendment rights to protect our citizens, so he says, and it went on and on and on. 
   But the one thing he did not mention was what was he going to do to the taxpayer; more importantly, what was he going to do for the taxpayer. He proposed to do nothing for them but do a heck of a lot to them. 
   Three times or four or five times last night he talked about his balanced budget. I say, ``Mr. President, how dare you.'' I say it with a bit of a smile on my face because this President has no credibility in that area. But he is basking in the popularity of it now, made popular by a conservative Republican  Congress that said, ``No more deficits, and we'll fight to get a balanced budget.'' And we did that, even though the President opposed us every step of the way and then takes credit for it. 
   The reason I bring that up in the context of what did he do to or for the taxpayers is that several news reporters said, ``What did you think of the speech?'' My reaction was, Well, for 15 years, I fought for a balanced budget. I and others, collectively this Congress, was successful in getting it, and we built this sizable growing surplus. We built that surplus, or at least we hoped we could build a surplus when we created a balanced budget to do a couple of things: to stimulate the economy by returning to the taxpayers excessive taxes which we had taken from them. Surpluses are not free moneys to spend, they are representative of the fact that we are overtaxing our citizenry, and we ought to return some of the money to them. 
   I won't argue with the President about Social Security reform and the value of that reform and using the surplus for those purposes. But, Mr. President, over $4 trillion worth of surplus in the next 15 years and you don't want to give one dime back to the taxpayer? 
   I think I was right in my initial analysis, this President slipped back last night, because of the pressure and the crisis he is in, to his old base of trying to give something to everybody. It was a feel-good State of the Union speech that did nothing for the taxpayer, nothing for the economy and a heck of a lot to grow big government and, once again, put shackles on the freedom of our citizens to perform independent of their Government. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I appreciate that. I wanted to add for the RECORD some of the analysis we are now doing about what the President said last night and, more importantly, how he proposes to spend the taxpayers' money. 
   The surplus that he projects, and that I think we generally agree with, based on the vibrancy of our economy today, is about $4.35 trillion over the next 15 years. That is rough, give or take 1 percent, depending on who is doing the calculation. 
   In that context, here is what the President proposes to do: He proposes to spend 62 percent of it for Social Security, about $2.7 trillion. Probably we would not want to disagree with that, because about 60 percent of the surplus is generated by Social Security taxes, and it ought to go into Social Security and it ought to go into strengthening it and saving it and, hopefully, reforming it. 
   The President laid out a plan last night that we are looking at now, but at least he opened the door for reform--and I am glad he has--and will create some flexibility, because we are going to guarantee that the current recipients and immediate future recipients of Social Security are going to have their Social Security. What I am worried about are the young people who are entering the workforce today and beginning to invest in Social Security and finding that the worst investment they have ever made. That is wrong, and we know how to correct it. We have an opportunity to so. 
   He has done something else that is very interesting. He is saying that about 15 percent ought to go into Medicare. That would be the first time that general fund taxes would ever go to Medicare. That represents about a 20-percent increase in the current payroll tax that is going into Medicare--general fund dollars into Medicare, first time in history that would happen. That is a rather bold new break in his approach. 
   USA retirement accounts, 11 percent; new spending, about 11 percent, $479 billion. He also includes a substantial tax increase to get there. 
   That is a little bit of the economic analysis. Here is a President who says we have a balanced budget, and he slides into major new tax increases and creates a huge new approach toward Federal spending. We are going to work with him, but we are not going to spend that kind of money, that is for sure.
