 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to call World Population Awareness Week 1998 to the attention of my colleagues. October 24-31st marks the 13th annual celebration of World Population Awareness Week. More than 300 family planning, environmental, educational, community and service organizations in 61 countries are co-sponsoring the week in an effort to raise awareness of the need for universal voluntary family planning. 
I call Governor Tommy G. Thompson's proclamation to the attention of my colleagues. I am pleased to note that Jeannette Bell, Mayor of West Allis has agreed to proclaim World Population Awareness Week as well.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act before us. This was not an easy decision because there are many parts of this legislation I support. But, on balance, I cannot support a bill that is in essence sloppy--both in the process by which it was constructed and in its content. 
We are asked today to vote--up or down--on a bill that contains eight of thirteen appropriations bills that fund the government and almost $500 billion in government spending, nearly 30 percent of our budget. We have one vote, little debate, and no chance of amendment on what has been described as the largest piece of spending legislation in recent history. And beyond the spending sections of the bill, it also includes various pieces of authorizing legislation--seven different drug bills, home health care reform, and Internet tax moratorium, a tax cut that will cost $9.2 billion over the next nine years among other items. 
This is a huge measure--a measure that the esteemed Senator Byrd has called a `monstrosity,' and he is right. It is a measure that, in its entirety, few have seen and no one understands. Yet today, we are asked to say `yes' or `no' to it. How can we say `yes' to a budget that we have not read, have not participated in its drafting, have not even seen? To do so would be irresponsible and undemocratic. 
In saying this, I mean no disrespect to those of my colleagues who have worked very hard to try to make this process fair. The negotiators were caught in a bind that all of Congress has a responsibility for creating: We let partisanship and politics get in the way of passing a thoughtful budget this year, and so now we are stuck slapping a budget together at the last minute. 
I commend the negotiators for doing the best they could. All parties were as responsive as this terrible situation allowed. The Democratic leadership in the Senate and Representative Obey were vigilant in trying to protect the interests of Wisconsin during negotiations, and they were successful in doing some good for our State and in avoiding a great deal of bad. 
I also do not mean to suggest that there are no items in this legislation that I support. There are many good policies, provisions and priorities established here. 
For the most part, I am pleased with the final form of the Treasury-General Government appropriations bill which I worked on as the Subcommittee's Ranking Member. Controversial language tampering with the Federal Election Commission's staff was dropped. Important language guaranteeing adequate contraceptive coverage to federal employees was retained. And many important law enforcement and financial agencies were funded at adequate levels. In addition, that bill allocated money for fighting the war on drugs in my State--an additional $1.5 million to expand the Milwaukee High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) and additional funds for expanding the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Imitative operating now in Milwaukee. 
The Omnibus bill also makes a strong investment in the education of our children, starting from early childhood education and continuing through higher education. The bill increases funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant to over $1.18 billion, an increase of $182 million. This includes a continuation of the $19.1 million set-aside for resource and referral programs, which help parents locate quality, affordable child care in their communities. In addition, we increased funding for Head Start by over $300 million, increased funding for Disadvantaged Students (Title I) by over $300 million, increased Special Education funding by over $500 million, and provided $1.1 billion to local school districts to help reduce class size in the early grades. We also provided over $300 million more for Student Aid, including an increase in the maximum Pell Grant to $3,125. 
In addition to investing in our children, the bill also ensures that we take care of our nation's elderly. Despite the fact that the House eliminated funding for LIHEAP, we were able to restore that funding to its full amount of $1.1 billion, ensuring that the elderly will not have to choose between food and heat during the cold winter months. We also increased funding for the Administration on Aging, including a $3 million increase for the Ombudsman program, which serves as an advocate for the elderly in long-term care facilities. 
This appropriations measure also includes vital funding for highways and transit at the historic levels approved by Congress as part of the Transportation Equity Act earlier this year and a strong level of investment in airport improvement. In addition, the transportation piece of the omnibus bill funds a number of Wisconsin specific items, including Wisconsin statewide bus programs that play a crucial role in our welfare to work efforts, the renovation of the Milwaukee Train Station, crash and congestion prevention technology funding for the State, commuter rail planning and grade crossing mitigation funds for Southeastern Wisconsin and funding for the Coast Guard's Great Lakes' icebreaker and Seagoing Buoy Tender replacement programs. 
The transportation piece of the omnibus package includes an important authorization provision affecting Milwaukee, Wisconsin's East West Corridor project. In the ISTEA reauthorization debate, the future of this project fell victim to politics and backroom dealing. Specifically, a provision was attached to the reauthorization legislation, the Transportation Equity Act or so-called TEA-21 law, which sought to undermine the framework of local decision making created by the original ISTEA in 1991. Worse still, this TEA-21 provision had not been debated as part of either the House or Senate reauthorization bills, but was added to the final bill at the eleventh hour despite the objections of those Members of Congress most impacted. 
As a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I attempted to mitigate the damage done by the TEA-21 provision by attaching an amendment to the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1999. My amendment reaffirms the right of local officials to decide what transportation projects best fit the needs of their community. It simply makes sure that all parties who deserve to be at the decision making table have an equal seat at that table. I am pleased that a compromise version of my amendment is included in the omnibus package. It is my sincere hope that State and local officials will now work together to move ahead expeditiously with the East West Corridor improvements. Fairness has won the day, now consensus and cooperation must yield progress on a project of vital importance to the economy and quality of life in Southeastern Wisconsin. 
I also am pleased several provisions I worked for throughout the year have made it into the portion of the bill covering Commerce-Justice-State appropriations. Most importantly, the legislation includes more than a threefold increase in crime prevention spending through Title V, a juvenile crime prevention program I authored six years ago. The funding level was increased from $20 million to $70 million. This should provide WI with around $1 million in prevention spending next year, a big boost from the approximately $340,000 it received last year out of the lower funding level. 
The bill also extends a limited number of important tax provisions in a fiscally responsible manner--meaning these provisions are paid for, but not at the expense of the social security surplus. In particular, I strongly support the acceleration of the increase in the deduction for health insurance of the self-employed and the permanent extension of income averaging. Both these measures will go a long way to ease the tax burdens of Wisconsin's farmers and small business people. When we return in the spring, it is my hope that we will approve the reforms necessary to preserve the long term viability of social security, as well as enact more additional targeted, fiscally sound tax relief measures, such as my Child Care Tax Credit. 
Finally, I applaud the Administration for recognizing the financial crisis that is sweeping the agricultural sector of the Midwest this summer. The legislation also wisely adds more money for market losses and drought in the southern U.S. 
In addition, this bill does more than recognize the current problems in rural America. Although modest, the bill provides more financial help to maintain the viability of Wisconsin agriculture by appropriating $17 million more for agricultural research than last year, allowing the University of Wisconsin to develop the new technologies that will soon be the new production practices used by farmers. Soil and Water Conservation programs spending will increase by $8 million, enhancing programs like the Environmental Quality Improvement Program (EQIP). An additional $23 million was added for the Administration's Food Safety Initiative which includes money to increase the surveillance, research and education relating to food-borne illnesses. And finally, Congress agreed to pay dairy farmers for the transitioning of the industry to a more market oriented system as ordered by the last farm bill. Dairy producers will receive an estimated $200 million for agreeing to end the price support system in 1999. 
However, I still have significant concerns that Congress decided to postpone the consolidation of the milk marketing orders required by the 1996 Farm Bill and to extend the Northeast Dairy Compact. Our outdated, unfair pricing system must come to an end. It was wrong to use this bill to extend its life--and the life of a controversial regional price fixing scheme--both policies that hurt competitive Wisconsin family farmers. 
Another major problem with this bill is the use of the budget surplus to fund over $20 billion `emergency' spending. Certainly, some of these funds will go to meet truly unanticipated and urgent needs--like military deployments, natural disaster recovery efforts, and a response to the farm crisis sweeping the center of the nation. These are one-time, compassionate and necessary expenditures that must be made regardless of budget rules. 
Unfortunately, a significant portion of the so-called `emergency' money is not for true emergencies. For example, $1.3 billion is for military readiness--a worthy goal, but one that we ought to budget for as part of our annual budget process. I certainly hope it is not news to anyone that we expect our military to be ready to defend us. In addition, $50 million of that money is for `morale, welfare, and recreation.' Again, I agree with the goal of keeping our troops fit and content--but doing so should be a priority in every year's budget, not an off-budget item described as an `unanticipated need.' 
Many of us have argued that we ought not to use the budget surplus as an excuse to abandon fiscal discipline. We still need to save--for the Social Security obligations and health care needs of an aging population, for the rainy day that world economic instability may bring about, for the trust of the American taxpayer who expect us to use their tax dollars wisely. We succeeded in balancing the budget; it makes no sense to celebrate by unbalancing it again. 
I am also concerned about the pork that is the inevitable result of the haphazard and closed process that produced this legislation. I do not know what it is now, but I do know it will show up as we--and the public and the press--pore over the 8000 pages of this legislation over the next few weeks. 
In the end, as with any vote, the final decision has to be a result of weighing the good and the bad. No bill is perfect; most are the result of compromise. But in this bill, the balance of good and bad is tipped by the undemocratic and irresponsible manner in which it was written. I will vote no this morning, and I urge my colleagues to join me.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I agree with much of what my colleague, Senator Campbell, has said about this bill. 
It is a good bill. It provides sufficient appropriations for the Department of the Treasury and the independent agencies. But, since this bill left the Senate floor, it changed in ways that made it impossible for me to sign the conference report. 
First, the good news. The conference report before us is silent on the issue of staffing the Federal Election Commission. I am very pleased we have decided to avoid a partisan battle on this issue. 
Unfortunately, several other changes to the bill were made after the conference--and these make the bill much worse. 
First, the Senate bill contained a provision that would have provided for the adjustment of the status of Haitians. This provision, which had bipartisan Senate support, would allow 40,000 Haitian refugees who have been in this country since 1995, to stay permanently. Last year Congress provided this same type of correction for 150,000 Nicaraguans and 5,000 Cubans. The conference report before us drops that provision--despite the fact that it was agreed to by all conferees. 
Second, the Senate bill contained a provision that would address the requirements of providing quality child care in Federal facilities. This measure, proposed by Senator Jeffords, would simply make sure that Federal child care facilities operate under reasonable quality standards. In addition, it would bring under Federal regulation the child care centers run by Congress--child care centers that operate now completely unregulated by local, state, or Federal law. 
The conference report before us drops this provision--which until now was uncontroversial. I find it unacceptable that Congress would use the last minute legislative rush to exempt itself from basic health and safety standards for the children in its care. 
And, third, this conference report drops language--adopted by a bipartisan majority in both Houses--that would provide Federal employees with health insurance coverage for contraception. Again it is unacceptable that an extreme minority should be able to prevail on this. Close to half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and tragically, those unintended pregnancies often led to abortion. By providing federal workers with the most appropriate and safe means of contraception, we can reduce the number of abortions performed and increase the number of children who are born wanted, planned for, and loved. 
We in the Senate made good decisions when we passed the Treasury-General Government appropriations bill. It is disappointing that so many of those decisions have been overturned in last minute, partisan negotiations. 
The White House has promised that they will work with us to get the Haitian fairness, child care and contraception provisions included in the omnibus funding bill. Based on that assurance, and knowing of the many other strong provisions retained in the conference report, I will vote for passage. But I do so with great disappointment at how this bill has been altered in the last few days and great hope that the democratic decisions overturned will be restored in the final omnibus appropriations measure. 
One last note, I want to thank the staff members who have worked so tirelessly to bring this bill to the floor. Pat Raymond and Tammy Perrin of Senator Campbell's staff have always been helpful and professional in their dealings with us--their demeanor has allowed us to put this bill together in a truly bipartisan way. Paul Bock, my chief of staff, approached this bill as he does everything: with intelligence and a healthy sense of humor. And my deepest gratitude is for my clerk, Barbara Retzlaff, who has boundless energy, complete mastery of the programs she monitors, and incredible patience--with me and with this year's torturous negotiations. Thank you all.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong concern about the conference report on bankruptcy reform. We do need to stop abuse of the bankruptcy system, and there is some good in this measure. But regrettably this is not an adequate solution. I do want to `proceed,' but to a better bankruptcy bill. 
Two weeks ago, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a reform bill which I was proud to support. It targeted the worst abuses by debtors and creditors, without overburdening the vast majority of debtors who truly need--and deserve--relief. Senator Grassley and Senator Durbin deserve much of the credit for putting together such a balanced and effective measure. 
But this bill is not that bill. Let me tell you why. 
Mr. President, we can't truly `reform' the bankruptcy system unless we eliminate the most egregious abuse. That is, debtors who shield their assets in luxury homes in states like Florida and Texas, while their legitimate creditors--children, ex-spouses owed alimony, governments, retailers and banks--get left out in the cold. If we really want to restore the stigma to bankruptcy, all of us know this is the best place to start. By capping the homestead exemption at $100,000, the Senate bill would have stopped this abuse. 
But the Conference Report won't put an end to this practice. Indeed, it only addresses part of the problem--by making it harder to move to Florida or Texas solely to take advantage of their liberal homestead laws. Now that is a step forward. But it is just a small step; it does nothing to stop debtors who already own lavish homes--or second homes--in those states from continuing to live like kings. That's an injustice to legitimate creditors and an outrage to anyone who believes--like I do--that deadbeats who go into bankruptcy shouldn't be able to shield their assets in luxurious homes. 
Just take a look at what Burt Reynolds did earlier this week. The measure wouldn't apply to him, because he lives in Florida and that state has no homestead cap. As part of his bankruptcy settlement, he managed to hold onto his $2.5 million estate called `Valhalla.' Now, I like Burt Reynolds' movies. I liked `Deliverance,' `Daisy Miller,' and `The Longest Yard'--though I didn't see `Boogie Nights.' Burt Reynolds is a fine actor. But it seems like he's making out much like his title role in `Smokey and the Bandit.' While he lives in luxury, his legitimate creditors lose millions. The Conference Report allows this to happen; the Senate bill would have put an end to this travesty. 
Of course, the dramatic rise in bankruptcies is very troubling, regardless of whether the blame lies with credit card companies, a culture that disparages personal responsibility, the bankruptcy code or, most probably, with all of the above. While none of us wants to return to the era of `debtors' prison,' we need to do something to reverse this trend, reduce the number of bankruptcy filings and make sure bankruptcy remains a tool of last resort. This bill does some of that. For example, it discourages repeat filings and it encourages debtors who can repay some of their debts to do so. But Mr. President, ultimately this Conference Report falls short. Instead of proceeding to this measure, we should proceed to a better bill. And hopefully next Congress we will. Thank you.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Conference Report on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (H.R. 2281). In my view, we need this measure to stop an epidemic of illegal copying of protected works--such as movies, books, musical recordings, and software--and to limit, in a balanced and thoughtful way, the infringement liability of online service providers. The copyright industry is one of our most thriving businesses. But we still lose more than $15 billion each year due to foreign copyright piracy, according to some estimates. 
And foreign piracy is just out of control. For example, one of my staffers investigating video piracy on a trip to China walked into a Hong Kong arcade and bought three bootlegged computer games--including `Toy Story' and `NBA '97'--for just $10. These games, combined, normally sell for about $100. Indeed, the manager was so brazen about it, he even agreed to give out a receipt. 
Illegal copying has been a longstanding concern to me. I introduced one of the precursors to this bill, the Motion Picture Anti-Piracy Act (in the 101st Congress), which in principle has been incorporated into this measure. And I was one of the cosponsors of the original proposed WIPO implementing legislation, the preliminary version of this proposal. 
In my opinion, this bill achieves a fair balance by taking steps to effectively deter piracy, while still allowing fair use of protected materials. It is the product of intensive negotiations between all of the interested parties--including the copyright industry, telephone companies, libraries, universities and device manufacturers. And virtually every major concern raised during that process was addressed. 
Unfortunately, however, the Conference dropped what I believe were crucial protections for databases. It is my understanding, though, that the Committee will be `fast tracking' consideration of database protection next Congress. I look forward to working with Chairman Hatch to move forward on this matter early next year. 
In sum, Mr. President, I am confident that this bill will reduce piracy and strengthen one of our biggest export industries. It deserves our support and the President's signature.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to outline my proposal for reducing juvenile crime--the `Safe and Sound Communities Act,' which I will make available as a discussion draft today. In the past few years, we have begun to make real advances in fighting juvenile crime. And in cities across the country, juvenile crime has started to fall. For example, after Boston implemented a city-wide anti-crime plan, the number of juveniles murdered declined 80 percent, and in more than two years not a single child was killed by a gun. Not one child. And in three `Weed & Seed' neighborhoods in Milwaukee, violent felonies dropped 46 percent, gun crimes fell 46 percent, and crime overall was down 21 percent. Now we need to build on what works, in order to protect our children and to make our communities `safe and sound.' This measure will be an important step in the right direction. 
Indeed, we do not have to reinvent the wheel to reduce juvenile crime. The lesson from Boston, Milwaukee and other cities is clear. There is no one magic solution. But a number of steps, taken together, can and will make a difference: put dangerous criminals behind bars; keep guns out of the hands of juveniles; and give children after-school alternatives to gangs and drugs. That's what works in Boston and Milwaukee and the rest of America. And that's what this proposal is all about. It builds on each of these three basic strategies and expands them to more cities and more rural communities across the nation. Let me explain.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to put America's children first by putting more resources into the hands of families and encouraging more parents to live up to their child support obligations. My legislation, the Children First Child Support Reform Act, would direct that all child support collected through the Federal-State Child Support Enforcement Program be passed through, or paid, directly to the children and families to whom it is owed and disregarded in the calculation of public assistance benefits. My legislation will assure non-custodial parents that the child support they pay will actually contribute to the well-being of their child, rather than the government, and will also reduce administrative burdens on the state. 
As my colleagues know, since its inception in 1975, our Federal-State Child Support Enforcement Program has been tasked with collecting child support for families receiving public assistance and other families that request help in enforcing child support. Towards this end, the program works to establish paternity and legally-binding support orders, while collecting and disbursing funds on behalf of families so that children receive the support they need to grow up in healthy, nurturing surroundings. 
But on one crucial point, the current program does not truly work on behalf of families and, perhaps more importantly, may actually work against families by discouraging non-custodial parents from meeting their child support obligations. 
If the family was never on public assistance, the support is collected by the Child Support Enforcement Program and sent directly to the family. However, under current law, most child support collected on behalf of families receiving public assistance is retained by the state and Federal governments as reimbursement for welfare expenditures. In addition to this cost recoupment function, collections made on behalf of welfare families are used to fund the child support program in many states. 
Thus, under current law, we have a system where the vast majority of children on public assistance never actually receive the child support that is paid on their behalf. The government keeps the money. The research shows that many non-custodial parents who pay support do not believe that their payment actually benefits their children. They realize and resent that they are paying the government. Worse yet, some non-custodial parents may decide not to pay support because it does not go to their children. Some custodial parents also are skeptical about working with the child support agency to secure payments since the funds are generally not forwarded to them. 
Mr. President, we know that an estimated 800,000 families would not need public assistance if they could count on the child support owed to them. In addition, we know that 23 million children are owed more than $40 billion in outstanding support. Clearly, the vital importance of child support in keeping families off of assistance remains as true today as when the program began. In a world with TANF time limits, it has never been more important. And with these figures in mind, it is not unthinkable that some policymakers may have or might still consider this program as a means of recovering welfare expenditures. 
But I am convinced that that thinking must change, if not cast off entirely, because, simply put, times have changed. The welfare reform law of 1996, which I supported, paved the way for time limits and work requirements that provide clear and compelling incentives for families to enter the workforce and find a way to stay there. Open ended, unconditional public support is no longer a reality, and our goal and responsibility as policymakers, now more than ever before, is to give families the tools and resources they need to prepare for and ultimately survive the day when they are without public assistance. 
We fundamentally changed welfare, now we must fundamentally reexamine the central role of child support in helping families as they struggle to become and remain self-sufficient. And I say we go down the road of putting children first, a path on which we have already made some progress. Under the welfare reform law, states will eventually be required to distribute state-collected child support arrears owed to the family before paying off arrears owed to the state and Federal governments for welfare expenditures. In addition, states were given the option of continuing to passthrough directly the first $50 of child support to the family. 
One state, my state of Wisconsin, has opted to pass through all child support collected on behalf of participating families to those families. As you know, Wisconsin has been a leader and national model in the area of welfare reform. Under Wisconsin's welfare program, child support counts as income in determining financial eligibility for welfare assistance, but once eligibility is established, the child support income is disregarded in calculating program benefits. In other words, families are allowed to keep their own money. Non-custodial parents can be assured that their contribution counts and that their child support payments go to their children. And both parents are presented with a realistic picture of what that support means in the life of their child. I believe we, as a nation, should follow Wisconsin's example. 
The full passthrough and disregard approach also has significant benefits on the administrative side. The current distribution requirements place significant computer, accounting and paperwork burdens on the states. They are also costly. Data from the Federal Office of Child Support demonstrates that nearly 20 percent of program expenditures are spent simply processing payments. States are required to maintain a complicated set of accounts to determine whether support collected should be paid to the family or kept by the government. These complex accounting rules depend on whether the family ever received public assistance, the date a family begins and ends assistance, whether the non-custodial parent is current on payments or owes arrears, the method of collection and other factors. 
We know that we have already asked much of the states in the realm of automation, systems integration and welfare law child support enforcement adjustments. We hope and believe these improvements will lead to better collection rates. Now we have a chance to simplify and improve distribution of support. What could be simpler than a distribution system in which all child support collected would be delivered to the children to whom it is owed? A distribution system in which child support agencies would distribute current support and arrears to both welfare and non-welfare families in exactly the same way? 
Mr. President, I am raising these points and introducing this legislation today, in the final week of the 105th Congress, as a marker, as a starting point to this discussion. Child support financing must be addressed. First, our current distribution scheme is out of step with the philosophy of current welfare policy. We must move the child support program from cost-recovery to service delivery for all families. Second, the current financing scheme is no longer workable. TANF caseloads are decreasing dramatically, even as overall child support caseloads are increasing. Therefore, while the system needs additional resources, the portion of the caseload that produces those resources is decreasing. We must put the child support program on a sound financial footing that confirms a strong Federal and state commitment to the program. 
So, I believe it is time to begin a discussion on the issue of child support financing and the vital role of the child support program in helping families help themselves. The Administration has already begun to meet with policymakers, state administrators, and children's advocates to discuss the future of child support financing. I want to begin today, and ultimately end the debate, by pushing for a financing system that puts more resources into the hands of children, that lets our nation's families keep more of their own money. 
But let me strongly affirm that adopting a children first policy is only one of my goals. At this time, my proposal addresses only one half of the financing issue. Yes, we should put children first, but let me stress that I have every intention of continuing to refine this proposal so that it addresses the second point as well--finding alternative financing mechanisms so that states can maintain and strengthen their child support programs. Without adequate funding, state child support programs cannot deliver effective child support services to the families that so desperately need them. I want to continue working with my colleagues, Wisconsin and the other states, advocates and families to sort out the rest of the financing question. By advocating a full passthrough and disregard approach, I am absolutely not advocating a disinvestment in our child support system by either the Federal government or the states. Our commitment to this program must remain strong and steadfast. 
But it is time for us to create a system that truly serves families by giving them the tools to survive in a world without public support. It is time for a child support financing system that truly puts families, and not the government, first.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my continued strong interest in meaningful class action reform--and to announce that, although we do not have the time necessary to move legislation any further this year, class action reform remains one of my highest priorities. Although many class action lawsuits do result in significant and important benefits for class members and society, too many class lawyers put their self-interest above the best interests of their clients--resulting in unfair and abusive settlements that shortchange class members while their lawyers line their pockets with high fees. 
To address this growing problem, Senator Grassley and I introduced the Class Action Fairness Act of 1998 (S. 2083). The bill is a moderate approach to weed out the worst abuses, while preserving the benefits of class actions. It encourages closer scrutiny of class actions through several provisions. It requires that proposed class action settlements be in plain, easily understandable English and be sent to state attorneys general, so they have an opportunity to weigh in with any objections. It requires courts to determine what damages will actually be paid to class members before awarding attorneys' fees, rather than calculating fees based on overvalued estimates of meaningless coupon settlements. And it moves more class actions to federal courts, which generally give closer scrutiny than state courts and can promote efficiency and avoid a collusive `race to settlement' by consolidating overlapping cases. 
These proposals have earned a broad range of support. Even Judge Paul Niemeyer, the Chair of the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, who has studied class actions closely and testified before Congress on this issue, expressed his support for this `modest' measure, noting in particular that increasing federal jurisdiction over class actions will be a positive `meaningful step.' 
This year, our bipartisan measure was reported favorably by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. Unfortunately, as the term has winded down, we have been too busy with other pressing issues to give this proposal the full consideration it deserves. Still, we already have made several revisions to improve the bill and address concerns that have been raised, and in my view any remaining concerns can be worked out. 
So next year, class action reform will be one of my highest priorities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we eliminate those abuses that too often give class actions a bad name.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term Care Patient Protection Act of 1998, along with Senators Reid and Feinstein. I am pleased to introduce this legislation on behalf of the Administration. 
Recently, the Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General issued a report describing how easy it is for people with abusive and criminal backgrounds to find work in nursing homes. On September 14th, the Senate Aging Committee held hearings on this disturbing problem, where we heard horrifying stories of elderly patients being abused by the very people who are charged with their care. While the vast majority of nursing home workers are dedicated and professional, even one instance of abuse is inexcusable. This should not be happening in a single nursing home in America. 
Senator Reid and I have already introduced legislation, the Patient Abuse Prevention Act, to require background checks for health care workers. Those with prior abusive and criminal backgrounds would be prohibited from working in patient care. I am pleased that the Administration has also recognized the importance of addressing this problem, and I have been glad to work with them in this effort. While the bill we introduce today on the Administration's behalf is not perfect, I believe it is another important step in our efforts to pass strong patient protections. 
Mr. President, it is estimated that more than 43 percent of Americans over the age of 65 will likely spend time in a nursing home. The number of people needing long-term care services will continue to increase as the Baby Boom generation ages. The vast majority of nursing homes do an excellent job in caring for their patients, but it only takes a few abusive staff to cast a dark shadow over what should be a healing environment. 
A disturbing number of cases have been reported where workers with criminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in direct patient care, and have subsequently abused patients in their care. Just last year, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel ran a series of articles describing this problem. This past March, The Wall Street Journal published an article describing the difficulties we face in tracking known abusers. 
These news stories are only the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, it is just far too easy for a worker with a history of abuse to find employment and prey on the most vulnerable patients. The OIG report found that 5 percent of nursing home employees in Maryland and Illinois had prior criminal records. And it also found that between 15-20 percent of those convicted of patient abuse had prior criminal records. It is just too easy for known abusers to find work in health care and continue to prey on patients. 
Why is this the case? Because current state and national safeguards are inadequate to screen out abusive workers. All States are required to maintain registries of abusive nurse aides. But nurse aides are not the only workers involved in abuse, and other workers are not tracked at all. Even worse, there is no system to coordinate information about abusive nurse aides between States. A known abuser in Iowa would have little trouble moving to Wisconsin and continuing to work with patients there. 
In addition, there is no Federal requirement that nursing homes conduct a criminal background check on prospective employees. People with violent criminal backgrounds--people who have already been found guilty of murder, rape, and assault--could easily get a job in a nursing home or other health care setting without their past ever being discovered. 
The Administration's bill that we introduce today builds upon the extensive work that Senator Reid and I have done to address this issue, and incorporates some new ideas as well. 
First, this legislation will create a National Registry of abusive nursing home employees. States will be required to submit information from their current State registries to the National Registry. Nursing homes will be required to check the National Registry before hiring a prospective worker. Any worker with a substantiated finding of abuse will be prohibited from working in nursing homes. 
Second, the bill provides a second line of defense to prevent people with criminal backgrounds from working in nursing homes. If the National Registry does not include information about the prospective worker, the nursing home is then required to contact the state to initiate an FBI background check. Any conviction for patient abuse or a relevant violent crime would bar that applicant from working in nursing homes. 
Let me be clear: I realize that this legislation is not perfect. I have significant concerns about several unresolved issues that I believe must be addressed. We must continue to work on minimizing costs and determine a fair and reasonable way to distribute those costs. We must ensure that the system is efficient and effective, with a quick turnaround time and accurate information for providers. And I believe that we must apply these requirements to other health care settings besides nursing homes. It would do little good to ban these people from working in nursing homes, and still permit them to work in home health care. 
Senator Reid and I have worked for a long time with patient advocates, the nursing home and home health industries, and law enforcement officials to address these issues. I have been very heartened by their enthusiasm and willingness to work with us in this effort. It is in all of our best interests to pass legislation that is strong, workable, and enforceable. 
Despite the unresolved issues I have mentioned, I am introducing the Administration's legislation today because I believe it will provide a strong incentive for everyone to stay at the table and resolve these issues. All of us--the President, Congress, health care professionals and consumer advocates--we all share the common goal of protecting patients from abuse, neglect and maltreatment. We must keep working together to create a viable national system that will prevent abusive workers from working with patients. 
Although the remaining days of this Congress are few, we all need to come together once again to reach consensus on the remaining issues and prepare to move this process forward. This legislation gives us an opportunity to act now. I look forward to continuing our work on this issue, and I welcome comments and suggestions for improving the bill. 
Mr. President, I want to repeat that I strongly believe that most nursing homes and their staff provide the highest quality care. However, it is imperative that Congress act immediately to get rid of the few that don't. When a patient checks into a nursing home, they should not have to give up their right to be free from abuse, neglect, or mistreatment. They should not have to worry about dying from malnutrition and dehydration. 
Our nation's seniors made our country what it is today. Before we cross that bridge to the next century that we have all heard so much about, we must make sure we treat the people that brought us this far with the dignity, care, and respect they deserve. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration in this effort to protect patients. Our Nation's seniors and disabled deserve nothing less than our full attention to this matter.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the fiscal year 1999 Agricultural appropriations conference report. This bill would delay reform of the current milk pricing system and extend the life of the controversial Northeast Dairy Compact. Both policies would cost consumers and hurt dairy farmers in the Midwest. 
Most of the debate on this bill has rightly been about how we can help farmers devastated by drought and low crop yields. But just as we must act to help them, we should not act to harm the dairy farmers of Wisconsin and other Midwestern states. 
It is not as if there is support for the damaging dairy policies in this bill. Twenty-five Senators have signed a letter opposing extension of the current milk pricing system and the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The Judiciary Committee has requested that no action be taken to renew the Compact without their review. 
And it is by no means certain that the Compact could survive scrutiny. The higher prices ordered by the Compact are leading to higher consumer prices and a continued decline in fluid milk consumption. Worse yet, these higher prices are primarily benefiting large dairy farms. In Vermont the largest 7 percent of farms receive 30 percent of the Compact revenues. 
As for extending the USDA's time to review the milk pricing system, that is unnecessary. By delaying reform, this legislation does exactly what the authors of the 1996 Farm Bill were trying to prevent. Congress deliberately gave the job of reform to the Secretary of Agriculture so it could be done in a more analytical and less political environment. Our actions today put the antiquated dairy pricing system back into the political arena that created it in the first place. 
To many of you, this may seem to be an arcane debate with little real impact. But in Wisconsin, and through the Midwest region, the current inequitable pricing system is destroying family farms--not because they are uncompetitive, but because of a system that closes off regional markets and prices milk based on where it is made, not on its quality or its cost. Our actions today punish a traditional and successful industry. We are making the Midwest dairy farmers the victims of regional infighting and inside-the beltway politics. That is wrong. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a woman who has been honored as one of only seven Americans to receive the National Crime Prevention Council's Ameritech Award of excellence in Crime Prevention. 
Bette Wahl is an enthusiastic youth advocate and a strong voice in the Eau Claire community for crime prevention. While her words are powerful and persuasive, her actions prove her dedication to the youth of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Mrs. Wahl is the Project Coordinator for the Eau Claire Coalition for Youth. The Coalition is a collaboration of 28 agencies which address the recreational, educational, and social needs of youth and family. Under Mrs. Wahl's guidance, creativity, and energy, the Coalition has grown and become a true asset to the community. 
Bette Wahl has created innovative youth crime prevention programs, enlisting the support of senior citizens in her community. In 1994, Seniors Partnering with Youth brought young and old together to work on service projects that benefit the community. This program provides an alternative activity to crime and delinquency, helps youth serve the community, and develops the values of compassion, respect, and responsibility. Bette also created two pilot youth employment programs which serve as gang and delinquency diversion programs. Through one of the programs, Youth Works, young people build self-esteem, pride, and responsibility. 
Bette has displayed her extraordinary passion and skill while developing effective crime prevention programs in the Eau Claire community. Eau Claire's chief of police, David Malone, called Bette `phenomenal' saying that `she seems to have a unique talent for bringing out the best in people and getting them to reach a solution.' She succeeds where others fail by influencing and inspiring others with her energy and creativity, thereby achieving a positive and permanent change in the crime prevention field. 
Bette recognizes that greater communication and integration of services enables a community to achieve tangible benefits in crime prevention. Sixty percent of juveniles in her truancy reduction program experienced an increase in school attendance; she has provided community service opportunities for 369 youth in another program, and she organizes two youth job fairs each year to match youth with area businesses for entry level jobs. 
Mrs. Wahl's hard work in crime prevention encourages youth, adults, businesses, government agencies, community organizations, and schools to participate in a community-wide partnership to help Eau Claire's youth realize their full potential. On behalf of all those affected by her work and in honor of her recent award, congratulations, Bette Wahl.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to continue our efforts toward promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy technology. The Administration has placed a high priority on energy efficiency for the coming year and we must follow their lead. The problems of air and water pollution as well as the dangers of climate change only reinforce the need for an increased effort. Improved energy efficiency can buy us the time needed to develop an improved national energy policy based on renewable energy which will be the foundation of the 21st century. 
Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels has increased atmospheric CO2, methane and nitrous oxide, all of which contribute to global warming. In fact, U.S. fossil energy currently produces about one-fourth of the world's CO2 emissions. The U.S. accounts for 25% of world oil use, two-thirds of which is consumed by the transportation sector. Economically, U.S. oil imports accounts for 50% of national oil use, which amounts to $60 billion, or 36% of our trade deficit. Mr. President not only is this dangerous for our environment, but it also poses a great threat to our economic security. 
From FY1948-FY1997 total energy R & D spending reached $108 billion. Of this figure $66 billion or 61% has been spent on nuclear technology, $26 billion or 24% for fossil fuels, while only $11 billion or 10% has been spent on renewables and $7 billion or 7% for energy efficiency. In contrast, the DOE's 1995 Energy Conservation Trends report found that energy conservation activities from 1973 to 1991 curbed energy use by about 27%. In 1992 this savings equaled $283 billion or about half of the nation's $538 billion annual energy spending. These figures show the benefits energy efficiency can bring to the U.S. if managed properly. We must work to reverse this discrepancy and increase funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. 
One program which I believe shows great promise for the future is Federal use of Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC's). Administered under DOE's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), ESPC's are a technique which reduces energy costs and consumption by the Federal government without increasing budgetary outlays. ESPC's are awarded to private firms who then install and maintain energy efficiency improvements in Federal facilities while guaranteeing savings. 
However, the FEMP program has repeatedly gone under funded. It is for this reason I introduced the Federal Energy Bank Act of 1997 (S. 1375) which sought an alternative means of providing the critical needed funding for Federal energy management. I'd like to take this time now to thank my colleagues, Senators Feingold, Bumpers, Johnson, Bingaman, Jeffords and Campbell in supporting my bill and efforts. 
Mr. President, President Clinton has recently directed all Federal agencies to maximize their use of ESPC's before the authority to use ESPC's expires in the year 2000. I call on all my colleagues to support a reauthorization and expansion of the ESPC authority before this valuable program expires. We should continue to work with DOE and the Administration to see this important partnership between the private and public sectors is extended well into the future. 
Mr. President, if anyone is skeptical as to the benefits of the program I'd like to give two examples of successful ESPC's involving a Wisconsin company, Johnson Controls. Under one of the largest ESPC's in the country Johnson Controls has agreed to replace the outdated 50-year-old steam system at DOE's Hanford complex in Washington. The Hanford complex, which includes research labs, fuel fabrication facilities, industrial sites as well as numerous administrative buildings are undergoing a transition from a nuclear weapons production site to an energy research and development facility. This 25-year contract will save the taxpayers a guaranteed $108 million while reducing harmful emissions. 
Johnson also has recently signed onto another ESPC with the U.S. Department of Transportation to make improvements to the Volpe National Transportation Center in Massachusetts. Johnson will make and maintain improvements to lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning as well as other energy management systems. This 10-year contract will reduce energy expenses by $200,000 each year for the life of the contract, and limit carbon dioxide emissions. 
Mr. President, this is an important partnership which benefits many parts of society. It's good for the government, the private sector as well as the environment and should be continued. Again, I'd like to thank my colleagues for their past support. I encourage them to support reauthorizing this program for the future and support additional funding for energy efficient and renewable energy technology. Thank you Mr. President.

Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair. 
Today I rise to offer an amendment to reaffirm the Senate's commitment to cap the homestead exemption. The Kohl-Sessions homestead cap is already in the bill, but a sense of the Senate on this issue is important. It sends a message to the House, which does not have a homestead cap in its bill, that this provision is essential to meaningful bankruptcy reform. The $100,000 cap in the homestead exemption is a bipartisan measure I offered with Senator Sessions which was endorsed by Senator Grassley and was approved unanimously in subcommittee. It also has the endorsement of the congressionally appointed National Bankruptcy Review Commission. 
Our bipartisan measure closes a loophole that allows too many debtors to keep their luxury homes while their legitimate creditors, such as children, ex-spousal alimony, State governments, universities, retailers, and banks, get left out in the cold. Currently, five States--Florida, Texas, Kansas, Iowa, and South Dakota--allow debtors to protect their homes no matter how high their value. And time after time, millionaire debtors take advantage of this loophole by moving to expensive homes in these States, especially Florida and Texas, and then declare bankruptcy, yet continue to live in a style which is not appropriate to their circumstances. Let me give you just a few examples. 
A failed Ohio savings and loan owner, who was convicted of securities fraud, wrote off almost $300 million in bankruptcy claims but still held onto the multimillion-dollar ranch that he bought in Florida. A convicted Wall Street financier filed bankruptcy while owing at least $50 million in debts and fines but still kept his $5 million mansion with 11 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms. After his law firm went bankrupt and creditors were already in the process of seizing his two homes in the New York area, former Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn fled to a new $1 million home in Florida although he and his partners were on the line for $100 million. This may not be the most common abuse of the bankruptcy system but it is the most egregious. And given this record, it is not surprising to hear complaints that bankruptcy is no longer used as a tool of last resort and that it has become just another kind of financial planning. If we really want to restore the stigma attached to bankruptcy, these high-profile abuses are the best places to start. 
Mr. President, our $100,000 homestead cap will stop these abuses, and unless we keep it in the bill in conference we will not really have bankruptcy reform at all, in my opinion. So I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
At this point I send my amendment to the desk.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the dramatic rise in bankruptcies is very troubling, regardless of whether the blame lies with credit card companies, a culture that disparages personal responsibility, the bankruptcy code or, most probably, with all of the above. While none of us wants to return to the era of `debtors' prison,' we need to do something to reverse this trend. 
But true `reform' will only occur if we prevent the most egregious abuse of the bankruptcy laws--misuse of the homestead exemption. And we will only have true reform if we target other abuses without overburdening the vast majority of debtors who truly need--and deserve--relief. And, true reform also requires a balanced approach that targets abusive practices by creditors as well as by debtors. 
That is why I intend to vote for this bill. It does all three: prevents the most egregious abuses by capping the homestead exemption, uses `means testing' to deter other serious abuses without placing unfair burdens on honest debtors, and requires credit card companies to disclose the information consumers need to make intelligent choices. 
In particular, let me focus on the cap on the homestead exemption that Senator Sessions and I introduced in subcommittee. This proposal, which was adopted by a unanimous 7-0 vote in subcommittee and was unanimously reaffirmed on the floor through a Sense of the Senate resolution, closes a loophole that allows too many debtors to shield their assets in luxury homes, while their creditors get left out in the cold. Currently, a handful of states allow debtors to protect their homes no matter how high their value. And time after time, millionaire debtors move to states with unlimited exemptions, like Florida and Texas, declare bankruptcy--yet continue to live like kings while their creditors get little or nothing. If we want to restore the stigma attached to bankruptcy, these high profile abuses are the best place to start. 
Our proposal is simple and effective. It caps at $100,000 the maximum homestead exemption that an individual filing bankruptcy can claim. With the cap in place, bankrupt debtors will retain their right to a roof over their heads, but not to luxury accommodations. 
I am concerned, however, that if this homestead cap is dropped in Conference, the President will veto the bill. That is, if it reaches him, because if the cap is removed, I'll filibuster the Conference Report myself. 
But since all of the conferees support the homestead cap provision, and since the Senate has now gone on record as saying that the `cap' is `essential to meaningful bankruptcy reform,' I am confident that we won't have to go that route. 
Mr. President, when people talk about bankruptcy abuse, the notion of stashing cash in a lavish Florida home is the first thing they think about. And that's not surprising. To borrow a phrase from Bill Bennett, Congress needs to act responsibly to put `a death to this outrage.' 
Overall, I commend Senators Grassley and Durbin for their hard work and close collaboration. I look forward to a final product that continues tackling the worst abuses, while still helping honest debtors.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote against the cloture motion on S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act. I do so as a supporter of the bill and as one who supported cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1645. 
Let me be very clear. I support a family's involvement in a minor's very grave decision to have an abortion. I also support the rights of States to protect minors in their borders by passing constitutional consent measures. In my State of Wisconsin, there is a law that requires minors seeking an abortion to get the permission of a parent, a grandparent, an adult sibling, or a judge in cases where family support is unlikely. 
The reports of adults driving unrelated minors across state lines to avoid state consent laws are very disturbing. It is bad enough that a minor would make such a large decision and have such a serious procedure without the support of a family member. It is worse that the procedure might be performed far from home and away from the child's family doctor. It is because of these concerns that I supported S. 1645. 
However, S. 1645 as written is very narrow, and currently would cover only those few states that have strict parental consent laws. It would not cover Wisconsin where the law allows other family members to grant the required consent. In voting in Judiciary Committee to send S. 1645 to the floor, I had assumed that we would be able to address this shortcoming, as well as other technical difficulties with the bill. 
Unfortunately, the Majority decided to file cloture immediately on the bill before any perfecting amendments could be offered. Under the strict rules of cloture, virtually no amendments to S. 1645 would be in order. Of most concern to me, it would have be out of order to consider an amendment protecting from criminal prosection a grandparent who drove a minor across state lines for an abortion. I supported such an amendment in Committee and think it is a necessary, wise, and humane addition to this legislation. 
I am sorry that final consideration of this important measure will be pushed aside by partisan procedural wrangling. Consent laws may be one aspect of the highly charged abortion debate on which a majority of the Congress and a majority of the American people can agree. Sadly, we won't have a chance to find out as the rush to the campaign shoves consensus and sound policy off the agenda.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I support this measure, which will help create competition between satellite and cable television. Read in tandem with our Judiciary Committee proposal, it offers the promise of a comprehensive solution that removes some of the roadblocks to true video competition. Let me commend Senators McCain, Hollings, Hatch, Leahy, DeWine and Lott for their efforts, all of which were instrumental in the creation of a comprehensive package with a real chance to be enacted this year. 
Mr. President, let me explain why we need to move on these measures before the opportunity passes us by. Consumers want real choices. But they won't have a fair opportunity to choose between cable, satellite or other video systems if their network signals are, in essence, separate and unequal. 
The legislation that the Judiciary and Commerce Committees have been working on together would eliminate this problem. They extend the Satellite Home Viewer Act, give satellite carriers the ability to provide local television broadcast signals (while appropriately phasing in must-carry), reduce the royalty fees for these signals, give the FCC time to take a much-needed second look at the definition of `unserved households,' and make sure no one--no one--is terminated before February 28th of next year. 
Mr. President, these bills are not perfect pieces of legislation. And we invite the interested parties to work with us to improve them. But the overall package is a fair and comprehensive one. If we continue to work together, then consumers will have real choices among video providers, and that television programming will be more available and affordable for all of us. In addition, we will help to preserve local television stations, who provide all of us with vital information like news, weather, and special events--especially sports. 
I urge my colleagues to support these bipartisan bills, which will move us toward video competition in the next millennium, and I hope we can enact them as one before this Congress adjourns in October.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Judge Patrick T. Sheedy, who retired last month in Milwaukee after 19 years as a Circuit Court Judge and eight years as Chief Judge for Milwaukee's District 1. 
Pat Sheedy exemplifies everything that we hope to see in a judge in America. He possesses a brilliant legal mind, a compassionate attitude, and the wit to see the humor in almost every situation. 
I am proud to say that Judge Sheedy is a complete product of our great state of Wisconsin. He was born in Green Bay and received his undergraduate and his law degree at Marquette University in Milwaukee. 
In addition to serving 27 years on the bench, Judge Sheedy served his colleagues in a variety of capacities, including as past President of the Wisconsin Bar Association. But, I know his proudest legacy would be his six children and 12 grandchildren. 
Mr. President, we all know of the difficult demands we place on judges in our country. The grueling schedule and stress of legal negotiations can test the patience of even the most reasonable among us. In these most tense moments, Judge Sheedy could diffuse the most trying situations with a bit of his well-known Irish charm and humor. 
We all wish Judge Sheedy well in his retirement. But, the City of Milwaukee and the State of Wisconsin will sorely miss a man who has given back so much to our community and our state.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Ashcroft amendment on marriage penalty tax relief. Let me quickly point out that I strongly support the Senator from Kansas' intentions and believe that most, if not all, of my Senate colleagues do as well. Americans should be free to marry or remain single based on much more important considerations than those related to tax liability. 
That said, the Treasury-General Government appropriations bill is not the proper context for the marriage penalty debate. Now is simply not the right time or place. The Senate voted in favor of marriage tax relief during debate on the tobacco bill. And we all look forward to resuming this debate if and when we are able to take up, and it's my hope that we do take up, a comprehensive tax relief measure later this year. The marriage tax relief issue should be debated at that time, in the context of our overall budget priorities. Simply put, we've come too far in our efforts to enforce fiscal discipline to change course now and arbitrarily adopt major and expensive tax policy mesaures on appropriations bills. 
I will oppose the Aschcroft amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President. I want to take a moment to explain my support for the Daschle amendment on marriage tax relief. As you know, earlier today I opposed the Ashcroft-Brownback amendment on the same subject. My concerns related to the wisdom of attaching such a substantial tax policy change to an appropriations bill. Also, the Brownback amendment was not offset--it would have thrown the budget off balance by approximately $125 billion. The marriage tax debate belongs within the context of a balanced budget and a comprehensive tax bill. And let me again state my hope that we will approve such a tax bill later this year. 
However, it's clear that today's debate is primarily about political messages and maneuvering. And, in that case, the record should demonstrate that my voice and vote definitely stands with those calling for the elimination of the marriage penalty. Our tax code should be family friendly. Couples who want to get married should not be discouraged from doing so based on how much they will owe in taxes. And tax policy changes should be fully offset and respect the principles of a balanced budget. For these reasons, I intend to support the Daschle marriage penalty amendment.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I am truly sorry we have to address it every year. 
The bill we passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee treats federal employees just as private employees with health insurance coverage are treated: they are permitted to join a health care plan that covers a full range of reproductive health services, including abortion. The bill returns us to the policy that was in place before November of 1995. Currently, two-thirds of private fee-for-service health plans and 70% of HMOs provide abortion coverage. 
Like so many of my colleagues, I support a woman's right to choose, and I support policies that will keep abortions legal, safe, and rare. I also support anyone's right not to participate in a health plan that covers abortion, and federal employees can choose such plans under the bill as we passed it out of Committee. 
Adding this amendment, and continuing the unfair policy of the past few years, will impose real consequences, and real pain for government workers.

Mr. KOHL. One had to abort a fetus with no brain. Not only did they have the heartbreak of a failed pregnancy, but they also faced the high financial burden of a major operation not covered by insurance. The second letter tells of a family that had to abort non-viable twins. The cost of this complicated and necessary abortion bankrupted them. 
I understand and respect the deeply held convictions of both sides in the abortion debate. But it is not fair to allow our heated political debate to do real harm to the people who work for the government. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise in strong support of this amendment. It would require Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) plans that cover prescription drugs to also cover FDA approved prescription contraceptives. This same amendment was included in the House version of our bill by a vote of 239-183. 
The issue of family planning should be one that brings together both sides of the abortion debate. Close to half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and tragically, those unintended pregnancies often lead to abortion. By providing federal workers with the most appropriate and safe means of contraception, we can reduce the number of abortions performed and increase the number of children who are born wanted, planned for, and loved. 
I thank Senators Reid and Snowe for their leadership on this issue, and I hope the Senate follows the House's lead and gives this amendment our overwhelming support.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by the Senator from Tennessee. The Senator, I believe, shares the concerns of those of us who drafted section 642--we want to make sure the Federal government does not buy goods made with child labor. However, his amendment, by eliminating the list of suspect goods that Section 642 requires the Department of Labor to make, will make it very difficult for Federal contractors to know whether they are buying a product manufactured by children. 
Section 642 requires the Department of Labor print a list of products that may have been produced with forced child labor. Any federal contractor that sells these products to the government will be put on notice that the items he or she sells might have been produced by child labor. Those businesses then will have to check their suppliers and get assurances that they are not illegally selling a goods produced by children to the government. 
The importance of this list of products that are potentially made with child labor cannot be underestimated. This list will allow federal agencies to focus on specific industries that use child labor most often. It will allow us to be vigilant in our efforts to stop the procurement of such goods. When the government buys soccer balls for the West Point soccer team, we need to be sure they were not sewn together by children. When the government buys tea for the cafeterias and commissaries of federal facilities, we ought to know those leaves were not picked by children. 
I want to commend Senator Harkin for his tireless work on behalf of the exploited children of the world. By putting in place a process by which Federal contractors can know about and be held accountable for products they sell to the government, Senator Harkin has done a significant patriotic act. He has ensured that the United States is not in any way sanctioning, promoting, or even tolerating shameful exploitation of children. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against the Thompson amendment--and to vote against diluting protections against government purchase of goods made with child labor.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McConnell amendment. If this provision is enacted, the traditional bipartisan balance of the Federal Elections Commission will be disrupted. Under this provision the general counsel and staff director of the FEC can essentially be fired by either the three Democratic or Republican Commissioners on the FEC. 
This amendment has the potential of paralyzing the Federal Elections Commission and further eroding what is already a weakened campaign oversight agency. 
Mr. President, such a move would be unprecedented in the Federal Government. According to a memorandum prepared by the Congressional Research Service, no general counsel which is not subject to Senate confirmation may be removed in this manner. It would be ironic that the agency charged with investigating political campaigns is crippled by Congress. 
When this amendment was put forward in the House of Representatives, the New York Times noted that this provision would cripple the FEC and guarantee `an open field for influence peddlers and influence buyers.' 
In a year when this Congress failed to pass campaign finance reform, it would be even more tragic if we crippled the only watchdogs of our campaign finance system. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against the McConnell amendment.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment by Senator Glenn to bring the funding for the Federal Elections Commission to the level requested by the administration. Mr. President, we have watched during the last few years as public confidence in our electoral system has crumbled. We've seen investigations, deliberations, orations--but nothing substantive to improve how we elect Members of Congress. 
We all know that despite the strong efforts of many in this institution--especially Senator McCain and my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold--we have not passed genuine campaign finance reform. 
At the same time, the workload at the FEC has exploded. Since 1991, campaign spending has increased by nearly 150 percent. The number of audits have gone up 110 percent. And the sheer number of transactions recorded by the FEC has increased by 157 percent. This increase in work has come at a time when the FEC, an independent federal agency, has lost employees. In the last three years the number of full time employees has actually dropped from 314 to 300. 
With this increase in work and decrease in staff, it should not be a surprise that the FEC--the agency charged with investigating campaign fraud and abuse--has been forced to drop legitimate cases because of insufficient resources. In 1998 alone, of the cases the FEC dismissed, nearly two out of three cases were dropped because the FEC did not have the resources to fully investigate them. 
Mr. President, if I came before this body today and told you that criminals were being let out of jail because there were not enough policemen on the beat, we would rush to provide more resources to law enforcement. But because those allegedly breaking the law are political candidates and campaigns, we are ignoring the problem. 
The House of Representatives recognized the deficiency in funding and voted to bring the FEC budget to $36.5 million. Senator Glenn's amendment would do the same, and without increasing overall spending. 
Mr. President, we should have passed meaningful campaign finance reform this year, but we did not. Therefore, the only real improvement we can make to our campaign finance system is to provide the policemen of that systems the tool they need to enforce our laws. The Glenn amendment will provide that additional support, and I urge its passage.

However, I share the Senator from New Jersey's desire to clarify the intent of the report language. In so doing, we also have the opportunity to emphasize that no one wishes to harm community service organizations who are legitimately using their tax-exempt status to serve our young people, our families, and our seniors through a variety of health-related programs, including health and fitness programs.

The IRS has issued several private letter rulings and technical advice memoranda (including Technical Advice Memorandum 8502002) over the past years regarding the circumstances when adult fitness can be a charitable activity. It is my understanding that these rulings have stated that adult fitness is a charitable activity as long as the program serves a broad section of the community.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, before I get started, I express my deep sympathy to the families of Officers John Gibson and 
Jacob Chestnut. I also want to express my thanks to these brave heroes and to all the other law enforcement officers here in the Capitol and all over our great country who put their lives on the line every day to keep the rest of us safe. The two fallen officers are true heroes. They died protecting the Nation's most precious symbol of democracy and protecting the people who work here and who visit here. I hope their families take some comfort in the deep respect, gratitude, and pride all of us here feel for their acts of bravery. 
Mr. President, I thank Senator Campbell for his dedication to resolving many issues, large and small, on this Treasury and General Government appropriations bill. 
Throughout this process, he has forged a cooperative relationship not only with me, but with all of the subcommittee members. Throughout his cooperative approach, we were able to work out a reasonable balance among the many programs and activities under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. In addition, I want to acknowledge the very fine work of the chairman's staff, including Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula Edwards. 
As Senator Campbell mentioned, the Treasury and General Government appropriations bill continues and expands many investments in our future. Just for example, the Internal Revenue Service funding level is of critical importance. By passing the IRS restructuring legislation, Congress sent a clear message to the public and to the IRS that it is time for the IRS to provide American taxpayers with the kind of service they have a right to expect. In response, IRS is undertaking its most profound restructuring in more than 40 years. From business practices to organizational structure, the IRS of the future will act differently than the agency we know today. 
This appropriations bill provides the IRS over $7.8 billion to continue basic operations while initiating these changes. These funds will launch the new customer service initiatives, the submission and processing of investments, and the compliance research systems requested by the administration. The funding level will let the IRS revamp its business practices so IRS staff can focus on understanding, solving, and preventing taxpayer problems. 
To effectively update the Federal Government's computer system for the century date change, the committee added $3.2 billion to the Treasury and General Government appropriations bill. This work must be completed in the next 12 months, so money must reach all Federal agencies quickly. By including this emergency funding, the committee provides the Federal Government with the tools it needs to ensure that critical Government functions continue smoothly. 
Law enforcement activities are another important part of this bill, and the committee has provided over $3 billion to continue and expand these programs. Included in this funding level is full funding for the GREAT Program, which provides local police departments the resources necessary to help children avoid the temptation of gangs or drugs; the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, which traces illegal guns and establishes State and local links necessary to end gun trafficking and youth and gang-related violence; and the Customs' Child Pornography and Cyber Smuggling Program, which prevents illegal trafficking and distribution of child pornography both into and throughout the United States. 
The Office of National Drug Control Policy's media campaign receives continued funding of $175 million in this bill. This is the second year of a 5-year program aimed at changing attitudes towards drugs. The committee hopes to see dramatic results from this investment--an investment that is four times greater than the funding provided for GREAT, Youth Gun Crime, and Child Pornography Prevention Programs combined. 
Finally, I want to talk about the Federal Election Commission. This bill provides the FEC with $33.7 million. This is $2.8 million less than the funding provided by the House, and I hope we will bring the funding level up to the House figure. The need for this funding is clear. In congressional testimony earlier this year, FEC officials said they were forced to drop more than 100 cases because they did not have enough people to handle the caseload. 
As you all know, Congress has not been able to agree on campaign finance reforms. But we all agree that the current law must be enforced. And that cannot happen without a fully funded FEC. 
In an era of explosive spending on campaigns through innumerable avenues, both legal and illegal, we owe it to the American people to fully fund the only campaign watchdog we have. 
Finally, we have tried to accommodate numerous requests for funds while remaining within the funding restrictions imposed by the subcommittee allocation. Although we are required to make substantial reductions in the President's request level, I believe that programmatic funding levels included in this bill are fiscally responsible and very reasonable. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to continue protecting our airports and our government buildings from terrorist threats. Our proposal would extend the already existing ban on undetectable firearms--guns that don't set off metal detectors--for five more years. 
In 1988, we passed the Undetectable Firearms Act to bar the manufacture, sale, and possession of any firearm that is not detectable by metal detectors or the type of x-ray machines commonly used at airports. It passed unanimously in the Senate. It was endorsed by the NRA, and the NRA has no objection to this amendment being offered today. 
At the time we passed this law, `plastic' or undetectable guns were not yet developed. But Congress was concerned that technology might make `plastic' guns possible. Ten years later, plastic guns are still not a problem. This law deserves some for that. In fact, on a few occasions, ATF has refused to approve guns intended for commercial distribution because the guns didn't have enough metal in them. 
The Act, however, is scheduled to `sunset' this December. The sunset provision exists because in 1988 it was predicted that new technology would soon be able to detect non-metallic firearms. Unfortunately, technology has not developed so rapidly, so extension of this law appears to be warranted. 
While the Department of Treasury has requested a permanent extension, we propose a five year extension. A five year extension allows us to study whether a permanent law is necessary, and whether non-detectable guns are really a possibility. 
But an extension is appropriate, especially in light of recent events. Indeed, several years ago, it was reported that the columnist Jack Anderson sneaked a `plastic gun' past security into the Capitol. More recently, the New York Times reported that tiny guns made to look like `key chains' could get around metal detectors in Europe. 
Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration. I ask for unanimous consent that it be accepted.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to speak in opposition to the Brownback amendment. 
Sunsetting the Tax Code may sound catchy and attractive, but in truth it is simply wishful thinking until we have some concrete idea about its replacement. 
Now, we all agree that the current code is too complex and too burdensome for the average taxpayer, and everyone agrees that we need a simpler and a fairer system. But we also know that some sort of tax structure is necessary to maintain the vital functions of our Government. The current Tax Code, however imperfect, allows us to sustain our national defense, provide aid to struggling farmers, make sure that those Social Security checks are delivered on time, and much, much more. Down the road, we may envision and hope for a more direct route to providing those resources than the current tax system, but until we find that alternate route, this debate should remain just that, a debate, an open dialog as to what system would best serve the American people. 
In addition, simply sunsetting the code would be a disaster for American business. We hear so much about the need for American corporations to make long-range business plans, and indeed that is true, they must. But how will that be possible if they don't know what Tax Code they will face after the current one sunsets? How many resources would companies waste trying to plan for all the possible new tax codes that we might enact 4 years from now? 
Finally, sunsetting the Tax Code without any notion of how we might pay for it makes a mockery of the progress we have made in balancing the Federal books. We are all encouraged by the budget surplus and the strong economic forecasts, but we should not get ahead of ourselves and think that the good news warrants a swift departure from the tough decisions and fiscal discipline that brought us to this point. 
So for these reasons I will support, when it is raised, a Budget Act point of order against the Brownback amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude to the managers for including an amendment offered by myself and Senator Harry Reid. The managers have worked hard to reach consensus on this legislation, and I commend them for their efforts. 
I believe that this amendment will take another important step toward protecting our nation's elderly and disabled patients from abuse and neglect. The vast majority of employees in nursing homes and home health agencies work hard under stressful conditions to provide the highest quality care. However, there has been too many instances where people with criminal backgrounds and abuse histories have gained employment in long-term care facilities and subsequently abused patients in their care. This is inexcusable; Congress should take every step necessary to make sure that these facilities have the tools they need to screen potential employees. 
During consideration of the Senate Budget Resolution, the Senate unanimously adopted my Sense of the Senate amendment, which expressed strong support for the establishment of a national background check system to weed out known abusers and people with violent criminal backgrounds. The amendment that is included in the manager's package today takes this one step further. This amendment authorizes nursing facilities and home health care agencies to utilize the FBI fingerprint background check system to screen potential employees. It is important to note that this amendment does not mandate that these facilities conduct the checks. It simply allows them to access the FBI system if they choose to do so. 
Many States, nursing facilities and home care agencies have already taken steps to better screen their long-term care employees. This amendment will give them another tool to use in their efforts to screen out known abusers. However, our job does not end here. I still believe that Congress must act to establish a national registry that will coordinate abuse information between States, and require that all long-term care facilities utilize both the registry and the FBI system. I have been working for passage of such legislation, and I am pleased that the President has recently endorsed my idea as well. I look forward to working with the President and all of my colleagues in the future on this important effort. 
It is vital that we continue to take steps to protect our most vulnerable citizens from abuse, neglect and mistreatment, especially at the hands of those who are charged with their care. I believe that this amendment is another step in that direction. Again, I thank the managers for working with me in this effort. I yield the floor.

Mr. KOHL. I would like to thank the Senator from New Hampshire, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations, for his work on this bill. In particular, I appreciate his efforts to maintain funding for the Sea Grant College Program, which facilitates so much valuable research in the Great Lakes and other coastal areas of this country. 
As this process moves forward, it is my hope that the conferees working on this bill will ultimately support and reiterate the language included in the House Committee report related to pathogen research and the Sea Grant College Program. Specifically, this language encourages the agency `to conduct research related to the public health risks posed by pathogens released in ballast water discharges in ports around the country.' 
While we know that pathogens from other regions of the world are sometimes present in the ballast tanks of ships that enter our ports, we have very little information about the public health risks posed by those pathogens. It is important that we improve our state of knowledge in this regard. The Sea Grant College Program and its network of about 300 universities are appropriately positioned to undertake this research. They are in this position due to their ongoing research on aquatic nuisance species and ballast water, as well as their affiliation with human health experts at their network universities. 
Would the Senator from New Hampshire agree that this research on public health risks posed by pathogens in ballast water is important, and efforts should be made through the Sea Grant College Program to undertake such human health risk studies?

Mr. KOHL. I would like to engage Senator Shelby in a colloquy with respect to an issue of importance to my State of Wisconsin and the entire Midwest Region. As you may know, Wisconsin and eight other Midwestern states, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and Ohio, working with Amtrak, have undertaken planning studies of a Midwest regional rail system to be hubbed in Chicago. The regional rail system would provide modern service on all existing rail corridors as well as several new corridors within the nine-state region. By connecting major Midwestern metropolitan areas, ridership and revenue projections have revealed that the rail network would operate without subsidy, enhance regional economic development and increase mobility in corridors with congested highway systems. To date, the states and Amtrak have contributed $468,500. The Federal Railroad Administration has also contributed $200,000 to this endeavor. I understand that the Committee grappled with unique constraints this year due to the firewalls created by the Transportation Equity Act, the so-called TEA-21. Implementation planning funds are needed, however, to move this important project forward. For this reason, I do hope that I can count on your assistance if additional resources become available in conference and as this process moves forward.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. It would significantly cut the proposed funding for an effective prevention program, known as Title V. And it would undermine this bill's balanced approach between prevention and enforcement. 
Let me explain why we should support this program. 
First, it is truly bipartisan. It was originally drafted in 1992 by Senator Brown and myself. Last year, the full Senate supported increasing its funding level from $20 million to $75 million. And this year, with the support of Senators Campbell, Specter and Reid, its funding level is $70 million. Although on its face it gets $95 million, $25 million is set aside for a separate anti-drinking program. So if we cut $50 million, Title V gets the same $20 million it gets every year--and there will be no increase. 
Second, it relies on local communities--who know their needs better than the federal government--to identify solutions tailored to local needs. Let me tell you about some of these programs which get funding in Wisconsin. 
In Madison, Title V funds an after-school program for junior and high school age at-risk youth living in targeted low income neighborhoods. In Racine, it funds home visits by social workers and prenatal and postnatal education to mothers in low-income neighborhoods. In Jefferson County, it supports a program that works with school bullies--and their victims--to reduce school violence. 
And these kinds of innovative programs are supported by Title V all over the nation. For example, in Senator Sessions' home state of Alabama, a Title V program in Tuscaloosa, has--according to its organizers--`made a significant impact in the incidence of juvenile violence and crime.' 
Under Title V, communities qualify for funds only if they establish local boards to design long-term strategies for combating juvenile crime, and if they match federal funds with a 50 percent local contribution. Local communities know what works, and they don't throw good money after bad. 
Finally, Title V works. Nearly 400 participating communities--from 49 states--believe in this program so much that, according to the GAO, they've matched federal money almost dollar-for-dollar--far more than the 50 percent match this program requires. And studies confirm that many of these programs have reduced crime in cities across the nation, including cities like Cincinnati, Ohio and Woodbury, Iowa. 
Mr. President, it's a good idea to get rid of prevention programs that don't work. In fact, I authored legislation that resulted in a very controversial study by the Justice Department, which said that many prevention programs don't work. And with Senator Cohen I introduced legislation to junk bad prevention programs and consolidate many others. But we should keep and expand the programs that do work--especially ones like Title V that use federal dollars to inspire local action and local contributions. 
Mr. President, I oppose this amendment.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support this amendment which would require the sale of a child safety lock with every handgun. This amendment is based on the Child Safety Lock Act which we produced last year with bipartisan support from Senators Chafee, Durbin, and Boxer. 
It is a commonsense measure, obviously, and it is not an extreme measure. It is a measure that will reduce gun-related accidents, suicides, and homicides by young people. It will make children safer and it will make mothers and fathers feel more secure in dropping off their children at their neighbors' homes after school. 
In brief, all it will do is bring all the industry up to the level of most manufacturers who have already agreed to include safety locks with their guns. Our amendment is simple, effective, and it is straightforward. It requires that whenever a handgun is sold, a child safety device--or a trigger lock--also be sold. 
These devices vary in form, but the most common resemble a padlock that wraps around the gun trigger and immobilizes it. 
While we want people to use safety locks, we do not require it. In that sense, we treat safety locks like States used to treat seatbelts: You have to buy them, but you don't have to use them. 
This amendment is sorely needed. Mr. President, 2,000 young people are killed each year in firearms accidents and suicides. This is not only wrong, it is unacceptable. 
While our proposal is not a panacea, it will prevent many of these tragedies. Just today, in the Washington Post there is a story about a Prince George's boy of 4 who shot himself while playing with a handgun that was left laying around by his grandfather. Had that handgun been secured by a child-safety-lock device, this needless tragedy just yesterday would not have occurred. 
Safety locks will also reduce violent crime. Juveniles commit more than 7,000 crimes each year with guns taken from their own homes. That doesn't include incidents like the school shooting in Jonesboro, AR, where the guns were taken from the home of one student's grandfather, again, because most of `dad's guns were locked up.' 
If parents and relatives would use safety locks on these guns, then at least some of these incidents will be prevented. To be sure not all, but some. The fact is that a child with a handgun is an accident or a crime just waiting to happen. Of course, we should commend the gun manufacturers who already have voluntarily agreed to comply with this proposal. But we still need this legislation because too many manufacturers still resist common sense. 
The voluntary agreement covers about 77 percent of all new handguns manufactured in the U.S. each year, which is an impressive number. But it still leaves at least 350,000 handguns for sale each year without safety locks. This proposal brings hundreds of thousands more handguns up to the industry standard. 
Mr. President, this amendment deserves our support. I thank you, and I yield my time back. 
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Just a couple of brief points. Even though Senator Craig and those of us on the other side differ on this amendment, I have no doubt that Senator Craig is committed to ensuring gun safety. In fact, he was instrumental in passing our 1994 law, the Youth Handgun Safety Act that prohibits kids from having handguns. 
Second, we have really come a long way in the last few years. Today everybody, from the NRA to the gun manufacturers to police advocates, is advocating for handgun control because all believe that trigger locks, child safety locks, are helpful in preventing gun-related harm. 
No matter what the outcome is on this vote, I am sure we will continue to work for a consensus. Someday, I believe we will reach one on the issue of kids and guns.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment for two reasons. First, while I have a great deal of respect for Senator Smith--I was in the room when we wrote the Brady Act--along with Senators Dole, Mitchell and Metzenbaum. Certainly no one in that room believed that you couldn't charge fees under Brady. If anything, we expected that fees would be charged for doing checks. Nothing in Brady's legislative history leads me to change my mind. 
Fees for background checks are nothing new. In fact, when we negotiated Brady, all of us were aware that the FBI charged fees for other background checks. And no one was surprised that, once Brady became law, 39 States authorized fees for State-run Brady checks. No one is questioning these other fees. 
Second, prohibiting fees--without otherwise providing the funding necessary to support the instant check system--would endanger the Brady Act. The instant check system, which was originally proposed by the NRA itself, is an essential part of Brady that is scheduled to replace the State-run system at the end of this year. 
Of course, these instant checks will cost money. The FBI believes it will need about $75 million to pay for additional staff and resources. Unless the instant check system gets funded, these checks will not happen. No funding, no checks. And no checks means more criminals with guns and more violence. 
Now, in my opinion, it doesn't matter whether the funding for instant checks comes from fees or from a separate appropriation, but we need funding from somewhere, and we should not make the FBI choose between cracking down on violent gangs and doing instant checks. But this amendment provides no alternative funding. 
Mr. President, the real issue before us is this. We can pay for instant checks and build on the Brady Act's record of stopping nearly 150,000 criminals from buying guns, or we can leave Brady's future up in the air and risk putting more guns in the hands of dangerous felons. In my view, the choice is easy. I do not want to see the FBI make a `profit' on these fees, but we need to make sure that background checks continue saving lives by defeating this amendment. 
I thank the Chair. I yield for the Senator from California.

Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
This program was always intended to aid low- and middle-income home buyers. It was never intended to be of assistance to the high-income home buyer. The high-income home buyer belongs in the private mortgage insurance business. This amendment recognizes that. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the amendment offered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles. As my colleagues know, this amendment would strike the increase to the high-end FHA loan limit included in the VA/HUD bill. 
FHA is intended to fill an important mission--helping low- and middle-income Americans purchase their first homes--helping those who are not served by the private market. 
For this reason, our amendment leaves the proposed increase to the low-end FHA loan limit in place, ensuring that in the vast majority of States across the country--97 percent of the counties in the United States--the loan limit will be more than sufficient for low- to moderate-income people to purchase homes of their own. 
But we should all be reminded that any decision to raise the loan limits on the high end should be approached with caution. FHA loans are 100 percent insured by the Federal Government. If a home owner goes into default, it is the taxpayer, not the lender, that bares the risk. And that's no small risk--FHA default rates are three times higher than defaults on conventional mortgages. Last year, foreclosures on FHA homes resulted in over $5 billion in claims. 
There is no reason to extend that risk on behalf of home buyers who are already well-served by the private market. Raising the high end limit and expanding FHA to cover expensive homes may very well jeopardize the health of the entire program. Higher priced home loans, especially when combined with the relatively low downpayments required by FHA, default more often--and obviously cost more when they default. Raising the high end limit would clearly place the Federal Government in competition with the private sector, needlessly expose taxpayers to more risk, and give upper income home buyers access to mortgage credit they don't need. 
Changing the high end limit will steer the program away from working families--at a higher cost to taxpayers--with more devastation to the communities that hold abandoned, foreclosed-upon FHA properties. 
With this amendment, we have the chance to ensure that the program stays focused on borrowers who legitimately need help and also to create a strong, healthy FHA that works for everyone--home buyers, lenders, and the taxpayers. 
So I urge my colleagues to support the Nickles amendment.

Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the clarification by the Senator from Missouri. There has been considerable concern in our home state of Wisconsin that since EPA has combined its budget request for the 319 and 314 programs, Clean Lakes program grants to states have been reduced in the number of projects and dollars spent.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Senator Sessions and I today are introducing a bill that guarantees prosecutors can exercise their full power to keep criminals off our streets. The `Effective Prosecution and Public Safety Act of 1998' makes clear that prosecutors can offer plea bargains to accomplices in exchange for their testimony--a long-standing, accepted and necessary practice--without tainting a conviction resulting from such testimony. This measure puts to rest any concerns raised by an overwhelmingly disputed decision issued recently by a panel of three appellate court judges. And it makes it less likely that courts could overturn convictions of dangerous criminals like Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. 
Until a court decision two weeks ago, there was no doubt that prosecutors could build criminal cases by offering leniency to accomplices in exchange for their testimony at trial. But in U.S. versus Singleton, a Tenth Circuit panel held that a federal anti-bribery statute, which had been on the books for over 35 years, barred these kinds of leniency deals. This unprecedented decision has been criticized virtually unanimously. Subsequently, the full Tenth Circuit put the decision on hold, pending a full court rehearing scheduled for November. 
There is little doubt that the Tenth Circuit's decision is just plain wrong. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress ever intended to take away a prosecutor's ability to make deals for testimony. And it is no surprise that in 35 years no court ever found the anti-bribery statute to apply to this reasonable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This decision is simply a case of Scalia-ism taken to the extreme, beyond the bounds of common sense and in the face of established practices. I cannot believe that even Justice Scalia, the high priest of literalism, would agree with this result. 
As wrong as this decision is, it still cannot be taken lightly. Prosecutors make deals with cooperating witnesses all the time. So this decision puts tens of thousands of convictions in jeopardy. For an example, we need look no further than the conviction of Timothy McVeigh, which was based in large part on the testimony of Michael Fortier, who was allowed to plea to lesser charges in exchange for his testimony. And McVeigh's conviction is on appeal in the same Tenth Circuit--could that be the next conviction it will try to overturn? 
In my view, the risks posed by this decision are too great to leave this issue to the courts--even though I am confident that in the end they would do the right thing. Indeed, until this issue works its way to the Supreme Court, the potential dangers are serious. Prosecutors may feel the need to hold back on cutting deals with potential witnesses, making it tougher to convict dangerous criminals. And criminals behind bars will have a better chance than ever at overturning their convictions. Already, jailhouse lawyers are probably foaming at the mouth anticipating making this argument in courts all over the nation. 
Congress can act now to put this issue behind us, to guarantee that prosecutors are not hampered in their efforts to put criminals behind bars, and to make sure that is where criminals stay. This bill is simple and effective. It amends the anti-bribery statute to exempt deals for leniency made by prosecutors in exchange for testimony. And it applies to past as well as future deals, so that no criminal--including the Oklahoma City bomber--can try to use this awful decision as a `get out of jail card' at the expense of the safety of the American people. 
Mr. President, let me make clear what this proposal does and what it does not do. All it does is reinforce what Congress always intended--to allow plea bargains in exchange for testimony. It does not permit prosecutors to `buy' testimony with cash payoffs. That is still illegal. It does not allow prosecutors to knowingly elicit false testimony. That is obstruction of justice. And it does not prevent a defense attorney from raising a deal at trial to try to cast doubt on the credibility of a witness. That is what cross-examination is all about.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to make just a brief statement to emphasize my strong support for the IRS Reform bill which passed the Senate earlier today. Many thanks to Senators Roth and Moynihan and the Finance Committee members for their efforts, and especially Senator Bob Kerrey, whose year long effort on the Restructuring Commission made this reform package possible. 
The IRS Reform bill contains significant measures that will improve the life of every American by improving an agency that touches the lives of every American. The bill will reform IRS management by enhancing private sector input through the creation of the Oversight Board. It will also strengthen internal IRS management by providing increased flexibility to hire the best people, recognize those IRS employees who do their jobs well and fire those who do not. 
Perhaps most importantly, the IRS Reform Bill is grounded in the principles of consumer protection and accountability. We all agree that the IRS should run more like a business, focusing on management efficiency and high standards of performance. But businesses answer to shareholders and the bottom line. The IRS must answer to the American people. And for too long, the agency has operated as if it answered to no one. 
We have witnessed this regrettable circumstance in my home state of Wisconsin where for two and a half years we have worked to address allegations of misconduct and discrimination at the Milwaukee-Waukesha IRS Offices. These allegations were so serious that some IRS employees felt the need to sneak into my office in Milwaukee to report on abuses. I am pleased that the debate on IRS reform allowed us to move forward in our attempts to address the Milwaukee situation and am convinced that in approving this historic legislation, we will be taking significant steps to prevent similar incidences from occurring in the future. 
Mr. President, I do want to mention my regret at the decision to include the tax policy change involving Roth IRA conversion rules. While I support the IRS reform bill, I disagreed with the policy decision to loosen the conversion rules so that it will be easier for wealthy retirees to convert from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs. This may cover the cost of the IRS bill and generate income for the Treasury in the short term, but it will cost the Treasury and the American taxpayer dearly in the long run. This change, which is really just an accounting gimmick, will benefit those who do not need help and may undermine our efforts to maintain the progress we've made in balancing the budget. In addition, it may jeopardize other pressing long term issues such as making sure that social security is available to needy retirees in years to come. 
That said, however, I am still pleased to have been part of the creation of a more consumer-friendly, efficient and responsible IRS.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of this amendment to eliminate the Extremely Low Frequency or ELF System, and transfer these funds, some $12 million, to the National Guard. I commend my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, for his persistent efforts to kill this cold war relic. 
It is amazing to me that no matter how many times the Senate votes in favor of eliminating this little known and obsolete system, it continues to reemerge in conference. In an era of tight budgets, with pressures to fund operations abroad and maintain modernization efforts at home, we need to take a closer took at the ELF System and recognize that we have far more compelling needs even within the defense budget. 
Project ELF was conceived solely to launch and win a nuclear war. It was designed to protect submerged submarines from Soviet detection. Unfortunately, ELF's capabilities are minimal and, given the end of the cold war, its rationale is dubious. ELF is a communications system for sending one-way pre-formatted messages from shore commands to submarines operating at high speeds and depth without exposing antennae on the ocean surface. ELF's message capability is very limited and very slow--three letters take 15 minutes to transmit--so a submarine must still surface to retrieve communications. This poses serious questions about the protection ELF can provide to our submarine fleet. 
ELF's transmitting facilities are located in Clam Lake, WI and Republic, MI. The two antennae work together to strengthen the signal. The Clam Lake antenna is 28 miles long with two sets of wires strung on telephone poles. The wires form an X running several miles out in four directions from the center. 
The existence of this large antenna in Wisconsin has raised health and environmental questions over the years. At best the data on the risks posed by this facility are inconclusive. At worst, more than 40 medical studies point to a link between electromagnetic pollution and cancer. The people of Wisconsin would rather not have this question mark hanging over their heads. 
Directing ELF's funding to the National Guard would be a much better use of these funds. The National Guard has been under funded in the FY99 budget request and the trend continues in that direction: Unfunded requirements for the Army National Guard could exceed $1.2 billion by 2002 if current trends continue. Our amendment will help address this shortfall. 
Let me just conclude by noting that people of Wisconsin do not want this system in their borders. For years now, we have been working with the members of Congress in whose districts this system is based to shut it down. We almost succeeded in 1995 when the Senate Appropriations Committee rescinded funding for ELF in the Defense supplemental. At that time, I was told that the Navy wasn't interested in funding ELF anymore. Furthermore, when the Strategic Command was asked about the ELF program, it was lukewarm in its support, indicating that they would like to see ELF funded but they couldn't possibly fund it out of their own budget. Yet, at the last minute in conference, the House announced that there was new and classified information that supposedly revealed that ELF is essential to national security. The Defense Department has since weighed in with a letter saying it would like to keep ELF. 
Our inability to kill ELF is a perfect example of how we can't seem to shed the Cold War infrastructure that has shaped our defense budgets for so many years. We pay much lip service to `defense reform' and making defense spending relevant to threats of the future, but when we have a small opportunity to demonstrate our resolve in this area, we cower at the thought of dismantling even one small system. 
Mr. President, let's not hesitate this time. Let's eliminate this anachronism once and for all. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for his leadership on this issue.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my intention to vote in favor of the conference report to the Coverdell education savings accounts legislation. I do not believe that this alone will save our nation's education system, and I realize that this bill will only provide limited help to a very small percentage of students. But I believe it is one small step we can take to help improve education in this country, and that it will open the door for a discussion of other new approaches. 
Let me state unequivocally that I strongly support our public school system. I believe we should be doing much more to help States and local school districts address the challenges they face in improving public schools. Over 90% of our nation's children are educated in public schools, and we must not abandon our efforts to help educators, parents and communities provide the best education possible. 
Unfortunately, it is becoming apparent that despite our best efforts, we are not doing the best we can for our children right now. Too many of our children are falling behind and performing below their potential. Too many schools are in need of repair or modernization. Too many students are bringing guns and drugs to school. Too few classrooms have access to technology, and too few teachers have the training necessary to help students succeed in an increasingly global, technology-based economy. 
Clearly, it is time that we take a look at some new approaches to improving education. The status quo is unacceptable and we owe it to our children to do better. I initially opposed the Coverdell legislation in part because it included two amendments that I strongly oppose. Both amendments --one that would block grant one-third of Federal education programs, and another that prohibits the development of voluntary national tests--were dropped in conference. I am pleased that the conferees decided to omit these amendments, which I believe would have seriously undermined our commitment to public school students. 
Now that these two troubling amendments have been dropped, I have decided to support the Coverdell legislation. While this legislation will not solve all of the problems in public schools, it provides limited assistance to families that choose to use their own money to decide what type of education their children receive. I realize that it will only help a small number of families, but limited doses of competition could help encourage all schools to strive to do a better job. In addition, this legislation sunsets after five years. If, at that time, it is clear that this approach has not worked or has harmed public education, Congress can decide not to reauthorize this program. But I believe that there are benefits to trying this new approach now to see if it might contribute to the overall improvement of education in our country. 
We certainly do not want to abandon public education, and I believe there are better ways to help public schools address the many problems and challenges they face. During the course of this debate, I voted for many alternative education proposals that I felt would do a better job at improving public education. I am still hopeful that the Senate will make other education reform proposals a top priority during the remaining months of this session. But so far, our nation's education system has failed too many of our children--we cannot ignore that fact. It is time to look to new and innovative strategies to improve educational opportunties in America. The Coverdell legislation could be a small part of that effort, but it is certainly not the only step we should take. I will continue to support a strong investment in our nation's public school system, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that happens.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, disturbing events taking place around the world pose grave challenges to our U.S. strategic interests. In Pakistan and India, nuclear weapons are being developed, assembled and tested, escalating an arms race in the region. In Indonesia, the collapse of the rupiah has caused an economic and political crisis that has reverberated throughout the international financial markets. In China, missile proliferation looms ominously as evidence suggest that China conspired to sell entire missiles to other nations. And, in the former Yugoslavia province of Kosovo, NATO defense ministers have launched air exercises in an effort to convince Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic to halt his crackdown on the separatist ethnic Albanians in what has become Europe's most threatening security crisis since the 1992-95 Bosnian war. 
These are just some of the more widely known international crises--requiring U.S. vigilance to protect its strategic interests. But there are lesser known struggles in remote and distant lands that have significant implications for U.S. foreign policy. One of these that deserves our attention is the conflict in the Republic of Georgia and its small break-away region of Abkhazia. In the wake of the recent armed insurrection in Abkahazia, U.S. efforts to ensure Georgia achieves and sustains political independence and economic stability must be enhanced. 
Of all the newly independent states to emerges from the breakup of the former Soviet Union, Georgia is considered the most pro-western nascent democracy. Since its independence in 1991, Georgia has faced and begun to surmount formidable problems of economic collapse, civil war, separatist conflict, rampant crime, political infighting, and human rights abuses. Much to Russia's chagrin, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze has exerted strong leadership by moving Georgia away from Russia's sphere of influence. He has pursued an independent foreign policy, ushered in democratic and market reforms, and achieved annual growth rates of 10 percent. 
Moreover, Georgia is a NATO borderland and at the entry point to the emerging new `Silk Road' that traverses Central Europe to China. This commercial route will eventually encompass oil and gas pipelines, roads, railroads, bridges, airports and communications networks. It will completely alter the region's economic and political landscape. Because Georgia is situated at a critical juncture in the corridor, stability in this state, and its neighbors, is essential. There are signs of a Russian strategy to keep the region frozen in instability, thereby discouraging commercial investment, and ultimately forcing nascent democracies and their resources back into Russia's tacit control. 
The small, breakaway region of Abkhazia has been Russia's best available instrument to diminish Georgia's accomplishments and to imperil its remarkable gains. Numerous and compelling reports, including eye-witness accounts by Georgian refugees, suggest active Russian involvement in arming, training and sustaining Abkhazia's so-called freedom fighters against Georgian nationals. 
In this context, I am very concerned by indications of Russian activities and covert aggression aimed at eroding public support for President Shevardnadze and his administration. I regard Georgian independence from Russian hegemony as a critical first step toward stability in the region. 
I strongly encourage the administration to end its neglect of this situation and become actively engaged. The administration should state unequivocally that it stands behind the leadership of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze; that the stability and survival of an independent, democratic Georgia is in our national interest; and that the U.S. will consider all appropriate measures necessary to help build closer economic and political ties between Georgia and the United States. Finally, the administration should call the Russians to task for engaging in activities that would re-subordinate Georgia to Moscow's rule. 
Moreover, Congress should move expeditiously to secure enactment of the `Silk Road Strategy Act of 1997.' This legislation is designed to promote sovereign and independent democratic governments; assist in the development of infrastructure necessary for communications, transportation, energy and trade on an East-West axis; and promote market-oriented principles and practices among Central Asian and South Caucasus countries. Passage would help curb Russian hegemony in the region and contain the spread northward of anti-western Islamic extremism. The legislation is designed to assist all the nations of the region--Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhastan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. 
Russia is again increasing its grip on the region and working to keep these countries from maintaining their independence. Iran continues to exert influence to foster anti-western attitudes. It is critical that we help these countries look westward to contain extremist forces hostile to U.S. interests--and this is a good place to start.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Children's Development Commission Act. I am pleased to be joined in this by my friend, Senator D'Amato. He brings to this endeavor a deep understanding of the nation's capital markets and a deep concern for the well being of this country's children. In the House of Representatives, Representatives Maloney and Baker have already introduced a companion measure, H.R. 3637. 
Our legislation is designed to address the credit market's failure to provide sufficient long term financing for the building and renovation of child care centers, after-school care programs, infant care, and family child care homes. Because the profit margin in such centers is very low, and the perceived risk is great, lenders are often unwilling to lend to child care operations. This is true despite the fact that an overwhelming number of studies show a shortage in the supply of quality child care--especially in urban areas, in low income areas, and for certain types of care (infant care, school age care, off-hour care). 
The Children's Development Commission Act creates a loan guarantee program through HUD to provide insurance to lenders willing to put up money for child care center mortgages, leases, or renovations. The program is modeled closely on the successful Section 232 HUD program that provides mortgage insurance for elder-care facilities. 
The bill also creates a `Children's Development Commission' or `Kiddie Mac' which: (1) certifies child care development facilities eligible for guaranteed financing; (2) establishes the standards necessary to make such certification; (3) makes small purpose loans to child care facilities for reconstruction and renovation; (4) develops a plan to offer low cost liability and fire insurance to child care providers; and (5) creates a research foundation to support research into child care supply issues, fund pilot programs for improving child care, and publishes material for those interested in getting mortgage insurance through HUD. 
Congress will make one $10 million appropriation to fund the Kiddie Mac's incorporation and its micro-loan program; after that, a stock offering will fund Kiddie Mac until its financial activities and fee collection make it self-financing. 
The need, and the will, to take this sort of step to increase the supply of quality child care is evident. When I ran for Congress in 1988, I talked about the importance of child care. At best, I received a polite smile of interest, and then the discussion would move on to the pressing issues of the day--the environment, the budget deficit, health care. 
Today, child care is being discussed earnestly at dinner tables across the nation and in Committee rooms all over the Capitol. Almost everyone has a personal story about trying to secure good child care, about trying to help an employee find good child care, about the terrible shortage of quality child care in their town or city. 
We have always talked about the necessities of life as being food, clothing and shelter. I think it is time we add a fourth--quality child care. It is necessary to give our children the strong start they need. It is necessary if we are going to take advantage of the tremendous ability to learn in the first three years of life. 
And quality child care is necessary in order for the growing number of families in which both parents work, for the growing number of single parent families to be able to earn a living, and for businesses that want to attract and retain productive, happy employees. 
Unfortunately, by every measure and in every state, quality child care is in short supply. And in most areas of the country, the sweeping welfare reform we passed last year has exacerbated existing shortages. In my State of Wisconsin, the State's welfare reform plan will generate the need for 8000 new child care slots in Milwaukee Country alone. And in New York City, by the year 2001, there will be 30,000 more children who need child care than there are child care spaces for them. 
The shortage is not just one of child care slots, but of quality child care slots. One major study showed that seven out of ten child care centers provide mediocre care, while one in eight is so inadequate that the health and safety of the children are threatened. Another survey found that more than half of parents with children in child care worry weekly about whether their children are well-served in their current arrangements. 
Kiddie Mac will help address these shortfalls in several ways. It will lower the costs of those setting up child care facilities, home child care, or pre-schools. By guaranteeing child care facility mortgages and leases, Kiddie Mac lowers the start-up costs to facilities allowing them to pass the savings on to teachers in the form of higher salaries and parents in the form of lower fees. Kiddie Mac will also provide loan guarantees to facilities that want to upgrade and providing micro-loans for small repairs related to licensing. This will allow existing centers and homes, even very small ones, to bring their facilities up to--and beyond--code. 
Kiddie Mac is a market-based, small-government approach to moving capital toward a very wise investment in quality child care. Kiddie Mac's services will be available to any organization who can show they will provide quality child care: businesses, non-profits, churches or synagogues, family home providers, or after-school programs. Decisions as to how much and how the care will be provided are left where they belong: with the local providers, with local communities, and with the parents.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join 16 of my colleagues in cosponsoring S. 1993, the Medicare Home Health Equity Act. I want to commend my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, for taking the lead on this extremely important issue. This legislation will go a long way toward ensuring that seniors in Wisconsin continue to have access to the quality home health services they need, and that home health providers in low-cost States like Wisconsin receive fair and equitable reimbursement for the valuable services they provide. 
Mr. President, I have long supported efforts to expand access to home health care. This important long-term care option allows people to stay in their homes longer, where they are often most comfortable, while they receive the skilled medical care they need. Home care empowers people to continue to live independently among their families and friends. It is of added value that in many cases, home care is also more cost-effective than institutional-based care. For those seniors whose medical needs can be met with home-based care in a cost-effective way, we should do everything we can to make sure that they have the choice to continue to stay in their homes and received care through the Medicare home health benefit. 
I realize that the Medicare changes Congress made last year in the Balanced Budget Act were necessary in order to help prevent Medicare from going bankrupt. Home health is the fastest growing component of Medicare and it was imperative that we bring costs under control. However, I am deeply concerned that the Interim Payment System created in the BBA will inadvertently penalize those States, like Wisconsin, that have historically done a good job in keeping costs low. 
The IPS established in the BBA is based on a technical formula which pays home health agencies the lowest of three measures: (1) actual costs; (2) a per visit limit of 105% of the national median; or (3) a per beneficiary annual limit, derived from a blend of 75% of an agency's costs and 25% regional costs. Without going into the details of this complicated formula, this in effect means that agencies that have done a good job keeping costs and utilization low will be penalized under the IPS. At the same time, those agencies that provided the most visits and spent the most per patient will be rewarded by continuing to receive higher reimbursement levels that the agencies that were more efficient. Although the IPS would reduce reimbursement for everyone, Wisconsin agencies have already been successful in keeping costs low, and there is no fat to trim from their reimbursement. 
The proposed IPS would be devastating for home care in Wisconsin and would likely drive many good providers from the Medicare program. Already, I have heard from Wisconsin agencies who have had to let staff go, limit new patients, and who honestly don't know how they will be able to afford to operate under the IPS. This will severely hurt Wisconsin's seniors, many of whom will now have to enter nursing facilities because far fewer home health services will be available for them. 
Mr. President, this was not my intention when I voted for the Balanced Budget Act last year, and I believe that we must now work to make the IPS more equitable for seniors and providers. The Medicare Home Health Equity Act will accomplish this by changing the formula on which IPS is based. The new formula would be based 75 percent on the national average cost per patient in calendar year 1994 ($3,987) and 25 percent on the regional average cost per patient in calendar year 1995. This change would bring more equity between States and would ensure that low cost States like Wisconsin are not penalized for being efficient. Most importantly, this change will ensure that seniors in Wisconsin continue to have access to the quality home health care services they need and deserve. 
Mr. President, I understand that several more of my colleagues are also working on legislation that would bring greater equity to the Interim Payment System. I am cosponsoring this legislation not only because it is good for Wisconsin and other low cost States, but also because it is my hope that by bringing attention to this issue, we can all work together to find a fair solution for all States. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue during the remaining months of the 105th Congress.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I come here today to discuss an amendment to the tobacco bill and to highlight how tobacco companies have used court secrecy orders to deceive and endanger the American public. While secrecy orders may be justified to protect personal information or trade secrets, they all too often have been abused--especially by tobacco companies--to undermine health and safety. We need to strike a better balance and make sure this tactic can't be used to cover up future bad conduct. 
Typically, tobacco companies--like many other defendants--threaten that without `secrecy,' they will fight to conceal every document, and they will refuse to settle. They insist on making secrecy--or `protective'--orders a precondition to turning over documents and to settlement. And overmatched victims have no choice but to accept these demands, even though there is no legal reason why most of the documents should be kept under wraps. 
While courts actually have the legal authority to deny requests for secrecy, often they do not--because both sides have agreed, and judges don't take the time to independently look into the matter themselves. 
Over the years, we have raised this concern, citing several examples, including defective heart valves, exploding fuel tanks, and dangerous playground equipment. In case after case, people have been injured or killed by defective products that remained on the market while crucial information was sealed from the public light. This is not only wrong, it is also unacceptable. 
There is no doubt that the most flagrant abuse of secrecy orders involves Big Tobacco. This tactic has served the industry in two disturbing ways. First, it dramatically drove up the cost of litigation by making every plaintiff `reinvent the wheel.' As one tobacco official boasted, rather crudely, `the way we won these cases was not by spending all of [our] money, but by making that other S.O.B. spend all his.' And secrecy orders helped them do it. 
Second, secrecy kept crucial documents away from public view. The tobacco companies have used secrecy orders and attorney-client privilege to conceal all kinds of materials critical to public health and safety, including many relating to teen smoking and nicotine levels. Once these documents were released, public outrage compelled action. But if the public had this information earlier, we could have saved thousands of lives. 
The underlying tobacco bill--which I strongly support--sets up a depository where tobacco companies are supposed to send current and future documents. But the tobacco companies have made clear that they will not cooperate. They'll just tie up this and other provisions in court, and the promise of a meaningful document library will literally be empty. 
So the bill leaves a big, big loophole. In the future, tobacco companies could add new ingredients to cigarettes that pose health risks or make tobacco more addictive. And they will still be able to rely on secrecy orders to conceal these hazards from the public. 
Our proposal will close this loophole. It is simple, effective and limited in scope. It only applies to a small category of cases, like tobacco, which involve public health or safety. Before approving secrecy orders, courts would apply a balancing test--they could permit secrecy solely if the need for privacy outweighs the public's right to know. In addition, the amendment bars any agreement that would prevent disclosure to the federal and state agencies charged with protecting public safety. 
Mr. President, our proposal does apply to more than just tobacco cases, of course, and it should. We need to prevent others from copying the tobacco industry's tactics. 
Bipartisan support for this proposal has grown over the years. Last Congress, it passed the Judiciary Committee 11 to 7. So if the tobacco bill moves forward, this proposal should be included. 
But even if the tobacco bill goes down, we still need to address this problem. Because who knows what other hazards are hidden behind courthouse doors? So if necessary I will offer this amendment to another measure. 
Today, a debate is raging about whether the President is hiding behind court orders and legal privileges. But when health and safety are at issue, there shouldn't be any debate at all. This is far too important. We need to learn our lessons from tobacco and take action to stop the next threat. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the final passage of our Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act and to commend Senator DeWine, cosponsor of the Senate version which we passed last November, along with Chairman Hyde and Congressman Hoyer for their commitment to promoting the welfare of children and to strengthening our child support laws. In sum, this measure sends a clear message to the deadbeat parents of America: pay up or go to jail. 
Mr. President, when the original Child Support Recovery Act of 1990 was first enacted, Senator Shelby and I hoped to make a real impact on the non-payment of support orders. And we did make some progress. Over 200 more cases of nonpayment were prosecuted. Over 50 went to jail. Of the 150-some remaining cases, many were dropped when the defendant agreed to pay the support arrears. And some very high profile cases prosecuted under this law have also made some potential deadbeats think twice before not paying. But for some deadbeats the threat of a misdemeanor sentence still isn't enough to keep them paying. Many would rather `risk it.' They know that if they get caught for a first offense--no matter how big their debt and no matter how long they went without paying--they aren't facing a felony conviction. 
Now, Mr. President, we are not trying to throw people into jail. We'd rather they paid their child support on time and in full. And many parents--mothers and fathers--do just that. But some need a little extra incentive to fulfill their responsibilities. The threat of a year in prison and a felony conviction on their records, contained in this bill, provides that much needed incentive. 
It has been estimated that if delinquent parents fully paid up their child support, approximately 800,000 women and children could be taken off the welfare rolls. In fact, Mr. President, since our original legislation was signed into law in 1992, collections have increased by nearly 50 percent, from $8 billion to $11.8 billion. Moreover, a new national database has helped identify 60,000 delinquent fathers--over half of whom owed money to women on welfare. 
Although we should be proud of these efforts, they are merely a point of departure, not a final destination, It seems to me that in passing this legislation, we all recognize that we can not simply stop and rest on our laurels. We must continue to work on behalf of children and families. We must give police and prosecutors the tools they need to make a real impact on the non-payment of child support. And today, we have taken that next step, we have done these things, and we have continued this important work. I look forward to the President's signing this bill into law, which will help ensure that deadbeats across the country sign more child support checks.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will vote against cloture on the motion to proceed to the House version of the nuclear waste bill, but I want to be very clear that my vote does not change my strong support for nuclear waste legislation--and for passing such legislation this year. The federal government must act to fulfill its legal responsibility to store used fuel from more than 100 nuclear power plants across America. Over a decade ago, the federal government promised the ratepayers of Wisconsin that it would take possession of all the spent nuclear waste in the State by 1998 and send it to the desert of Nevada for long-term storage. On the basis of that promise, the ratepayers of Wisconsin have paid over $250 million into a fund to help pay for the construction of the storage site. But we have seen no return on that investment, only delays. 
This vote today has nothing to do with nuclear waste. The fate of that legislation lies in the House. The vote today is about tobacco--and whether we will continue to work on the strong tobacco control legislation that we started on two weeks ago. 
Let me be clear about that because most people watching this debate outside of Washington D.C. may not understand how these two important issues are linked. Very simply, if we invoke cloture right now, the tobacco bill will be bumped off the Senate floor and will not come back until the majority leader, and every Member of this body, agrees to bring it back. Though I think there is tremendous support for tobacco legislation, I do not think there is unanimous support--and that's what we would need to bring the bill up again. 
So I will oppose cloture today, but I will continue to support the nuclear waste bill; I will vote for it if it comes up again this year; and I will support cloture motions related to it--as long as they are not simply legislative maneuvers to kill other important initiatives.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Richard (Dick) Marbes, who is retiring from the full time position of Wisconsin State Adjutant of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV). As Mr. Marbes retires, it seems an appropriate time to acknowledge his distinguished career and extraordinary contributions and service to veterans and the DAV. 
During the 1950's, Dick served his country proudly in the Air Force. He is a long time active member of DAV chapter 3 in Green Bay and he has served as Wisconsin State Adjutant for over ten years. In 1993-1994, Dick was elected and served as the National Commander of the DAV where he spearheaded an effort to change some pre-existing policies, helping to reestablish the DAV as one on the strongest and most influential Veterans groups. Dick was recognized as the DAV's National Amputee of the year, and is also a member of the Wisconsin Board of Veterans affairs. 
Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in offering our congratulations to Dick Marbes and his wife Mary Jane and four children, Pam, Susan, Amy, and Tim. Dick has dedicated his time, talents and energy to serving Veterans and we are indeed indebted to him for his efforts. I am proud to salute Dick for a job well done, and I send him my best wishes for the future.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding career of Dr. D.H. McDonald, who is retiring after 45 years of dedicated service to the health of the people of Winneconne, Wisconsin. 
As a young boy growing up during the Great Depression, Dr. McDonald always dreamed of one day being able to take care of others. He took great pride in his father's hard work and accomplishments, and cherished the educational opportunities available to him. His desire to help people, hard work ethic and determination to do his best led Dr. McDonald to serve in the medical corps of the U.S. Army Air Force Command as a hospital administrator during World War II. 
During his time at Marquette University Medical School, Dr. McDonald took advantage of every opportunity he had, not only to learn about diverse areas of the medical field, but also to volunteer in the community. He worked at St. Mary Hill Psychiatric Hospital in Milwaukee and volunteered in the disadvantaged areas of Chicago where he made home deliveries of babies under the supervision of specialists. 
In 1952 Dr. McDonald established the McDonald Clinic. In an effort to accommodate the needs of the patients, Dr. McDonald used his clinic as a 24 hour, seven days a week walk-in clinic. 
Mr. President, Dr. McDonald has remained extremely close to the Winneconne community for over 45 years. Throughout the years, he has contributed to many of the events that have taken place within the community and will always be remembered for his commitment to the health and well-being of the people of Winneconne, Wisconsin. 
As he retires from the practice of medicine to the community which he has spent most of his life serving, we wish him the best of luck and thank him for his service.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. In my view, we need this measure to stop an epidemic of illegal copying of protected works--such as movies, books, musical recordings, and software. The copyright industry is one of our most thriving businesses. But we still lose more than $15 billion each year due to foreign copyright piracy, according to some estimates. 
This foreign piracy is out of control. For example, one of my staffers investigating video piracy on a trip to China walked into a Hong Kong arcade and bought three bootlegged computer games--including `Toy Story' and `NBA `97'--for just $10. These games normally sell for about $100. Indeed, the manager was so brazen about it, he even agreed to give a receipt. 
Illegal copying has been a longstanding concern to me. I introduced one of the precursors to this bill, the Motion Picture Anti-Piracy Act, which in principle has been incorporated into this measure. And I was one of the original cosponsors of the original proposed WIPO implementing legislation, the preliminary version of this measure. 
In my opinion, this bill achieves a fair balance by taking steps to effectively deter piracy, while still allowing fair use of protected materials. It is the product of intensive negotiations between all of the interested parties--including the copyright industry, telephone companies, libraries, universities and device manufacturers. And every major concern raised during that process was addressed. For these reasons, it earned the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee. 
I am confident that this bill has the best approach for stopping piracy and strengthening one of our biggest export industries. It deserves our support. Thank you.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I today introduce the Class Action Fairness Act of 1998. This legislation addresses a growing problem in class action litigation--too many class lawyers put their self-interest above the best interests of their clients, often resulting in unfair and abusive settlements that shortchange class members while the class lawyers line their pockets with high fees. 
Let me share with you just a few disturbing examples. 
One of my constituents, Martha Preston of Baraboo, Wisconsin, was an unnamed member of a class action lawsuit against her mortgage company that ended in a settlement. While at first she got four dollars and change in compensation, a few months later her lawyers surreptitiously took $80--twenty times her compensation--from her escrow account to pay their fees. In total, her lawyers managed to pocket over $8 million in fees, but never explained that the class--not the defendant--would pay the attorneys' fees. Naturally outraged, she and others sued the class lawyers. Her lawyers turned around and sued her in alabama--a state she had never visited--and demanded an unbelievable $25 million. So not only did she lose $75, she was forced to defend herself from a $25 million lawsuit. 
Class lawyers and defendants often engineer settlements that leave plaintiffs with small discounts or coupons unlikely ever to be used. Meanwhile class lawyers reap big fees based on unduly optimistic valuations. For example, in a settlement of a class action against major airlines, most plaintiffs received less than $80 in coupons while class attorneys received $14 million in fees based on a projection that the discounts were worth hundreds of millions. In a suit over faulty computer monitors, class members got $13 coupons, while class lawyers pocketed $6 million. And in a class action against Nintendo, plaintiffs received $5 coupons, while attorneys took almost $2 million in fees. 
Competing federal and state class actions engage in a race to settlement, where the best interests of the class lose out. For example, in one state class action the class lawyers negotiated a small settlement precluding all other suits, and even agreed to settle federal claims that were not at issue in state court. Meanwhile, a federal court found that the federal claims could be worth more than $1 billion, while accusing the state class lawyers of `hostile representation' that `surpassed inadequacy and sank to the level of subversion;' `vigorous disparagement' of the value of the federal claim in order to sell the settlement to the state court; and pursuit of self-interest in `getting a fee' that was `more in line with the interests of [defendants] than those of their clients.' 
Class actions are often filed in state courts that are more likely to certify them without adequately considering whether a class action would be fair to all class members. On several occasions, a state court has certified a class action although federal courts rejected certification of the same case. And in several Alabama state courts, 38 out of 43 classes certified in a three-year period were certified on an ex parte basis, without notice and hearing. One Alabama judge acting ex parte certified 11 class actions last year alone. Comparably, only an estimated 38 class actions were certified in federal court last year (excluding suits against the U.S. and suits brought under federal law). This lack of close scrutiny appears to create a big incentive to file in state court, especially given the recent findings of a Rand study that class actions are increasingly concentrated in state courts. 
Class lawyers often manipulate the pleadings in order to avoid removal of state class actions to federal court, even by minimizing the potential claims of class members. For example, state class actions often seek just over $74,000 in damages per plaintiff and forsake punitive damage claims, in order to avoid the $75,000 floor that qualifies for federal diversity jurisdiction. Or they defeat the federal requirement of complete diversity by making sure at least one named class member is from the same state as a defendant, even if every other class member is from a different state. 
Out-of-state defendants are often hauled into state court to address nationwide class claims, although federal courts are a more appropriate and more efficient forum. For example, an Alabama court is now considering a class action--and could establish a national policy--in a suit brought against the big three automakers on behalf of every American who bought a dual-equipped air bags in the past eight years. The defendants failed in their attempt to remove to federal court based on an application of current diversity law. And, unlike federal courts, states are unable of consolidate multiple class actions that involve the same underlying facts. 
These examples show that abuse of the class action system is not only possible, but real. And part of the problem are the incentives and realities created by the current system. 
A class action is a lawsuit in which an attorney not only represents an individual plaintiff, but, in addition, seeks relief for all those individuals who suffered a similar injury. For example, a suit brought against a pharmaceutical company by a person suffering from the side effects of a drug can be expanded to cover all individuals who used the drug. A class action claim may proceed only if a court certifies the class, and certification is permitted only if the class procedure will be fair to all class members. Prospective class members are usually sent notice about the class action, and are presumed to join it, unless they specifically ask to be left out. 
Often, these suits are settled. The settlement agreements provide money and/or other forms of compensation. The attorneys who brought the class action also get paid for their work. All class members are notified of the terms of the settlement, and given the chance to object if they don't think the settlement is fair. A court must ultimately approve a settlement agreement. 
The vast majority of these suits are brought and settled fairly and in good faith. Unfortunately, the class action system does not adequately protect class members from the few unscrupulous lawyers who are more interested in big attorneys' fees than compensation for their 
clients, the victims. The primary problem is that the client in a class action is a diffuse group of thousands of individuals scattered across the country, which is incapable of exercising meaningful control over the litigation. As a result, while in theory the class lawyers must be responsive to their clients, the lawyers control all aspects of the litigation. 
Moreover, during a class action settlement, the amount of the attorney fee is negotiated between plaintiffs' lawyers and the defendants, just like other terms of the settlement. But in most cases the fees come at the expense of class members--the only party that does not have a seat at the bargaining table. 
In addition, defendants may use class action settlements to advance their own interests. A settlement will generally preclude all future claims by class members. So defendants have ample motivation to give class lawyers the fees they want as the price for settling all future liabilities. 
In light of the incentives that are driving the parties, it is easy to see how class members are left out in the cold. Class attorneys and corporate defendants sometimes reach agreements that satisfy their respective interests--and even the interests of the named class plaintiffs--but that sell short the interests of any class members who are not vigilantly monitoring the litigation. And although the judge is supposed to determine whether the settlement is fair before approving it, class lawyers and defendants `may even put one over on the court, a staged performance. The lawyers support the settlement to get fees; the defendants support it to evade liability; the court can't vindicate the class's rights because the friendly presentation means that it lacks essential information.' Kamilewicz v. Bank of Boston Corp., 100 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting) (7th Cir. 1996). 
Although class members get settlement notices and have the opportunity to object, they rarely do so, especially if they have little at stake. Not only is it expensive to get representation, but also it can be extremely difficult to actually understand what the settlement really does. Settlements are often written in long, finely printed letters with incomprehensible legalese, which even well trained attorneys are hard pressed to understand. And settlements often omit basic information like how much money will go towards attorney's fees, and where that money will come from. In Martha Preston's case, one prominent federal judge found that `the notice not only didn't alert the absent class members to the pending loss but also pulled the wool over the state judge's eyes.' 
We all know that class actions can result in significant and important benefits for class members and society, and that most class lawyers and most state courts are acting responsibly. Class actions have been used to desegregate racially divided schools, to obtain redress for victims of employment discrimination, and to compensate individuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products. Class actions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable people to pursue claims that collectively would otherwise be too expensive to litigate. 
The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is weeding out the abuses without causing undue damage. The legislation we propose attempts to do this. It does not limit anyone's ability to file a class action or to settle a class action. It seeks to address the problem in several ways. First, it requires that State attorneys general be notified about proposed class action settlements that would affect residents of their states. With notice, the attorneys general can intervene in cases where they think the settlements are unfair. 
Second, the legislation requires that class members be notified of a potential settlement in clear, easily understood English--not legal jargon. 
Third, it limits class attorneys' fees to a reasonable percentage of the actual damages received by plaintiffs and the actual costs of complying with settlement agreements. This will deter class lawyers from using inflated values of coupon settlements to reap big fees, even if the settlement doesn't offer much practical value to victims. Some courts have already embraced this standard, which parallels the recent securities reform law. 
Fourth, it permits removal to federal court of class actions involving citizens of multiple states, at the request of unnamed class members or defendants. This provision eliminates gaming by class lawyers to keep cases in state court. It reinforces the legitimate role for diversity jurisdiction--to establish the federal courts as the proper forum for lawsuits directly affecting residents from diverse states. Diversity jurisdiction makes little sense if a $76,000 claim by one out-of-state plaintiff qualifies for federal jurisdiction but a multimillion dollar class action bundling thousands of $74,000 claims by out-of-state citizens cannot be brought in federal court, and if remote state courts can make decisions affecting nationwide classes of citizens. 
Finally, it amends Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures to require the imposition of sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits, although the nature and extent of sanctions remains discretionary. This provision will deter the filing of frivolous class actions. 
Let me emphasize the limited scope of this legislation. We do not close the courthouse door to any class action. We do not require that State attorneys general do anything with the notice they receive. We do not deny reasonable fees for class lawyers. And we do not mandate that every class action be brought in federal court. Instead, we simply promote closer and fairer scrutiny of class actions and class settlements. 
We are aware that some are critical of provisions in this bill. For example, there is concern that attorneys' fee provision does not adequately address settlements which offer primarily injunctive relief. For this reason, this bill should be viewed as a point of departure, not a final product. 
But Mr. President, right now, people across the country can be dragged into lawsuits unaware of their rights and unarmed on the legal battlefield. What our bill does is give regular people back their rights and representation. This measure may not stop all abuses, but it moves us forward. It will help ensure that good people like Martha Preston don't get ripped off. 
Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I believe this is a moderate approach to correct the worst abuses, while preserving the benefits of class actions. It is both pro-consumer and pro-defendant. We believe it will make a difference.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Agriculture Research conference report. A great deal of thanks and appreciation is due to Senators Lugar and Harkin for their hard work and efforts to reform and prioritize USDA's agriculture research, extension and education activities. 
This conference report is extremely important to the agricultural community. It invests $1.7 billion in agricultural research to develop the new technology that will be used by farms in the next five to ten years, to solve the projected shortfall in crop insurance funding, and to support the Fund for Rural America. 
The nation's Land-Grant Universities work with the USDA on issues ranging from the international competitiveness of our family farms, to new food borne illness problems, to ground water contamination. We need to support their efforts with a robust research budget in line with other agencies' research budgets. This bill puts us on the track to do that, and I support it. 
I am also pleased to speak in strong support of the provisions of this bill restoring food stamps to legal immigrants. 
Mr. President, I supported the 1996 welfare reform law. The time had clearly come for radical change. We rightly concluded that nothing erodes the human spirit more readily than dependence on handouts, and we instituted reforms based upon the principles of personal responsibility and hard work. 
But in some cases, a helping hand is truly necessary, and sometimes so much help is needed that only the Federal government is capable of providing it. This is clearly the case with respect to certain classes of legal immigrants. The welfare law provisions restricting legal immigrant access to food stamps went too far. 
Legal immigrants pay taxes and serve in our armed forces. They are not granted all the privileges of U.S. citizenship, but are expected to fulfill most of the responsibilities of citizenship. The ban on food stamps for elderly, disabled and other needy legal immigrants from food stamps was harsh and unfair. 
While myself and others argued that point during debate on the welfare bill in 1996, the majority of us have learned it since then. In any case, we should all feel confident that we are doing the right thing today by voting for this bill. 
Mr. President, my support for the food stamps restoration is particularly heart-felt due to my concern for the Hmong and other legal immigrants from Laos and their families. As my colleagues may know, the Hmong fought along side our American men and women in the Vietnam War. They risked their lives on behalf of all that we hold dear in this country--freedom from oppression, democracy and the pursuit of happiness--and fled to the United States following the War out of fear of persecution. To them, we truly owe a debt of gratitude. 
There are 250,000 Hmong and Lao people living in the United States, approximately 40,000 of whom live in Wisconsin. Of those 40,000, roughly 7000 lost eligibility for food stamps under the welfare law. And 75 percent of those individuals who have lost food stamps in Wisconsin live in households with children. 
The Hmong and highland people have enriched our country and enriched Wisconsin. They have worked hard to support their families and give back to their communities. Simply put, we are thankful for all they did and thankful for the contributions they continue to make. 
Last year, we took steps to restore SSI benefits to the Hmong and other worthy immigrants, and today we are right to take this step with respect to food stamps. 
I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.

Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Senator Byrd. 
Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the IRS Reform bill. There is no doubt that this bill will count among the most important pieces of legislation that we will pass in the 105th Congress. A great deal of thanks and appreciation is due to Senators Roth and Moynihan for their work sheperding this bill through the Finance Committee, and most especially to my friend from Nebraska, Senator Bob Kerrey, whose efforts on the Restructuring Commission and tireless advocacy brought us here today. 
We have all been struck by the stories of abuse of taxpayers by overzealous or self-serving IRS employees. And all of us have received calls of concern and outrage from constituents who feel they have been treated unfairly by an agency that wields a tremendous amount of power in the daily lives of Americans. 
We have also learned of retaliation against honest IRS employees who worked hard and wanted to do the right thing by speaking out against abuses. This legislation will go a long way towards addressing these problems. 
It will also go a long way toward making the agency more effective in its policy mission and more responsive to budget constraints. We have all witnessed the $4 billion debacle of the IRS computer modernization effort and want to ensure resources are allocated responsibly in the future. 
As ranking member of the Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to meet the Commissioner of the IRS, Mr. Rossotti, and am encouraged by his strong background in management and information technology. The legislation before us will provide the Commissioner with tools to put together a high-quality team to run the agency, and award those who do their jobs well. 
This bill also includes new sources of outside oversight of the agency, such as the Oversight Board and the new Treasury IG's Office for Tax Administration. Coming from the business world, I know the importance of accountability and constant self-examination. Management and employees should always be looking for ways to do their jobs more effectively and be open to constructive criticism. 
But for too long, the IRS has operated as if it were a class by itself, somehow above the standards of efficiency and customer service that any American business must follow to survive. 
We have witnessed the effects of this problem in my home state of Wisconsin. For the past two and a half years, we have worked to address allegations of misconduct and discrimination at the Milwaukee-Waukesha IRS Offices. These allegations were discussed at length at the Committee hearings last week, and were so serious that some IRS employees felt the need to sneak into my office in Milwaukee to report on abuses. 
Employees feared retaliation and alleged again and again that management was allowing, if not promoting, a hostile work environment. Such a deplorable situation of fear and intimidation is unacceptable, must be stopped, and must be prevented from happening in the future. 
This bill sets up a confidential means through which honest employees can report allegations of abuses. In addition, I am offering an amendment with my colleague, Senator Feingold, to ensure that oversight of the Milwaukee office is a top priority of the new IG. This legislation will prevent abuses in the future, but we must also be vigilant in dealing with serious problems that have yet to be resolved in the present. 
Mr. President, while taking time to mention only a few of the many important provisions of this bill, I want to urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
We have a historic opportunity to right future wrongs and be party to the creation of a more consumer-friendly, efficient and responsible IRS. Let us seize that opportunity with enthusiasm and without further delay.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. In my view, we need this measure to stop an epidemic of illegal copying of protected works--such as movies, books, musical recordings, and software. The copyright industry is one of our most thriving businesses. But we still lose more than $15 billion each year due to foreign copyright piracy, according to some estimates. 
This foreign piracy is out of control. For example, one of my staffers investigating video piracy on a trip to China walked into a Hong Kong arcade and bought three bootlegged computer games--including `Toy Story' and `NBA '97'--for just $10. These games normally sell for about $100. Indeed, the manager was so brazen about it, he even agreed to give a receipt. 
Illegal copying has been a longstanding concern to me. I introduced one of the precursors to this bill, the Motion Picture Anti-Piracy Act, which in principle has been incorporated into this measure. And I was one of the original cosponsors of the original proposed WIPO implementing legislation, the preliminary version of this measure. 
In my opinion, this bill achieves a fair balance by taking steps to effectively deter piracy, while still allowing fair use of protected materials. It is the product of intensive negotiations between all of the interested parties--including the copyright industry, telephone companies, libraries, universities and device manufacturers. And every major concern raised during that process was addressed. For these reasons, it earned the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee. Of course, as with any legislation, some tinkering may still be needed. 
I am confident that this bill has the best approach for stopping piracy and strengthening one of our biggest export industries. It deserves our support.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the bipartisan chorus in support of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. I commend the sponsors for their excellent work. Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Kennedy, and Wellstone have done an outstanding job of crafting legislation that is long overdue. For too long American workers have had to struggle through a complex system of dozens of different job training and educational programs to get the skills they needed to enter, or reenter the job market. Today, the Senate takes concrete steps to streamline the current system so that getting the help they need will be easier for the workers of America. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act simplifies the search for a job by encouraging communities to establish a `one stop shopping' location. Localities will have one location where an individual can go to get help finding a job or search out skill training opportunities. At this location all of the options will be laid out, and the choice will be up to the worker. 
Inherent in this idea is that there will be no wrong door. No longer will a person be told, `We can't help you here because you don't qualify for these programs. Maybe they can help you down the hall.' That sort of bureaucratic run around results in inefficiency and frustrates the very people we are trying to help. 
This job training reform bill focuses on shifting power back to the states and local communities. Government, business, labor, and community groups will collaborate on strategies that fit the economic situation of the individual state and locality. The Senate version of this bill also takes the important step of allowing states to keep reforms they have made that are working. Wisconsin has made many changes to its job training system on its own initiative that have been ground- breaking and very successful. I am pleased the Committee recognizes that there is no need to replace programs that are already doing the job and meeting the goals set forth in this legislation. 
I am also pleased we maintain our commitment to helping at risk youth. This bill ensures that providing opportunities for kids on the edge will continue, and that the funds will move quickly to those who need it most. I hope that the Conference Committee can quickly complete its work so that the $250 million set aside in last year's budget for Out-of-School Youth will become available before the July 1 deadline. These kids need our help to become productive citizens and contribute to society. If Congress fails to complete action before July 1, these young people will be forced to wait even longer for our support. 
In today's global economy, our people are our greatest resource. With the rise in information and technology, the nations that are the most creative, most innovative, and most inventive will have the edge. The United States currently has the lead in these sectors and this bill will help our people maintain their advantage through continuing their education and updating their skills. Our nation's continued prosperity, and the prosperity of our workers, hinges on a well-trained workforce. This bill helps ensure that our current economic growth will continue into the future and be shared by all Americans.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today is Israel's Independence Day marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the modern state of Israel. The last fifty years have fascinated and captivated many of us as we have watched and supported this country in its struggle for survival. Out of the ashes of the Holocaust, Jews from around the world converged on this small but holy land to build a modern state in a place where Jews had maintained a presence for thousands of years. From the first days of statehood in 1948 when its neighbors declared war and attempted to obliterate it from the map, Israel has defied the odds and endured in the most dangerous of neighborhoods. Each decade since 1948 Israel has survived a major war with its neighbors: Suez in 1956, the Six Day War in 1967, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the war in Lebanon in 1982 and then the deadly Iraqi Scud missiles launched against its people in 1991. Yet in the midst of all these wars, tens of murderous terrorist attacks, and a crippling Arab economic boycott, Israel has built a vibrant democracy and a robust economy. 
The United States has not been a bystander in this remarkable transformation. We have provided needed assistance, in recognition of our shared democratic values, and we have benefited from a close strategic alliance. There is a special and enduring relationship between the United states and Israel dating back to the days when the United States was the first nation to recognize Israel when it declared its independence. As Israel marks its jubilee year, we celebrate that relationship. 
Mr. President, I want to salute the people of Israel for all they have achieved in the last fifty years. I join with the Jewish community around the world, which has provided support and received moral and spiritual sustenance from Israel, in wishing them well. May they go from strength to strength.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, for quite some time I have been studying the issue of whether we should expand NATO. There are some who have argued that there has not been sufficient debate about NATO expansion. Yet, we have been considering NATO expansion for several years now, long before this resolution of ratification made it to the Senate floor. By wide margins, the Senate indicated its support for the concept of NATO expansion in 1994 and 1995, and since then, there has been much discussion in the Senate and in the media on the pros and cons of expanding NATO. As the Administration has worked with our allies on the details of NATO expansion, building on the Partnership for Peace which lay the ground work for this move back in 1994, and culminating with the signing of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty on the accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in December 1997, we have reached the point where there is little doubt that the Senate will ratify the resolution before us today. It is interesting to note, that as a bipartisan consensus for NATO expansion has emerged, opponents of NATO expansion have sharpened their arguments. I want to credit these opponents for giving us all much food for thought and for ultimately helping me focus my thinking on this important issue. 
After careful consideration, I have concluded that expanding NATO is in our national interest and I intend to support the resolution of ratification before us today for a number of reasons. 
NATO will help to fill a security vacuum in newly democratic Central Europe. It has only been a few short years since Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have embraced democratic institutions and embarked on the path to political and economic reform. We need to send the strongest possible signal to the fledgling democracies of Central and Eastern Europe that they must not falter in this endeavor. It is in our national interest for these nations to succeed, and support from the West allows them to proceed with difficult political and economic reforms. Just as it made sense in the breathless months after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact to invite these countries to join NATO, we cannot back away from them now. Following through on our invitation offers them a sense of security after years of domination by the Soviet Union. And, it is fitting that a military alliance originally conceived to counter the Soviet threat would offer them a safe haven from the threats of the future. Although it may seem that they have little to worry about now, we cannot predict what threats may emerge. After all, few among us could have predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. 
We should support NATO expansion because it will help ensure that Russia does not pose a threat to those countries in the future. Russia may not pose a threat now, but the fears of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic that Russia will change its stripes or that some other hegemonic power will threaten them are all too real. We must respond to these fears. It's easy for critics of NATO expansion on this side of the Atlantic to say that these fears are not justified but we must not forget that the reason the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are clamoring for NATO membership in the first place is because of their long history of invasion and subjugation. Who among us could look the Poles, and the Czechs, and the Hungarians in the eyes and say that even without NATO they need not fear an invasion in the future. True, no one can make the case that the Russian military in its current state is in any position to reconstitute the Soviet Union or the Warsaw Pact. Recent articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times lay out in stark terms the weakened state of the military, and the difficulties Russia is facing in developing strong economic and political alliances with its neighbors. Although some have argued that these are reasons to oppose NATO expansion, for me this underscores the challenges Russia faces today in realizing full political and economic reform, challenges that have little to do with NATO expansion. If Russia does not succeed--and we must do all we can to ensure that it does--I shudder to think of the consequences. NATO expansion will shield Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic from these consequences. 
I do not intend to respond to all of the arguments made by opponents of NATO expansion, but I want to say a few more words about Russia. I do not believe that NATO expansion will undermine Russian efforts to achieve democratic reform: If Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic want greater integration with Western Europe this should not pose a threat to Russia. However, just as we are responding to the fears of the Central Europeans by inviting them to join NATO, we must recognize Russian fears. We must continue to remind the Russians that NATO is not antagonistic to their interests. And, we must redouble our efforts to help the Russians so that they too can succeed in their economic and political reforms. As the resolution of ratification states:  
The Senate finds that is in the interest of the United States for NATO to develop a new and constructive relationship with the Russian Federation as the Russian Federation pursues democratization, market reforms, and peaceful relations with its neighbors. 
I hope that at some future date the Senate will consider specific measures to further this goal. 
As tensions between the United States and Russia have subsided, the end of the Cold War has brought many long dormant ethnic rivalries to the surface. NATO expansion is a reasonable response to these developments: A broad based military alliance can help keep ethnic tensions from escalating into violence. As we have seen all too vividly with the 
dissolution of Yugoslavia, ethnic tensions in Europe are still deep rooted. The world was taken by surprise at the atrocities that were unleashed in Bosnia and it took several years for the West to bring enough pressure on the parties to end the violence. We want to do what we can to prevent the dissolution of state militaries into murderous ethnic militias as took place in Bosnia. There are no guarantees, but by bringing the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe into a broad based military alliance we are encouraging military cooperation and understanding and fostering relationships that will make it easier to resolve major conflicts. Although NATO's primary purpose is not as a dispute resolution body, it is my hope that NATO can help prevent many of these disputes from emerging in the first place. 
NATO's strength is that it is not only a military alliance, but an alliance of nations sharing democratic values. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made great strides over the last seven years demonstrating that their commitment to democratic institutions and political reform runs deep. Some have argued that political stability rests on economic stability and that we should press the European Union to admit the countries of Central and Eastern Europe before we engage them in a military alliance. However, free market economies are not the only key to stable democracies. The role of the military can make a difference in the long-term success of democracies. A military alliance that defers to civilian leaders can serve as an example of stable civil-military relations. I am confident that inclusion in NATO will strengthen democratic values in the new democracies of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
The NATO alliance has been a successful alliance. It is in our national interest to build on that success. For fifty years, NATO has united Europe and America in a common purpose, and with its strong emphasis on cooperation and a collective defense, NATO will serve as a building block for the security arrangements of the future. We have established some very important relationships in NATO. These relationships are a source of strength and they should not be abandoned. And, the strong ties we have with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic can be formalized by admitting them to NATO. 
Earlier in the debate we reaffirmed the strategic purpose of NATO. I believe that as the threats of the future come into sharper focus, the strategic rationale for NATO will evolve. This will not happen overnight. And that is why I supported the Warner amendment. Before we remake an alliance that has served American interests and proceed with further expansion we need to spend more time thinking about the role NATO will play in our changing security arrangements. The Warner amendment also would have allowed us to step back from the process without specifically rejecting any of the nations of Central or Eastern Europe. Regardless of how long we wait before the next group of nations is admitted to NATO, we must closely monitor the integration of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO. 
Finally, I would like to say a few words about the cost of NATO expansion, an issue of particular concern to me. Although there have been numerous estimates, the most recent Administration estimate is that we will spend $400 million over the coming decade to cover the US share of NATO expansion costs. This is not a small sum. Consider, however, that we have already spent more than $6 billion on US operations in Bosnia in the last two and a half years. If NATO can help prevent the Bosnias of the future, even if NATO expansion costs are double the Administration's current estimate, this will be money well spent. 
I am disappointed that there is no consensus in the Senate to limit our spending in this area beyond the existing limit on the US contribution to the NATO common budget. I supported the Harkin amendment that would have placed a 25 percent cap on expenses that might be incurred to help NATO's newest members integrate their forces with NATO, and I will continue to watch spending in this area. As the Resolution of Ratification states: `the United States is under no commitment to subsidize the national expenses necessary for Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic to meet its NATO commitments.' 
Our future is and always has been inextricably tied to Europe, a region that has been beset by war. After two devastating World Wars dominated the first half of this century, we have relied on the NATO alliance to help keep the peace during the second half. I believe that NATO expansion can also help us maintain peace and stability in Europe into the next century and for that reason the resolution of ratification to admit Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic merits our support.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to comment on one aspect of the conference report before us today, the provisions relating to the consolidation of USIA into the State Department. Although the President has already signaled his intention to veto this bill should it pass, I would like to highlight a concern I share with others which was addressed to some degree in the conference report: the need to protect the integrity of U.S. public diplomacy. 
There have been some indications that when the State Department incorporates the functions of USIA into its organization, there are some State Department officials who are interested in using the resources associated with USIA programs to boost the public affairs functions of the State Department. I would like to go on record in opposition to any shifting of resources or even worse merging of these two very distinct functions of public affairs and public diplomacy. 
To give some background on this issue, since 1948 when U.S. government information programs were first authorized under section 501 of the Smith/Mundt Act, it has been understood that public diplomacy programs were directed to foreign audiences. As Under Secretary of State Philip Habib said in 1986: 
There is a distinction between public diplomacy and public affairs. The word diplomacy means `outside' and has nothing to do with what you are trying to do with the American people, which is altogether different. Gaining the support of the American people for U.S. foreign policy initiatives is entirely different from attempting to pursue the interests of the United States in the foreign arena. 
Over the years, Congress and the courts have upheld and strengthened the distinction between public diplomacy, which is directed abroad, and public affairs, which is directed toward a U.S. audience. As USIA and its functions are folded into the State Department--and I do not necessarily oppose this and other cost savings moves--we must continue to uphold the distinction between these two functions. I support the need to provide a clear articulation of U.S. foreign policy to Americans, especially as the world and U.S. international interests have become increasingly complex. However, the State Department should not anticipate a windfall in resources for its public affairs function. 
Public diplomacy, the presentation and advocacy of information about the United States, not just the advocacy of a particular foreign policy position, has been best presented independently and objectively without consideration of how that message would play at home. Educating the rest of the world about American society should not be hindered by the equally important but distinct function of explaining U.S. foreign policy to the American people. 
Edward R. Murrow said it best almost 40 years ago: 
What we endeavor to reflect . . . is not only our policy, but our ideals. We not only seek to show people who we are and how we live: we must also engage others in the delicate, difficult art of human persuasion, to explain why we do what we do. 
Mr. President, as we consider legislation to consolidate USIA into the State Department, whether it be in this session or in future sessions of Congress, I urge my colleagues to keep this important distinction in mind.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the City of Sheboygan, Wisconsin for being selected by the National Sporting Goods Association to launch the Wannabe Cool, Gottabe Active Campaign. The campaign, which targets students in grades 3-8, is designed to inspire confidence in one's abilities and to spur a lifetime dedication to physical and mental wellness. We must recognize the importance of programs like this which give children options that empower them to lead healthy lives. 
Mr. President, this is especially important when we consider that we are witnessing a decrease in activity among our nation's youth. Today, only 22 percent of our children are physically active for the recommended 30 minutes each day. Physical education classes are on the decline with three out of four students in America not attending daily physical education classes and one out of four not attending any physical education classes in their schools--this represents a drop of almost 20 percent in just four years. These are frightening statistics and we need to reverse this trend. 
The Wannabe Cool, Gottabe Active Campaign is a good start. There are several things I like about the program. First, the campaign targets the right age group, because we know that a commitment to physical activity is formed between the ages of eight and twelve. I am also impressed that the campaign involves a cooperative effort: parents, students, teachers, and community leaders all working together. Finally, the Wanna be Cool, Gotta be Active Campaign is designed to encourage all youth, not just those who are athletically inclined to participate and develop long-term enjoyment of physical activity. This is a serious issue which demands our attention. 
Mr. President, I would like to once again extend my congratulations to the wonderful city of Sheboygan, Wisconsin for being selected to kick off the campaign. I'm sure that everyone involved will benefit from this very worthwhile venture.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, my amendment to the Budget Resolution I hope will be only the first step this Congress will take to prevent abuse and mistreatment of elderly and disabled patients in long-term care. 
Mr. President, it is estimated that more than 43% of Americans over the age of 65 will likely spend time in a nursing home. The number of people needing long-term care service, both in nursing homes and home health care, is sharply increasing, and it will continue to do so as the Baby Boom generation ages. The vast majority of long-term care facilities do an excellent job in caring for their patients, but it only takes a few abusive staff to cast a dark shadow over what should be a healing environment.

Mr. KOHL. This article is only the tip of the iceberg. A recent report from the Nation's long-term care Ombudsmen indicates that in 29 states surveyed, 7,043 cases of abuse, gross neglect, or exploitation occurred in nursing homes and board and care facilities. Similar stories have appeared nationwide and abuse is not limited to nursing homes. It is far too easy for a health care worker with a criminal or abusive background to gain employment and prey on the most vulnerable patients. 
Why is this the case? Because current state and national safeguards are inadequate to screen out abusive workers. All States are required to maintain nurse aide registries which include information about abusive workers. But these registries are not comprehensive or complete. First, many facilities do not report abuse complaints and instead, simply fire the worker. Second, these registries usually do not include abuse information about home health or hospice aides. Finally, and most important, there is no national system in place to track abusers, little information sharing between States, and no Federal requirement that a criminal background check be done on potential employees. A known abuser or someone with a violent criminal background in Iowa would have little trouble moving to Wisconsin and continuing to work with patients there. 
I have introduced and continue to work on legislation that would create a national registry of abusive long-term care workers and require criminal background checks for prospective employees who participate in Medicare and Medicaid. Although this will not prevent all cases of abuse, I believe it will go a long way toward making sure that those who have a history of preying on the vulnerable are not paid to do so by Medicare and Medicaid. 
This Budget Resolution includes a lot of different priorities and funding recommendations--some of which I agree with, and others that I believe deserve more attention. But as we consider this Budget Resolution, we must not forget to protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens--the elderly and the disabled. 
This amendment expresses our desire to establish a viable, efficient, and cost-effective national system that will screen out abusive workers and prevent them from working with patients. We should adopt this amendment to devote resources toward developing such a system. We should adopt this amendment to send a clear signal to potential abusers that we will not tolerate the mistreatment of our patients. And we should adopt this amendment to demonstrate our commitment to protecting the elderly and the disabled from known abusers and criminals. When a patient checks into a nursing home facility or receives home health services, they should not have to give up their right to be free of abuse, neglect, or mistreatment.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, earlier today I supported an amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller. Senator Rockefeller's amendment to the Budget Resolution would have restored $10.5 billion to the Veterans' Affairs Subommittee, offsetting that restoration by reducing funds allocated to the Transportation Subcommittee. 
As we all know, the Senate ISTEA bill, now awaiting conference deliberations with the House, authorized approximately $217 billion for transportation over 6 years--about $171 billion for highways, about $41 billion for transit and about $2 billion for safety. These levels represent a 38 percent increase for transportation over the previous ISTEA bill. Under the Budget Resolution considered today, a significant portion of this increase is financed by a $10.5 billion reduction in funds set aside to pay for smoking related illnesses among veterans. 
Mr. President, I believe we need to do more for infrastructure development--our investment in roads, bridges and transit must increase if we hope to maintain our quality of life while keeping up with the demands of the economy and the changing nature of our cities and towns. That said, veterans should not have to pay for that investment. It's not right, and perhaps more importantly, it's not necessary. 
The ISTEA bill vastly increased transportation funds and took some big steps to improve the longstanding equity problem between those states that contribute more in gas tax revenues than they receive and those states that receive more than they contribute. However, while improving the donor state problem to some extent, the bill also provided generous increases in funding to many donee states. I would argue that we were too generous to those states. It was unacceptable to me that despite a 38 percent increase in the amount of funds made available for transportation, the ISTEA bill continued to have donor states give significantly more than they get back, and donee states get significantly more than they give. We could've done better. And if we had provided less of an increase to donee states, we could have avoided the need for controversial offsets, such as the reduction in veterans benefits that Senator Rockefeller sought to restore. We all know that sometimes fairness is painful to swallow, and it seemed to me that in the highway bill, we simply gave everyone more in order not to inflict pain on some. Today we voted on whether veterans should feel that pain. But why should we limit programs for our veterans in order to be even more generous to those who are already in an advantageous position under transportation formulas? Simply put, we should not. A more responsible course of action would have been to distribute highway dollars more fairly, limiting the increase overall by limiting the increase to states that were already getting more than their fair share.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Budget Resolution. And while I will not vote for the final product, I want to compliment both sides of the aisle this year's unique debate over our budget blueprint. 
For the first time since I arrived in the Senate, the issue of balancing the budget was not an issue. The President started the debate this year by proposing a budget that balances this fiscal year--a full two years before the proposed Constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment would have demanded it. The Republican members of the Budget Committee countered with the balanced budget before us today, and Democrats offered up their substitute, also in balance. 
This year, partisan attempts to play `pin the blame for the deficit' were replaced by a serious discussion of the government's priorities. Hot air gave way to an honest airing of our policy differences. We debated the questions that must be answered in the budget that will guide our legislative actions for the rest of the year--questions about how government should spend its time and energy in the coming fiscal year. 
And it is because of the budget answers those questions that I must oppose this budget. Though the numbers add up, the policies do not. 
In short, on too many issues of importance to the families of America, this budget is more than silent--it stifles discussion. 
For example, the budget forbids consideration of a comprehensive child care program for the United States--a plan like that proposed by the President, by Senator Dodd, or by Senator Chafee. Senator Dodd offered an amendment to fix this, and it was defeated. 
How can we support a budget that does not at least allow Congress to consider the child care needs of our youngest children and our hardest working families? 
At a time when 60 percent of our preschool age children are regularly cared for by someone other than their parents, can we accept a budget that will not allow us to debate any proposals to increase the accessibility of decent child care? 
At a time when we are learning more each day about the importance of brain development in the earliest years of life, can we accept a budget that will not allow us to discuss creating more quality early education opportunities? 
At a time when the business world is waking up to the link between good child care and employee productivity, can we accept a budget that will not let Congress also explore how to help working parents work well? 
This budget also precludes consideration of any of the various proposals to implement the tobacco settlement. Under the budget, the Hatch plan, the emerging McCain bill, the Chafee-Harkin bipartisan plan, the Conrad bill, or even the initial tobacco settlement between the State Attorneys General and the tobacco companies would be out of order on the Senate floor. 
This budget silences Congress on two of the most pressing issues that face our nation today: How can we give our youngest children the best start to their educations and their lives? And how can we free our children from the deadly pressure to start smoking? 
Despite these serious objections, I would like to thank the managers of the bill, and the whole Senate, for unanimously accepting my amendment to the Resolution expressing the Senate's intention to protect our nation's elderly and disabled patients from abuse, neglect and mistreatment in long-term care facilities. 
And I would like to compliment the drafters of this budget for one section. The $30 billion tax cut envisioned in this budget does include $9 billion for child care tax credits. 
As many of you know, I have worked hard to establish a tax credit to provide an incentive to private sector businesses willing to take actions that increase the supply of quality child care. 
My credit will give incentives to large companies--like Wisconsin's Johnson Wax or Quad Graphics--that set up state of the art child care centers on-site. And it will provide an incentive for smaller companies--like the 80 companies in the New Berlin, Wisconsin Industrial Park that joined together to build a child care center open to the children of all of their employees. 
In addition, my credit is not just for the costs of construction--but also for the other substantial costs of providing suitable quality child care: the costs of accrediting a center, of setting up a merit-based pay system for the woefully underpaid child care workers, for reserving slots in an existing child care facility, or for hiring a resource and referral firm to design the best child care option for a given company. 
This proposal has the support of the President, child care advocates, the business community, and the 72 Senators who voted for it as part of last year's tax package. I am glad to see that the budget before us also would support it. 
However, as much as I would like to see us move forward on my child care tax credit this year, it is only one part of the solution to the shortage of quality, educational child care in this country. 
For years, the Federal budget stole from the future to fund programs and pork in the present. The enormous deficits of those years were a national shame. 
Today, the budget is in balance and moving toward surplus. We have reason to be relieved, but not reason yet to be proud. We have stopped stealing from our grandchildren, true. But this budget does not let us even consider in a comprehensive way their earliest, and most important, educational needs. 
We have an obligation to at least discuss how best to nurture our youngest children--and I cannot support a budget that will not allow that. 
I urge my colleagues to vote down this budget.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, my vote in opposition to the motion to proceed to H.R. 2646 was unrelated to the merits of this education IRA proposal. I voted with Senator Durbin on this procedural issue to protest the lack of floor action on two noncontroversial judicial nominees from Illinois. 
While the Senate should consider how to make quality education more affordable, it also should not neglect its duty to fill judicial vacancies. The Senate's failure to act on these nominees is particularly egregious--one of these positions has been vacant for five years, and the other has been vacant for almost three and a half years. There are currently 82 judicial vacancies, and continued inaction and delay in the Senate is likely to compromise the quality of justice available to crime victims and other injured persons throughout the U.S.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Senate reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), the so-called `ISTEA II' bill that we've been debating for the past couple of weeks and that was approved yesterday. I thank the managers of the bill and their staff for the hard work and long hours they put in, as well as their attempts to face the very difficult task of balancing the transportation needs of the fifty states. 
First, let me say that we all agree that maintaining, developing and improving our roads, bridges and transit systems is vital to our economy and our way of life. Transportation development has and will play a crucial role in the growth of this country. And the Senate reaffirmed that importance by approving significantly increased funding levels. That part of the equation, I strongly support. From the beginning, I believed we needed to do more and the Senate bill does do more, including an increase of approximately $130 million for Wisconsin highways and significant increases for transit systems as well. 
That said, the other part of the equation, and the reason for which I ultimately opposed the legislation, is the issue of percentage share of total program dollars. My state of Wisconsin is one of the 20 or so donor states whose taxpayers pay more in gas tax revenues than they receive in Federal transportation funds. And one of the top issues that Wisconsinites from all across the state and from all walks of life stressed to me was the need to improve Wisconsin's share. That was certainly not the only issue, nonetheless, it is a very basic issue of fairness that we have faced every time we have sat down to write a highway bill. 
And this year, perhaps more than any other, we had an historic chance to correct the donor state problem since the bill includes significant new resources. However, while this bill improves many states' shares, it actually decreases Wisconsin's share. Under the original ISTEA, my state realized an average return of 92 percent on our gas tax contributions over the life of bill. Under the Senate bill, Wisconsin would only be guaranteed a 91 percent return. Because this bill is more generous overall, Wisconsin's overall funding will go up, but on the share side, we are worse off under this bill than when we started. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that additional transportation resources will be available to my state. I am also pleased that this bill maintains the principle of a strong Federal partnership, balances resources between the many different modes of transportation and continues important environmental programs. However, in the end, I felt that a vote in favor of this bill was a vote to continue an unfair system for another six years. The taxpayers of Wisconsin deserve better.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, to some people, Wisconsin means cheese. To that I say, yes, and we're proud of it. The great state of Wisconsin has a dairy industry that has thrived for 150 years despite our country's discriminatory milk pricing policies. 
To some people, Wisconsin means beer. To that I say, yes, and we're proud of it. Brewing was among the first industries to help propel Wisconsin's economy forward, creating thousands of jobs and incomes that supported many families. They were not amused with Prohibition. 
But Wisconsin means much more. As we celebrate 150 years of Wisconsin statehood this year we are reminded of the state's rich history, its natural beauty and its determined people. 
In 1848, as a wave of immigrants flooded into America, many of the brightest among them chose to settle in Wisconsin. The state still displays the influence of its earliest settlers, from Poland, Russia, Ireland, Germany and Scandinavia. Wisconsin continues to draw newcomers because of its strong economy, its first-rate education system and the appealing mix of villages and cities that exist side by side. And we have the Green Bay Packers. 
Wisconsin's natural beauty is unsurpassed. We are fortunate to have as our borders two Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Wisconsin is called a `sporting paradise' because of its lakes, rivers and forests. We boast fishing, hunting, skiing and world-class golf. Our national forests are breathtaking. People in Wisconsin know the value of our environment and have worked hard to protect it. Wisconsin's spas and resorts and restaurants have earned the attention of glossy travel magazines, who have discovered the charm of vacationing in Wisconsin. We don't mind visitors because we realize that not everyone is lucky enough to be born here. 
Wisconsin residents can relax in a small, picturesque lakeside town or explore a vibrant and sophisticated city without traveling far from home. Over the years we have built a thriving arts community that includes the theater, symphony and ballet. For those of us who have an interest in sports, we have exciting teams to follow. For over 150 years, our state has been home, home to Olympic athletes, respected scholars, famous celebrities and great artists. Frank Lloyd Wright left us the gift of Taliesen. Wisconsin has an independent streak that runs through our economy and our politics, and a work ethic that is the envy of employers nationwide. Wisconsin has some of the best minds in the country working in some of the best research facilities on behalf of all Americans. And we make Harley Davidson motorcycles. 
But the best thing about Wisconsin in 1998 is the same as in 1848: the people. Their dedication to family, friends, neighbors and community is not a quaint notion from the past, but alive today. Wisconsin is a place where families gather for Sunday dinner. Where lost wallets are returned with all the cash. Where a neighbor offers a ride to work when the car is in the shop. Where friends come to the doorstep with a casserole to welcome a new baby or to console the loss of a grandparent. That's what we celebrate most about Wisconsin and that's why I have tremendous respect for the people I represent. 
Much of what we value about Wisconsin has, in the best sense, remained unchanged from its start, 150 years ago. I am fortunate to have lived in Wisconsin all of my life and grateful for the opportunities my family had. Wisconsin is a great place to be a kid, to raise a family and to grow old. It is a reminder of all this country had to offer 150 years ago, and an example of the best it can put forward in the next century.

Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Mr. President. Along with my colleagues, Senators Hatch and Leahy, I rise in support of the Copyright Compulsory License Improvement Act of 1997. This proposal, although clearly not a final product, is an important step forward in creating true competition between satellite and cable television. And that is an important step forward for consumers. 
Mr. President, this bill generally takes the right approach. It gives satellite carriers the ability to provide the one thing that consumers want most: local television broadcast signals. In return, the satellite carriers must comply with FCC regulations governing syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout protection, and network nonduplication. The measure also creates a retransmission consent process, and establishes certain `must carry' obligations on satellite carriers that rebroadcast local signals. As a general premise, it seems only fair that the benefits of carrying local signals should be balanced with reasonable regulatory burdens that are consistent with cable's obligations. But we should also look at reducing at least some of the `must carry' burdens--for example, why should any provider be required to carry the Home Shopping Network, which is predominantly commercial? 
So what does all this mean for businesses and consumers? Hopefully, it will create more availability and affordability in television programs. And it will help to preserve local television stations, who provide all of us with vital information like news, weather, and special events--especially sports. We ought to get moving on this sooner, rather than later. It would be a mistake to wait until just before the license expires in 1999. 
This measure replaces the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels with a Copyright Royalty Adjudication Board. In addition to its clever new acronym (`CRAB'), the Board in the future will hopefully find a better way to create parity in the fees that cable and satellite providers pay in copyright royalties. This time around, however, it would be wise to lower legislatively the recently proposed 27 cent rate. 
In any event, we should view the Copyright Compulsory License Improvement Act as a point of departure rather than a final product. I am hopeful we can work with the Commerce Committee, which clearly has an important role to play in many of these matters. This measure is a significant step in promoting competition, and Senators Hatch and Leahy deserve enormous credit for creating a constructive approach, which can only benefit consumers nationwide. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Snowe amendment. First, I wish to commend the Senator from Maine for her efforts to craft a compromise on this issue. If everyone entered this debate with her spirit of negotiation and patience, I think we would surely be able to come to a final resolution of this matter. 
I favor the Snowe amendment at this time because I feel it is the best compromise available to possibly pass the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. As an original cosponsor of that legislation, I favor S.25 as presented yesterday by Senator McCain. I believe the section related to independent expenditures is well-crafted, would go a long way in improving our electoral system, and meets the difficult constitutional standards for this issue. 
However, it is clear that the McCain-Feingold bill does not have the necessary votes to end the filibuster. By altering the section of the bill dealing with independent expenditures, we would have a compromise which has the potential of passing the Senate. I would prefer the language as crafted by Senators McCain and Feingold, but it is clear we cannot pass the bill in that form. Therefore, adding the Snowe amendment at least offers hope that campaign finance reform can be passed in this session. 
I also wish to add that my support for this amendment is conditional on its inclusion in a broader package of campaign finance reform. Any reform proposal must be designed to be fair and balanced. Taken separately, or added to other legislation that does not address other important campaign finance issues, the Snowe amendment would not have the desired impact on the electoral process. 
If we pass the Snowe amendment, and the underlying McCain-Feingold bill, we will have made a great stride toward reforming our campaign finance laws, and offer the American public some hope that Congress is taking their concerns on this matter very seriously.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. This debate is one of the most important that the Senate will conduct in this session of Congress, and I desperately hope it will result in passage of meaningful campaign finance reform. 
We are beginning another mid-term election year, and the American public is again bracing for the barrage of money, special interest TV ads, and rhetorical hyperbole that accompany modern campaigns. There is near universal belief in this nation that Congress should do something about our campaign finance laws. We hold weeks of hearings on abuses in recent elections; we document loophole after loophole in the fabric of our laws whereby special interest influence campaigns to the detriment of our national interests; and we see meaningful, genuine reform proposals twisted and maligned by those same groups who are terrified at their potential loss of power. 
This is an old-fashioned debate in Washington, because it's about who has the power and how that power will be used. The McCain-Feingold bill seeks to diffuse that power; to level the playing field a little bit in federal campaigns and reduce the amount of special interest money in elections. Senators McCain and Feingold have developed a genuine compromise plan. It is not exactly as I would have drafted--or any of us, if we had that chance. It is, however, the best chance we have to repair the broken campaign finance system. 
The modified version of the bill addresses one of the fundamental problems in the system--soft money contributions. By banning these huge sums from federal campaigns, we correct many of the problems which were exposed last year in hearings before the Senate Government Affairs Committee. 
The bill also tries to deal with the growing and disturbing impact of independent expenditures. I believe the sponsors of the bill have achieved a delicate balance in this area--curtailing the use of this practice, while still conforming to constitutional boundaries. 
Mr. President, there is an extraordinary need for reform of our election laws. Despite the apparent problems--problems that have gotten worse with every election--Congress has not passed reform. Our failure to act has contributed to a loss of confidence, not only in our electoral system, but in our democracy. 
The American public has lost faith in government and its institutions. Americans feel they don't control government because they believe they don't control elections. 
If you ask people who runs Washington, most will say `special interests.' People watch state officials, Members of Congress, and presidential candidates chase money, and believe that's the only way to get your voice heard in Washington. They see televised campaign finance hearings, allegations of trading contributions for access, and they think, `how could my voice be heard over all that cash.' 
Certainly, Congress is not alone to blame for the current system. Voters themselves share some responsibility. People routinely decry the use of negative political ads, yet continually respond to the content of those ads. The media, especially television stations and networks, have failed to adequately inform the public of important policy questions. Instead of covering significant issues, broadcasters often fall back on covering the `horserace' aspect of the campaign, or `sideshow' disagreements among candidates. 
But the ultimate responsibility rests in this chamber, with Congress. For more than 30 years the growing crisis has been ignored. Year after year, speeches are given, bills are introduced, but no action is taken. 
We now have a rare opportunity, with public attention focused on this debate and this bill, to pass real campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, we have never had a time in our nation's history when such a pervasive problem went unanswered by the Congress. America has met challenges such as this before, and adopted policies which strengthened our democracy. We have that opportunity with the bill before us. 
The McCain-Feingold bill will help restore the American public's faith in this institution and in all the institutions of government. 
As some of my colleagues know, Senator Brownback and I have introduced legislation to establish an independent commission to reform our campaign finance laws. This commission would be similar to the Base Closure Commission, which proposed a series of recommendations to Congress for an up-or-down vote of approval. 
But I do not believe that we should take such an approach at this time. It would be much better if Congress acted on its own, without the help of an outside body, to reform our election laws. It would demonstrate to the American public that Congress is serious about changing the way our democracy functions. 
Mr. President, before I conclude, I just want to take a moment to once again commend my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. Last year, when we debated this bill, I said that Senator Feingold truly follows in the tradition of the great progressive movement in Wisconsin. That's more even true today than it was last year. I'm proud to serve with him, and I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to pass this vital legislation.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to tell you why Lynn Adelman, the President's nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, is such a fine choice to fill the vacancy created when Judge Curran took senior status. 
First, Lynn Adelman has a record of unquestioned skill and unequaled experience in his 30 years of practice. His dedication, hard work and intelligence has been displayed in both civil and criminal cases, before the Wisconsin Supreme Court and before the Supreme Court of the United States. 
Second, Lynn Adelman has spent a life devoted to public service. He has dedicated a great deal of his professional time to disadvantaged clients. And, rather than pursue his private practice full-time, he has simultaneously served in public office. As a State senator for 20 years, much of the time serving as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he has championed the causes of families, crime victims and government accountability. 
Based on this outstanding record, Lynn Adelman received high marks from the nonpartisan commission that Senator Feingold and I established with the State Bar. And his nomination has bipartisan support, including the endorsement of Wisconsin's Republican Governor, Tommy Thompson. Although they have not always seen eye to eye, Governor Thompson wrote that Lynn is `thoughtful, fair and open-minded' as well as someone who `is sensitive to and has respect for the principle of the separation of powers.' 
Finally, let me conclude on a personal note. My family has known the Adelman family for over 30 years, and I have known Lynn personally for more than 20. I know that he has the compassion, integrity and skill that will make him a valuable addition to the bench.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, let me take a moment to explain the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1997, which I introduced with Senator DeWine and which I drafted with the help of the administration. This measure toughens the criminal penalties we created in the Child Support Recovery Act of 1992 and creates new gradations of offenders to target and punish the most egregious child support evaders. It ensures that more serious crimes receive the more serious punishments they clearly deserve. And, Mr. President, this measure sends a clear message to deadbeat dads and moms: ignore the law, ignore your responsibilities, and you will pay a high price. In other words, pay up or go to jail. 
When Senator Shelby and I introduced the original Child Support Recovery Act, we knew that Federal prosecutors had a role to play to keep these parents from shirking their legal, and I would argue moral, responsibilities. It has been estimated that if delinquent parents fully paid up their child support, approximately 800,000 women and children could be taken off the welfare rolls. In fact, Mr. President, since that legislation was signed into law in 1992, over 386 cases have been filed, resulting in at least 165 convictions to date. And not only has that law brought about punishment, but it has also brought about payment. Collections have increased by nearly 50 percent, from $8 billion to $11.8 billion, and a new national database has helped identify 60,000 delinquent fathers--over half of whom owed money to women on welfare. Although we should be proud of that increase, we can not merely rest on our laurels. More can be done--and today the Senate's passage of the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act is a step in the right direction. 
Mr. President, as you know, current law already makes it a Federal offense to willfully fail to pay child support obligations to a child in another State if the obligation has remained unpaid for longer than a year or is greater than $5,000. However, the current law, by providing for a maximum punishment of just 6 months in prison for a first offense, makes violations only a misdemeanor. A first offense--no matter how egregious--is not a felony under current law. 
Police officers and prosecutors have used the current law effectively, but they have found that current misdemeanor penalties do not have the teeth to adequately deal with more serious cases--those cases in which parents move from State to State, or internationally, to intentionally evade child support penalties. Those are serious cases that deserve serious felony punishment and, under this new measure, that serious punishment will be available. 
Mr. President, I believe that making the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act law will make a difference in the lives of families across the country. I thank my friend from Ohio, and this bill's original cosponsor, Senator DeWine for his efforts on behalf of children and families, and I commend my colleagues in the Senate for passing this important message. I look forward to this measure quickly passing the House and being signed into law by the President.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, my thanks to the chairman and ranking member for their hard work on the District of Columbia appropriations bill and for working with me on an amendment of vital importance to the children and families of the District. I am very pleased that they have agreed to accept my amendment which would allow the District to increase the number of monitors and inspectors responsible for upholding safety and quality standards in day-care centers and home-care operations across the city. 
Mr. President, in early October we all had the occasion to read an extremely troubling article on the front page of the Washington Post. As part of a series on welfare reform implementation, the Post discussed the deplorable and unsafe conditions at many District day-care facilities. Many of the problems could be traced to the fact that the people and resources dedicated to overseeing child care centers in the District are woefully inadequate. 
We learned that of the approximately 350 public day-care centers in the District of Columbia, more than half are operating without proper licenses. The primary inspection agency has been without a supervisor for almost a year and a half. There are only five inspectors charged with issuing and enforcing licenses to District child care centers, and only three people in charge of certifying which centers should be eligible for public funds. Those who are clearly suffering as a result are the children, far too many of whom are spending their days in an environment where they are unstimulated, uncared for, and even in mortal danger. 
The availability and regulation of quality day-care centers and home-care operations in the District and across the country is a crucial component of successful welfare reform. Simply put, welfare reforms will not succeed unless moms and dads across the country have a safe place to leave their children while they are out earning paychecks. 
Not only that, welfare reform has and will continue to increase greatly the demand for day-care slots. In the District alone, it is predicted that 4,000 additional slots will be 
needed to accommodate the schedules of working parents. That number mirrors the situation in the city of Milwaukee in my home State of Wisconsin. As more, new child care centers spring up to meet this new demand, tough, consistent licensing standards, applied and enforced by an adequate number of inspectors, are essential to avoiding more tragedies like we are witnessing in the District. 
I am a supporter of welfare reform because I believe the family is strengthened by work. But that premise is destroyed--and the success of true reform, jeopardized--if we force parents to choose between work and the basic safety of their children. As a society, we have a responsibility to help American families become independent, unified, and strong by moving them off welfare and into the workplace. As a people, we have a moral duty to ensure that children of those families are safe and nurtured while their parents work. We will have crippled more than just welfare reform if, because of inadequate attention to the quality of child care in this country, we force parents to turn their children over to dangerous, deplorable child care situations. 
I am very pleased that the Senate has agreed to incorporate my amendment into the spending legislation for the District of Columbia. Obviously, this is a crisis situation which the additional staff will help address. 
That said, much more needs to be done. This problem goes way beyond a question of mere staffing numbers. As such, in addition to this amendment, the chairman and I will be writing a letter to the Control Board to ensure that oversight and proper licensing and enforcement of safety and quality regulations by District agencies is an integral part of the comprehensive management reform plans scheduled to be unveiled in December. 
Specifically, we will press the Control Board on procedures for day-care center and home day-care licensing, rates of inspection, the effectiveness of safety and quality standards at day-care centers and home day-cares, the effectiveness of public subsidy and case referral services in the District day-care system, the effectiveness of the current system of public oversight of day-care center and home day-care operations as conducted by the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs and the Department of Human Services, and appropriate staffing levels at these agencies. 
Again, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to my amendment. I consider it to be one of many steps we need to take on this very important issue. I look forward to working with the District on finding solutions to this and other pressing problems relating to the quality of life in our Nation's Capital. 
Thank you.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a disturbing trend in our democracy--the decline of voter turnout in our elections. 
During the past 2 years we have debated at length our campaign finance system. We have seen in ample detail the corrupting influences invading our elections, and the effect these stories are having on the American public. Voters are increasingly distrustful of their system of government. They have lost confidence in America's institutions, its leaders, and its electoral process. 
The Senate is taking steps to reform the campaign finance system, and I am hopeful that before the spring we will have a campaign finance reform bill to present to the American public. But there are other reforms which we can undertake to restore citizens' faith in our democracy and increase participation in elections. 
For decades we've seen a gradual decline in voter turnout. In 1952, about 63 percent of eligible voters came out to vote--that number dropped to about 49 percent in the 1996 election. Non-Presidential year voter turnout is even more abysmal. 
Analysts point to a variety of reasons for this dropoff. Certainly, common sense suggests that the general decline in voter confidence in government institutions is one logical reason. However, I'd like to point out, one survey of voters and nonvoters suggested that both groups are equally disgruntled with government. 
We must explore ways to make our electoral process more user friendly. We must adjust our institutions to the needs of the American public of the 21st century. Our democracy has always had the amazing capacity to adapt to the challenges thrown before it, and we must continue to do so if our country is to grow and thrive. 
I propose that we consider innovative ways to increase voter turnout and enhance our citizens' impression of the process. One way to do this would be change the hours that polls are open. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing the Weekend Voting Act of 1997, which would change the day for congressional and presidential elections from the first Tuesday in November to the first weekend in November. 
Mr. President, I come from the business world, where you had a perfect gauge of what the public thought of you and your products. If you turned a profit, you knew the public liked your product--if you didn't, you knew you needed to make changes. If customers weren't showing up when your store was open, you knew you had to change your store hours. 
In essence, it's time for the American democracy to change its store hours. Since the mid-19th century, election day has been on the first Tuesday of November. Ironically, this date was selected because it was convenient for voters. Tuesdays were traditionally court day, and land-owning voters were often coming to town anyway. 
Just as the original selection of our national voting day was done for voter convenience, we must adapt to the changes in our society to make voting easier for the regular family. Two in every three households have both parents working. Since most polls in the U.S. are open only 12 hours, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., voters often have only 1 or 2 hours to vote. If they have children, and are dropping them off at day care, voters often must take time off work to vote. 
We can do better by offering more flexible voting hours for all Americans, especially working families. 
Under this bill, polls would be open nationwide for a uniform period of time from Saturday, 6 p.m. eastern time to Sunday, 6 p.m. eastern time. Polls in other time zones would also open and close at this time. Some Western States have complained that early return information broadcast over television networks has decreased voter turnout. By establishing uniform nationwide voting schedules, this problem would be solved. 
I should note, while I've been an advocate of weekend voting for some time, it was NBC Anchor Tom Brokaw who suggested the uniform voting schedule, and I thank him for his contribution to this proposal. 
Mr. President, of 27 democracies, 17 of them allow their citizens to vote on holidays or the weekends. And in nearly every one of these nations, voter turnout surpasses our country's poor performance. We can do better. 
Like most innovative plans, States already are experimenting with novel ways to increase voter turnout and satisfaction. Texas has implemented an early voting plan, California has relaxed restrictions on absentee voting, and Oregon's special election for Senator in 1996 was done entirely by mail. While results are still inconclusive whether these new models increase voter turnout, there is no doubt that voters are much more pleased with the additional convenience and ease with voting. 
Under the Weekend Voting Act, States would be permitted to close the polls during the overnight hours if they determine it would be inefficient to keep them open. Because the polls are open from Saturday to Sunday, they would not interfere with religious observances. 
I know that partisans in both parties will decry this plan as detrimental to their candidates. Republican consultants will worry that union households that traditionally vote Democratic will have more time to go and vote. Democrat consultants will worry that the combination of church and voting on Sundays will hurt their party's chances at the poll. I hope both are right, and that the end result is more people affiliated with both parties coming out to vote. That should be the goal of a democracy. 
Mr. President, I recognize a change of this magnitude will take some time. But, how much more should voting turnout decline before we realize we need a change. How much lower should our citizens' confidence plummet before we adapt and create a more `consumer-friendly' polling system. 
The Weekend Voting Act will not solve all of this democracy's problems, but it is a commonsense approach for adapting this grand democratic experiment of the 18th century to the American family's lifestyle of the 21st century.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for their support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 48, which was adopted by unanimous consent. 
This resolution is important because over the past few months a series of increasingly troubling reports have been published indicating Russian organizations are continuing to provide missile assistance to Iran. According to these reports, Russia has supplied blueprints and components for the 2,000 kilometer range SS-4 ballistic missile, as well as a wide variety of equipment and material useful in the design and manufacture of ballistic missiles, including special metals, a wind tunnel, and missile design software. 
These press accounts are corroborated by an unclassified CIA report to Congress released in June titled, `The Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions,' which states that, `Russia supplied a variety of ballistic missile-related goods to foreign countries [in late 1996], especially Iran.' 
These reports clearly make the point that the assistance provided by Russian organizations is the critical factor which has accelerated the pace of Iran's ballistic missile program and may enable Tehran to complete development of a missile, called the Shahab-3, that will have sufficient range to strike United States forces in the region and Israel in as little as 12 to 18 months. In addition, Iran is also receiving Russian assistance with the development of a second missile, called the Shahab-4, that would have enough range to reach Central Europe and could be deployed in as little as 3 years. 
The resolution adopted today expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should demand that the Russian Government take concrete actions to stop governmental and nongovernmental organizations from assisting Iran's missile program. If Russia fails to respond to United States concerns, the resolution calls on the President to impose sanctions on the responsible Russian entities. 
This legislation does not require new sanctions, but rather calls on the administration to enforce the substantial amount of existing sanctions law. The fact that the resolution was adopted by unanimous consent in the Senate and passed by an overwhelming vote of 414 to 8 in the House of Representatives sends a clear signal to Russia and the administration that this dangerous trade must stop now. 
I am very pleased that from its inception, this resolution has enjoyed bipartisan support; 39 Senators, from both sides of the aisle, cosponsored the measure and I want to thank them for their support and also thank Representative Jane Harman who was the principal sponsor of the resolution in the House of Representatives and worked tirelessly on its behalf. It has been a pleasure working with Representative Harman over the past few months and I look forward to continuing to work closely with her to address the national security challenges facing our nation.

Mr. KOHL. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation entitled `the Federal Energy Bank Act.' The purpose of this legislation is to provide a stable long-term source of funding for energy efficiency projects throughout the Federal Government. If we are to start the Nation on the road toward increased energy conservation we must begin with the Federal Government. This bill will help provide the necessary investments to make this first step toward long-term energy conservation possible. 
I have long believed that our Nation must implement a sensible national energy policy which emphasizes greater energy conservation and efficiency, as well as the development of renewable resources. This bill is just one step of many that need to be taken to reduce our energy consumption problems. The events in the Middle East, coupled with the environmental problems associated with the use of fossil fuels, have only increased the need for improved energy conservation. Simply put, we cannot continue to rely on imported oil to meet such a large part of our Nation's energy needs. This dependence places our economic security at great risk. At present, petroleum imports account for fully one-half of our trade deficit. In addition, the use of oil and other fossil fuels contributes to global climate change, air pollution, and acid rain. 
Mr. President our attempts to remedy this situation are nothing new. In fact, the laws requiring significant energy use reductions are already in place. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that Federal agencies use cost-effective measures, with less than a 10-year payback, to reduce energy consumption in their facilities by 20 percent by the year 2000 compared to 1985 levels. President Clinton, with Executive Order 12902, extended the mandate by requiring Federal agencies to reduce energy consumption by 30 percent by the year 2005 compared to 1985 energy uses. If accomplished, this would save the American taxpayer millions in annual energy costs and in turn put us on the road to future energy savings. This would also improve our environment, our balance of trade, and our national security. 
But the road toward energy efficiency or even self-sufficiency is not an easy one and requires capital investment. The administration and Congress must back their policies with real dollars for investment in energy efficiency projects. According to the recent Federal energy efficiency and water conservation study, drafted by the Department of Energy, an investment of $5.7 billion is required through 1996 to 2005 to meet National Energy Policy and Conservation Act and Executive order goals. The best estimate of the total funding available has resulted in a shortfall of $2 billion. Without significant funding the goals as set forth by the President will not be met. Laws and mandates alone will not solve our energy problems. It requires long-term capital investment. 
Mr. President, my business background has taught me that most large paybacks come from positive long-term investments. Unfortunately, the Federal Government does not traditionally take this approach. More often that not, it seeks short-term savings and cuts which do not address the problem of energy consumption or encourage future energy conservation. 
Mr. President, my bill will help address this funding shortfall. The bill creates a bank to fund the purchase of energy efficiency projects by Federal agencies and in the long run will reduce the overall amount of money spent on energy consumption by the Federal Government. For each of the fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, each Federal agency will contribute an amount equal to 5 percent of its previous year's utility costs into a fund or bank managed by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
The Secretary of Energy will authorize loans from the bank to any Federal agency for use toward investment in energy efficiency projects. The agency will then repay the loan, making the bank self-supporting after a few years. The Secretary of Energy will also establish selection criteria for each energy efficiency project, determining the project is cost-effective and produces a payback in 3 years or less. Agencies will be required to report the progress of each project with a cost of more than $1 million to the Secretary 1 year after installation. The Secretary will then report to Congress each year on all the operations of the bank. 
Mr. President, this bill will provide the real dollars required to make the Executive order goals a reality. The Congressional Budget Office has projected a 5-year savings for the bill at $3 million. Our energy savings will be even greater over the long term. 
Mr. President, in closing I would like to thank Johnson Controls, the largest public company in Wisconsin, for their continued leadership and input on this bill. As a maker of energy conservation systems, Johnson has provided me with the real world insights that have helped me draft a bill that attempts to address our energy conservation needs. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full text of the bill be printed in full in the Record. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and will push for its early enactment.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. I want to thank Senator DeWine and commend him for taking the lead on this important issue. 
This bill demonstrates America's commitment to the same historical honesty that we are demanding of Switzerland and other countries only now facing their role in the atrocities of World War II. It is not enough for us to talk about disclosure by others. We need to practice it too. If there are secrets relating to the presence of Nazi war criminals in the United States, or if there is information that will be helpful in identifying assets of Holocaust victims, or even evidence of other governments collaborating with the Nazis, let's open these files and reveal these secrets before an entire generation of survivors is gone. 
This bill creates a presumption in favor of the public interest in learning all there is to learn about Nazi war crimes and requires a proactive searching of Government files for relevant documents. We have an obligation to find this information and to disseminate it. Although the Holocaust happened more than 50 years ago, we are now seeing countries and individuals caught up in the maelstrom of World War II grappling with this difficult past. Much of the debate on these issues has been triggered by recently released information from Government and other archives. 
For survivors, there is no legislation that can erase the suffering they endured at the hands of the Nazis. As we go about our day-to-day business, it is easy to forget the horrific details of what happened in Europe: the gruesome torture and deaths, the systematic 
extermination of people. However, for those of us who were directly touched by the Holocaust, history is very real. I grew up in the shadow of this tragedy. When I was a child, my family worried daily about family members left behind in Europe during the war. We constantly discussed what was or wasn't happening, and when the truth finally emerged, and all Americans realized the extent of the tragedy, it touched us even more. 
It is only natural for American survivors and their families to expect the American Government to be as forthcoming as possible. Although many survivors have gone on to live productive lives here in the United States, and around the world, they can never forget. Nor should we. 
Many emerging democracies are now facing their pasts--through truth commissions and the like. It is tempting to want to look forward and to forget events of long ago. But for these fragile democracies, reckoning with the past is the key to ensuring a secure future. We too must recognize that the openness prescribed by this legislation only makes our democracy stronger. 
This legislation maintains protections for individuals from the unwarranted invasion of their personal privacy, and it continues to provide exceptions for the most urgent national security and foreign policy interests. The difference between this bill and existing FOIA protections is that this bill firmly sets into law the public's right to know about Nazi war crimes and the disposition of Nazi assets, and if there is information that agencies insist on keeping secret, the relevant congressional committees must be informed. This will give us the opportunity to determine whether information dating so far back should remain classified. Finally, the bill provides that if an agency head exercises his or her authority to block the release of information, the decision is subject to judicial review. 
It is difficult to imagine what knowledge would be subject to these protections so many years after the fact. Yes, there may be information which makes us feel uncomfortable. There is already information about the extent to which the U.S. Government knew about what was going on during the war in the Nazi death camps. We must not be afraid of what we may learn. The only ones who need fear are the perpetrators of these vicious acts who have escaped scrutiny until now, for there are still Nazi war criminals at large in this country and abroad. Armed with new information, much like the information which may be available in our own files, courts around the world are compelling them to answer for their despicable acts. 
This legislation is targeted to information solely related to Nazi war crimes and to transactions involving Nazi victims, yet it sets an important precedent in codifying a more narrow set of privacy and national security exceptions for the release of Government information through the Freedom of Information Act. These exceptions are based on Executive Order 12958 which set the criteria for the release of information more than 25 years old. Unfortunately, we still have a long way to go in ensuring that this more open standard is uniformly applied to the release of Government information. 
I am pleased that Senator Moynihan is one of the lead sponsors of this bill because he has been such an eloquent spokesman against excessive secrecy. His work with the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy is truly commendable and I am pleased that this legislation is consistent with the findings of the Commission. Beyond shedding light on a difficult chapter in the history of humanity, this legislation can help foster a greater openness in the handling of Government information. 
If we succeed, we will have left a legacy of which we can all be proud.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, to introduce the Wisconsin Federal Judgeship Act of 1997. This bill would create one additional Federal judgeship for the eastern district of Wisconsin and situate it in Green Bay, where a district court is crucially needed. Let me explain how the current system hurts--and how this additional judgeship will help--businesses, law enforcement agents, witnesses, victims, and individual litigants in northeastern Wisconsin. 
First, the four full-time district court judges for the eastern district of Wisconsin currently preside in Milwaukee. Yet for most litigants and witnesses in northeastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee is well over 100 miles away. Thus, litigants and witnesses must incur substantial costs in traveling from northern Wisconsin to Milwaukee--costs in terms of time, money, resources, and effort. Indeed driving from Green Bay to Milwaukee takes nearly two hours each way. Add inclement weather or a departure point north of Green Bay--such as Oconto or Marinette--and the driving time alone often results in witnesses traveling for a far longer period of time than they actually spend testifying. 
Second, Mr. President, as Attorney General Janet Reno recently noted before the Judiciary Committee, Federal crimes remain unacceptably high in northeastern Wisconsin. These crimes range from bank robbery and kidnaping to Medicare and Medicaid fraud. However, without the appropriate judicial resources, a crackdown on Federal crimes in the upper will be made enormously more difficult. 
Third, many manufacturing and retail companies are located in northeastern Wisconsin. These companies often require a Federal court to litigate complex price-fixing, contract, and liability disputes with out-of-State businesses. But the sad truth is that many of these cases are never even filed--precisely because the northern part of the State lacks a Federal court. Mr. President, this hurts businesses not only in Wisconsin, but across the Nation. 
Fourth, prosecuting cases on the Menominee Indian Reservation creates specific problems that alone justify having a Federal judge in Green Bay. Under current law, the Federal Government is required to prosecute all felonies committed by Indians that occur on the Menominee Reservation. The reservation's distance from the Federal prosecutors and courts--more than 150 miles--makes these prosecutions problematic. And because the Justice Department compensates attorneys, investigators, and sometimes witnesses for travel expenses, the existing system costs all of us. In addition, Mr. President, we saw juvenile crime rates on this reservation rise by 279 percent last year alone. Without an additional judge in Green Bay, the administration of justice, as well as the public's pocketbook, will suffer enormously. 
Fifth, Mr. President, the creation of an additional judgeship in the eastern district of Wisconsin is also clearly justified on the basis of caseload. I have commissioned the General Accounting Office to look at this issue and their report will be released early next year and which we expect will confirm our belief. However, based on standards already established by the Judicial Conference, the administrative and statistical arm of the Federal judiciary, an additional judgeship is clearly needed. In 1994, the Judicial Conference recommended the creation of additional Federal judgeships on the basis of weighted filings; that is, the total number of cases filed per judge modified by the average level of case complexity. In 1994, new positions were justified where a district's workload exceeded 430 weighted filings per judge. On this basis, the eastern district of Wisconsin clearly merits an additional judgeship: it tallied more than 435 weighted filings in 1993 and averaged 434 weighted filings per judge between 1991-93. In fact, though our bill would not add an additional judge in the western district of Wisconsin, we could make a strong case for doing so because the average weighted filings per judge in the western district was almost as high as in the eastern district. 
Mr. President, our legislation in simple, effective, and straightforward. It creates an additional judgeship for the eastern district, requires that one judge hold court in Green Bay, and gives the chief judge of the eastern district the flexibility to designate which judge holds court there. And this legislation would increase the number of Federal district judges in Wisconsin for the first time since 1978. During that period, more than 252 new Federal district judgeships have been created nationwide, but not a single one in Wisconsin.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks about the legislation before us. I am a strong supporter of the line-item veto. I believe we must use whatever tools we have at our disposal to restrain Federal spending. 
That said, I agree with my colleagues that we have a right to expect the President to exercise his line-item veto authority in a manner that is fair. If he says he is going to use a set of criteria, then he should. Unfortunately, some but not all of the project vetoed met the President's own criteria. 
For example, the President used his line-item veto authority to eliminate funding for an aerial port training facility at the General Mitchell Air Reserve Station in Milwaukee based on erroneous information. The administration has admitted as much. There is no question that this project is 35 percent designed with a site selected and is ready to be constructed in fiscal year 1998. In addition, this project was authorized in the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill conference report and is included in the Pentagon's 5-year plan. 
I should also add that this project makes a significant contribution to the military readiness of a unit which plays an important role in our Nation's defense. The merging of the 34th Aerial Port Squadron, 154 persons, and the 95th Aerial Port Squadron, 102 personnel, has overburdened the current training facility. The 34th Squadron must train its reserve airlift specialists to load and unload military cargo aircraft using one bay of the base warehouse and a leased modular facility. Even with the temporary facility, overcrowding is so severe that the unit cannot train together. Some reservists must train on weekends that are not normal unit training assembly weekends, depriving them of working with the rest of the unit personnel. Using the warehouse bay has also created a shortage in onbase storage. Members of the 34th Aerial Port Squadron have been deployed to support our mission in Bosnia, and they will continue to be called upon to support other active duty and reserve units. 
Funding for the aerial port training facility is not included in the legislation before us today. It is my hope that the Department of Defense will recognize the importance of this project and will move it up 1 year to include it in the fiscal year 1999 budget, and I am working to that end. 
Mr. President, it is our job to make difficult choices. I am not willing to support a bill that restores all of the projects which were line-item vetoed. Some of these projects were not 35 percent designed. Some of these projects did not meet the President's criteria. Some of these projects did not need to be built this year. 
If this legislation included just the project which met the President's criteria that would be a different story, but that is not the bill before us today. Thus, Mr. President, I cannot support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to uphold the President's line-item veto.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my colleagues', Mr. Feingold and Mr. Grams, efforts to clarify study language included in the Agriculture appropriations bill being discussed today. 
My friends from the Northeast have worked hard to boost prices above market clearing levels by creating a regional compact for their farmers. Now that the compact is implemented and operating, we need a timely, comprehensive economic analysis by the Office of Management and Budget of the marketing and pricing of milk within the six State compact and surrounding areas. The pricing of milk is an extremely complex issue. Artificially manipulating the marketing and pricing of milk will have major impacts on other regions of the United States, like Wisconsin. 
Their proposal to raise prices for farmers has worked well and that cost is being passed on to consumers. A recently released study announced that Massachusetts consumers will pay an additional $25 million for their milk over the next 12 months. The print media has reported that consumers are paying $.27 a gallon more per gallon of milk in the compact area. We need to analyze the impact this price increase has not only on government purchases of dairy products for lunch programs, but also the impact on low-income families that spend more of their income on food and dairy products. 
Although the program only regulates class I milk, other classes will be impacted by the economic signals encouraging Northeast dairy farmers to overproduce. What happens to that excess fluid or manufacturing milk that will be produced in the Northeast and forced to find a new processing plant outside the compact area? Again, the print media has reported that distressed raw milk has moved out of the Northeast to plants in Ohio and as far away as Wisconsin and Minnesota. Ohio plants reportedly were paying $8.00 per cwt. delivered milk filling all manufacturing plants to capacity in that State. That excess supply of milk added to the overproduction that occurred in the United States further exasperating record low price paid to farms this summer. 
Finally, the study should consider a cost/benefit analysis for each State participating in the compact. For example, Massachusetts has only about 300 dairy farms, roughly 10 percent of New England total, while its consumers pay half of the aggregate total consumer costs. 
I encourage the Office of Management and Budget to take a serious look at the issue.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished WI. Mrs. Ruth (Nowicki) Becker of Altoona, Wisconsin. Mrs. Becker, who just turned 75, attended the dedication of the Memorial to the Women in Service at Arlington National Cemetery on October 18, 1997. Ruth is one of approximately 1.8 million women who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces and we honor her as does the memorial for serving our country proudly. 
Mrs. Becker enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1944 and served as a WAVE, Women's Auxiliary for Volunteer Emergency Service, during World War II. Ruth's responsibilities took her to New York City and Washington, DC where she worked in naval communications for Pacific theater operations until February 1946. 
Ruth is a charter member for the women's memorial project which has transformed Arlington National Cemetery's 75-year-old main entrance gate into a shrine honoring the Nation's women veterans. The memorial will house a museum, a 196-seat auditorium, a Hall of Honor, and an education center on military history. Mr. President, Ruth Becker served our country with pride and we honor her, as we also honor all women who have served our country proudly.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today eight of the largest gun manufacturers voluntarily agreed to include safety locks with every handgun they sell. I rise today to commend the President and the gun industry for their historic efforts. 
This agreement addresses a very serious problem. Every year, many hundreds of children die from accidental shootings and thousands more try to take their own lives with guns. Encouraging parents to use safety locks will not save all of these young lives, to be sure, but it will save many of them. It will make a difference. 
This deal, however, would not have been possible without the public outcry over these tragedies and the growing momentum for bipartisan child safety lock legislation. Our measure, which lost by a single vote in the Judiciary Committee this summer, requires the sale of a safety lock with every handgun. 
Mr. President, in my opinion voluntary action is always better than Government regulation. For that reason, when we entered into negotiations with gun manufacturers, we asked them to take this dramatic step on their own initiative. Today we are very pleased that most of the industry has responded so that 80 percent of all handguns manufactured in the United States will now be sold with child safety locks. But we will continue to push until the half million more handguns, including those manufactured abroad, are 
also covered. 
We will also continue to encourage voluntary compliance, but until we have the support of the entire industry, we will move to enact our legislation. It should be easier now because most of the industry is already on board. 
Mr. President, today's announcement is an important step for safety and a victory for families and children everywhere. We should all be grateful. 
I thank you and yield the floor.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. This debate is one of the most important that the Senate will conduct in this session of Congress, and I desperately hope it will result in passage of meaningful campaign finance reform. 
There is an extraordinary need for reform of our election laws. Despite the apparent problems--problems that have gotten worse with every election--Congress has not passed reform. Our failure to act has contributed to a loss of confidence, not only in our electoral system, but in our democracy. 
The American public has lost faith in government and its institutions. Americans feel they don't control government because they believe they don't control elections. 
If you ask people who runs Washington, most will say `special interests.' People watch State officials, Members of Congress, and Presidential candidates chase money, and believe that's the only way to get your voice heard in Washington. They see televised campaign finance hearings, allegations of trading contributions for access, and they think, `how could my voice be heard over all that cash.' 
Certainly, Congress is not alone to blame for the current system. Voters themselves share some responsibility. People routinely decry the use of negative political ads, yet continually respond to the content of those ads. The media, especially television stations and networks, have failed to adequately inform the public of important policy questions. Instead of covering significant issues, broadcasters often fall back on covering the `horserace' aspect of the campaign, or `sideshow' disagreements among candidates. 
But the ultimate responsibility rests in this Chamber, with Congress. For more than 30 years the growing crisis has been ignored. Year after year, speeches are given, bills are introduced, but no action is taken. 
We now have a rare opportunity, with public attention focused on this debate and this bill, to pass real campaign finance reform. 
Senators McCain and Feingold have developed a genuine compromise plan. It is not exactly as I would have drafted--or any of us, if we had that chance. It is, however, the best, last chance we have to repair the broken campaign finance system. 
The modified version of the bill addresses one of the fundamental problems in the system--soft money contributions. By banning these huge sums from Federal campaigns, we correct many of the problems which have been exposed this year in hearings before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
The bill also tries to deal with the growing and disturbing impact of independent expenditures. I believe the sponsors of the bill have achieved a delicate balance in this area--curtailing the use of this practice, while still conforming to constitutional boundaries. 
Mr. President, we have never had a time in our Nation's history when such a pervasive problem went unanswered by the Congress. America has met challenges such as this before, and adopted policies which strengthened our democracy. We have that opportunity with the bill before us. 
The McCain-Feingold bill will help restore the American public's faith in this institution and in all the institutions of Government. 
As some of my colleagues know, Senator Brownback and I have introduced legislation to establish an independent commission to reform our campaign finance laws. This commission would be similar to the Base Closure Commission, which proposed a series of recommendations to Congress for an up-or-down vote of approval. 
But I do not believe that we should take such an approach at this time. It would be much better if Congress acted on its own, without the help of an outside body, to reform our election laws. It would demonstrate to the American public that Congress is serious about changing the way our democracy functions. 
Mr. President, before I conclude, I just want to take a moment and commend my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. Without his tireless efforts to advance this bill, it surely would have died long ago. By bringing this cause to the floor, Senator Feingold truly follows in the tradition of the great progressive movement in Wisconsin. I'm proud to serve with him, and I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to pass this vital legislation.

Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of this bill which provides funding for the Department of the Treasury, Executive Offices of the President, General Services Administration, and related agency programs. We have tried to be as critical and constructive as we can be. And I believe we have provided a strong funding bill. 
Throughout this year we have had to grapple with a number of difficult issues, such as: accusations of IRS staff browsing at taxpayer files; IRS modernization efforts going awry; unidentified century date change requirements; and the appropriate funding level of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, media campaign. 
These are issues we will continue to review and examine in 1998. And I hope we see some real progress occur as a result of the funding that we have provided. 
In addition, we continue to be concerned with the level of crime through out our country. We realize that the money that is available through illegal drug and gun trafficking is enormous. As long as this kind of profit is available by doing illegal things our job will be more difficult in providing the necessary funding and technology required to deter that. 
As a result, we have worked vigorously to fund the law enforcement agencies' priorities. And I hope that we can continue to work together to continue to fully fund much needed crime prevention programs such as GREAT, the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, the Drug Free Prison Zone demonstration project and others. 
I have enjoyed reviewing the diverse and complex issues of the agencies funded through this bill. I look forward to continuing to work with the subcommittee members and these agencies. Only through a constructive dialog, in a bipartisan fashion can we continue to build and maintain the agencies contained in this bill. 
Finally, I want to say that I have enjoyed working with you, Mr. Chairman, and with your staff. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I reserve the balance of my time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my opposition to a provision within the Treasury, General Government, Civil Service Appropriations Act. 
I am the ranking member of the subcommittee which crafted this legislation, and there is much to support in the bill. However, I am opposed to the provision in the bill to provide a 2.3-percent cost-of-living-adjustment to Members of Congress. 
I have heard the arguments on both sides of the issue and I cannot agree that it is appropriate for Congress to receive this pay raise. While we have made progress in balancing the budget, we have not made the kind of progress which justifies this raise. The American public is rightly holding us to a higher standard, and until we meet that standard, congressional pay should remain at its current level. 
Earlier this week, we had a vote in the House-Senate conference committee on whether to keep the pay raise in the bill. I was prepared to offer a motion to reject the pay raise, and, indeed, voted against the measure. As this body knows, the House voted to insist on its position, and we could not muster a majority in the Senate to similarly insist on this Chamber's position against the pay raise. 
Mr. President, this bill before us also includes many provisions and important programs. If this were an up-or-down vote on the pay raise, I would again oppose the measure. But, this bill is more than that--it funds the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the White House, and dozens of other Federal agencies. 
In addition, the bill includes many anticrime programs, including those operated by `Drug Czar,' the Treasury Department, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. I'm pleased that the legislation includes $3 million for the designation of a high-intensity drug trafficking area for milwaukee, WI. Unfortunately, the drug epidemic often crosses State lines, and it is necessary for Wisconsin law enforcement agencies to coordinate with Federal authorities. If the drug czar concurs with the language in this bill, this money will help my State better combat the growing drug problem. 
The legislation also includes a $1 million increase in the Youth Gun Crime Interdiction Initiative. Milwaukee is one of a small number of cities selected last year to participate in the program which uses resources from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to trace weapons in an attempt to track the seller. The program saw its first success in April when Milwaukee Police arrested a grocery store security guard and charged him with Federal firearms violations. Lawrence M. Shikes plead guilty to purchasing guns and reselling them to juveniles, gang members, and drug dealers in the Milwaukee area. This is an important program, and one of the reasons that I am voting for the overall bill. 
Mr. President, while I am voting for this bill, I strongly oppose to the congressional pay raise provision. Because of this conviction, I will not accept any increase in my salary. Since coming to the Senate in 1989, I have not accepted any salary increase, and I will return any future pay increase to the U.S. Treasury to reduce the deficit. 
Since this is one provision of a larger bill, I will vote in favor of the measure.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Court Consistency in Communications Act of 1997. The purpose of this bill is to bring consistency to the judicial interpretation of some of the central provisions of the Telecommunications Act, to make sure that an appellate court with broad and deep understanding of these issues can bring its expertise to bear on them, and to resolve related litigation as quickly as possible. In many other areas, such as bankruptcy and labor, strong precedent exists for consolidation of cases to bring about more efficient and informed judgments. 
This measure is simple, effective and straightforward. It consolidates in the District of Columbia Federal courts all appeals of FCC decisions under title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and State commission decisions under section 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Let me tell you why this legislation is crucially needed. 
The telecommunications industry accounts for about one-sixth of our national economy. And almost 2 years ago we passed legislation designed to unleash competition in the industry. It was signed into law with great fanfare. As President Clinton said, `Today with the stroke of [my] pen, competition and innovation can move as quick as light.' But we are still waiting for lower rates, better service, and greater innovation that was promised when the Telecom Act was signed. 
The sad truth is that the promise of the Telecom Act has gotten bogged down in litigation. Lawyers are arguing about the meaning of its provisions in courts all across the country. Indeed, today a major challenge to the FCC's jurisdiction over long distance service is being filed in the Eighth Circuit. In my opinion, even under current law this case should have been filed in the District of Columbia. 
We don't, of course, want to take away people's ability to redress grievances through the courts. The right to sue is, for better or worse, almost sacred to American culture. But while some people may choose to wait for a resolution to emerge from the 93 different Federal district courts and 12 distinct Federal circuits, to my mind the better way to bring competition to telecommunications markets is to have some judicial certainty about the rules of the game--and to have it sooner, rather than later. This bill should create the necessary framework for predictability in the courts, so that companies can shift their rivalry from the courtroom to the marketplace. 
This proposal is not a panacea, but it does move us in the right direction. By streamlining the appellate process, the Court Consistency in Communications Act will speed the arrival of local and long distance telephone competition. It will help consumers--the people who pay the bills, who deserve more choice and who wonder why their rates aren't going down. 
Mr. President, this judicial reform bill does not alter the substance of the Telecommunications Act in any way--that is clearly in the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee. Nor does it affect pending cases. Finally, to those who have expressed concerns about the measure, let me remind them that this is not a final product, but a work in progress; in other words, we want to work with you. 
I urge my colleagues to support this measure, because all of us have an interest in reducing litigation and encouraging competition.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, along with my colleagues, Senators Hatch and Leahy, I rise in support in the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaty Implementation Act of 1997. This proposal, while clearly not a final product, is nevertheless an important step forward in our ongoing battle against illegal copying of protected works--such as movies, books, musical recordings, and software. Let me also commend the administration, especially the Commerce Department and the Patent and Trademark Office, for their hard work in pushing for the underlying treaty and assembling a workable proposal to ensure the value of intellectual property.  
What makes this legislation so important to our economy? Consider that the copyright industries had over $53 billion in foreign sales in 1995, surpassing every other export industry except automobiles and agriculture. Also consider that the copyright industries employ nearly 6 million people in the United States, or about 4.8 percent of our work force. But despite the tremendous contribution these businesses make to our economy, we still lose more than $15 billion each year due to foreign copyright piracy, according to some estimates. That is not only wrong; it is unacceptable. 
Mr. President, we need to maintain our status as an international leader in the fight against illegal copying because many nations look to us for guidance in setting their own standards for copyright protection. And we need to show strong leadership in this area because, otherwise, some nations with troubling histories of copyright piracy will be even less likely to improve their records. This proposal moves us in the right direction. 
Some of my colleagues may remember back in 1991 when I introduced similar legislation, the Motion Picture Anti-Piracy Act, to deal with the problem of video bootlegging. Although today's technology is more advanced than in 1991, the problem of unauthorized copying remains. Indeed, it has in some respects grown even worse. The spread of copying technology worldwide, including piracy that takes place with the touch of a button over the Internet, begins to explain the scope of this problem. And because the piracy problem extends across national borders, the best way to address unauthorized copying is through international agreements that go after devices deliberately designed to circumvent technological protection measures. 
Mr. President, this bill generally takes the right approach. It makes it illegal to circumvent various copyright protection systems, it protects the integrity of copyright management information, and it provides for both civil and criminal penalties to deter potential violators. Some have suggested that it goes too far, while others argue that the bill does not go far enough. In any event, we should view this proposal as a point of departure rather than a final product. And we should make certain, as the measure moves forward, that it doesn't restrict products that have other beneficial uses. 
Mr. President, let me make one additional point. The bill does not address the issue of online service provider liability. This issue needs to be discussed and resolved, whether as part of this legislation or separately. But it shouldn't slow down the consideration of the bill we have before us. The WIPO Implementation Act is a significant step in curbing illegal copying, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Patient Abuse Prevention Act, a bill to establish greater safeguards in our health care system for vulnerable Americans. I am pleased to be joined in offering this bill by Senate Committee on Aging Chairman Charles Grassley and Senator Harry Reid. 
One of the most difficult times for any family is when a senior or disabled member enters a long-term care arrangement. That family should not also be faced with the worry that the long-term care facility or its staff may pose a threat. 
Whatever health care setting a family chooses, whether institutional or community-based, there should be assurances that care will be provided by trained and compassionate professionals. 
Thankfully, that is the case in most facilities. But in a few cases--and that is a few cases too many--a long-term care facility hires someone who doesn't have the best interests of the patient in mind. 
A disturbing number of cases have been reported where health care workers with criminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in a long-term care facility and have abused patients in their care. If only greater attention was given to discovering the background of these applicants, the abuses may have been prevented. 
A recent report from the Nation's long-term care ombudsmen indicates that, in 29 States surveyed, 7,043 cases of abuse, gross neglect or exploitation occurred in nursing homes and board and care facilities. 
According to a random-sample survey of nursing home staff, 10 percent admitted committing at least one act of physical abuse in the preceding year, and 40 percent committed psychological abuse. Thirty-six percent of the sample had seen at least one incident of physical abuse in the preceding year by other staff members. 
These statistics may only scratch the surface of the problem. It's quite likely that the incidence of abuse is far more prevalent. In fact, the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services has reported that 46 percent of respondents questioned believed abuse is only sometimes or rarely reported. 
Mr. President, the vast majority of health care facilities and their employees are dedicated and work hard under stressful conditions to provide the best care possible. But it only takes a few abusive staff to cast a dark shadow over what should be a healing environment. 
Although some facilities run thorough background checks on prospective employees, most do not. And even if they wanted to run more complete checks, facilities are prevented due to a fractured and inefficient system. 
It is far too easy for a health care worker with a criminal or abusive background to gain employment and prey on the most vulnerable patients. 
Why is this? Because current State and national safeguards are inadequate to screen out abusive workers. All States are required to maintain nurse aide registries, but these registries are not comprehensive or efficiently maintained. 
Many States limit their registries to nursing home aides, failing to cover home health aides, assisted living workers and hospital aides. Most States don't require criminal background checks of long-term care workers. Further, due to hit and miss investigations, many reports of abuse fall through the cracks. 
The problem I find most troubling is the lack of information sharing between States about known criminal and abusive workers. There are no Federal requirements or guidelines on information sharing about abusive workers--even those who have been convicted in a court of law. 
Because no national registry of abusive health care workers exists, people with histories of abuse or serious crimes in one State can simply travel to another State to find work. These workers can also move from a nursing home to home health agencies or to hospitals without ever undergoing a complete background check. 
Problems also exist with reporting abuse. Rather than going through the trouble of making a report and drawing possible unwanted attention, a facility often will dismiss a worker without a report ever filed. Further, States hesitate to document problem workers due to the fact that a listing means barring a worker from nursing homes for life. 
Much of the public scrutiny on patient abuse has focused on nursing homes. But this is not the only care setting that should have increased protections. Home health care has been dramatically growing as a preferred long-term care option. Yet, protections for home care recipients are even more lax than those for nursing home residents. 
While I am pleased to report that some States, including Wisconsin, have begun working to establish criminal background checks and improve their registries, it is clear that effective national protections must be in place to fill the gaps in the system. 
The legislation I offer today builds on recommendations by State ombudsmen programs who are the watch guards for long-term care residents. This effort is also in response to calls from consumer groups and the long-term care industry for a streamlined, accurate way to screen potential workers for abusive or criminal histories. 
The Patient Abuse Prevention Act creates a national registry of abusive health care workers and requires criminal background checks for those entrusted to care for vulnerable patients. 
This would enable States and employers--either by computer or by phone--to check if a potential employee has a criminal record or other problem in their past that should preclude them from caring for the infirm. 
The national registry would also create a coordinated information network between States so that violators could not simply travel to another state to find work in a nursing home or other setting. 
By far, the best way to stop abuse is to address the situations that lead to problem behaviors. Most studies that have looked into patient abuse indicate that better training would make a big difference. Therefore, this bill creates a demonstration program to investigate best practices in patient abuse prevention. What we learn from this program can then be disseminated by the Department of Health and Human Services and made available to all health care settings. 
Mr. President, when a patient moves into a nursing home, or hires a home health care agency, they are entrusting that company with an enormous responsibility. 
Any instance of patient abuse is intolerable and inadequate background checks of health care workers is inexcusable. 
I believe that protecting our Nation's elderly and infirm Americans from abuse, neglect, and mistreatment should be a national priority. When senior citizens and disabled Americans check into a nursing home or other care setting, they should not have to check their right to a safe environment at the door. 
I urge my colleagues to join in this effort so that all Americans can rest more comfortably knowing that their loved ones are receiving the best and safest care possible.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I just wanted to thank Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings and their staff for their hard work on this bill and especially for their efforts in the area of crime prevention. Since the passage of the Crime Act in 1994, I have worked here in the Appropriations Committee and on the Senate floor to provide funding for proven crime prevention programs and to maintain a reasonable balance between law enforcement and prevention. During that time, Senator Gregg and I have had our differences over the need for these programs. This year, however, I was very pleased to work with Senator Gregg on this issue and these discussions resulted in a total of $75 million for a new program that expands upon the Juvenile Justice Act's title V. This program gives local communities broad discretion to fund a variety of crime prevention efforts, while guaranteeing that not all of our anticrime effort goes to law enforcement alone. Consistent with this initiative, the Judiciary Committee reauthorized title V in the juvenile crime bill reported out of committee last week. 
While this is a large step in the right direction, some small but effective crime prevention efforts that were funded in last year's bill have, unfortunately, been eliminated this year--including the President's Crime Prevention Council. I look forward to working with Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings to address these problems as we move forward with this bill. 
In closing, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for their support of significant crime prevention funding. In communities across the Nation, their efforts will make a difference in the lives of millions of young people.

Mr. KOHL. Let me take this opportunity to thank both the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, Senators Shelby and Lautenberg, and their staffs, for all their hard work in putting together the transportation appropriations bill. Every Member of the Senate should greatly appreciate the bipartisan and good faith manner in which they tackled the daunting task of meeting our Nation's infrastructure priorities. 
There are many transportation programs and priorities funded by this bill that are important to my State of Wisconsin and the Great Lakes region. I would like to take a moment to discuss one particular Great Lakes priority, the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation [SLSDC]. 
Mr. President, since its creation in 1959, SLSDC has provided safe, efficient, and reliable commercial shipping and lockage services through the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The Seaway serves as the gatekeeper for all oceangoing vessel traffic coming to and from the Great Lakes. As such, SLSDC's work is vital to the Great Lakes region, which is responsible for nearly half of America's industrial and agricultural output. That output translates into iron ore for America's steel miles, low-sulphur coal for public utilities and Midwestern export grain for the world market. Simply put, the economic viability of the Great Lakes and the country depends on the efficient operation of the Seaway and SLSDC. Of equal importance are the environmental and safety functions performed through the Seaway. 
As you know, the administration has proposed that SLSDC be restructured as a performance-based organization [PBO]. I have endorsed this proposal as a critical and innovative step in ensuring the long-term stability of commercial shipping in the Seaway System and throughout the Great Lakes region, and am currently working with other Great Lakes' Senators to prepare the necessary authorizing legislation. 
Last year, in the transportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997, the Senate included a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that the Congress should consider such legislation in the 105th Congress. We are hopeful that the Senate will approve the PBO legislation before the end of this session, although we recognize that there's much work left to be done. 
As you know, one of the unique features of the PBO initiative is the financing mechanism, which would link SLSDC's funding level to performance--that is, the annual funding level would be calculated according to average tonnage figures through the Seaway. Thus, the PBO initiative authorizing legislation will move SLSDC financing from appropriated funds to an automatic, annual, performance-based payment. The administration's budget request reflected this distinction by not including a request for appropriated funds for SLSDC. I bring this up for discussion simply to avoid confusion as to the appropriations level included in the Senate transportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998.

Mr. KOHL. I appreciate your fair and unbiased assessment of the PBO initiative, Mr. Chairman. We have every hope of moving the authorizing legislation this session. However, as you and I both know, Congress can be unpredictable. Sometimes we advance ideas quickly, and other times, our work is frustratingly slow. For this reason, I want to reiterate our understanding that if Congress does not enact PBO authorizing legislation for SLSDC by the beginning of fiscal year 1998, the Senate will ensure in conference with the House that SLSDC will be funded.

Mr. KOHL. I understand that the FTC has proposed to weaken the standard for `Made in the U.S.A.' advertising from `all to virtually all' U.S. content to `substantially all' U.S. content. The proposal sets forth two alternative safe harbors for `Made in the U.S.A.' claims: 75 percent U.S. content--U.S. manufacturing costs represent 75 percent of the total manufacturing costs for the product and the product was last substantially transformed in the U.S. or; two level substantial transformation--The product was last substantially transformed in the United States and all significant inputs were last substantially transformed in the United States. 
I also understand that the new proposed guidelines would have the effect of allowing products made with 25 percent or more foreign labor and foreign materials to be labeled `Made in the U.S.A.' In some cases, the FTC's proposed guidelines would allow products made entirely with foreign materials and foreign components to be labeled `Made in the U.S.A.' 
The `Made in the U.S.A.' label, a time-honored symbol of American pride and craftsmanship, is an extremely valuable asset to manufacturers. Allowing this label to be applied to goods not wholly made in America will encourage companies to ship U.S. jobs overseas because they can take advantage of the cheaper labor markets while promoting their products as `Made in the U.S.A.' For products not wholly made in the U.S.A., companies already can make a truthful claim about whatever U.S. content their products have--e.g., `Made in the U.S.A. of 75 percent U.S. component parts' or `Assembled in the U.S.A. from imported and domestic parts'. However, if manufacturers seek to voluntarily promote their products as `Made in the U.S.A.' they must be honest in that promotion and only apply the `Made in the U.S.A.' label to products wholly made in the U.S.A.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the people of the Milwaukee Vet Center. For 17 years now these Wisconsinites have counseled and assisted veterans during the difficult period of readjustment from frontline to homefront. 
Fighting a war is a terrible experience, inflicting physical and psychological wounds which few veterans can fully heal on their own. The Milwaukee Vet Center has helped over 8,800 veterans of American missions in their attempts to overcome these psychological battle scars. Originally established for Vietnam veterans, its doors are now open to veterans of every major American engagement since World War II. 
This center stands as a prime example of success in our Nation's social services. A division of the Department of Veterans Affairs, it provides comprehensive and personalized counseling, not only to male and female veterans but also to their spouses and children. Although the center's responsibilities include 91,513 eligible veterans in 13 eastern Wisconsin counties, its workers strive to make personal contact with as many veterans as possible. Its outreach programs engage veterans in the context of their communities, granting a fuller knowledge of where each individual stands geographically, psychologically and socially. Working with other specialized organizations, the center provides individualized services for native American and African-American veterans, among others. 
Those who enter the Milwaukee Vet Center seeking help know they are dealing with some of America's most experienced social workers. Collectively, the center's employees possess decades of experience in the fields of drug and alcohol abuse, mental health problems, vocational rehabilitation, women's health treatment, and psychiatric treatment. They have worked in the public and private sectors, schools, hospitals, even disaster areas. 
The Vet Center provides hands-on field experience for students in local colleges and universities such as the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, the Milwaukee Area Technical College, and the Stratton Business Institute. By sharing their wealth of experience, the Vet Center's professionals enrich these students' education and more importantly guide them on the path to a fulfilling career in public service. 
I commend the heroic efforts of these public servants, and personally thank them for playing an important part in making Wisconsin great.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to address a critical need in our society, the need for affordable health care for the terminally ill. Today, in the fiscal year 1998 Treasury and general government appropriations bill, a bill which I otherwise supported, I believe we did a disservice to those suffering from the HIV virus, cancer, and other terminal diseases. We failed to authorize a pilot program which might have severely reduced the cost of essential, and at this time very expensive, drugs which significantly prolong patients' lives and enhance their quality of life. 
The Treasury and general government appropriations bill includes a repeal of section 1555 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. This so-called cooperative purchasing provision would have allowed local governments to purchase items from the schedule of prices established by the Government Services Administration [GSA] for the Federal Government. On the face of it, this provision had some appeal, as a measure that might save money for local governments. However, many argued that section 1555 would bankrupt small businesses, increase all prices in the long term, and undermine the reliability and safety provided by a local manufacturing and distribution network. The concern about section 1555 was widespread and profound and, therefore, I supported a repeal of the provision. However, I favored one exception, which would address a critical need and give us a chance to observe the effects of section 1555. I favored the authorization of a carefully defined pilot program in cooperative purchasing of drugs for terminally ill patients. 
Public hospitals in cities and counties throughout the United States are desperate to reduce the cost of health care for the terminally ill. Last year, the Nation's largest city, county, and State hospitals lost an average of $86 million per year by providing care to uninsured an underinsured patients. To avoid closure or bankruptcy, many of these institutions have to limit their more expensive services, such as the new generation of life-prolonging AIDS drugs. At the same time, many AIDS patients are deprived of adequate care because they cannot afford $15,000 per year for AIDS drug therapy. State and local programs must purchase these drugs for them. 
The Department of Health and Human Services has agreed to coordinate a pilot program which would enable State and local governments to benefit from Federal Government rates when they purchase drugs for life-threatening conditions. Recent studies suggest that this could save public hospitals more than 25 percent of their current expenditures on these essential drugs. These savings would, in turn, make it possible for hospitals to help more Americans battling against terminal illness. 
I think we all agree that the terminally ill and those who serve them deserve our support in making their medical care more affordable and available. At the same time, I am acutely aware of the concern of veterans' groups and others that this kind of program could eventually result in higher health care costs for all. Therefore, this pilot program would be narrowly focused and of finite length. I encourage concerned groups to contribute suggestions as we define those program constraints. Furthermore, I acknowledge that this pilot program may fail. If so, we will have learned from our error. If the program works, however, if it truly brings down the costs of life-prolonging and potentially life-saving drugs, could we live with ourselves if we refused to give it a chance?

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, last Thursday Senator Hatch and myself, along with Senators Leahy and Durbin, offered an amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill that would delink Federal judicial pay raises from those of the Congress and senior level executive branch officials. Our amendment, which was accepted without objection, will allow judges' salaries to be adjusted automatically on an annual basis. I am pleased that it is part of the measure that will pass the Senate today. 
For too many years, Congress has refused to take the political heat for accepting pay raises, and held judicial salaries hostage in the process. This congressional scheme of hiding behind judicial robes has created a tremendous financial gulf between Federal judges and the lawyers who come before them. The likelihood that this salary gap will only get worse is driving some of our best jurists from the Federal bench and making it increasingly difficult to attract top-quality replacements. Such a talent drain threatens the quality of American justice at a time when our already overburdened courts need our best and most experienced legal minds. 
The numbers offer their own warning. Between 1960 and 1970, only three Federal judges resigned. But since 1980 more than 50 judges have left the bench early, many citing inadequate compensation as the reason. Indeed, a study several years ago by the American Bar Association estimated that more than one-fourth of the Nation's Federal judges may quit their jobs. 
While this exodus grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract the best and the brightest to Federal judicial service. Judicial candidates can clearly see the ink fading on their checkbooks. Many say they want to serve the public, but they just can't afford it. 
The solution to this problem is simple, and by delinking judicial pay raises, the Senate today takes an important step toward ensuring that this situation will not be repeated. I am hopeful and optimistic that we can retain this provision when we conference the measure with the House. 
Mr. President, we in Congress have taken the opportunity to show our commitment to fairness. We have recognized the mistake Congress made 20 years ago when it tied its own salary increases to those of Federal judges. This backdoor way of securing congressional pay raises hasn't worked. But by this amendment we have freed the hostages, the Nation's Federal judges, and helped to ensure the continued high quality of America's judicial system.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we have accepted amendment No. 940, but I do want to mention that we may need to fine-tune it in conference. The reason is that, as currently drafted, the proposal is somewhat ambiguous. And for that reason, the Justice Department has told us that it has serious concerns about the amendment. 
Now, I read the language to apply prospectively; that is, to people who are subsequently convicted of a crime--but not to those employees who were convicted years ago--or at any time prior to when this proposal becomes law. And I also believe that parts (a)(1) and (a)(2) should be read conjunctively; that is, to apply to government employees who are convicted of drug-related bribery--but not to employees who are convicted of either bribery or drug-related crimes alone. 
We have talked to Senator Coverdell's staff and they are willing to work on the language of the amendment to make this clear and I am optimistic that we can write it to everybody's satisfaction in conference.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. 
As the distinguished Senator from Colorado has just indicated, we are bringing to the floor recommendations on the fiscal year 1998 appropriations level for the Treasury, general Government agencies. 
First, I thank Senator Campbell for his dedicated work on this bill. He has worked long and hard on the difficult issues that he has just outlined for our colleagues. As a result of his efforts, I believe the committee has developed a balanced approach for dealing with the many programs and activities under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee, while staying within the budget allocation. 
Since this budget allocation was $489 million below the administration's request, we have been required to make some substantial reductions. However, the subcommittee actions have resulted in a bill that is both fiscally responsible and I also believe very reasonable. 
Senator Campbell has discussed the major funding highlights, and rather than repeating those highlights, I will limit my comments to a few areas that I would like to emphasize. 
First, the funding provided for IRS activities. Tax processing, tax law enforcement and information systems is at the President's request. Additionally, $325 million has been provided for an information technology fund. While we continue to have concerns over the IRS modernization efforts, we believe that it is important to provide the IRS with the tools necessary to collect taxes owed. By providing full funding, we can be assured that the critical century date change and data center consolidation occur in a timely manner and allow the IRS to continue smooth operations into the year 2000. 
Second, the national media campaign proposed by the Office of National Drug Control Policy is not fully funded. I fully support, of course, the efforts to combat the drug problem in this country, and I support the efforts in leadership of Gen. Barry McCaffrey, but I am reluctant to provide billions of dollars for an untried and untested media program. So I supported funding at a smaller pilot program level, which would provide the administration and Congress with the evidence of the success that is necessary when we are committing such huge taxpayer dollars. 
However, Senator Campbell and I have come to a compromise position: funding the national media program for 1 year at $110 million, after which the program will be evaluated. 
We are also providing over $35 million for community-oriented drug prevention programs, such as a drug-free prison zone program and the initiation of the Drug Free Communities Act grants. 
Finally, I want to highlight that no funds are provided for the General Services Administration's Construction and Acquisition Program. The Federal buildings fund is experiencing a shortfall in revenue resulting from GSA miscalculating rent income and miscalculating construction completion dates. While I am concerned over the financial situation generating this shortfall, I believe it provides a good opportunity to review the principles applied to the Courthouse Construction Program. As a result, the report accompanying the bill contains criteria that the General Services Administration and the Administrative Office of the Courts must apply to future courthouse construction projects. 
According to these criteria, projects included in future requests must: 
One, meet the design guide standards for construction; 
Two, reflect the priorities of the Judicial Conference of the United States; 
Three, be included in the approved 5-year construction plan; 
And four, must be accompanied by a standardized courtroom utilization study. 
It is hoped that the application of these criteria will result in a well-justified Courthouse Construction Program in the future. 
Mr. President, that concludes my highlights of the bill's funding levels. We believe we have provided the best funding levels possible under the funding restrictions. 
Before I yield the floor, I also want to acknowledge the fine work done by the staff on this bill: 
Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, Lula Edwards, Frank Larkin, and Barbara Retzlaff, and others. I thank them for all their hard work in helping to bring this bill before the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, let me make a few brief points. First, it is kind of ironic that Joel Klein's nomination has nearly universal Republican support, but has divided many Democrats. After all, he is the President's choice for the job and any Presidential nominee for an executive branch appointment--Democrat or Republican--deserves the benefit of the doubt. More than that, Mr. Klein has the support of many prominent Democrats, among them Judge Abner Mikva, Former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, Lloyd Cutler, and others. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from them--and from prominent Republicans--in support of Joel Klein be printed in the Record.

Mr. KOHL. Second, while it is unfortunate that Eric Holder is being held `hostage' to Joel Klein's nomination, the truth is that the sooner we confirm Mr. Klein, the sooner we can move forward and confirm Eric Holder. The Department of Justice, and the American people, will be better off with a confirmed Deputy Attorney General. 
Third, I respect the efforts of my colleagues, Senator Hollings, Senator Dorgan and Senator Kerrey, who have fought long and hard for consumers on telecommunications matters. Like me, they clearly want someone in charge of the Antitrust Division who will bring about the kind of competition promised in--but not yet delivered by--the Telecommunications Act. They have sent a strong message to Joel Klein on how to interpret Section 271 of the Act, and I believe he understands that message and will work hard to promote vigorous competition in the telephone industry--and all other industries. 
My hope is that Joel Klein, as a confirmed appointee, will surprise his critics and please his supporters in his enforcement of the antitrust laws. I urge my colleagues to support him.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as the ranking Democrat on the Antitrust Subcommittee, let me tell you why I support Mr. Klein's nomination, why he is a good choice for the job, and why we ought to confirm him today. 
First, Joel Klein is an accomplished lawyer with a distinguished career. He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, and clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals here in Washington, then for Justice Powell. Just as importantly, he is the President's choice to head the Antitrust Division, and I believe that any President--Democrat or Republican--is entitled to a strong presumption in favor of his executive branch nominees. 
Second, Joel Klein is a pragmatist, not an idealogue. His answers at his confirmation hearing suggest that he is not antibusiness, as some would claim the Antitrust Division was in the late 1970's, nor anticonsumer, as some argue the Division was during the 1980's. Instead, he will plot a middle course, I believe, that promotes free markets, fair competition, and consumer welfare. 
The third reason we should confirm Joel Klein is because no one deserves to linger in this type of legislative limbo. Here in Congress, we need the input of a confirmed head of the Antitrust Division to give us the administration's views on a variety of important policy matters--defense consolidation, electricity deregulation, and telecommunications mergers, among others. We need someone who can speak with authority for the Division without a cloud hanging over his head. 
More than that, without a confirmed leader, morale at the Antitrust Division is suffering. And given the pace at which the President has nominated and the Senate has confirmed appointees, if we fail to approve Mr. Klein, it will be at least a year before we confirm a replacement--maybe longer, and maybe never. So we need to act now; we can't afford to let the Antitrust Division continue to drift. 
Finally, Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from South Carolina--as well as the Senators from Nebraska and North Dakota. They have been forceful advocates for consumers on telecommunications matters, and I have stood side by side with them in that fight. But we ought to give Mr. Klein our vote today, so he can have the chance to succeed or fail as a confirmed appointee. My hope and expectation is that in a few years--when we look back at Joel Klein's service as head of the Antitrust Division --his accomplishments will surprise his critics, please his supporters, and improve what is already the best free market economy in the world.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes about the importance of this bill and the profound responsibility which we have in determining our Nation's defense budget. 
I am a cosponsor of a tactical fighter amendment which will be proposed later today by my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin. Senator Feingold's amendment, which calls upon the Department of Defense to focus on strategic needs rather than special interests, represents an intelligent and responsible approach to protecting the security of our Nation. It is only the first step in what should be a revolution in our thinking about defense planning and spending. 
Mr. President, some people believe that the revolution in military affairs is only a technological revolution: developing cutting-edge technology to preserve our military dominance into the future. In order to be successful, however, a revolution must impact strategy as well as technology. 
While we, as a country, lead the world in defense technology, we are not making similar progress in our thinking about defense. While our technologies may be sleek, our defense complex is not. As a result, we spend far more than we need to in order to remain the world's superpower. 
Many people say that we can't cut corners when it comes to national security. I agree. But that doesn't mean that we can't cut costs. In recent weeks we have stood on this floor and cut costs in Medicare and debated all too limited funding for education. Are we saying that we can we afford to cut corners with our children? Our parents? Of course not. We are saying that we have to cut costs--not corners. 
I think we all want the same thing: to do the best for our country. And that means protecting our children, our parents, and the security of our Nation. It also means making wise financial decisions regarding all of our priorities. Without a sound economy, our children, our parents, and the security of our country are at risk. 
Mr. President, I think we can be proud of what Congress has done this year in support of a balanced budget. Still, within that balanced budget we are not doing enough to challenge old-style thinking. In particular, I want to draw our attention to the fact that, when every other spending area is up for debate and in most cases adjusting to budget cuts, the defense budget seems to be untouchable. 
In fact, both the Senate and the House plan to give the Administration $2.6 billion more than it requested for defense spending. Why? 
Mr. President, it is impossible to have rational debate about defense spending issues because there is a majority in this body that hears the words `cut defense' and then does not listen to anything else. 
Now, I realize that we have a bipartisan budget agreement this year--an agreement that takes us toward a balanced budget. Out of respect for that hard won compromise, I will not introduce any amendments to cut defense spending at this time. However, I urge us, as a Congress and as a Nation, to set aside our special interests and old-style thinking, and to look at defense spending just as we approach every other issue of importance to our Nation's future. 
Let's not give the military things they don't need and, in some cases, haven't asked for. And let's be realistic and smart about what it takes to defend our national interests. 
Do we really need 18 Trident submarines? If we retired just two of the older Tridents, we would still have the most powerful submarine fleet in the world--by far. 
Similarly, there is an honest debate among experts about the ideal number of aircraft carriers. Many believe that we could hold the fleet down to 10 carriers and have more than enough to defend our global interests. Either of these plans would save billions of dollars over the next few years. Why isn't this debate going on in the Senate? 
I could tell you that, if we gave up those Tridents or carriers, we could fund education or prevent crime or reduce the deficit. That's true. And all of those initiatives could use more funding. But that is not the only argument I want to make today. Yes, I believe we should spend more on kids. But even if we already had every dollar we needed for education, we still should spend our defense dollars wisely. I do not believe that we are doing that today. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in an honest debate about our defense needs. If we don't start examining the defense budget more closely, it will remain a sacred cow to which we are beholden rather than a tool which we use to further the best interests of our country.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss today's Brady law decision, in which a deeply divided Supreme Court put judicial activism over public safety. At a time when the United States leads the world in gun carnage, surely the Federal Government is entitled to enlist the aid of States to keep guns out of the hands of felons, illegal immigrants, and the criminally insane. Asking local police to conduct background checks--and nothing more--hardly amounts to a Federal power grab, as the majority has claimed. Instead, the majority's opinion should make us fear what the Supreme Court could do next. 
Will the Court prohibit Congress from requiring States to report missing children? Will it bar Congress from requiring states to get lead out of school drinking water? Will it stop Congress from requiring States to publicly disclose where hazardous waste is being stored? 
All of these requirements are now current law, and all of them are now in peril. 
We will have to consider these troubling issues in the future. But as for today, this decision alone is hardly a fatal blow to the Brady law itself. Since its enactment, Brady background checks have stopped over 186,000 persons from obtaining guns. And these Brady checks will continue for two reasons. First, virtually all of the police officers we have spoken to say they will continue to do the Brady check voluntarily--even if they are not required to do so. The reason why is simple: they know these checks save lives. Second, the provision struck down by the Court only relates to the so-called interim Brady law. By the end of next year, Brady requires that a permanent instant check system be implemented. And that system, operated by Federal officials, will be immune from constitutional challenge. 
Still, the Supreme Court's misguided decision opens up the possibility that, before the instant check system becomes fully operational, a handful of rogue police officers will refuse to do background checks. As a result of such inaction, at least a few felons will commit violent crimes with guns they never should have been able to obtain. 
For this reason, we are working with the President to draft legislation that will ensure 100 percent Brady compliance--for example, by allowing gun dealers to obtain background checks from any police chief in their State, not just the chief in the jurisdiction where the buyer resides. Because the vast majority of police will continue to conduct Brady checks voluntarily, this approach will clearly preserve our no check, no sale policy. 
Mr. President, today's Supreme Court ruling, while unfortunate, does not take away from how effective the Brady law has been or will be. But it is nevertheless a bad decision that will hurt us in our fight against crime. We'll introduce bipartisan legislation to fix it, and I hope my colleagues will support our efforts.

Mr. KOHL. Thank you. 
Mr. President, I also am a supporter of this amendment. What it simply says is that we are going to do what we set out to do, which is to balance the budget, and, if we go over it in any year, then we are going to have to decide how we are going to reduce that spending to be sure we stay on target to get the budget balanced over the next several years. That is all this does. It is not a sequester. Nobody should fear that. But it is simply an enforcement mechanism which is necessary.

Mr. KOHL. This amendment provides a tax incentive for companies that provide quality child care for the children of their employees. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Hatch, Daschle, DeWine, Boxer, D'Amato, Specter, Snowe, Johnson, Abraham, Moseley-Braun, and Murray. This amendment creates a tax credit limited to 50 percent of $150,000 per company per year for 3 years for those companies that invest in quality child care on or near site. The credit is offset by authorizing the antifraud program that will keep parents who do not have custody of their children from unlawfully claiming child-related tax benefits. 
We know child care is an investment that is good for children, good for business, good for States and good for our Nation. We need to involve every level of government and private communities and private businesses in building a quality child care system for our youngest that is the best in the world. This amendment is the first essential and deficit-neutral step toward that end. 
I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, tomorrow I will up amendment No. 524 which I believe is at the desk. This amendment creates a tax incentive for companies that provide child care for the dependents of their employees. The amendment is also cosponsored by Senators Daschle, DeWine, Boxer, D'Amato, Moseley-Braun, Snowe, Specter, and Johnson. 
Our amendment creates a tax credit for employers who get involved in increasing the supply of quality child care. The credit is limited to 50 percent of $150,000 per company per year. 
The amendment is based on S. 82, the Child Care Infrastructure Act, which has received praise from businesses, parents, and day care workers alike. Working Mother magazine gave the initiative its `Lollipops' award in the January issue, and the Children's Defense Fund has endorsed it. S. 82 is also endorsed by the National Center for the Early Childhood Work Force and the National Child Care Association. 
The amendment responds to a great need, a great challenge, and a great opportunity. The need is to provide a safe and stimulating place for our youngest children to spend their time while their parents are at work. The challenge is to make the American workplace more productive by making it more responsive to the needs of the American family. And the opportunity is to take what we are learning about the importance of early childhood education and use it to help our children become the best educated adults of the 21st century. 
The credit is offset by authorizing an anti-fraud program that will keep parents who do not have custody of their children from unlawfully claiming child-related tax benefits. 
Child care is an investment that is good for children, good for business, good for our States, and good for the Nation. We need to involve every level of government--and private communities and private businesses--in building a child care infrastructure that is the best in the world. Our amendment is a first, essential and deficit neutral step toward that end, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the retirement of Mrs. Jimmie Johnson. Mrs. Johnson retires after 36 years of dedicated service to Milwaukee Public Schools. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge her hard work and commitment to the students of Milwaukee. 
Throughout her 36 years as an education professional, she has earned the respect and admiration of her students and colleagues by upholding educational standards, while maintaining a loving and caring relationship with all who encountered her. She is known to her coworkers and students as a counselor, a problem solver, and consummate friend. 
As socioeconomic and family issues changed over the years for the students within the school system, she maintained the same love for making a difference. Her dedication shines through in her desire to feed, clothe, and counsel her students. 
Her commitment to education transcended the school system, as she taught Sunday school faithfully for more than 25 years. She also taught vacation Bible school out of her home to the children in her neighborhood. This same commitment is also exemplified by her ability to obtain a masters degree in education, while working fulltime and raising a family. 
A success not only in the classroom, but in her personal life as well--Mrs. Johnson is a devout Christian who lends her time to the development of other Christians. She is also the faithful wife to Oscar Sr., a world class mother to Oscar Jr. and Derrick, and a loving grandmother to Janae and Dilona. Throughout the process of fulfilling these responsibilities, she has managed to balance her professional career with her family life. Her kind spirit has made her the unofficial adopted mother of countless peers, acquaintances and extended family members. 
Mrs. Jimmie Ruth Johnson has left a mark on the countless students that she has taught and deserves this recognition. She has played an integral part of the development of excellence through educating the city of Milwaukee's youth with optimism, patience and love.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address the serious problem within our campaign finance system. I have made similar remarks earlier this year, so I will not belabor the problems again. 
The American public is demanding that Congress reform our campaign finance system, and many doubt whether we are ready or even able to meet that demand. I am support S. 25, introduced by Senators McCain and Feingold. This bipartisan legislation is the best bill moving through the Congress to reform our campaign system. However, there are signs that Congress may not pass this legislation. 
Therefore, if, and only if S. 25 is not passed, I think the 105th Congress must put in place a process for reforming the campaign finance system. The legislation I introduce today for myself and Mr. Brownback of Kansas would establish an independent, bipartisan commission to reform our campaign finance laws. Earlier this year I introduced similar legislation, also as a fall-back measure if S. 25 is not passed. 
This measure, like the bill I introduced earlier this year, establishes a commission similar to the Base Closure and Realignment Commission. The Commission would have a limited time to make recommendations, Congress would be forced to vote up or down on their proposals, and would not have the power to amend the legislation. 
Mr. President, I sincerely hope that Congress does not have to turn over this matter to an independent commission. But, if we do not pass meaningful campaign finance reform this year, I believe it is the next best alternative. And, if we do create a campaign finance reform commission, it must be a real commission, with real powers, and not another advisory committee. 
Congress has created many panels in the past to make recommendations about reforming campaign finance laws. But, for reform to genuinely take place, we must empower the Commission with the ability to create a package of reforms that Congress cannot change. Like the successful Base Closure and Realignment Commission, Congress should have only the power to vote up or down on the recommendations. 
Mr. President, we should not allow another Congress to come and go without passing meaningful campaign finance reform. Let this be the year that Congress responds to cry from the grassroots and restore America's faith in our election system.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Reverend Dennis E. Ellisen for his wonderful invocation this morning. Reverend Ellisen is the Pastor of Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Appleton, WI. Reverend Ellisen has led the congregation there, which has now swelled to more than 1,600 people, for the past 21 years. 
The people of Appleton have been fortunate to have such a compassionate and a strong spiritual leader. During his time there, Reverend Ellisen has made a profound impact on his community and upon his congregation. As a member of the Goodwill Board of Directors, he helps direct efforts to help the neediest in our State. 
Perhaps his most significant impact has been in starting the first hospice program in the area. As president of the Visiting Nurses Association, Reverend Ellisen created the first hospice program for Appleton. This courageous and humanitarian effort brings care and companionship to the terminally ill. Without Reverend Ellisen's guidance and leadership, that corner of my State would be less special and a lot of people's lives in Appleton would be less bright. 
I thank the Reverend Ellisen for his prayers and words of encouragement today and congratulate him on his years of achievement for the people of Wisconsin. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty [CTBT]. Along with many of my colleagues, I call upon the Senate to ratify this important treaty which will help to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, improve the environment in which we live, save billions of dollars, and enhance the security of our Nation. 
The CTBT prohibits all nuclear test explosions worldwide. The treaty establishes an international agency to coordinate nuclear policy and verify test ban compliance through an International Monitoring System, onsite inspections, consultation and clarification, and confidence-building measures. The treaty is quite simple, really, and it is something that Americans have wanted for a long time. 
`The conclusion of such a treaty * * * would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the great hazards which man faces * * * the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security; it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards.' 
Those words, so appropriate today, were spoken 34 years ago by President John F. Kennedy, in an historic speech at American University. In that speech, the President announced the beginning of high-level discussions among the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the United Kingdom regarding `a comprehensive test ban treaty.' Even then, long before the demise of the Soviet Union rendered the United States the sole remaining superpower, President Kennedy and many others recognized the dangers inherent in nuclear testing, and the many benefits of a test ban. 
A test ban will curb the spread of nuclear weapons, helping to keep them out of the hands of rogue states and terrorists. A test ban will mean that children do not have to grow up in areas contaminated by nuclear explosions. A test ban will mean that money spent on maintaining test sites and running tests--hundreds of millions of dollars a year in the United States alone--could be spent on education, health, and other priorities of the American people. In short, a nuclear test ban will enhance the military, political, and economic security of our Nation. That's why President Clinton has signed and 158 countries in the United Nations have endorsed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That is also why 80 percent of Americans are calling upon us to ratify it. 
When President Kennedy began test ban negotiations 34 years ago, he was realistic about the challenges in negotiating with the Soviet Union. He said, `Our hopes must be tempered with the caution of history, but with our hopes go the hopes of all mankind.' Today, Mr. President, history and hope are on our side. Now is the time to conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Now is our chance to fulfill the hopes of all mankind.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I am one of this body's strongest advocates for deficit reduction. I attribute much of my deep commitment to this goal to my days in business. As a businessman, I learned that you must balance your books and live within your means. I also learned that you must treat people fairly and admit when you have made a mistake. I have come to the floor to acknowledge that a mistake has been made, and must be corrected. 
In August 1993 we passed the omnibus budget reconciliation bill. I am proud to say that this legislation has helped to produce falling deficits and sustained economic growth. However, in our efforts to get our fiscal house in order we unfairly penalized a group of hard working, middle-class Americans: transportation workers. It is for this reason that I rise today, to reintroduce the business meal deduction fairness bill. This measure would increase the deductibility of business meals, from 50 to 80 percent, for individuals who are required to eat away from home due to the nature of their work. 
In the 1993 reconciliation bill was a provision which lowered the deductible portion of business meals and entertainment expenses from 80 to 50 percent. The change was aimed at the so-called three martini lunches and extravagant entertainment expenses of Wall Street financiers and Hollywood movie moguls. Unfortunately, the change also hit the average truck driver who eats chicken fried steak, hot roast beef sandwiches, and meatloaf in truck stops. And while those who entertain for business purposes can change their practices based on the tax law change, long-haul transportation workers often have no choice but to eat on the road. 
For these workers, the 1993 decrease in the meal deduction has translated into an undeserved decrease in take home pay. For example, when the allowable deduction was dropped in 1993, it increased taxes on an average truck driver $700 to $2,000 per year. This is a huge increase for a truck driver who normally earns $27,000 to $35,000 per year. 
Our legislation would increase the take-home pay of hard working, middle-class Americans who were inadvertently hurt by changes in the tax law in 1993. Workers who, due to regulations limiting travel hours, must eat out. They have no control over the length of their trips, the amount of time they must rest during a delivery, or, in many cases, the places they can stop and eat. This legislation is straight forward. It would simply restore the business meal expense deduction to 80 per cent for individuals subject to the Department of Transportation's hours-of-service limitations.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important issue before the Senate--campaign finance reform. First, let me state that I am a cosponsor of S. 25, Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold's Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1997. I cosponsored S. 25 because I feel it is the best legislation moving through the Congress to reform our campaign finance system. My Wisconsin colleague, Senator Feingold and Senator McCain deserve our gratitude and praise for keeping this issue alive. It's been nearly 20 years since Congress enacted meaningful campaign finance reform, and they have come closer than anyone at passing a bipartisan plan. 
We are at a crossroads in this debate. America's campaign finance laws have not been significantly altered since the 1970's. Since that time we've seen an explosion in the costs of running campaigns and a growing public perception that special interests are far too influential in the electoral process. The last election cycle saw the problems in our system grow to new proportions, and we are now witnessing two congressional investigations and a Justice Department investigation into alleged illegalities and improprieties. Despite these widely agreed-upon problems, Congress and the President seem incapable of enacting a campaign finance reform bill. 
We have seen initiatives by Democratic and Republican Presidents. Democratic and Republican Congresses, even widely hailed bipartisan approaches all fail. One can easily conclude that this issue is so mired in partisan politics, trapped in a quagmire of self-interest and special interest, that Congress will not be able to craft a comprehensive reform bill. S. 25 is the best legislation to be proposed in two decades, and yet, when we voted on the measure in the last Congress, we could not get 60 Senators to support it, and the House of Representatives leadership wouldn't even bring it up for a vote. 
Mr. President, I am very concerned that this important piece of legislation may face the same fate this year. I support S. 25, and will continue to strongly support it until we have a clear vote on the measure this year. However, I do not believe it would be in the country's best interest to let another campaign cycle go by without the Congress taking clear action to reform our campaign finance system. 
Therefore, I am introducing today the Campaign Finance Reform Commission Act of 1997. Let me be clear from the outset: I would prefer to pass a bill such as S. 25, and I desperately hope that we do. But, in the case that we do not, Congress needs to be ready with legislation that moves us toward a better system. 
The Campaign Finance Reform Commission is modeled on the successful Base Realignment and Closure Commissions. The legislation would establish a balanced, bipartisan commission, appointed by Senate leaders, House leaders, and the President to propose comprehensive campaign finance reform. Like the BRAC Commissions, the proposals of the Campaign Finance Reform Commission would be subject to congressional approval or disapproval, but no amendments would be permitted. The Commission would have a limited duration--1 year after its creation. And Congress would have a limited time to consider the Commission's proposals. 
Mr. President, there are many who will object to this plan and argue that, through the creation of a commission, the Congress is conceding that it cannot solve this problem on its own. To the contrary, the creation of a Campaign Finance Reform Commission would be a concrete sign to the American public that Congress is serious about reforming our election laws. We have seen the success of the BRAC Commissions in removing political influences from the decision-making process. This same formula could be used for our campaign finance reform laws. 
When Congress enacted the first BRAC Commission law, it was argued that a nonpartisan commission was required because the closure of military bases was so politically sensitive, Congress could not be expected to make the tough choices of closing bases. Well, Mr. President, if closing military bases is considered tough, altering the campaign laws that literally determine whether Members could retain their jobs must be just as politically sensitive, if not more so. 
Again, I wish to praise the efforts of Senators Feingold, McCain, and the broad coalition of grassroots organizations which have kept the campaign finance issue in front of the American public and the Congress. I hope that they succeed in their efforts with their bill and we can present the American public with a new campaign system before the 1998 election. I offer this bill today only as an alternative to be considered, if, and only if, we cannot pass S. 25 this year. 
Mr. President, like all commonsense ideas, the idea of a Campaign Finance Reform Commission did not spring from a text book but came from a simpler setting. Two years ago President Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich held an historic conversation at a New Hampshire meeting. The first question came from a retiree, Mr. Frank McConnell, Jr. Mr. McConnell had a simple, commonsense idea--form a commission like the one that closed the military bases to reform our election system, so, in Mr. McConnell's words, `it would be out of the political scene.' The time for Mr. McConnell's idea has come. 
I am pleased to put Mr. McConnell's idea into legislative form. If S. 25 fails this year, this Commission could give us the reform we all demand. And, it would give the American public a restored faith that their democratic institutions have responded to their cry for change in our electoral system.

Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. President, I rise today as a supporter of this budget and as a cosponsor of the Kerry amendment. 
This budget deserves the support of the Senate for several reasons. It is bipartisan and it is centrist. It funds priorities like education and child health that transcend party lines. It includes reasonable tax relief targeted toward families and economic growth. It balances the budget by the year 2002 and it produces surpluses to reduce the debt in the years after that. 
This good deal will be made better by adopting the Kerry amendment which makes clear the Senate's commitment to very young children. A compelling amount of research on the brain has confirmed what scientists have long talked about for years, that the most significant period in a child's development is between the years of zero to 3. Unfortunately, the Federal commitment to early childhood education has not caught up with our understanding of how important the first 3 years of life are. Early education and child care receive fewer resources for teacher training, salary, and even respect than the rest of the education system. 
According to data compiled by the Rand Corp., while 90 percent of human brain growth occurs by the age of 3, public spending on children in that age range equals only 8 percent of spending on all children. 
And so, Mr. President, we are clearly missing a unique opportunity. A look at the current Department of Education budget shows the stark funding disparity against early childhood education. Of $29.4 billion in current estimated education expenditures, only $1.5 billion or 5 percent is spent on children from birth to age 5. A new commitment to quality child care is a necessary response to the fact that children between the ages of zero and 3 are spending more time in care away from their homes. Almost 60 percent of women in the work force have children under the age of 3 requiring care. Many of these working families will not be able to find quality child care for their young children. And while Federal, State, and local governments have helped build a strong education system for 5- to 25-year-olds, care and education for zero to 5-year-olds is largely unstructured, undervalued, and scarce. Resolving this inequity will require solutions through the public and private sector. 
I proposed legislation to encourage the private sector to invest in child care for their employees through a new tax credit. I intend to work with Senator Hatch who is the primary cosponsor of my bill to see to it that this important child care incentive is included in the overall tax provisions of the budget. 
The amendment before us now would give us the opportunity under this budget to enhance innovative early childhood programs focused on the educational needs of children in the zero to 3 age group. This initiative does not earmark a specific amount of money. It does not create any new bureaucracy and it does not threaten this budget. So, Mr. President, a solid and sensible commitment to early childhood education specifically focused on children from zero to age 3 is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield the floor.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I support the Hatch-Kennedy Child Health Insurance bill, but I reluctantly must oppose their budget amendment. 
I am pleased that the President has secured over $16 billion to address the serious problem of children who lack health insurance coverage in this Nation. I believe that the funding allotted under the budget resolution for child health can and should be applied for the Hatch-Kennedy child health bill. 
Mr. President, as a member of the Senate centrist budget group, I realize how difficult it can be to work across party lines to craft a budget plan. I was pleased to be a member of the Chafee-Breaux centrist group that crafted a fair and balanced budget plan. The budget plan that the centrists put together again this year is very similar to the bipartisan budget resolution we are considering today. I support this budget resolution and am concerned that the Hatch-Kennedy amendment would put the entire budget plan in doubt. 
Although I will vote against this amendment, I believe we must enact legislation this Congress that expands health insurance coverage for children. The Hatch-Kennedy Child Health Insurance and Lower Deficit Act is at the forefront of the proposals that Congress should pursue. 
The growing problem of children who lack health coverage is extremely troubling. A recent study drawn from U.S. Census Bureau data show that during 1995-96, there were 23 million children who did not have health insurance for all or part of the period. Surprisingly, 9 out 10 of these children lived in households where one or both parents worked. Although Wisconsin has the second best rate of insurance for our children, 23 percent, or over 330,000 kids were uninsured for at least 1 month over the 2-year period. This situation is unacceptable. 
Helping families obtain health insurance coverage for their children is the next logical step to build on the success of the recent Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It is an effort that is long overdue. The Hatch-Kennedy bill should serve as the model for the plan crafted during the remaining budget process and I will support Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy in their efforts. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise as a supporter of this budget and as a sponsor of the Brownback-Kohl enforcement amendment. This budget deserves the support of the Senate for several reasons. 
It is bipartisan and centrist. It finds priorities--like education and child health--that transcend party lines. It includes reasonable tax relief targeted toward families and economic growth. It balances the budget by the year 2002, and it produces surpluses to reduce the debt in the years after that. 
In this budget, the Congress and the administration have found a way to do what the American people have long asked us to do: Balance the budget in a balanced manner--grow the economy without growing income inequality--strengthen the country by strengthening the working family. 
The amendment I offer today with my colleague from Kansas makes this very good budget stronger. It calls on the Budget Committee to report enforcement legislation that will lock in the deficit targets in the agreement. 
While there are some enforcement provisions in the budget deal, we don't think they go far enough. Our amendment calls for enforceable caps on all parts of the budget--entitlements, discretionary spending, and tax expenditures. It requires windfall savings from a good economy or lower than anticipated spending to be locked in to deficit reduction. And it calls for reform in emergency spending procedures so that Congress cannot use true disasters as an excuse for off-budget spending on favorite programs. 
Again, said. Out amendment does not change the budget deal. It strengthens it. It guarantees that the balanced budget becomes a reality. And it will assure the American people that we are serious about reaching balance by 2002. 
It is important that we make that assurance. This budget is open to criticism because it increases the deficit from $67 to $90 billion in 1998 and 1999 before bringing it to 0 in 2002. All of the deficit reduction in this agreement occurs after the turn of the century. 
We simply are not credible if we promise to cut the deficit a couple of years down the road. People have heard that from Congress for too long. I urge my colleagues to support this budget--and more. I urge them to commit to it by agreeing on strong enforcement procedures that will guarantee the deficit reduction we promise. I urge my colleagues to support the Brownback-Kohl amendment.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-author of this important legislation, which Senator Jeffords and I, and many others, introduce today on behalf of all of our nation's farmers. 
Let me begin by thanking my colleague from Vermont for his help and leadership on this issue. The economic health of our agricultural economy is paramount to both of our regions, and to the country at large. And tax provisions related to agriculture, whether it be the earned income credit [EIC] or other provisions, have repercussions throughout our agricultural economy. In the two regions that Senator Jeffords and I represent, dairy farming is of particular importance. And it is with our dairy farmers in mind that we feel an urgency in introducing this legislation. Because while the tax policy change that we are seeking to undo affects many livestock producers, it is the dairy farmers who are the hardest hit. 
Mr. President, our legislation will clarify that the sale of livestock should not be treated as capital gain net income for purposes of the EIC. As you may know, in last year's welfare bill, we took steps to tighten eligibility to the EIC, a refundable tax credit available only to lower income, working Americans. We did so to ensure further that, in a time of limited Federal resources, the EIC was benefiting those that it was intended to benefit--the working poor--those who have jobs but who often need extra help to avoid turning to public assistance. For many facing tough financial times and struggling to support their families, the EIC has been the difference between hard work and a hand out, between self-worth and self-doubt. And for many dairy farmers in Wisconsin, the EIC has helped pay seed bills and farm operating expenses and put food on kitchen tables. 
One of several EIC provisions approved by Congress last year expanded the category of disqualified income to include capital gain net income. As such, under current law, if a taxpayer reports more than $2,200 in capital gain net income, he or she is automatically disqualified from collecting the EIC. 
On its face, this tax policy adjustment seems reasonable. Most policymakers would agree that an individual who realizes substantial capital gain income from the sale of capital assets in any given year should not be 
eligible for a tax credit for the working poor. The House Committee report confirms as much. 
That said, however, we are here today because a subsequent IRS interpretation of that adjustment has restricted EIC eligibility in such a way that we believe goes far beyond congressional intent--distorting the purpose of last year's reforms and denying the credit to a population of hard working Americans that the EIC was designed to help--small- and mid-sized family farmers. 
Specifically, the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] has interpreted capital gain income to include income generated by the sale of culled cows for purposes of the EIC. Further, the IRS argues that dairy cows represent the type of assets Congress would expect a taxpayer to sell to cover living expenses in lieu of claiming the credit. 
Mr. President, though I do not question their good intentions, I believe the IRS is misguided. 
As you may know, farmers sell cows no longer suited for dairy farming as a matter of course. It is a standard part of a farmer's business. And in times of low prices or economic stress, it can play an even more important role when some farmers are driven to cull cows more quickly than they otherwise would. In addition, the Tax Code defines dairy cattle held by a taxpayer for a certain period of time as property used in a trade or business, specifying that such property is excluded from the definition of capital assets. Since dairy cattle are not capital assets, it follows that sales of cattle should not give rise to capital gain income for EIC purposes. 
For our Nation's dairy farmers, this unfair policy change has come at a particularly cruel time, when milk prices have declined precipitously, and many have been forced to cull cows to make ends meet. Yet instead of stretching the family budget, they learn that their actions have actually resulted in thousands of dollars in extra taxes, leaving them worse off than before. 
The consequences for my home State have been devastating. In a sample of cases from a seven-county area in the eastern part of the State, the average loss of Federal and State EIC benefits to farmers has been $2,111 per family. And these are families with between one and seven children. The total loss to the approximately 12,000 Wisconsin dairy farms eligible for the EIC is estimated at $15.5 million. 
Denying the EIC to family farmers on the basis of culled cows sales is wrong. It is wrong, unfair, and Congress should act swiftly to correct it. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation of national significance and help ensure the EIC continues to benefit those for whom Congress intended.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, yesterday Mr. Leahy and several of my colleagues spoke about judicial confirmations. Let me make a few additional points. First, we are experiencing a record slowdown in confirming judges. Last year, only 17 Federal judges were confirmed, and not a single judge for a court of appeals. This year, the process has gotten even worse--only two judges have been confirmed, and the year is almost half over. Indeed, at our current pace, with only 5 judges likely to be confirmed a year, and an average of more than 50 retiring, we would have no federal judges at all in 20 years. Literally, an empty bench. 
Second, we need these judges, both to prosecute and sentence violent criminals and to prevent more backlogs in civil cases. This is about justice--it shouldn't be about politics. Don't take my word on this, ask Chief Justice Rehnquist. He says `filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice.' Chief Justice Rehnquist is right. 
Or ask Judge George Kazen from the Southern District of Texas. He is the subject of a front page article in today's Washington Post with the headline `Cases Pile Up as Judgeships Remain Vacant.' He is hearing a dramatic increase in criminal cases now because we're cracking down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling in his border district. He desperately wants and needs help. But we haven't helped. Instead, the Senate has held up a nominee for his district for almost 2 years. I ask unanimous consent to print this article in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments. 
The bill before us today serves as a shining example of what Congress and the administration can do when working together in a bipartisan basis to address the concerns of diverse interests. In this case, these interests include parents, teachers, disability advocates, and school administrators. Too often these groups have been pitted against one another and have risked losing sight of a goal they all share--providing the best education for children with disabilities. This bill helps clear away problems that have obstructed that goal and reaffirms a child's right to a free appropriate education. 
Since the inception of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975, later changed to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA], our education system has undergone significant changes. Prior to this monumental legislation, children with disabilities were often shunned from traditional schools and relegated to State institutions. Today, special needs children are learning in the classroom side by side with their peers. This would not have been possible without IDEA. 
Advances in technology, teaching methods, and understanding of childhood development have changed the way we approach education in general, and special education in particular. But this progress has not been painless. School districts face enormous challenges in meeting the needs of all children. Given the intense resources often required to help keep special needs children in the classroom, schools and states have struggled with rising costs. Along with the financial burden, schools have been faced with growing societal pressures. 
I have been troubled by reports from parents, teachers, and administrators in Wisconsin about violence in the classroom. Some of these cases have involved students with disabilities. Although often a reflection of inadequate resources directed to the special needs of the disabled student, disruptions affect the entire classroom. No student should have to learn in a classroom of fear and no teacher should be forced to chose between educating a special needs student and the rest of the class. And Mr. President, no student should be denied an appropriate education. 
I am also troubled that despite IDEA, some disabled students are not be getting the education they deserve. Procedures and resources may vary tremendously from State to State and even between school districts within States. Clarification is needed to help schools and States conform with the goals of IDEA. This bill provides that clarification. 
The bill makes numerous improvements to the current provisions of IDEA, while maintaining key principles. To address concerns with litigation, the bill encourages use of mediation and parent training centers, which are effective resources that provide low-cost 
dispute resolution between parents and schools. Paperwork burdens faced by schools and States are also addressed. Although documentation is a necessity, educators should concentrate on teaching, not paperwork. Important, parents rights are maintained and each child is still guaranteed an appropriate education. 
I am particularly pleased that this legislation will intensify the focus on early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities. As we know from the growing body of scientific evidence on brain development, the most important time to influence a child's learning capacity is in the zero to 3 age range. This section of IDEA recognizes the need for early intervention and represents one of the very few areas of Federal investment in this critical age group. 
Finally, Mr. President, this bill helps resolve two very contentious issues involving special education--discipline and due process. This compromise will ensure that disabled children retain access to special education services while giving school districts greater ability to maintain order and safety in the classroom. If students pose a threat to themselves or others, there is new authority to allow removing the child from the class to an alternative educational setting. But the student cannot be shut out of school doors because of behavioral problems relating to the child's disability. In addition, parents will maintain a key role in their child's education and retain legal rights if a child's education is neglected. 
Although these changes may not please everyone, I believe they represent a fair compromise to a very delicate area of law. Overall, this bill is a balanced attempt to enable infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities to receive a high-quality education and helps schools provide that education. 
Mr. President, this compromise was a long time coming and will have an impact for a long time to come. I urge my colleagues to support this consensus legislation.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to call for justice for Wei Jingsheng. Mr. Wei is a Chinese citizen who has devoted his life to the cause of democracy and tolerance in the People's Republic of China. In exchange for his selfless effort, Mr. Wei has spent almost 20 years in prison. We must, as a Senate and as a country, call upon Chinese leaders to recognize Mr. Wei's genuine love of his country, to respect his right to dissent, and to set him free to live his life in peace. 
I have chosen to make this statement today because today we celebrate the publication of Mr. Wei's book, `The Courage to Stand Alone: Letters from Prison and Other Writings.' In these unadorned yet powerful reflections, Mr. Wei provides insight into the tortures he has suffered in prisons and labor camps, as well as the passion and commitment which have maintained his fighting spirit. His straightforward missives on the obvious need for democracy remind us all of our fundamental civic values. 
Wei Jingsheng is a hero. With a background as an electrician, and with the weight of the Communist leadership against him, he became what the New York Times called the strongest voice of China's democracy movement. It is with awe and sadness that I note Mr. Wei's ability to persevere these many years despite his and other Chinese dissidents' virtual invisibility on the international scene. 
We can not allow Mr. Wei to be invisible. As Americans we have always supported the cause of democracy and tolerance. In our own country we are lucky. Democracy as law and tolerance, though we must always be vigilant for transgressions against it, is an integral part of our social fabric. In other parts of the world, including the People's Republic of China, democracy and tolerance remain elusive. Mr. Wei is a hero because he fights against the tide. The leaders of China will be heroes when they realize that men and women like Wei Jingsheng can strengthen and enrich their country--if only they are set free.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Chafee-D'Amato amendment regarding SSI benefits to legal immigrants and refugees. I am pleased to support this important first step to correct a significant mistake of last year's welfare bill. 
As you know, this amendment would extend the eligibility of disabled and elderly legal immigrants to the Supplemental Security Income Program. These people, including approximately 5,000 in my home State of Wisconsin, were scheduled to lose their SSI benefits in August of this year. As my colleagues from California, New York, Rhode Island, and elsewhere have explained, many others would have been similarly affected all across the country. 
While many legal immigrants will become citizens by the August deadline, without this amendment, State officials estimate that approximately 3,000 elderly and disabled legal immigrants living in various Wisconsin communities would have been cut off from their only source of support. These are people who cannot work and who would not be able to live or take care of their families without outside help. If the Federal Government abandoned them, their most basic needs--shelter, food, medical help--and the accompanying costs, would have fallen on the shoulders of, and quite potentially overwhelmed, State and local resources. 
Wisconsin has already decided to continue medical assistance to SSI recipients. And the recently hatched budget deal contains even more comprehensive remedies for the next fiscal year--two encouraging bits of news. Nonetheless, the extension of benefits from August to October will provide crucial help until those long-term remedies take effect. 
Mr. President, I supported the new welfare law. Policy reforms to move people from welfare to work were laudable and long overdue. Yet throughout the welfare debate I also supported numerous attempts, all of which failed, to soften the bill's restrictions on benefits to legal immigrants and refugees. 
Simply put, the welfare bill went too far. It was too harsh on legal immigrants who come to this country with every intention of working hard and contributing to our economy and cultural melting pot. It also was too harsh on refugees and asylees who come to this country to escape persecution in their native lands. To this latter group, the United States made and continues to make a unique commitment of assistance and guidance to help them rise above adversity and build a new life for themselves and their families. 
Wisconsin has been enriched by many different ethnic groups throughout its history. That said, I would like to take this occasion to discuss a population that has been hit particularly hard by the welfare changes--the Hmong and other highland peoples--who came to Wisconsin and other parts of the country as refugees from Southeast Asia. Since coming, they have faced the challenges of integrating into American society. Many arrived in this country illiterate because they did not have a written language at home and have had a difficult time fulfilling the educational requirements of the citizenship application. In August, many of the Hmong would have lost the SSI benefits that they have relied upon to cope with these challenges. 
Like most legal immigrants before and since, the Hmong and their children have strengthened our communities. But some of my colleagues may not know of the Hmong's invaluable contribution to the United States before ever setting foot in Wisconsin or anywhere else on American soil. 
Mr. President, Americans owe a debt of gratitude to the Hmong. Most of them fled their native country at the end of the Vietnam war, fearing retribution for having fought for the United States alongside American soldiers and helping us through what was a very difficult time in our history. 
While no disabled or elderly legal immigrants should be left without help, I am particularly pleased to cosponsor the Chafee-D'Amato amendment on behalf of the Hmong. It would be unconscionable to abandon the Hmong in their time of need. They put their lives on the line in defense of all that Americans hold dear--our freedom, our prosperity, and our way of life. Today, Congress has taken a very small step toward repaying their priceless service to all Americans.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Juvenile Jail Improvement Act of 1997. 
We face a growing and frightening tide of juvenile violence. And that tide is threatening to swamp our rural sheriffs. It is increasingly common for rural sheriffs to face a terrible dilemma every time they arrest a juvenile--they either have to release a potentially violent juvenile on the street to await trial or they have to spend invaluable time and manpower chauffeuring the juvenile around their State to an appropriate detention facility. Either way, the current system makes little sense and needs to be changed. 
Let me explain how this dilemma works. In most rural communities, the only jail available is built exclusively for adults. There are no special juvenile facilities. But sometimes, the community can create a separate portion of the jail for juveniles. However, under current law, a juvenile picked up for criminal activity can only be held in a separate portion of an adult facility for up to 24 hours. After that, the juvenile must be transported--often across hundreds of miles--to a separate juvenile detention facility, often to be returned to the very same jail 2 or 3 days later for a court date. This system often leaves rural law enforcement criss-crossing the State with a single juvenile--and results in massive expenses for law enforcement with little benefit for juveniles, who spend endless hours in a squad car. Such a process does not serve anyone's interests. 
And that is not all that rural sheriffs face. Even qualifying for the 24-hour exception can be a nightmare. That's because juveniles can be kept in adult jails only under a very stringent set of rules. Keeping juveniles in an adult jail is known as collocation. It can only be done if there is strict sight and sound separation between the adults and the juveniles as well as completely separate staff. For many small communities, making these physical and staff changes to their jails is prohibitively expensive. 
So sheriffs faced with diverting officers to drive around the State in search of a detention facility may choose to let the juvenile go free while awaiting trial. This prospect should frighten anyone who is aware of the growing trend in juvenile violence. 
Today, I am introducing legislation that is designed to cure this problem. My legislative solution is simple, straightforward and effective. It extends from 24 to 72 hours the time during which rural law enforcement may collocate juvenile offenders in an adult facility, as long as juveniles remain separated from adults. It also relaxes the requirements for acceptable collocation. After taking a hard look at how collocation rules have worked--and in what ways they have failed--this legislation comes to a reasonable compromise. 
Mr. President, one of our most important goals in assuring that any changes to these rules do not sacrifice the safety and welfare of arrested juveniles. In addition to the growing fear about juvenile violence, we have witnessed a growing anger and frustration at juveniles. This frustration should not lead us to forget the painful lessons we learned many years ago about abusive and dangerous treatment of delinquent children. Twenty years ago, we learned about kids who were thrown in jail where they were victimized and abused by adult prisoners; or where, without proper supervision, they committed suicide; or, where, guarded by people who only had experience with adult prisoners, they were disciplined savagely. When we give into the temptation to throw juveniles in jail and teach them a tough lesson, we are often ill rewarded. So even as we loosen these collocation requirements, we must bear in mind that the juvenile justice system still has its principle goal rehabilitation not harsh retribution. 
My conversations with administrators, sheriffs, and juvenile court judges have led me to conclude that we must bring greater flexibility--and less red-tape--to the Juvenile Justice Act. It is my hope that this legislation--which offers greater flexibility while retaining important protections regarding the separation of juveniles from adults--will meet with strong support from the Senate. Thank you.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senator Wyden that will help Wisconsin and several other States, including Oregon, Texas, Alaska, and California, extend one of our most successful veterans programs to Persian Gulf war participants and others. This bill will amend the eligibility requirements for mortgage revenue bond financing for State veterans housing programs. 
Wisconsin uses this tax-exempt bond authority to assist veterans in purchasing their first home. Under rules adopted by Congress in 1984, this program excluded from eligibility veterans who served after 1977. This bill would simply remove that restriction. 
Wisconsin and the other eligible States simply want to maintain a principle that we in the Senate have also strived to uphold--that veterans of the Persian Gulf war should not be treated less generously than those of past wars. This bill will make that possible.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Juvenile Corrections Act of 1997, which I am proud to sponsor with my friend and colleague, Senator Cochran. The act dedicates approximately 10 percent of the 1994 Crime Act's adult prison resources to the construction and operation of State and local juvenile corrections facilities. 
Juvenile violence, as we all know, is at the heart of the crime problem in America. Every 5 minutes a child is arrested for a violent crime in the United States; every 2 hours a child dies of a gunshot wound. Unfortunately, there is good reason to believe that this problem may get worse before it gets better. Demographics tell us that between now and the year 2000, the number of children between the ages of 14 to 7 will increase by more than 1 million. The likely result: a serious increase in the number of violent juvenile offenders in the coming years--above already unacceptable levels. 
Despite this state of affairs, the Federal Government has treated juvenile corrections as the poor stepchild of the Federal anticrime effort. The 1994 Crime Act contained billions of dollars for policing and adult prisons at the State and local level, but no significant program to help States alleviate the increasing burdens on their juvenile corrections systems. 
These burdens are real and substantial, Mr. President. Department of Justice surveys have indicated that many juvenile corrections facilities nationwide are seriously overcrowded and understaffed--in short, bursting at the seams. As a result of the increasing number of 14 to 17 year olds we highlighted above, we will probably see even worse overcrowding in the future. 
Mr. President, the consequences of overcrowding should trouble us all. In part due to the combination of overcrowding and understaffing, juvenile offenders attacked detention facility staff 8,000 times in 1993. In countless U.S. cities, juvenile offenders who require detention are nonetheless released into the community because of a lack of space. And finally, it is clear that overcrowding breeds violence and ever more violent juvenile offenders who, when eventually released, are much more dangerous to society than when they were first institutionalized. 
For all these reasons, we introduce today the Juvenile Corrections Act. Our legislation provides crucial assistance--over $790 million in funding over 3 years--to State and local governments for the construction, expansion, and operation of juvenile corrections facilities and programs. And, I should note, the Act has no impact on the deficit, as it draws its funding from the $10 billion adult corrections component of the 1994 Crime Act. 
Mr. President, we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the juvenile corrections problem. So I hope my colleagues will join with me and Senator Cochran to enact the Juvenile Corrections Act. In light of the spiraling juvenile violence problem, we believe it makes good sense to dedicate roughly 10 percent of the Crime Act's adult prison resources to State and local juvenile corrections.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Act of 1997, legislation which addresses a serious problem that threatens Americans' confidence in our bankruptcy laws. The measure would cap at $100,000 the State homestead exemption that an individual filing for personal bankruptcy can claim. It passed the Senate last term when it was included into the Bankruptcy Technical Corrections Act (S. 1559), and I hope that we can all support this measure again this year. The goal of our measure is simple but vitally important: to make sure that our Bankruptcy Code is more than just a beachball for crooked millionaires who want to hide their assets. 
Let me tell you why this legislation is critically needed. In chapter 7 Federal personal bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor is allowed to exempt certain possessions and interests from being used to satisfy his outstanding debts. One of the chief things that a debtor seeks to protect is his home, and I agree with that in principle. Few question that debtors should be able to keep the roofs over their heads. But, in practice, this homestead exemption has become a source of abuse. 
Under section 522 of the Code, a debtor may opt to exempt his home according to local, State, or Federal bankruptcy provisions. The Federal exemption allows the debtor to shield up to $15,000 of value in his house. The State exemptions vary tremendously: some States do not allow the debtor to exempt any of his home's value, while eight States set no ceiling and allow an unlimited exemption. The vast majority of States have exemptions under $40,000. 
My amendment under section 522 would cap State exemptions so that no debtor could ever exempt more than $100,000 of the value of his home. 
Mr. President, in the last few years, the ability of debtors to use State homestead exemptions has led to flagrant abuses of the Bankruptcy Code. Multimillionaire debtors have moved to one of the eight States that have unlimited exemptions--most often Florida or Texas--bought multi-million-dollar houses, and continued to live like kings even after declaring bankruptcy. This shameless manipulation of the Bankruptcy Code cheats creditors out of compensation and rewards only those who can game the system. Oftentimes, the creditor who is robbed is the American taxpayer. In recent years, S&L swindlers, insider trading convicts, and other shady characters have managed to protect their ill-gotten gains through this loophole. 
One infamous S&L banker with more than $4 billion in claims against him bought a multi-million-dollar horse ranch in Florida. Another man who pled guilty to insider trading abuses lives in a 7,000-square-foot beachfront home worth $3.25 million--all tucked away from the $2.75 billion in suits against him. We read even now about the possibility that O.J. Simpson may seek to avoid the civil suit judgment against him buying a lavish home in 
Florida, a State with an unlimited exemption, and declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying his multimillion-dollar obligations. These deadbeats get wealthier while legitimate creditors--including the U.S. Government--get the short end of the stick. 
Simply put, the current practice is grossly unfair and contravenes the intent of our laws: People are supposed to get a fresh start, not a head start, under the Bankruptcy Code. 
In addition, these unlimited homestead exemptions have made it increasingly difficult for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation to go after S&L crooks. With the S&L crisis costing us billions of dollars and with a deficit that still remains unacceptably high, we owe it to the taxpayers to make it as hard as possible for those responsible for fraud to profit from their wrongs. 
Mr. President, the legislation that I have introduced today is simple, effective, and straightforward. It caps the homestead exemption at $100,000, which is close to the average price of an American house. And it will protect middle class Americans while preventing the abuses that are making the American middle class question the integrity of our laws--the abuses the average American taxpayer is paying for out of pocket. 
Indeed, it is even generous to debtors. Other than the eight States that have no limit to the homestead exemption, no State has a homestead exemption exceeding $100,000. In fact, 38 States have exemptions of $40,000 or less. My own home State of Wisconsin has a $40,000 exemption and that, in my opinion, is more than sufficient. 
Mr. President, this proposal is an effort to make our bankruptcy laws more equitable. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.

 Mr. KOHL. Today, Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to remember the men and women of the 440th Airlift Wing, based at Mitchell Field in Milwaukee, who died and were injured in the course of their duty on April 1, 1997. At a treacherous airport in Honduras, far from home, three airmen made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. On a routine resupply mission, their C-130 skidded off the end of the runway while attempting to land at Tocontin International Airport in Tegucigalpa. The plane burst into flames killing Senior M. Sgt. Leland Rassmussen, S. Sgt. Vicki Clifton, and Senior Airman Samuel Keene. Also injured in the crash were T. Sgt. Joseph Martynski, Capt. Ian Kincaid, M. Sgt. Steven Hilger, T. Sgt. Danny Formanski, Capt. Michael Butler, S. Sgt. Dean Ackmann, and Capt. Robert Woodard. 
The 440th flies out of my hometown, Milwaukee, WI and I am proud of their commitment to excellence. Over the years they have been called on many times to serve their country in foreign lands and dangerous circumstances. They are an example of the best the Reserve system has to offer, and I was deeply saddened to hear of their loss. 
Too often we take for granted the risks members of the military run on a day-to-day basis. We assume that because the United States is at peace soldiers do not face danger. While in fact, everyday men and women in our armed services put their lives on the line. They do it quietly and without fanfare. It seems that only when tragedy strikes do we take a moment to appreciate their courage and sacrifice. 
I would also like to take a moment to thank those brave Honduran citizens who risked their lives to help victims of the crash. With the wreckage burning only 100 yards from two gas stations, these good Samaritans waded into the fiery crash site to rescue complete strangers. Because of their selfless courage, lives were saved and crippling injuries avoided. 
Those injured in the accident have my best wishes for a speedy and complete recovery. My heart goes out to the families of Leland, Vicki, and Samuel. Over the years these three airmen have foregone time with their families in order to serve their country, and now the Nation owes them a debt it can never fully repay. All we can offer is our deepest sympathy and highest esteem.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I recognize today an outstanding achievement in Wisconsin collegiate athletics. Over the weekend of March 7-8, 1997, the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse, captured the NCAA Division III Men's Indoor Track and Field Championship. A perennial powerhouse in men's track and field, the Eagles amassed 44 points to claim their 7th NCAA Division III men's indoor title and the 6th title under men's head coach, Mark Guthrie. 
Paced by junior All-American David Whiteis' first place finish in the 400 meter dash, the Eagles demonstrated their team balance in both field and track events by placing finalists in the 1500 and 5000 meter runs; the 4 by 400 meter relay; the pole vault; the triple jump; and the 35-pound weight throw. 
I have great respect for student-athletes, Mr. President, and in particular those student athletes who compete within the guidelines of the NCAA's Division III status. These student-athletes do not compete with the benefit of a scholarship; their only prize is pride and victory. It is with this spirit of competition that I salute head coach Mark Guthrie and the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse, Eagles Men's Track Team for their outstanding effort and dedication. Congratulations on a job well done.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I introduce an important piece of legislation, The Child Safety Lock Act of 1997. Our measure will save thousands of children's lives by curtailing the senseless deaths that occur when improperly stored and unlocked handguns come within the reach of children. Let me tell you about the tragic death of 4 year-old Dylan Pierce of Eaton, WI, which illustrates why we need this law. 
Last August, Dylan and his 8-year-old brother Cody stumbled upon an unlocked cabinet while their parents were at work. The cabinet contained a .357-magnum handgun and several rifles. Although the boys' parents told them not to play with the guns, the children were naturally curious. The boys loaded the handgun with ammunition that was kept separate from the guns and began playing with the loaded handgun. While Dylan was handling the gun, it fired, shooting him in the head. Dylan was instantly killed by the bullet. Now, the lives of this family are forever changed, forever damaged. 
Unfortunately, statistics show that the Pierce family's tragedy represents part of an everincreasing trend in the United States. Currently, children in the United States are 12 times as likely to die because of a firearm than children in the other 25 largest industrialized countries. Even more startling, the Centers for Disease Control recently reported that nearly 1.2 million latch-key children alone have access to loaded firearms. These figures become even more disturbing when you account for the tragedies that could have been prevented by safety locks. 
And while most gun owners properly store their firearms, the sad fact is that a substantial number do not, leaving their guns loaded and within the reach of children. 
Mr. President, children's natural curiosity should not lead to their unnatural deaths. We need to ensure that young people who stumble upon handguns do not meet the same fate as Dylan Pierce or the many other children who have died or been injured in handgun accidents. This legislation is especially necessary as long as some adults continue to carelessly store their guns, and in places where children may reach them. Preventing these tragic accidents is the sole purpose of the Child Safety Lock Act. 
Our legislation is simple, effective and straightforward. First, it requires that whenever a handgun is sold, a child safety device--or trigger lock--is also sold. These devices vary in form, but the most common resemble a padlock that wraps around the gun trigger and immobilizes it. Trigger locks are already used by thousands of responsible gun owners to protect their firearms from unauthorized use, and they can be purchased in virtually any gun store for less than ten dollars. 
Second, the measure requires that a warning be enclosed with the purchase of every firearm. This warning serves as a wake up call to make gun owners aware of the risks associated with improper storage, and it also makes them aware of potential state civil and criminal penalties for failing to use child safety devices. 
Mr. President, this bill is not a panacea, but it will help prevent the tragic accidents and deaths associated with unauthorized, unlocked firearms. And it will help ensure that American children do not die as a result of adult carelessness. President Clinton challenged us to enact child safety lock legislation in his State of the Union Address: Today we respond to his challenge. 
Senators Boxer, Durbin, and Chafee join me as cosponsors of this bipartisan bill. We ask our other colleagues to join as well.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, 
I rise today as a strong supporter of the balanced budget amendment and a strong supporter of the Torricelli amendment. I do not believe that the two are inconsistent 
Those of us who support amending the Constitution to balance the budget have an obligation to make sure that we are supporting the best possible balanced budget amendment. I listened carefully to Senator Byrd earlier this week when he talked about the sanctity of the Constitution. He argued, and I agree, that we ought to amend this most basic and important document of our Government with only our best ideas, principles and language. 
The balanced budget amendment does, in my opinion, embody a principle simple and vital enough to deserve inclusion in the Constitution. It says that we ought to spend no more than we take in. It says that this generation has no right to finance its own consumption with money borrowed from the next generation. It asks the Federal Government to run its finances in a manner that both provides for a strong America in the present and builds a stronger America in the future. 
The Torricelli amendment would improve the balanced budget amendment by bringing it closer to this fundamental principle. The Torricelli amendment would exclude investments in physical infrastructure that provide long-term economic benefits from the definition of Federal outlays. In other words, it would put into the balanced budget amendment the requirement that we balance our operating budget but would allow debt financing of long-term public investments. 
To me this makes eminently good sense. It is how everyone else keeps their books, from State governments, to businesses, to families. You pay now for things that are going to benefit you now, and you pay over time for investments, the value of which accrues over time. A State government issues bonds to finance major highway projects and new construction of public buildings. A business goes to the bank for a loan to upgrade its machinery. A family takes out a mortgage to buy a house. 
When we say on the Senate floor that the Government ought to balance its books just like an American family has to, we mean that the Government ought to balance its operating budget just like an American family has to. No one is suggesting that a family wait until they save up enough money to pay cash for a home. If we operated that way, there would be very few homes bought in this country. 
If the Federal Government must balance its budget without separating out its capital expenditures, there will be very few public investments made in this country, and that would be very wrong. Already, the Federal Government woefully underinvests in the capital that will grow our economy--in our roads, in our schools, in our cities. The Torricelli amendment will ensure that in pursuing a balanced budget we do not have a perverse incentive to avoid those public expenditures that would most benefit future generations. 
State governments understand this. Forty-three of them have balanced budget requirements that separate out the capital budget. In my State of Wisconsin, the constitution requires that taxes cover expenses. But it also states that debt may be incurred `to acquire, construct, develop, extend, enlarge or improve land, waters, property, highways, railways, buildings, equipment, or facilities for public purposes.' 
That is a simple, straightforward and correct approach that we ought to take in the Federal balanced budget amendment, and I hope my fellow supporters of the balanced budget amendment will agree. This debate has always been about stopping the practice of robbing Peter and Paul, Jr. to pay for Peter and Paul, Sr. Supporters of a balanced budget amendment want to look beyond our needs today and toward our hopes for the future. 
That means not spending more than we take in. And that means making wise, long-term investments in the economy that will sustain future generations. We can do both with a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution if we also pass the Torricelli amendment, and so I urge my colleagues to do so. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his efforts on this issue. 
The Cheese Exchange is of great concern to all dairy farmers nationwide, because it is a market that is very thinly traded, completely unregulated, and has a great deal of influence on the prices that farmers are paid for their milk. 
That's why my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold and I have been working to reduce the influence of the Cheese Exchange. Both Senator Feingold and I introduced legislation on this matter last week. Ultimately, what we need to do is find an alternative price discovery mechanism that is more reflective of market conditions, and less subject to manipulation. 
And we have two initiatives underway that could form the basis for new price discovery mechanisms. 
First, we've worked with Secretary Glickman to start a new cheese price survey, to survey cheese plants nationwide, to get a better view of prices paid for cheese. If done right, this could be very useful as a price discovery mechanism. But there's still some issues that need to be ironed out. 
And second, we've asked other exchanges such as the Coffee, Sugar, Cocoa Exchange to explore the possibility of creating a new cash market for cheese. Again, if this is done right, it could be very useful as a new price discovery mechanism. 
But in the short term, the Senator from Pennsylvania is right, we need to delink the National Cheese Exchange from the farmers' milk prices, and we need to do that as soon as possible. Two weeks ago, the Secretary of Agriculture announced a 60-day comment period on that exact proposal. The trick will be to find a new equivalent price mechanism, to take it's place. We need to find a new mechanism that is credible, or we'll merely make matters worse. 
So I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I look forward to working with him on this issue, which has been a longstanding concern of mine. As far as I'm concerned, the more Senators become aware of this problem and join our efforts, the better.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my continued opposition to the Northeast Dairy Compact. As I have said many times in the past, it does not make me happy to oppose efforts by dairy farmers in other parts of the country to reap a higher price for their milk. For years, I have worked with many of the proponents of the compact in efforts to help farmers get a better price for their product. But in the past, these efforts have been national. And I believe we should continue with national efforts to bring farmers together, instead of regional efforts that pit farmer against farmer. 
The Northeast Compact is an effort by six Northeastern States to establish a regional cartel, to guarantee the farmers in that region alone get a higher price for their milk, to the detriment of the consumers in the Northeast, and farmers in other parts of the country, including Wisconsin. In my view, it is the exact opposite of what we should be doing; which is establishing a fair and reasonable national dairy policy that gives farmers in all regions an opportunity to prosper, free of structural impediments from the Federal Government. 
In my region of the country, the discriminatory nature of the current milk pricing system has contributed to a dangerous erosion of our farm economy. In Wisconsin alone, we have lost 12,000 dairy farms in the last 10 years. And I believe that the Northeast Compact will worsen the regional inequities that exist today, and be detrimental to farmers in regions outside the Northeast. 
To those outside the upper Midwest, who have not witnessed the destruction caused by the current milk pricing system, it may be difficult to understand how pricing schemes in one region could affect other regions of the country. But we cannot ignore that dairy markets are national, and any effort to artificially boost prices in one region alone will have effects throughout the national system. History has proven that point time and time again, and unfortunately, Wisconsin is the proving ground of that destruction. 
And even prior to its implementation, the evidence is beginning to build proving that the Northeast Dairy Compact sets a dangerous precedent in U.S. economic policy. Recently, the secretaries of agriculture from 15 southeastern States announced that they would be seeking to establish a Southeastern Dairy Compact, citing the precedent established by the Northeast Compact. So we must ask ourselves, where does it stop? A 6-State dairy cartel in the Northeast, a 15-State dairy cartel in the Southeast. This disintegration of our national economic unity does not come without cost. We may not be able to predict where this new regional cartel movement will stop, but it is clearly dangerous. 
So I join my colleagues in introducing this legislation that would repeal the section of the 1996 farm bill that gives the Secretary of Agriculture authority to approve the Northeast Compact. Whether it is stopped legislatively, or by the Secretary of Agriculture, to whom it has been returned by a Federal judge for reconsideration, I believe it should be stopped. And I urge my colleagues to join us in opposing this dangerous precedent for U.S. economic policy.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I introduced two bills, the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1997, and the Sunshine in Litigation Act of 1997. Both address issues that are of enormous importance to our communities and country. 
First, Senator DeWine and I introduced a measure to toughen the original Child Support Recovery Act of 1992 to ensure that more serious crimes receive more serious punishment. Our new proposal sends a clear message to deadbeat parents: Pay up or go to jail. 
Current law already makes it a Federal offense to willfully fail to pay child support obligations to a child in another State if the obligation has remained unpaid for longer than a year or is greater than $5,000. However, current law provides for a maximum of just 6 months in prison for a first offense and a maximum of 2 years for a second offense. A first offense, however, no matter how egregious, is not a felony under current law. 
Police officers and prosecutors have used the current law effectively, but they have found that current misdemeanor penalties do not adequately deal with more serious cases, those cases in which parents move from State to State to intentionally evade child support penalties or fail to pay child support obligations for more than 2 years--serious cases that deserve serious felony punishment. 
In response to these concerns, President Clinton drafted legislation that would address this problem, and we dropped it in last month. 
This new effort builds on past successes. In the 4 years since the original deadbeat parents legislation was signed into law by President Bush, collections have increased by nearly 50 percent, from $8 billion to $11.8 billion, and we should be proud of that increase. Moreover, a new national database has helped identify 60,000 delinquent fathers, over half of whom owed money to women on welfare. 
Nevertheless, there is much more that we can do. It is estimated that if delinquent parents fully paid up their child support, approximately 800,000 women and children could be taken off the welfare rolls. So our new legislation cracks down on the worst violators and makes clear that intentional or long-term evasion of child support responsibilities will not receive a slap on the wrist. In so doing, it will help us continue to fight to ensure that every child receives the parental support they deserve. 
With this bill, we have a chance to make a difference in the lives of families across our entire country. I look forward to working with my colleagues to give police and prosecutors the tools they need to effectively pursue individuals who seek to avoid their family obligations. 
The second bill I introduced 2 weeks ago was the Sunshine in Litigation Act of 1997, a measure that addresses the growing abuse of secrecy orders issued by Federal courts. All too often, our Federal courts will allow vital information that is discovered in litigation and which directly bears on public health and safety to be covered up, to be shielded from people whose lives are potentially at stake and from the public officials we have asked to protect our health and safety. 
All of this happens because of the so-called protective orders, which are really gag orders issued by courts--and designed to keep information discovered in the course of litigation secret and undisclosed. Typically, injured victims agree to a defendant's request to keep lawsuit information secret. They agree because defendants threaten that, without secrecy, they will refuse to pay a settlement. Victims cannot afford to take such chances. And while courts in these situations actually have the legal authority to deny requests for secrecy, typically they do not because both sides have agreed and judges have other matters they prefer to attend to. So judges are regularly and frequently entering these protective orders using the power of the Federal Government to keep people in the dark about the dangers they face. 
This measure will bring crucial information out of the darkness and into the light. The measure amends rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require that judges weigh the impact on public health and safety before approving these secrecy orders. It is simple, effective, and straightforward. It essentially codifies what is already the best practices of the best judges. In cases that do not affect the public health and safety, existing practice would continue, and courts can still use protective orders as they do today. 
But in cases affecting public health and safety, courts would apply a balancing test. They could permit secrecy only if the need for privacy outweighs the public's need to know about potential public health and safety hazards. Moreover, courts could not, under this measure, issue protective orders that would prevent disclosures to regulatory agencies. 
I do want to mention that identical legislation was reported out of the Judiciary Committee last year by a bipartisan, 11-to-7 majority. I do want to remind people that this issue is not going away: A number of States are currently considering antisecrecy measures; the Justice Department itself has drafted its own antisecrecy proposal--one that in many ways goes further than my own. The grassroots support for antisecrecy legislation will continue and grow, as long as information remains held under lock and key. 
So, Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to do more to combat deadbeat parents and limit court secrecy. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted on the first of several potential amendments to exempt certain programs from the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I greatly appreciate the comments made on the amendment by the Senator from Minnesota regarding the importance of programs that benefit our children. Senator Wellstone spoke passionately and I could not agree more that we must protect our children. 
However, I disagree with the notion that we should exempt certain categories of programs from the strictures of the balanced budget amendment. I don't see balancing the budget and helping our children as two mutually exclusive goals. In fact, these are two of my highest priorities and they are critically linked. 
I heard the compelling arguments about the difficult spending cuts that occurred during the last Congress. I agree that more should be done to balance the burden of spending reductions in the future. As a society and as a government, we must maximize our commitment to the well-being of our children or suffer the consequences in the world economy. But what's more important, if we fail our children, we fail as a people. 
Mr. President, I am committed to the concept of the balanced budget amendment. I am committed to the idea that the financial security of this Nation rests on the ability of the Federal Government to curb the practice of spending beyond its means. And I am deeply committed to the belief that our Nation's future depends on the investment we place in our children. In reviewing the fiscal history of this Nation over the past 25 years, it has become clear to me that the will to exercise the necessary spending restraint does not exist within this body without a strict requirement. I believe that the balanced budget amendment provides such a framework, and that is why I support it. 
The Wellstone amendment was certainly difficult to vote against. But I strongly believe that the very arguments made by the proponents of the amendment are exactly those that will help preserve critical children's programs from future budget cuts. Our children are already saddled with a tremendous debt burden created by past federal budget excess. It makes no fiscal sense to further hinder their ability to pay off that debt by short-changing their education or health. The very viability of our economy depends upon the opportunity of our children to flourish. 
We clearly can not afford to ignore the needs of our children. But if we are serious about passing a meaningful balanced budget amendment, then we must reject efforts to dismantle that effort through piecemeal exclusions of programs, however worthy the particular program. I fear that such exemptions will lead to a cascade of further exemptions and ultimately leave little room to create a truly fair and balanced budget. That is exactly the scenario that has caused us to get to a 4 trillion dollar Federal debt. 
I have sought to protect funding for child care resources, public health and education and will continue to do so in the context of a balanced budget. When it comes to the annual appropriations process, of which I am an active participant as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will remain front and center fighting to protect children's programs. But as a supporter of the balanced budget amendment, I must object to blanket exclusions. 
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few moments to comment on the Prohibition of Incentives for Relocation Act, introduced yesterday by my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. I strongly support and am an original cosponsor of this legislation, the passage of which is of great importance to workers in Wisconsin and all across the country. 
For the third consecutive Congress, we have introduced this legislation to amend the Housing and Community Development Act to prohibit the use of Federal funds, directly or indirectly, for business relocation activities that encourage States and communities to steal jobs from one another. 
My background is in business. I know well that in today's tough economic environment, it is commonplace for businesses to relocate or downsize their operations in order to maintain a competitive edge. In so doing, some choose to leave one location in favor of another location in a different State. However painful, mobility and adaptability have become important business survival tactics. But there's a catch: in some instances, relocation activities have been partially subsidized or underwritten by Federal funds. In other words, while it appeared that Federal moneys were fueling job creation in one community, the flip side of the coin revealed that those moneys were fueling job losses elsewhere. 
Mr. President, that is just plain wrong; wrong in terms of fairness; wrong because it violates the spirit of the law. And it's public policy without vision: if States start fighting each other for jobs, instead of creating employment opportunities from the ground up, any regional or national economic cooperation will be lost. 
This issue was first brought to our attention in 1994 when Briggs & Stratton Corporation announced plans to relocate 2,000 jobs from Milwaukee to other locations, including two that had used Federal community development funds to expand their operations. We introduced this legislation then, and in 1995 a version of the bill was adopted as an amendment to an appropriations bill. Although our amendment was dropped in conference, the final bill did include language requesting that the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] report to Congress on the costs and benefits of maintaining an information database on this issue. 
We are still waiting for HUD's report, but the need to act is no less significant today than it was in 1994. In fact, in December 1996, the Wisconsin State Journal reported that the communications director for the Michigan Jobs Commission had stated, and I quote, `we will aggressively pursue Wisconsin companies for relocation into Michigan.' 
Mr. President, we were disheartened by Michigan's attitude to say the least, and we contacted then-HUD Secretary Cisneros, Assistant Secretary Singerman at the Economic Development Administration [EDA] and Administrator Lader at the Small Business Administration [SBA] to urge all three to be vigilant when distributing Federal funds. We wanted to be sure that their agencies were not inadvertently encouraging Michigan to steal jobs from Wisconsin. I am pleased to report that Assistant Secretary Singerman responded by affirming EDA's sensitivity to the issue and want to add that both EDA and SBA are already governed by antijob piracy provisions. We are simply proposing that these types of provisions govern HUD programs as well. 
Our attention to this matter is imperative. Community development for all Americans is best achieved by promoting new growth, rather than promoting job raids between hard-pressed communities. I urge my colleagues to take this issue seriously by acting upon this legislation as soon as possible.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to address a matter of great concern to all dairy farmers in the Nation--the lack of a credible milk-pricing system. Though there are many aspects of the milk-pricing system in need of reform, the legislation that I am introducing today seeks to address concerns about the potential for manipulation on the National Cheese Exchange [NCE] in Green Bay, WI, and the influence of the NCE on farmers' milk prices. 
Last year, a 3-year study funded by USDA, and conducted by economists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, highlighted the flaws of the National Cheese Exchange. Specifically, the report showed that although less than 1 percent of the nation's cheese is traded on the exchange, the price resulting from the exchange's weekly trading sessions acts as a reference price for nearly 95 percent of the commercial bulk cheese sales in the country. Further, the NCE price is also used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a factor in calculating the monthly minimum price that farmers receive for their milk. 
The report raised serious concerns about the appropriateness of allowing a market that is as thinly traded, highly concentrated, unregulated, and subject to manipulation as the NCE to have such extreme influence over farmers' milk checks and national cheese prices. 
Since the report was released, a great deal of time has been devoted to a discussion of whether certain companies or cooperatives have intentionally manipulated the exchange. I personally asked the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to review the report, to determine if any antitrust laws had been violated. While I am not convinced that either agency gave much attention to the matter, both replied that they saw no sign of illegality in the activities by large traders on the NCE. 
While these questions of legality and manipulation are valid, they are questions that may never be resolved to anyone's satisfaction. Ultimately what I believe to be the most important exercise is to find a market that will be more reflective of supply and demand, and to eliminate any potential for manipulation in price discovery. Farmers and consumers alike deserve to know that markets are fair and aboveboard. 
With that goal in mind, my colleagues from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold and Congressman Obey, and I have worked continuously on several initiatives to create and promote alternative price discovery mechanisms, and to urge Federal and State regulatory agencies to exercise any authorities they might have to oversee the operations of the exchange.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I introduce the Class Action Fairness Act of 1997. This legislation is necessary to address a troubling and growing problem in class action litigation--unfair and abusive settlements that ignore the best interests of injured plaintiffs while unscrupulous defendants and attorneys reap the rewards. 
Let me give you an example of this situation. It involves a class action settlement that affected a constituent of mine, Martha Preston of Baraboo, WI. Ms. Preston was a member of a class action lawsuit filed in Alabama State Court against BancBoston Mortgage Corp. The suit alleged that the bank was holding an excess balance of Ms. Preston's money in her mortgage escrow account. As with many class members in this case--and in most class action lawsuits--Ms. Preston did not actually initiate the suit or even have knowledge that her mortgage company was being sued on her behalf. But a group of lawyers who claimed to represent her and all other people in a similar situation filed the suit on behalf of the class and negotiated a settlement of the suit, as they are allowed to under the law. 
The settlement they negotiated provided that the bank would refund the excess money that it was holding and provide a small amount of compensation to the plaintiffs for lost interest. Pursuant to the settlement, Ms. Preston received a check for $4.38 to compensate her for the interest she would have earned had the excess money been invested. A few months later, a miscellaneous disbursement of $80.94 showed up on her escrow account. That $80 went to pay the class action attorneys their fee for getting her $4.38. So Ms. Preston ended up losing $75 as the result of a lawsuit filed without her knowledge and that purported to be to her advantage. 
Unfortunately, Ms. Preston's losses did not end there. She was understandably upset at what happened to her. So she found an attorney who was willing to represent her pro bono. She sued the attorneys who had negotiated the agreement that cost her $75. No sooner had she sued them for what they had done, than these attorneys turned around and sued her and her pro bono attorneys in Alabama--a State she has never visited--for abuse of process and malicious prosecution and asked for $25 million in damages against her. Both of these lawsuits are ongoing; indeed the suit that Ms. Preston filed is now the subject of a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. Not only did Ms. Preston lose $75, but now as a result of trying to defend herself from being fleeced she is defending a $25 million lawsuit against her. 
The Preston case is especially egregious. Unfortunately it is not uncommon. The system of class action law suits has created a climate where this kind of abuse is possible. 
A class action is a lawsuit in which an attorney not only represents an individual plaintiff but, in addition, seeks relief for all those individuals who have suffered an injury similar to the plaintiff. For example, a suit brought against a pharmaceutical company by a person suffering from the side effects of a drug can, if the court approves it as a class action, be expanded to cover all individuals who used the drug. 
Often, these suits are settled. The settlement agreements provide money and/or other forms of compensation. The attorneys who brought the class action suit also get paid for their work. All class members are usually notified of the terms of the settlement and frequently--but not always--given the chance to withdraw from the agreement if they do not want to be part of it. A court must ultimately approve a settlement agreement. 
Many of these suits are brought and settled fairly and in good faith. Unfortunately, we also know that there are a few unscrupulous lawyers who file class actions in search of big attorney fees rather than to get compensation for victims. And the class action system does not adequately protect class members from such predatory acts. The primary problem is that the client in a class action is a diffuse group of thousands of individuals scattered across the country. The group is so diffuse that it is incapable of exercising meaningful control over the litigation. As a result, while in theory the class action lawyers must be responsive to their clients, in practice, the lawyers control all aspects of the litigation. 
Moreover, when a class action is settled, the amount of the attorneys fee is negotiated between the plaintiffs' lawyers and the defendants. But in most cases the fee is paid by the class members--the only party that does not have a seat at the bargaining table. 
In addition, class actions are now being used by defendants as a tool to limit their future liabilities. Class actions are being settled that cover all individuals exposed to a particular substance but whose injuries have not yet manifest themselves. As Prof. John Coffee of Columbia Law School has written, `the class action is providing a means by which unsuspecting future claimants suffer the extinguishment of their claims even before they learn of their injury.' 
In light of the incentives that are driving the parties, it is easy to see how the class members can be left out in the cold. Plaintiffs attorneys and corporate defendants can reach agreements that satisfy their respective interests--and even the interests of the name class plaintiffs--but that short sell the interests any class members who are not vigilantly monitoring the litigation. 
Although members of class actions get notices of settlements, the settlements are often written in incomprehensible legalese. Let me give you an example of a recent notice: 
`The Rebate payable to the eligible member [sic] of the Open Class and the Closed Class shall be an amount equal to (i) the Average Surplus, as determined by the above subparagraph, multiplied by (ii) 50% multiplied by (iii) 3% multiplied by (a) 1 if the loan was serviced for at least 1 year but less than . . . .' 
Even well trained attorneys are hard pressed to understand these notices. But these long, finely printed and intricate letters are being sent to class members. And on the basis of these notices, people's legal rights are being eliminated and in cases like Ms. Preston's they are being injured. 
We all know that class action suits can result in significant and important benefits for class members and for our society. Class actions have been used to desegregate racially divided schools, to obtain redress for victims of employment discrimination, and to compensate individuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products. Class actions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable people to pursue claims that collectively that would otherwise be too expensive to litigate. 
The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is in weeding out the abuses without causing undue damage. The legislation I propose attempts to do this. It does not limit anyone's ability to file a class action or to settle a class action. It seeks to address the problem in two ways. First, it requires that State attorneys general be notified about potential class action settlements that would affect residents of their states. With this systematic notification in place, the attorneys general can intervene in cases where they think the settlements are unfair. Second, the legislation requires that class members be notified of a potential settlement in clear, easily understood English--not legal jargon. 
Let me emphasize the limited scope of this measure: we do not require that State attorney generals do anything with the notice that they receive. No obligations are imposed upon them at all, although we are hopeful that they will act when appropriate. Moreover, we do not give the attorneys general any new or special rights to intervene in the settlements. They must work within current law. 
The simple goal of this legislation is to provide better information and better consumer protection through greater knowledge. We do not want to close the courthouse door to meritorious cases, but merely assure that people are provided with meaningful information so that they can defend themselves.

Mr. KOHL. 
Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Sunshine in Litigation Act, a measure that addresses the growing abuse of secrecy orders issued by our Federal courts. All too often our Federal courts allow vital information that is discovered in litigation--and which directly bears on public health and safety--to be covered up, to be shielded from people whose lives are potentially at stake, and from the public officials we have asked to protect our health and safety. 
All this happens because of the use of so-called protective orders--really gag orders issued by courts--that are designed to keep information discovered in the course of litigation secret and undisclosed. Typically, injured victims agree to a defendant's request to keep lawsuit information secret. They agree because defendants threaten that, without secrecy, they will refuse to pay a settlement. Victims cannot afford to take such chances. And while courts in these situations actually have the legal authority to deny requests for secrecy, typically they do not--because both sides have agreed, and judges have other matters they prefer to attend to. So judges are regularly and frequently entering these protective orders, using the power of the Federal Government to keep people in the dark about the dangers they face. 
The measure that I am introducing today will bring crucial information out of the darkness and into the light. The measure amends rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require that judges weigh the impact on public health and safety before approving these secrecy orders. It is simple, effective, and straightforward. The Judiciary Committee reported out identical legislation last Congress by a bipartisan 11 to 7 majority. 
Our bill essentially codifies what is already the practice of the best judges. In cases that do not affect public health safety, existing practice would continue, and courts could still issue protective orders as they do today. But in cases affecting public health and safety courts would apply a balancing test: they could permit secrecy only if the need for privacy outweighs the public's need to know about potential health or safety hazards. Moreover, courts could not, under this measure, issue protective orders that would prevent disclosures to regulatory agencies. 
Although the law may result in some small additional burden on judges, a little extra work from judges seems a tiny price to pay for protecting blameless people from dangers. Every day, in the course of litigation, judges make tough calls about how to construe the public interest and interpret other laws that Congress passes. I am confident that the courts will administer this law fairly and sensibly. If this requires extra 
work, then the work is well worth it. After all no one argues that spoiled meat should be let out on the market because stricter regulations mean more work for FDA meat inspectors. 
The problem of excessive secrecy orders in cases involving public health and safety has been apparent for many years. The Judiciary Committee first held hearings on this issue in 1990. `Court Secrecy,' Hearings before the Subcommittee. On Courts and Administrative Practice, Committee on the Judiciary, May 17, 1990, 101st Congress, 2d Session. The committee held hearings again in 1994. 
In 1990, Arthur Bryant, the executive director of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, told us: `The one thing we learned * * * is that this problem is far more egregious than we ever imagined. It goes the length and depth of this country, and the frank truth is that much of civil litigation in this country is taking place in secret.' Four years later, the attorney Gerry Spence told us about 19 cases he had been involved in in which his clients had to sign secrecy agreements. They included cases involving defects in a hormonal pregnancy test that caused severe birth defect, a defective braking system of a steam roller, and an improperly manufactured tire rim. 
Individual examples of this problem abound. For over a decade, Miracle Recreation, a U.S. playground equipment company, marketed a merry-go-round that caused serious injuries to scores of small children--including severed fingers and feet. Lawsuits brought against the manufacturer were confidentially settled, preventing the public and the Consumer Products Safety Commission from learning about the hazard. It took more than a decade for regulators to discover the hazard and for the company to recall the merry-go-round. 
There are yet more cases like these. In 1973, GM began marketing vehicles with dangerously-placed fuel tanks that tended to rupture, burn, and explode on impact more frequently than regular tanks. Soon after these vehicles hit the American road, tragic accidents began occurring, and lawsuits were filed. More than 150 lawsuits were settled confidentially by GM. For years, this secrecy prevented the public from learning of the dangers of these vehicles--6 million of which are still on the road. It wasn't until a trial in 1993 that the public began learning of the dangers of GM sidesaddle gas tanks and the GM crash test data which demonstrated these dangers. 
Another case involves Fred Barbee, a Wisconsin resident whose wife, Carol, died because of a defective heart valve. Mr. Barbee told us that months and years before his wife died, the valve manufacturer had quietly, without public knowledge, settled dozens of lawsuits in which the valve's defects were demonstrated. So when Mrs. Barbee's valve malfunctioned, she rushed to a health clinic in Spooner, WI, thinking, as did her doctors, that she was suffering from a heart attack. Ignorant of the evidence that her valve was defective, Mrs. Barbee was misdiagnosed. Mrs. Barbee was treated incorrectly and died. To this day, Mr. Barbee believes that but for the secret settlement of heart valve lawsuits, he and his wife would have been aware of the valve defect, and 
his wife would be alive today. 
At the 1994 Judiciary Committee hearing, we heard from a family which I must call the Does because they are under a secrecy order and were afraid to use their own names when talking to us and to our committee. The Does were the victims of tragic medical malpractice that resulted in serious brain damage to their child. A friend of the Does is using the same doctor, but Mrs. Doe is terrified of saying anything to her friend for fear of violating the secrecy order that governed her lawsuit settlement. Mrs. Doe is afraid that if she talks, the defendant in her case will suspend the ongoing settlement payments that allow her to care for her injured child. 
What sort of court system prohibits a woman from telling her friend that her child might be in danger? And the more disturbing question is this: What other secrets are currently held under lock and key which could be saving lives if they were made public? 
Mr. President, having said all this, I must in fairness recognize that there is another side to this problem. Privacy is a cherished possession, and business information is an important commodity. For this reason, the courts must, in some cases, keep trade secrets and other business information confidential. The goal of this measure I have introduced is to ensure that courts do not carelessly and automatically sanction secrecy when the health and safety of the American public is at stake. At the same time, it will still allow defendants to obtain secrecy orders when the need for privacy is significant and substantial. 
To attack the problem of excessive court secrecy is not to attack the business community. Most of the time, businesses seek protective orders for legitimate reasons. And although a few opponents of product liability reform may dispute that businesses care about public health and safety, we know that they do. Business people want to know about dangerous and defective products, and they want regulatory agencies to have the information necessary to protect the public. 
The Sunshine in Litigation Act is a simple effort to protect the safety of the American people. Its benefits far outweigh any of the worst imaginable disadvantages. And the longer we wait to enact the legislation, the more people are put at risk.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I introduce the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1997. Along with Senator Shelby and Congressmen Hyde and Schumer, I introduced the original Child Support Recovery Act in 1992, and today Senator DeWine and I are pleased to introduce a measure that will toughen the original law to ensure that more serious crimes receive more serious punishment. In so doing, we can send a clear message to deadbeat dads and moms: ignore the law, ignore your responsibilities, and you will pay a high price. In other words, pay up or go to jail. 
Current law already makes it a Federal offense to willfully fail to pay child support obligations to a child in another State if the obligation has remained unpaid for longer than a year or is greater than $5,000. However, current law provides for a maximum of just 6 months in prison for a first offense, and a maximum of 2 years for a second offense. A first offense, however--no matter how egregious--is not a felony under current law. 
Police officers and prosecutors have used the current law effectively, but they have found that current misdemeanor penalties do not adequately deal with more serious cases--those cases in which parents move from State to State to intentionally evade child support penalties, or fail to pay child support obligations for more than 2 years--serious cases that deserve serious, felony punishment. In response to these concerns, President Clinton has drafted legislation that would address this problem, and we are pleased to introduce it today. 
This new effort builds on past successes achieved through bipartisan work. In the 4 years since the original deadbeat parents legislation was signed into law by President Bush, collections have increased by nearly 50 percent, from $8 to $11.8 billion, and we should be proud of that increase. Moreover, a new national database has helped identify 60,000 delinquent fathers, over half of whom owed money to women on welfare. 
Nevertheless, there is much more we can do. It has been estimated that if delinquent parents fully paid up their child support, approximately 800,000 women and children could be taken off the welfare rolls. So our new legislation cracks down on the worst violators, and makes clear that intentional or long-term evasion of child support responsibilities will not receive a slap on the wrist. In so doing, it will help us continue the fight to ensure that every child receives the parental support they deserve. 
Mr. President, with this bill we have a chance to make a difference in the lives of families across the country. So I look forward to working with my colleagues to give police and prosecutors the tools they need to effectively pursue individuals who seek to avoid their family obligations.

Mr. KOHL. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family Farm Retirement Equity Act of 1995, a bill to help improve the retirement security of our nation's farmers. 
As we begin the 105th Congress, we can anticipate legislative action dealing with pension reform and the tax treatment of retirement savings. In his 1996 State of the Union address, President Clinton mentioned his concerns about the retirement security of farmers and ranchers, and many of us in Congress have sought to address this concern, as well. 
Last year, Congress passed the 1996 farm bill, bringing sweeping changes to the traditional farm support programs, and greatly affecting the income side of the average farmer's financial sheet. But it is equally important that we address the other side of the farmers' financial equation--the cost side. And some of the biggest costs that farmers face are the costs associated with retirement planning. In fact, those costs are sometimes so monumental that farmers reach retirement age without having made the appropriate provisions for their security. 
In the last Congress, efforts were made to address the financial concerns of retiring farmers and ranchers. In fact, the Senate version of the 1995 Budget Reconciliation Act included the legislation that I am reintroducing today, the Family Farm Retirement Equity Act. Unfortunately, that important provision did not survive the conference negotiations between House and Senate budget leaders. It is my hope that we will be able to revisit this matter this year, and address this growing concern in rural America. 
Farming is a highly capital-intensive business. To the extent that the average farmer reaps any profits from his or her farming operation, much of that income is directly reinvested into the farm. Rarely are there opportunities for farmers to put money aside in individual retirement accounts. Instead, farmers tend to rely on the sale of their accumulated capital assets, such as real estate, livestock, and machinery, in order to provide the income to sustain them during retirement. All too often, farmers are finding that the lump-sum payments of capital gains taxes levied on those assets leave little for retirement. 
The legislation that I am reintroducing today would provide retiring farmers the opportunity to rollover the proceeds from the sale of their farms into a tax-deferred retirement account. Instead of paying a large lump-sum capital gains tax at the point of sale, the income from the sale of a farm would be taxed only as it is withdrawn from the retirement account. Such a change in method of taxation would help prevent the financial distress that many farmers now face upon retirement. 
Another concern that I have about rural America is the diminishing interest of our younger rural citizens in continuing in farming. Because this legislation will facilitate the transition of our older farmers into a successful retirement, the Family Farm Retirement Equity Act will also pave the way for a more graceful transition of our younger farmers toward farm ownership. While low prices and low profits in farming will continue to take their toll on our younger farmers, I believe that this will be one tool we can use to make farming more viable for the next generation. 
This proposal is supported by farmers and farm organizations throughout the country. It has been endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Sheep Industry Association, the American Sugar Beet Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Cattleman's Beef Association, the National Corn Growers Association, National Pork Producers Council, and the Southwestern Peanut Growers Association. 
Further, I am very pleased that a modified version of this legislation has also been included in the Targeted Investment Incentive and Economic Growth Act of 1997, as introduced today by Minority Leader Daschle and other Senators. I look forward to swift action on that legislation, so that the working families and small businesses targeted for assistance can enjoy tax relief as soon as possible.

Mr. KOHL. 
Mr. President, one of the basic tenets upon which this Nation was founded was that there should be no taxation without representation. But the dairy farmers of this nation know all too well that taxation without representation continues today. They live with that reality in their businesses every day. 
Dairy farmers are required to pay a 15 cent tax, in the form of an assessment, on every hundred pounds of milk that they sell. This tax goes to fund dairy promotion activities, such as those conducted by the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board, commonly known as the National Dairy Board. Yet these same farmers that pay hundreds, or in some cases thousands, of dollars every year for these mandatory promotion activities have no direct say over who represents them on that Board. 
In the summer of 1993, a national referendum was held giving dairy producers the opportunity to vote on whether or not the National Dairy Board should continue. The referendum was held after 16,000 dairy producers, more than 10 percent of dairy farmers nationwide, signed a petition to the Secretary of Agriculture calling for the referendum. 
Farmers signed this petition for a number of reasons. Some felt they could no longer afford the promotion assessment that is taken out of their milk checks every month. Others were frustrated with what they perceived to be a lack of clear benefits from the promotion activities. And still others were alarmed by certain promotion activities undertaken by the Board with which they did not agree. But overriding all of these concerns was the fact that dairy farmers have no direct power over the promotion activities which they fund from their own pockets. 
When the outcome of the referendum on continuing the National Dairy Board was announced, it had passed overwhelmingly. But because nearly 90 percent of all votes cast in favor of continuing the Board were cast by bloc-voting cooperatives, there has been skepticism among dairy farmers about the validity of the vote. 
While I believe that dairy promotion activities are important for enhancing markets for dairy products, it matters more what dairy farmers believe. After all, they are the ones who pay hundreds or thousands of dollars every year for these promotion activities. And they are the ones who have no direct say over who represents them on that Board. 
It is for this reason that I rise today to reintroduce the National Dairy Promotion Reform Act of 1997. 
Some in the dairy industry have argued that this issue is dead, and that to reintroduce such legislation will only reopen old wounds. But I must respectfully disagree. 
The intent of this legislation is not to rehash the referendum debate, which was a contentious one. Instead, the intent is to look forward. 
Farmers in my state have traditionally been strong supporters of the cooperative movement, because the cooperative business structure has given them the opportunity to be equal partners in the businesses that market their products and supply their farms. I have been a strong supporter of the cooperative movement for the same reason. 
But there is a growing dissention among farmers that I believe is dangerous to the long-term viability of agricultural cooperatives. As I talk to farmers around Wisconsin, I hear a growing concern that their voices are not being heard by their cooperatives. They frequently cite the 1993 National Dairy Board referendum as an example. The bill that I am reintroducing today seeks to address one small part of that concern, by giving dairy farmers a more direct role in the selection of their representatives on the National Dairy Board. Whereas current law requires that members of the National Dairy Board be appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, this legislation would require that the Board be an elected body. 
Further, although the legislation would continue the right of farmer cooperatives to nominate individual members to be on the ballot, bloc voting by cooperatives would be prohibited for the purposes of the election itself. There are many issues for which the cooperatives can and should represent their members. But on this issue, farmers ought to speak for themselves. 
It is my hope that this legislation will help restore the confidence of the U.S. dairy farmer in dairy promotion. To achieve that confidence, farmers need to know that they have direct power over their representatives on the Board. This bill gives them that power. 
I welcome my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, as an original cosponsor of this bill, and I am also pleased to join today as an original cosponsor of two pieces of legislation that he is introducing today, as well. 
Senator Feingold's two bills would make other needed improvements in the national dairy promotion program. Specifically, one bill would require that imported dairy products be subject to the same dairy promotion assessment as are paid on domestic dairy products today. The other would prohibit the practice of bloc voting by cooperatives for the purpose of any future farmer referenda regarding the National Dairy Board. 
I thank my colleague Senator Feingold for his efforts on these matters, and I believe that our three bills provide dairy promotion program reforms that are both complementary and necessary.

Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Child Care Infrastructure Act. This legislation is designed to give incentives to private companies to get involved in the provision of quality child care. I introduced the bill as S. 2088 late last year, and I intend to make its passage this year one of my highest priorities. 
My bill responds to the challenges presented by the landmark welfare legislation enacted last Congress. And it responds to the fundamental changes in the American economy that have led to parents entering the work force in record numbers. 
The Child Care Infrastructure Act creates a tax credit for employers who get involved in increasing the supply of quality child care. The credit is limited to 50 percent of $150,000 per company per year. The credit will sunset after 3 years. The credit goes to employers who engage in activities like: Building and subsidizing an entire child care center on the site of a company or near it; participating, along with other businesses, in setting up and running a child care center jointly; contracting with a child care facility to provide a set number of places to employees--this gives existing centers the steady cash flow they need to survive, or it can give a startup center the steady income it needs to get off the ground; contracting with a resource and referral agency to provide services such as placement or the design of a network of local child care providers. 
This legislation responds to a great need, a great challenge, and a great opportunity. The need is to provide a safe and stimulating place for our youngest children to spend their time while their parents are at work. The challenge is to make the American workplace more productive by making it more responsive to the needs of the American family. And the opportunity is to take what we are learning about the importance of early childhood education and use it to help our children become the best educated adults of the 21st century. 
The need for quality child care is certainly apparent. As real wages have stagnated over the last decade, many families have adapted by having two wage earners per family. Also, over the same period, the number of children living in mother-only families has increased--in 1950, 6 percent of all children lived in mother-only families; in 1994, that number was 24 percent. In my home State of Wisconsin, 67 percent of women with children under 6 years old are in the work force according to Children's Defense Fund. And in Milwaukee County, about 56 percent of children under the age of 6 have both parents in the work force or their sole parent in the work force. That translates into about 67,600 children under the age of 6 in that county who right now are already in need of or in child care. 
With the passage of the welfare reform law, and the implementation of W-2, Wisconsin's welfare reform State plan, the need for child care will become even greater. A recent report done for the Community Coordinated Child Care of Milwaukee found that the implementation of W-2 will lead to the need for over 8,000 new full-time child care slots in Milwaukee County alone. 
Wisconsin is not unique in facing this overwhelming shortage of child care slots. Across the Nation, States and communities are facing the same issue. Where are our youngest children going to spend the day while their parents are at work? 
This is not the sort of market shortage we can or should address haphazardly. There is nothing less at stake than the welfare of our children. Study after study has found the enormous importance of early childhood education and care--and by early education, the experts mean the education of 0 to 4 year olds. One University of Chicago researcher has claimed that intelligence appears to develop as much during the years 0 to 4 as it does from the years 4 to 18. 
If we are simply warehousing kids in these early years, we are going to not only hamper their ability to develop fulfilling and productive lives, but we are hurting ourselves. We are resigning ourselves to trying to solve educational and developmental problems--at great expense--for the rest of these children's lives. 
As obvious as this point may seem, the desperate need for quality early child care is not a problem that this Nation has addressed. As a Nation--and I mean Federal, State, local, and private resources--over the last 10 years, we have doubled our expenditures on educating 5 to 25 year olds to $500 billion. Contrast that with the mere $4 billion we are spending on Head Start, and 95 percent of that is on children 3, 4, and 5 years old. Only $100 million out of $500 billion is spent on the period when the most significant development takes place--that's one-fifth of one thousandth of what we spend on ages 5 through 25. 
Obviously, our investment in children has not kept up with what we now know about how children learn and develop in their earliest year. 
There is another reason to care about the supply of quality child care--especially for businesses to care about quality child care. Employees who are happy with their child care situations are better employees. They are more productive, have less absenteeism, and are more loyal to their company. 
Clearly, there is a shortage of quality child care, and equally clearly, there is a benefit to the private sector if they are involved in solving that shortage. The approach I take in my legislation is to try to encourage private businesses to undertake activities that would increase the supply of quality child care. 
The legislation gives flexibility to businesses that want to get involved in providing child care for their employee's dependents. Though the shortage of quality child care is definitely a national problem, it does have uniquely local solutions. What sort of child care infrastructure works best in a community is going to depend on the sort of work that community does--whether there are many part-time or odd hour shifts, whether the local economy has a few very large employers or a lot of small employers, or some mix. My legislation includes a tax incentive that would allow many different kinds of businesses to take advantage of it--and that would allow them to be as creative as possible. 
The 21st century economy will be one in which more of us are working, and more of us are trying to balance work and family. How well we adjust to that balance will determine how strong we are as an economy and as a Nation of families. My legislation is an attempt to encourage businesses to play an active role in this deeply important transition. 
In the 1950's, Federal, State, local governments, communities, and businesses banded together to build a highway system that is the most impressive in the world. Those roads allowed our economy to flourish and our people to move safely and quickly to work. In the 1990's, we need the same sort of national, comprehensive effort to build safe and affordable child care for our children. As more and more parents--of all income levels--move into the work force, they need access to quality child care just as much as their parents needed quality highways to drive to work. And if we are successful--and I plan to be successful--in the 21st century excellent child care will be as common as interstate highways. 
Child care is an investment that is good for children, good for business, good for our States, and good for the Nation. We need to involve every level of government--and private communities and private businesses--in building a child care infrastructure that is the best in the world. My legislation is a first, essential step toward this end.

 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. UW-Oshkosh is celebrating its service to the State of Wisconsin as an institute of higher learning for 125 consecutive years and will be concluding its celebration with a large community event on February 8, 1997. 
The University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh has a rich tradition of serving the families of our State through dedication and devotion to the principles of higher education. UW-Oshkosh was founded in 1871 with an entering class of 43 students. During that time the university was mainly a teacher-training institution, producing thousands of teachers who contributed immensely to Wisconsin's leadership in education. 
Today, as part of the distinguished University of Wisconsin System, UW-Oshkosh enrolls more than 10,000 students on its campus in Fox River, WI. The university's four colleges and graduate school offer a range of programs in education and human services, letters and science, business administration, and nursing. With a tradition of strong programs in the arts and sciences and in professional career fields, the university has created an environment that promotes excellence and values diversity. In the past several years faculty and students have created a blueprint for the university's future, including a vision statement and 11 goals. Mr. President, the blueprint has been working because for the third consecutive year UW-Oshkosh ranks in the first tier of Midwestern colleges and universities by U.S. News and World Report. 
I hope that all of you will join me in congratulating the faculty, students, employees, and graduates of the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh for all of their accomplishments during their 125 years of existence, and I know you will join me in wishing them well during the next 125 years.
