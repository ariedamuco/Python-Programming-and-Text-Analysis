   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, first I would like to thank my colleague from Nevada for expressing his thoughts and concerns with H.R. 5528, and I want to express my thoughts on this matter as we pass this legislation. 
   I think that H.R. 5528 does present a unique situation in that the Torres-Martinez Tribe's lands have been inundated by the waters of the Colorado River since the beginning of the 1900s and one that I hope is not in other settlement agreements negotiated by the Department of Justice and presented to Congress for its consideration. 
   I understand your concerns about the precedent that would be set if as part of land settlements, land-into-trust acquisitions for gaming purposes were routinely proposed in exchange for the settlement of land claims. Though IGRA clearly calls for that situation in section 2719 of the Act, I agree that if a wholesale policy of off-reservation acquisitions as part of a settlement were adopted by the Department of Justice or this Congress, that a great many Senators would call for amendments to the act. 
   While I appreciate these concerns and would not favor inclusion of off-reservation land-into-trust acquisitions for purposes of land settlement in all cases, the IGRA is clear in providing the authority to do just that if warranted by the facts of the case in question. 
   Although this legislation is not the most desirable option and does not provide all parties with what they want out of a legislated settlement, it does provide justice to the Torres-Martinez Tribe and I think we are right in approving the bill.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to call my colleagues' attention to a conference which is convening this week here in Washington, DC. The Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America is sponsoring its National Leadership Forum XI from December 6-8, 2000. The National Leadership Forum is the largest meeting of grassroots and professional community coalition leaders in the country. CADCA expects approximately 1500 participants to participate in the Forum this year to network and learn about the most innovative programs, products and services working to reduce youth substance abuse in communities across the country. 
   As the chairman of the Treasury and General Government Subcommittee, I have a keen interest in these programs which receive support through the Drug Free Communities Act under the Treasury subcommittee's jurisdiction. The Drug Free Communities Act has seen some great successes. This program is funded at $40 million for fiscal year 2001, which is $5 million more than the administration requested. This program provides small grants to non-profit organizations that are trying to curb the impact of drugs in our communities. 
   One good example is in my own state of Colorado. The Drug Free Community  grant recipient is called Grand Futures. This non-profit organization has implemented a program that attempts to directly influence the social behaviors that tend to lead to drug use. The basic premise is, if you can influence those activities that lead to or are related to drug use, you can impact the incidence of drug use itself. 
   Grand Futures, which receives funding under the Drug Free Communities Act, conducts tobacco and alcohol stings. In addition, Grand Futures also works with local businesses regarding employee alcohol consumption during working hours and conducts outreach efforts regarding patrons' drinking and driving behavior. 
   As a result of their work, Grand, Moffat and Routt counties in Colorado, the area which Grand Futures administers, has shown a significant drop in adult and juvenile violations of the state's liquor laws. For that same time and location, this area also experienced a corresponding decrease in adult and juvenile drug violations. 
   I think you can see that if we focus on the contributing factors of drug use, we can have an impact. Also, it demonstrates that when you allow the state and local organizations to tackle an issue and provide them the resources to do so, each in its own way, they can be more successful in their grassroots efforts than a large Federal program would be. People like those working at Grand Futures live in the community, and they understand the local environment and the potential constraints that an outsider may not. This can be something as simple as knowing what the local past time is for teens. 
   The Drug Free Communities Act demonstrates that groups like Grand Futures are well suited to tackle the drug problem with locally-based solutions tailored to address the community's unique situation. I would encourage my colleagues to look into their Drug Free Communities Act recipients in their own state. I think that they will find dedicated, hard-working organizations that are achieving success and deserve their support.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I commend my friend and colleague from Hew Hampshire, Senator GREGG, for his effective leadership on this important Commerce, Justice, State appropriations conference report. The Senate version of the fiscal year 2001 Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill included a recommendation of up to $2.2 million for the FBI's Jewelry and Gem Program within funds available for Organized Criminal Enterprises, OCE, to address crimes against jewelry vendors who have proven easy targets for thieves, including organized South American gangs. The House report on the bill encourages the FBI to continue to allocate sufficient resources to disrupting these criminal enterprises. This program is designed to protect small businesses and the lives of employees in this field from violent crime. The conference agreement adopts the House position, but it is my understanding that the FBI decided to commit significant funds to combating these crimes in fiscal year 2000. Therefore, the conference agreement should be understood to recommend the FBI make available sufficient funds for the Jewelry and Gem Program. May I ask my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, the chairman of our subcommittee and our Senate conferees, if my understanding is correct?

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am joined by Senator BINGAMAN, Senator DOMENICI, and Senator ALLARD in asking the Senate to support our version of the Animas-La Plata water project by voting to table the Feingold amendment. In 2 minutes they will not have time to speak, but I believe I am speaking for them. 
   Our version of S. 2508 is truly bipartisan. By the way, it is not an expanded project. This is a much more reduced project. The Republican Governor and the Democratic attorney general of Colorado strongly oppose the Feingold amendment. By voting to table the Feingold amendment, we will leave intact a bipartisan version of S. 2508, supported by the administration, the States of Colorado and New Mexico, the Ute tribes of Colorado, the Navajo nation, and rural and municipal water users of southwest Colorado and northwest New Mexico. 
   In doing so, we will be saving the taxpayers over $400 million by downsizing the currently planned Animas-La Plata water project. If the Feingold amendment is not tabled, most of those entities will withdraw their crucial support  for the historic compromise and it will be dead. 
   If the Feingold amendment is adopted and the compromise collapses, then our only option for satisfying the tribal water right claims will be to build the entire huge Animas-La Plata water project as authorized in 1968. 
   In addition to killing our bipartisan solution to a regional water conflict, the Feingold amendment unfairly singles out rural water users and small municipalities in both of our States to pay higher costs for their domestic water supplies than the residents of big cities such as Phoenix and Tucson that are served by the central Arizona and central Utah projects, which were also authorized in 1968 at the same time the Animas-La Plata Project was authorized. 
   As chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, the Feingold amendment sends the wrong message by penalizing a region for participating in historic water rights settlement. If the Feingold amendment is not tabled, there will only be losers because the Indians and non-Indians will be locked into needless and expensive litigation and taxpayers will have to pay the costs of litigation on both sides. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join with me, along with Senators BINGAMAN, DOMENICI, and ALLARD, to support our bipartisan effort in voting to table the Feingold amendment. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the next votes in the series be limited to 10 minutes each.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined in offering the proposed amendment by three of my distinguished colleagues: Senator ALLARD, who is with me on the floor tonight; Senator BINGAMAN; and Senator DOMENICI from New Mexico. This is a bipartisan effort. I thank each of them for their support. All four of us representing the States of Colorado and New Mexico have actively supported this project since its inception. And, hopefully, S. 2508 will be the last time we need to deal with this long overdue project. 
   In 1956 and 1968, decades ago--in fact, before I was ever elected to any public office--the United States promised the residents of southwestern Colorado they could count on the Government to assist them in developing the region by ensuring an adequate and reliable water supply for the benefit of the tribes and the non-Indian community. In fact, in 1968, this project was authorized at the same time as the central Arizona project and the central Utah project, both of which have been completed. 
   Even before that, nearly 100 years before in 1868, the United States made a treaty that guaranteed the southern Ute and Ute Mountain Indian tribes of California a permanent homeland. No one could suggest this did not include the right to an adequate water supply. 
   In 1987, as a freshman Member of the House of Representatives, I introduced legislation to settle the Ute water rights claims. This settlement act was signed by President Ronald Reagan in November of 1988. For the next two Congresses, I worked to obtain the funding needed to implement this agreement, as did my colleagues from New Mexico and Colorado. The 1988 settlement act is currently the law of the land. 
   Unfortunately, that law has never been complied with. When I came to the Senate, I worked to secure the funding for the massive environmental studies needed on the proposed projects. I have also worked to prevent misguided attempts to deauthorize or defund this necessary project. The Federal Government's responsibility to build this project is even more urgent because the Colorado Ute tribes have claims to much of the water that is already being used and has been used for generations by their non-Indian neighbors. 
   The urgency of this bill has increased too because under the 1988 Agreement the Tribes can go back to court to sue the Federal Government if the project was not completed by the year 2000. That is obviously not going to happen. 
   The four of us I have fought for the fulfillment of these promises because I know what will happen if the Government is allowed to forget its promise to this region and walk away from its commitment to provide a firm water supply. Most important, the united States, the State of Colorado, the two Ute Tribes, and the non-Indian residents will spend the next few decades and millions of dollars in the Federal courts fighting for the limited water supply that exists in this region. There will only be losers in this fight because the non-Indians will lose the legal right to use the water, and the indians may never have the ability to put the water to use. The ironic part is that if  this issue ends up in the courts--it will pit one Federal agency against another with your tax money paying for attorneys on both sides. 
   As the author of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 and now as the chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I have an additional responsibility to make the United States fulfill its promise to this region. 
   The Ute Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 is a commitment to the Ute Tribes. This commitment is very similar to the 472 treaties previously approved by the United States Senate. In those treaties, each tribe agreed to give up a great deal in return for a guarantee that the United States would recognize and protect the tribes' rights to the reservation land guaranteed to them by the treaty. Also, as with other treaties, the opponents did not even wait until the ink was dry before they began trying to convince the United States to break its terms. Even though the States of Colorado and New Mexico have spent over $40 million to implement their part of the agreement. and Congress has already appropriated over $50 million which went to pay the Tribes to drop their lawsuits. 
   All of the 472 other treaties have been violated by the United States. But in this case, if the government does not fulfill the treaty terms, it is not only the Indians who will suffer, but all of the non-Indians in the region. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, the United States has two choices when it comes to the Ute water rights: we can build the facilities needed to store water for the tribes or we can reallocate the water from those who are presently using it. Estimates are that between 1/4 and 1/2 of all non-Indian irrigators would lose their water rights if we forcibly reallocate it. 
   Throughout a negotiation process sponsored by the state of Colorado, the tribes and local water users tried to convince the project opponents that reallocating the limited water supply is an unrealistic, risky, and disruptive way to resolve the tribal water rights claims; because it deprives hundreds of non-Indian water users of their rights to life giving water. 
   Clearly, the ALP opponents will continue to oppose 
   any project that provides any water storage. Compromise--and this bill is the 4th one--is not in their vocabulary. When the opponents tried to use environmental laws to delay and frustrate the project, the coalition of Indian tribes and local water users responded in two ways. First, they agreed to reduce the size of the project, so it could be built in a manner consistent with numerous existing environmental studies and reports, and would cost 1/3 of the cost of the original project. They also insisted that any reduction in the project size should require the government to make use of its existing studies when analyzing the project's environmental impact; rather than restart the whole process all over again. 
   It was difficult to convince me that we should follow this strategy and agree to build only a small part of the ALP that was passed in 1988. When I introduced this proposal in the last Congress, I knew that even a substantially reduced project would not satisfy the project's opponents. They don't want a smaller project: they want a dead project. I also knew that these opponents would work to mischaracterize any attempt to make use of the existing environmental documents. We did not have to wait very long for everyone to see that each of these concerns was correct. During the 105th Congress, the last time we reached a compromise and a bill was introduced, an administration official appeared before my committee and opposed a bill that offered to downsize the project in order to settle the tribal water rights claims. 
   But this left the administration with no feasible way to resolve the tribal claims. In fact, as the Department of Interior began to produce a new supplemental environmental impact statement, it compared the smaller project with the idea of just buying water rights. Even the present management of the Department of Interior could not deny that the only realistic, feasible alternative available to the government is to store some of the waters of the Animas River. 
   The Record of Decision signed by the Interior Secretary on September 25, 2000 explicitly and implicitly recognize all of these facts. It can be found at http://indian.senate.gov. 
   In fact Mr. President, the lateness of having this Record of Decision on file is the reason we could not move this bill sooner. For the first time, this administration is strongly on record in favor of settling tribal water claims by building an off-stream storage facility at Ridges Basin. The Record of Decision also rejects the any alternative to settling the 
   tribal water claims, especially the unrealistic, risky, and disruptive schemes that have been proposed by the opponents of the ALP. 
   Although I have agreed to sponsor this amendment, which implements the Record of Decision, I am still very concerned that the non-Indian beneficiaries of the project have been asked to give up too much. I am sure that there are those who will ask these people to give up even more. But I think that they have given up more than enough. 
   Under my amendment, the Animas-La Plata Project will consist of the facilities needed to divert and impound water in an off-stream reservoir. This provision will only take effect if these features are actually constructed. By taking this step, a number of potential project beneficiaries agree to forgo a substantial number of benefits that were promised to them by their own government in 1968. 
   In my view, the Federal Government is not fulfilling all of its obligation to these people, but they seem to have no alternative. They will receive substantially fewer benefits than they were promised. In addition, they will bear an even greater share of the cost for the benefits than those using Federal reclamation projects in other states, especially in the States of Arizona, California, and Utah which were originally authorized at the same time in 1968. 
   Many people now regret the subsidy of western water development, so they are taking it out on the ALP. However, in this case, they cannot do this without injuring the Ute Tribes. Some people will argue that they are only opposed to the part of the project that provides water to non-Indians. But the Ute Tribes refuse to allow the Federal Government to break all of its promises to the non-Indian project beneficiaries. Why? Because the Ute tribes know that they will be next. The tribes and their non-Indian neighbors have held together in a unique and strong coalition of Indians and their non-Indian neighbors that from my perspective is quite rare. 
   This project has been an 18 year effort for myself, for Senator BINGAMAN, Senator ALLARD and Senator DOMENICI. We worked together on it. The tribes have worked in good faith with the non-Indian project users to produce an agreement that allows the project to be built in a manner consistent with every existing environmental study and standard. We are consistent in the writing of this bill. As I understand the Record of Decision, the Department of Interior has also concluded that the time for studying the project has come to an end. And the time for actually fulfilling the government's promises to Indians and non-Indians is finally at hand. 
   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support S. 2508 as presented in amendment No. 4303. This is the last best chance for the United States to live up to the obligations freely embraced in 1956, 1968, and 1988, not to mention the 1868 treaty with the Ute Tribe.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement, I will, at the end of my statement, move to table Senator FEINGOLD's amendment. Also pursuant to that agreement, I request 10 minutes of the 30 that has been agreed to under the unanimous consent. 
   Each of the changes proposed by Senator FEINGOLD is either unnecessary or would have the opposite effect to what he intends. I will tell the Senator, who I consider a good friend, that I was in his State just last week with his very fine Governor, Tommy Thompson, traveling across the State doing several things. It was raining the whole time I was there. I rather marveled about how green and nice it was and how much water it had. I was somewhat envious coming from a State that has to store roughly 85 percent of its water needs a year. And as I looked around, I saw many roads and bridges and more than one or two lakes that I think had been paid for with the taxpayers' money in one form or another. 
   I would tell him that if he lived in a State such as mine or any of the Western States, as the Presiding Officer lives, he would understand how desperately we need water and how in a fast growing State it puts more and more strains and stresses on existing water. 
   I will talk about the Senator's amendment a little bit. Senator FEINGOLD's amendment proposes that we make existing Federal reclamation law inapplicable to non-Indian project beneficiaries. The Senator asks the Senate to amend S. 2508 to eliminate all references to the Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956. I don't know the age of the Senator, but I have a hunch it was about the time he was born. I assume Senator FEINGOLD believes that his amendment will make the repayment obligations more fair. In fact, it would be completely unfair to require these individuals to bear a greater repayment burden than all the other projects constructed under the authority of the 1956 and 1968 act. It would, in fact, in my view, be somewhat discriminatory against non-Indians. 
   If the Senate makes any of the changes proposed by Senator FEINGOLD, we will be saying that existing Federal law should not control the repayment obligation of the non-Indian water users of the project. Other water users up and down the Colorado River--and there are many in our States, as the Presiding Officer knows--will have their repayment obligation set by existing Federal law, but those getting water from this part of the Colorado River system and at this late hour will be told that a new law controls their repayment obligation. 
   I have to ask my colleagues, why should these project users be singled out in this manner? The most unfair part of this amendment is that it would be part of an Indian water rights settlement act. These non-Indian people are only being treated differently because they agreed to accept the smaller project as part of their agreement with the Ute Indian tribes. As the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, I can't think of a worse precedent or message to send. In my view, we ought to be rewarding the non-Indian neighbors who have worked cooperatively with their Indian neighbors, not making them pay more money for their cooperation. 
   If any of the repayment provisions proposed by Senator FEINGOLD were to pass, I would have to advise my non-Indian constituents that it is actually in their best interest to break their agreement with the tribes, because the price they must pay 
   for fulfilling their commitment to the tribes is to give up all the rights they already have under existing law. I am sure that isn't what the Senator intends, but that will be the result of the proposed amendment. 
   Senator FEINGOLD's proposed change concerning project deauthorization has the same effect. Under my bill, the only parts of the project that are to be constructed are the components that are explicitly included in S. 2508. Every other part of the project cannot be built unless and until they are authorized by Congress. That is the compromise on deauthorizing the project. The administration agrees with this compromise. It was even accepted in the House Resources Committee on a bipartisan vote. 
   This compromise is fair because it only becomes effective if the small part of the project is actually constructed. The Senator from Wisconsin asks the non-Indian project beneficiaries, including the State of Colorado, to accept project deauthorization now and accept the Government's promise that a smaller project will be built someday. I can tell you, with the history of promises made by the Federal Government to Indians, in fact to many people in the West, I am somewhat skeptical. I know the Republican Governor of the State of Colorado and the Democratic Attorney General also reject this idea. I ask the Senate to reject it as well. It is simply not fair. 
   Senator FEINGOLD also proposes a provision concerning judicial review. I assume this is intended to preserve judicial review. At best, however, this will have no effect because there is nothing in the bill that constricts judicial review. There is nothing to preserve. Since the provision has no obvious application, we should be concerned that a court will be encouraged to make some kind of a provision that doesn't exist now. Maybe a court will decide to interpret the provision as an invitation to ignore all the work Congress and the administration have done to analyze the project and its alternative. There is simply no reason to take that risk. 
   The administration has had its say in its record of decision. Congress will have its say by enacting S. 2508. There is nothing in the bill that prevents the court from doing what courts do or what they are supposed to do. They can have their say on whether the other two branches have followed the law. There is no reason to supplement or enhance the authority of the Federal courts with respect to this bill or the project. 
   The most unfair change suggested by the Senator is his desire to require nontribal recreation costs be made nonreimbursable. First, this is directly contrary to existing law. Ever since Congress enacted the Colorado River Storage Project Act in 1956, all recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement costs are nonreimbursable. Senator FEINGOLD proposes we do away with that part of the law. This would require water users in New Mexico to pay for recreation facilities or benefits in Colorado. Again, this provision would be included in an Indian water rights settlement. I think it is completely unfair to have New Mexico bear additional unwarranted expenses solely because they agreed to be part of this historic agreement. 
   I am sure the Senator from Wisconsin means well, but meaning well is not a test of whether we should amend S. 2508. Upon inspection, none of the proposed changes is necessary and most will be harmful. Each of them would wreck years of good faith negotiations among the parties. Also, they would mean breaking explicit promises made decades ago by the Federal Government. 
   For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote to table the proposed amendment, and I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays as outlined under the unanimous consent agreement.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I guess we could talk about everything, put it on spreadsheets, and talk about the dollars spent. But the Senator from Wisconsin mentioned something that I think is very important. He talked about the relevancy. 
   It seems to me that relevancy is part of the big picture and whether we ought to keep our promises. After 474 broken treaties by this Nation towards Indians, isn't it time we kept one? 
   We made a promise in 1935 to senior citizens called Social Security. If we can break our promise to one class of people in America, why can't we break it to another? Why can't we break our promise made to senior citizens? I will tell you why. We can't and won't because it is called stepping on a third rail called the AARP. Some thirty-million seniors belong to it--or more, for all I know--and they would absolutely come down the throat of everybody that is a Member of this body. So we don't fool around with them. We don't break our promises to people with high-powered lobbyists and full-time lawyers and lots of members that can write letters and oust us out of office. 
   Indians can't do that. There are not many of them. They don't have much money. They lost almost everything. So they have very little voice here. It is easy to take away the promise that we made to them. I think it is wrong. We talk about relevancy. This Nation ought to be greater than that, and keep our promises. 
   The statement of administration policy in the last paragraph basically says  they would support this bill with or without the Feingold amendment.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as an original cosponsor of this resolution introduced by my colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, to address the continuing constitutional crisis in Belarus. 
   As Co-Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, during the 106th Congress I have worked on a bipartisan basis to promote the core values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Belarus in keeping with that country's commitments as a participating State in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Back in April the OSCE set four criteria for international observation of parliamentary elections held this past weekend: respect for human rights and an end to the climate of fear; opposition access to the state media; a democratic electoral code; and the granting of real power to the new parliament. 
   Regrettably, the Lukashenka regime responded with at best half-hearted measures aimed at giving the appearance of progress while keeping democracy in check. Instead of using the elections process to return Belarus to the path of democracy and end that country's self-isolation, Mr. Lukashenka tightened his grip on power launching an intensified campaign of harassment against the democratic opposition and fledgling independent media. Accordingly, a technical assessment team dispatched by the OSCE concluded that the elections ``fell short of meeting minimum commitments for free, fair, equal accountable, and transparent elections.'' The President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE confirmed the flawed nature of the campaign period. 
   We recently saw how Slobodan Milosevic was swept from power by a wave of popular discontent following years of repression. After his ouster, Belarus now has the dubious distinction of being the sole remaining dictatorship in Europe. Misguided steps toward recognition of the results of Belarus' flawed parliamentary elections would only serve to bolster Mr. Lukashenka in the lead up to presidential elections slated for next year.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, Sid Yates, former Congressman from Ohio and a long-time friend of Indian country passed away last week. 
   I am particularly saddened because in the last 2 years, we have lost Morris Thompson, the Alaska Native tribal leader and one of the instrumental leaders in Alaska politics, Dr. Helen Peterson one of the founders of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), and now our long-time friend Sid Yates. 
   Indian country is losing far too many friends and most unfortunate is that we seem to be losing more friends than we are gaining. 
   As a Congressman from the State of Ohio with no federally-recognized Indian Tribes Sid Yates had no political reason to become the champion for Indian causes that he was known for. His dedication was not part of constituent service and he stood to lose more than he gained from his advocacy. Nonetheless, Sid Yates' commitment and determination to do the right thing never wavered. 
   I am saddened to be making this statement because all who knew or came in contact with Sid Yates were awed by his generous heart and humbled by the patience he showed with his colleagues and with the public--even when they disagreed with him. 
   His patience and focus in the legislative realm were legendary. Sid Yates started what I believe an appropriate protocol in the House Subcommittee by affording every Tribal Leader wishing to come before the subcommittee the brief opportunity to describe the most pressing needs of his or her Tribe. 
   When I came to the House of Representatives in 1986, I became deeply involved in issues that affect my State of Colorado, natural resource issues and of course issues that affect American Indians. In pursuing and working on these matters, I worked with Sid Yates time and again and benefitted from that association both as a legislator and as a man. 
   Sid Yates also knew when generosity of spirit and patience were not the appropriate response. In the mid 1980's a series of newspaper articles appeared in the Arizona Republic that revealed a breathtaking level of corruption and waste in the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. Millions of dollars were being siphoned off or wasted and were not getting to the Indian beneficiaries as Congress intended. 
   As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, Sid Yates took bold steps to ensure that this would not happen again and launched the Tribal Self Governance Demonstration Project. I am proud to say that in August the President signed legislation that I sponsored in the Senate to make permanent Self Governance in Health Care. 
   The auditorium in the U.S. Department of Interior was appropriately named the ``Sid Yates Auditorium'' and his name will carry with it the kind of dedication and honesty that was his hallmark. 
   It is customary and protocol to add the prefix ``The Honorable'' when talking of elected leaders and if there was ever a man who fulfilled that moniker it was the Honorable Sid Yates.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I take this opportunity to update my colleagues on the situation in Belarus, as I have done on previous occasions. 
   The Belarusian parliamentary elections are scheduled for October 15, and unfortunately, they do not meet the basic commitments outlined by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) concerning free and democratic elections. Moreover, many observers have concluded that the Belarusian government has not made real progress in fulfilling four criteria for international observation of the elections: respect for human rights and an end to the climate of fear; opposition access to the state media; a democratic electoral code; and the granting of real power to the parliament that will be chosen in these elections. 
   Instead, the Helsinki Commission has observed that the Lukashenka regime launched a campaign of intensified harassment in recent days directed against members of the opposition. We have received reports that just last week, Anatoly Lebedka, leader of the United Civic Party, whom many of my colleagues met when he visited the Senate last year, was roughed up by police after attending an observance marking the first anniversary of the disappearance of a leading member of the democratic opposition Viktor Gonchar and his associate, Anatoly Krasovsky. And just a few days ago, we were informed that Belarusian Popular Front leader Vintsuk Viachorka's request for air time on Belarusian television to explain why the opposition is boycotting the parliamentary elections was met with a hateful, disparaging diatribe on the main newscast ``Panorama.'' 
   This is only the tip of the iceberg--in addition, the Helsinki Commission is receiving reports of detentions, fines and instances of beatings of opposition activists who are promoting a boycott of the elections by distributing leaflets or other literature or holding meetings with voters. In recent weeks, we have also been informed of the refusal to register many opposition candidates on dubious grounds; the seizure of over 100,000 copies of the independent trade union newspaper ``Rabochy''; forceful disruptions of public meetings with representatives of the opposition; an apparent burglary of the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party; a ban of the First Festival of Independent Press in Vitebsk, and recent ``reminder letters'' by the State Committee on Press for independent newspapers to re-register. 
   Mr. President, Belarusian opposition parties supporting the boycott have received permission to stage ``Freedom March III'' this Sunday, October 1. At a number of past demonstrations, police have detained, harassed and beaten participants. Those in Congress who are following developments in Belarus are hopeful that this demonstration will take place peacefully, that authorities do not limit the rights of Belarusian citizens to freedom of association and assembly, and that the Government of Belarus will refrain from acts of repression against the opposition and others who openly advocate for a boycott of these elections. 
   Mr. President, the Helsinki Commission continue to monitor closely the events surrounding these elections and we will keep the full Senate apprized of developments in the ongoing struggle for democracy in Belarus.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is about to consider and pass S. 1438, the National Law Enforcement Museum Act of 1999. This legislation will authorize the construction of a National Law Enforcement Museum to be built here in our Nation's Capital. 
   As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks peace officers face in enforcing our laws. Throughout our nation's history, nearly 15,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement officers have lost their lives in the line of duty. Based on FBI statistics, nearly 63,000 officers are assaulted each year in this country, resulting in more than 21,000 injuries. On average, one police officer is killed somewhere in America every 54 hours. Approximately 740,000 law enforcement professionals are continuing to put their lives on the line for the safety and protection of others. 
   We owe all of those officers a huge debt of gratitude, and it is only fitting that we properly commemorate this outstanding record of service and sacrifice. 
   My legislation seeks to achieve this important goal by authorizing the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization, to establish a comprehensive law enforcement museum and research repository on federal land in the District of Columbia. The Fund is the same group that so ably carried out the congressional mandate of 1984 to establish the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, which was dedicated in 1991 just a few blocks from the Capitol. Clearly, their record of achievement speaks volumes about their ability to meet this important challenge. 
   Since 1993, the Fund has efficiently operated a small-scale version of the National Law Enforcement Museum at a site located about two blocks from the Memorial. The time has come to broaden the scope of this museum and move it in closer proximity to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. 
   This museum would serve as a repository of information for researchers, practitioners, and the general public. The museum will become the premiere source of information on issues related to law enforcement history and safety, and obviously a popular tourist attraction in Washington, DC, as well. 
   The ideal location for this museum is directly across from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on a parcel of federal-owned property that now functions as a parking lot. 
   I introduced this legislation on July 27, 1999, and after committee hearings and extensive testimony, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported the bill in July of this year. Although the bill was pending on the Senate calendar awaiting final action by the Senate, I was pleased to work with my colleagues, Senator THOMPSON, Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, and Senator DURBIN, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring and the District of Columbia, on a compromise amendment. 
   After over two months of negotiations, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund and the District of Columbia Courts reached an agreement to clarify that the building of this museum will in no way conflict with court expansion and renovation plans. As a result of this agreement, Senators THOMPSON and DURBIN have offered an amendment with my support to reflect this agreement with the courts. 
   Under my legislation, no federal dollars are being proposed to build this museum. Rather, the Fund would raise all of the money necessary to construct the museum through private donations. The legislation places the responsibility of operating the museum in the hands of the Fund. 
   Finally, let me add that this legislation is supported by 15 national law enforcement organizations: the Concerns of Police Survivors; the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association; the Fraternal Order of Police; the Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary; the International Association of Chiefs of Police; the International Brotherhood of Police Officers; the International Union of Police Associations/AFL-CIO; the National Association of Police Organizations; the National Black Police Association; the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; the National Sheriffs Association; the National Troopers Coalition; the Police Executive Research Forum; the Police Foundation; the United Federation of Police; and the National Law Enforcement Council. Together, these organizations represent virtually every law  enforcement officer, family member and police survivor in the United States. 
   As we remember the sacrifices made by our brave officers, I strongly urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation. I also call on our colleagues in the House to pass this important bill before the Congress adjourns for the year.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank the manager, my friend from Utah. I would like to review the Treasury and general government section, which was added to the legislative branch bill in conference. 
   I am going to repeat a few numbers. They are rather dry, but they are important numbers for my colleagues.  Needless to say, I think this is an important section and hope they support it. Budget constraints made it impossible for the committee to fund all requests made by the administration and by our colleagues in the Senate, too, but we tried to accommodate all of the requests as far as we could. 
   I think, as does my ranking minority member, Senator DORGAN, we would probably have preferred to bring this bill to the floor as a free-standing bill, but time constraints prevented us from doing that. But I believe it is still a good bill. Let me go over some of the numbers. 
   Mr. President, the Treasury and general government portion of this conference report contains a total of $30,371,000 in new budget authority. Of that, $14,679,607,000 is for mandatory programs over which the Appropriations Committee has no control. 
   This conference report strikes a portion between congressional priorities, administration initiatives, and agency requirements. Preparation of the Senate committee-reported bill would not have been possible without the hard work and cooperation of the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator DORGAN, and his staff. 
   As we consider the Treasury and general government portion of the legislative branch conference report, I would like to highlight some of the provisions before us: 
   We emphasize on the need for the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program--called GREAT--by including $3 million more than the administration request for grants to State and local law enforcement. 
   We provided a total of $93,751,000 for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to enforce existing gun laws. This includes: 
   $19,078,000 to fully staff and expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, bringing the total to 50 cities. This program allows ATF to track and prosecute those who supply guns to our youth. 
   Also, $23,361,000 for expanded ballistics imaging technology, and $41,322,000 to significantly expand the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy to support criminal enforcement initiatives such as Project Exile and Project Ceasefire to combat violent crime. 
   We have also included $13,700,000 for the Southwest Border Customs staffing initiative, $130 million for the Customs automation effort, called ACE, and $2,572,000 more to combat importation of items produced by forced child labor. 
   Speaking of youngsters, Mr. President, I am pleased to note that we have been able to fund the ONDCP anti-drug youth media campaign at $185 million. 
   We have spent over half a billion dollars in this program in the last several years. 
   Title II of this section provides $96,093,000 for the U.S. Postal Service and continues to require free mailing for overseas voters as well as for the blind, as well as a 6-day delivery and prohibit the closing or consolidation of small and rural post offices. 
   Title III contains a total of $691,315,000 for the Executive Office of the President. This includes the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Federal drug control programs, and the funding for the media campaign to which I alluded. 
   There is $29,053,000 for the Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center for their program to transfer technology to State and local law enforcement agencies. This is an ongoing program and has been a huge benefit to both State and local law enforcement groups. 
   There is $206 million for the High Intensity Drug Traffickers Area Program, called the HIDTA Program. This is an existing program, and the funding is continued in this bill under the current level. HIDTA Programs coordinate local, State, and Federal antidrug efforts. It has met with a great deal of approval with local and State law enforcement. As a matter of fact, many Senators requested expansion of this program, but we had to live within our budget constraints. 
   Title IV is independent agencies, such as the Federal Elections Commission, the General Services Administration, the National Archives, as well as agencies involved in Federal employment issues, such as the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Office of Government Ethics, the Office of Special Counsel, and the Office of Personnel Management. 
   Also included in this title are mandatory accounts to provide for Federal retiree annuities, health benefits, and life insurance. The conferees have provided a total of $15,986,378,000 for this title in fiscal year 2001. 
   For the first time in 4 years, the administration has requested funding for courthouse construction. Although we have not been able to fund the entire list due to limited resources, we have included funding for four courthouse projects in fiscal year 2001, as well as an additional four projects in fiscal year 2002. 
   Again, I thank the ranking member of our subcommittee, Senator DORGAN, for his hard work and support. Certainly this bill would not have been possible without his assistance. Too often we forget the hard work of staff--for Senator DORGAN, Chip Walgren and Steve Monteiro; for the majority, Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula Edwards--who deserve a great deal of credit for the long hours, nights, and sometimes weekends spent in trying to put this section of the bill together. I believe this conference report deserves the support of the Senate. 
   One last thing, Mr. President. We are still obviously in a state of shock and loss at the death of our colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell, who was a tireless worker in trying to reduce youth violence and drug use. His life was a model of what youngsters should aspire to. In his honor, we have named the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's newest dormitory building at Glynco, GA, for him.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my friend and colleague from North Dakota. 
   His advice and counsel has been extremely important to me. I appreciate his comments very much. As I mentioned in my opening statement, I would have preferred to bring the bill to the floor as a self-standing bill, too. We are simply running out of time with only less than 3 weeks, I guess, of actual workdays before we adjourn for the year. It just was not possible this year. 
   But I look forward to working with him. If we do bring some emergency spending bill to the floor through the full committee, I would ask to work with him to try to fill in some of the holes we have missed in this bill. 
   With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill making certain technical amendments to laws relating to Native Americans. As my colleagues know, Congress typically considers legislation like this every year or so. This bill provides an opportunity to address a series of corrections to the law or other non-controversial, minor amendments to Indian laws in one broad stroke, rather than having to introduce several separate bills. 
   This bill includes amendments regarding issues of importance to a number of my colleagues that have been brought to my attention over recent months. The amendments include, for instance, one-year reauthorizations of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, as well as a clarification of a bill signed into law earlier this year relating to the status of certain lands held in trust by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. 
   All amendments included in this bill will serve to promote the original intent of the affected laws, and do not alter the meaning or substance of the laws they amend. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, the sole purpose of which is to ensure that the laws this body has already passed are carried forward in the way we originally intended.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Establishment Act of 2000, legislation which will finally recognize and memorialize the hallowed ground on which hundreds of peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians were massacred by members of the Colorado Militia. 
   The legislation I introduce today follows The Sand Creek Massacre Historic Site Study Act of 1998, legislation I introduced and Congress approved to study the suitability of creating an enduring memorial to the slain innocents who were camped peacefully near Sand Creek, in Kiowa County, in Colorado on November 28, 1868. 
   Much has been written about the horrors visited upon the plains Indians in the territories of the Western United States in the latter half of the 19th century. However, what has been lost for more than a century is a comprehensive understanding of the events of that day in a grove of cottonwood trees along Sand Creek now SE Colorado. In some cases denial of the events of the day or a sense that ``the Indians had it coming'' has prevailed. 
   This legislation finally recognizes a shameful event in our country's history based on scientific studies, and  makes it clear America has the strength and resolve to face its past and learn the painful lessons that come with intolerance. 
   The indisputable facts are these: 700 members of the Colorado Militia, commanded by Colonel John Chivington struck at dawn that November day, attacking a camp of Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians settled under the U.S. Flag and a white flag which the Indian Chiefs Black Kettle and White Antelope were told by the U.S. would protect them from military attack. 
   By day's end, almost 150 Indians, many of them women, children and the elderly, lay dead. Chivington's men reportedly desecrated the bodies of the dead after the massacre, and 
   newspaper reports from Denver at the time told of the troops displaying Indian body parts in a gruesome display as they rode through the streets of Colorado's largest city following the attack. 
   The perpetrators of this horrible attack which left Indian women and even babies dead, were never brought to justice even after a congressional investigation concerning this brutality. 
   The legislation I introduce today authorizes the National Park Service to enter into negotiations with willing sellers only, in an attempt to secure property inside a boundary which encompasses approximately 12,470 acres as identified by the National Park Service, for a lasting memorial to events of that fateful day. 
   This legislation has been developed over the course of the last 18 months. It represents a remarkable effort which brought divergent points of view together to define the events of that day and to plan for the future protection of this site. The National Park Service, with the cooperation of the Kiowa County Commissioners, the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the Northern Arapaho Tribe, the State of Colorado and many local landowners and volunteers have completed extensive cultural, geomorphological and physical studies of the area where the massacre occurred. 
   All of those involved in this project agree, not acting now is not a option. This legislation does not compel any private property owner to sell his or her property to the federal government. It allows the National Park Service to negotiate with willing sellers to secure property at fair market value, for a national memorial. This process could take years. However, several willing sellers have come forward and are willing to negotiate with the NPS. The property they own has been identified by the NPS as suitable for a memorial. Additional acquisitions of property from willing sellers could come in the future. However, the Sand Creek National Historic Site could never extend beyond the 12,470 acres identified by the site resource study already completed. 
   This legislation has come to being because all of those involved have exhibited an extraordinary ability to put aside their differences, look with equal measure at the scientific evidence and the oral traditions of the Tribes, and come up with a plan that equally honors the memory of those killed and the rights of the private property owners who have been faithful and responsible stewards of this site. We have a window of opportunity here that will not always be available. I encourage my colleagues to respect the memory of those so brutally killed and support the creation of a National Historic Site on this hallowed ground in Kiowa County, in Colorado.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which would preserve over 130,000 acres of land in Western Colorado. This legislation is supported locally by property owners, county commissioners, environmentalists, and recreational groups. My bill is a Senate companion to H.R. 4275 which was introduced by my colleague and fellow Coloradan Representative SCOTT MCINNIS.  
   The areas proposed for Wildernesss Protection are the Black Ridge and Ruby Canyons of the Grand Valley and Rabbit Valley near Grand Junction, Colorado. They contain unique and valuable scenic, recreational, multiple use, paleontological, natural, and wildlife components. This historic rural western setting provides extensive opportunities for recreational activities, and are publicly used for hiking, camping, and grazing. This area is truly worthy of additional protection as a national conservation area. 
   This legislation has the support of the administration and should easily be signed into law. The only issue confronting us is the limited amount of time left in the 106th Congress. I hope we will be able to move this legislation quickly through the process and that it will not get bogged down in partisan politics. It simply is the right thing to do.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, on September 15, 1999, I introduced S. 1586, the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000. At that time I pledged to work with all interested parties to address the vexing problems associated with fractionated ownership of Indian lands. These lands were carved out of Indian reservations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Within only a few generations, the ownership of the allotments was divided among dozens of the heirs of the original owners of these parcels. This situation has only grown worse as each decade passes. 
   In 1983, Congress tried to solve fractionation when it enacted the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), P.L. 94-459. The ILCA prevented small undivided interests from passing by either devise or descent. Only those interests that produced more than $100 in revenue in the preceding year were exempted. In 1987 the Supreme Court ruled in Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, that those provisions of the ILCA violated the 5th Amendment by taking property without just compensation. 
   Then in 1992, the General Accounting Office surveyed 12 Indian reservations with fractionated ownership and reported to Congress:   
   BIA's workload for ownership records is substantial. The agency maintains about 1.1 million records for the 12 reservations. Over 60 percent of the records represent small ownership interests of Indian individuals--some as small as one four thousandth of 1 percent. (GAO/RCED-92-96BR)  
   In 1994, the Department of Interior began a national consultation with tribal leaders and landowners concerning the need to address fractionation through a comprehensive legislative proposal. Based on these consultations, in June 1997, the Administration submitted a legislative proposal on land fractionation to Congress. 
   Also in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled in Babbitt v. Youpee, 519 U.S. 234 that the 1984 amendments to the ILCA did not go far enough to alter the Court's previous finding that the ILCA violated the 5th Amendment. 
   On November 4, 2000, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee (SCIA) held a joint hearing on S. 1586 with the House Committee on Resources. 
   On March 23, 2000, the SCIA reported S. 1586. Relying on a suggestion in the Supreme Court's 1987 opinion, the reported bill allowed an owner to devise fractional interests of less than 2%, but eliminated the intestate descent of such interests. These interests were allowed to ``escheat'' to the tribe exercising jurisdiction over the parcel. Because of the controversy associated with the escheat provision, Committee staff continued to work with interested parties to develop a proposal for addressing fractionation without the use of escheat. 
   On June 14, 2000, the SCIA reported S. 1586 with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. In response to concerns that probate reform should be comprehensive, the reported version of the bill was not limited to smaller fractional interests. Instead the bill addressed both the problem of fractionated ownership and the loss of trust land through devise and descent. The bill provided that non-Indian heirs and devisees would receive ``non-Indian interests in Indian land,'' rather than fee title to trust and restricted land. In most instances, these interests would operate as if they were a life estate in the interest.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is correct. The Committee on Indian Affairs has received a series of communications from Native American tribes and tribal organizations indicating their opposition to eight of the hundreds of proposed provisions. These eight ``impasse'' issues appear to involve particularly sensitive matters which the Indian tribes believe would seriously set back the advances these tribes have made in the field of tribal self-governance during the past decade.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. The tribal representatives have provided the Committee with a list of eight issues. They have asked the Department to agree to not publish any regulatory provision which: limits the reallocation authority of a Self-Governance Tribe/consortium by requiring that reallocation of funds may only be between programs in annual funding agreements; limits the local decision-making of a Self-Governance Tribe/consortium by requiring that funds in an annual funding agreement shall only be spent on specific programs listed in such funding agreement; prohibits Tribal Base funding from including other recurring funding within Tribal Priority Allocations; requires renegotiation or rejection of a previously executed Self-Governance 
   Compact or Funding Agreement or a provision therein; prohibits a Self-Governance Tribe/consortium from investing funds received under Self-Governance Compacts in a manner consistent with the ``prudent investor'' standard; requires any Self-Governance Tribe/consortium to adopt ``conflict of interest'' standards which differ from those previously adopted by its governing body; applies project-specific construction requirements to a tribal assumption of project design and other construction management services or of road construction activities involving more than one project; or fails to provide that ``Inherent Federal functions'' for purposes of the published regulations shall mean those Federal functions that cannot be legally transferred to a Self-Governance Tribe/consortium.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. The Senator is correct. In 1994, the Congress received a series of complaints from Indian tribes that the Department was attempting to unilaterally amend agreements it had previously reached with Indian tribes who were assuming functions previously carried out by Federal officials. The Congress had to remind the Department in 1994 that it must treat the agreements it reached with Indian tribes as bilateral accords that cannot be amended except by mutual consent. Now, the Department is insisting on a regulation that would permit it to unilaterally revise agreements it had previously reached on a bilateral basis with individual Indian tribes. The American Indian and Alaska Native organizations find these and the remaining seven regulatory provisions objectionable, and I agree with them.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President today I am pleased to introduce the Indian Gaming Regulatory Improvement Act of 2000 to make specific and what I feel are needed changes to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, 25 U.S.C. &#167;2701, et seq. (``IGRA''). 
   The IGRA was signed into law in 1988 with two broad goals in mind: First, to provide for the continued economic opportunities tribal gaming presents to Indian tribes, and second, to provide a regulatory framework for tribal gaming to ensure the integrity of such gaming for the benefit of tribes as well as customers of tribal gaming operations. 
   In 1988, tribal gaming was a relative new activity and in 12 years tribal gaming gross revenues have grown from $500 million to $8.26 billion. By statute these revenues are spent by tribal governments on physical infrastructure, general welfare and the betterment of Indian and surrounding non-Indian communities. 
   For the 198 tribes that now conduct some form of gaming the economic benefits for the tribes as well as surrounding communities cannot be ignored. For these communities collectively, unemployment has dropped and tribes who operate gaming have been able to provide for housing, health care and education for their members and to generate hundreds of thousands of jobs for Indians and non-Indians alike. 
   The legislation I am introducing today is not intended and should not be viewed as a comprehensive attempt to remedy all matters that have arisen in the past 12 years. Rather, this bill takes aim at very specific items. 
   1. With regard to gaming fees assessed against tribal operations, this bill will require the Federal National Indian Gaming Commission to levy fees that are reasonably related to the duties of and services provided by the Commission to tribes, and in certain instances to reduce the level of fees payable by those operations; 
   2. It establishes a Trust Fund for such fees that can only be tapped for the specific activities of the Commission mandated by the IGRA; 
   3. It provides statutory authority for the Commission to establish through a negotiated rule-making process, Minimum Standards for the conduct of tribal gaming, acknowledging that for class III gaming the standards are to be determined by the tribe and the state through negotiated gaming compacts; 
   4. It authorizes technical assistance to tribes for a number of purposes including strengthening tribal regulatory regimes; assessing the feasibility of non-gaming economic development activities on Indian lands; providing treatment services for problem gamblers; and for other purposes not inconsistent with the IGRA; 
   5. It launches a negotiated rulemaking to eventually clarify the current conflict between the IGRA and other Federal law with regard to the classification of certain games conducted by tribes; and 
   6. Last, to bring the Commission in line with all other Federal agencies it specifically subjects the Commission to the reporting and other requirements of the Federal Government Performance and Results Act. 
   Mr. President, while there are other matters that Indian tribes and others wish to address that are not included in this bill, I am hopeful that people of good will find this legislation to be appropriate, reasonable and targeted to specific issues that he arisen in the part 12 years. 
   It is my hope that we can debate and discuss the bill in Committee to get the views of affected parties and iron out whatever differences there may be.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I came to the floor to tell my colleagues my disappointment that we are not able to move forward with the Treasury and general government bill. It is certainly not a perfect bill, but it is a darn good bill. As chairman of the subcommittee, I can say that we worked very hard on that. I remind my friends that we only have about 28 working days left--not much to complete the whole appropriations process, which we are required to do by law. That gets us in trouble. 
   Two years ago, we didn't have the opportunity to complete the Treasury bill, and it ended up in what is commonly referred to as the omnibus bill. People in the Senate understand what  that is, but to the millions of Americans who watch these proceedings, the omnibus bill is, in one word, a mess. It is that bill where we stick everything in at the end that we didn't have time to finish. We end up with a bill a foot thick and weighs 30 pounds, with 3,000 to 5,000 pages. Nobody in this body can read it all because we don't have the time before we have to vote on it. That is how we get in trouble. We vote to pass it through as a last-minute emergency. When we go home, people say: Why did you vote to give money to that frivolous thing on page 2,403? And we don't even know why we voted for it, which is why it is so important to get the bills through one by one. 
   Let me mention a little bit about the Treasury and general government bill as it is going to come to the floor, if we can get an agreement. I don't think there is anybody in this body who doesn't know that we have a sieve, not a border, between the U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and Mexico. Our customs people are severely understaffed and underfunded. If you want to stop drugs at the border, the money to do that is in this bill. We need to do that. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas we started about 8 years ago expanded to about 44 States and many cities. That is the agency that coordinates reduction of drug use and trafficking among our local law enforcement, State law enforcement, and Federal law enforcement. 
   If you want to reduce drug trafficking, the money is in this bill. We also have upkeep and maintenance for Federal buildings. A number of them nationwide are in disrepair, as everybody knows. We have to put money into making sure the buildings are sound, safe, and fireproof. We are not doing that very well. The money to do that is in this bill, too. If you want to reduce drug violence, the money to do that is in this bill. We know this is a very important year for the Secret Service. They are being asked to do more in an election year, with limited resources. The money to do that is also in this bill. 
   In fact, as all of us know, there are many, many requests by individual Senators in all of these bills. I was going through the list on our bill. We have 13 pages of requests by individual Senators for money in this bill. It is rather surprising to me that some of the Senators who are opposing bringing this bill to the floor are the ones who asked for money to be put in the bill in the first place. It is similar to when we consider the so-called pay raise and people demagog it, the thing passes, and they quietly pocket the money and leave. We have the same situation with this bill. A lot of people have very important programs in this bill. Again, there are 13 pages of things Senators want in this bill. 
   Also, Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about a program which I believe deserves the support of the Senate--the Gang Resistance Education and Training or GREAT Program. GREAT is administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, in partnership with State and local law enforcement. 
   Unfortunately, gang activity has increased in our country in recent years. ATF has developed a program to give our children the tools they need to be able to resist the temptation to belong to a gang. 
   The GREAT program is eight years old, and has grown from a pilot program in Arizona to classrooms all over the United States--and in Puerto Rico, Canada, and overseas military bases. ATF estimates that about 2 million students have received GREAT training. 
   GREAT was designed to provide gang prevention and antiviolence instruction to children in a classroom setting. ATF trains local law enforcement officers to teach these classes, and provides grants to their offices to help pay for their time. 
   This program is having a positive effect on student activities and behaviors, and is deterring them from involvement in gangs. A side benefit is that the graduates seem to be doing a better job of communicating with their parents and teachers, and getting better grades. 
   For the third year in a row, the Administration is requesting only 10 million dollars for grants for the GREAT program. For the last two years, Congress felt that wasn't enough to fund the many requests for help from State and local law enforcement and provided 13 million dollars for GREAT grants. 10 million dollars still isn't enough. I urge my colleagues to support the effort of the Committee to again provide 13 million dollars for grants to State and local law enforcement for this worthwhile and effective program. 
   I hope my colleagues will reach some consensus and allow us to move forward. It is an extremely important bill, and I certainly urge our leadership to try to get this to the floor. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I have one further comment. Both of these officers put their lives on the line, as all of our Capitol Police officers do and, indeed, officers in law enforcement across the country. J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson were personal friends to many of us. I used to be a policeman years ago, as some of my colleagues know. I collect shoulder patches, which are pretty easy to get. Most police organizations will send them to you if you like to collect them. John had a collection and we used to trade shoulder patches. If he had two of a patch I didn't have, or if I had two of one he didn't have, we would trade back and forth. 
   When you talk about the Capitol Police, they are not just uniforms; these are real people with real lives and real families. 
   Both of them left a wife and children, as the Presiding Officer knows. It has been 2 years, but they are still fresh in my mind--and that is a tragedy. 
   Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, last night the Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations bill for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies with my support. Today I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Manager of the bill, Senator COCHRAN, for his willingness to accept my amendment to require that funds available in the Food Stamp Program be used for the purchase of bison meat for use in the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). This amendment was cosponsored by Senators DORGAN, CONRAD and DOMENICI. 
   The buffalo has always played an important role in Native American culture, religion and history, providing Indian people with clothing, tools, and food. Bison meat is extremely healthy, low fat, and high protein meat source that in the past was a staple of nutrition for Indian people. However, when our own government decided it was best for tribes to be placed on reservations, often far away from their traditional lands, tribes lost this nutritious food source and from this, we are seeing some severe and devastating effects on the health of our Native communities. 
   Today, Native Americans suffer from diabetes and heart disease at five times the rate of any other group in the United States. Diabetes is a killer and the cure for it is elusive. One of the things we can do is to encourage a better diet for Native people. This is awfully hard to do when the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations is the main source of food for nearly 125,000 Native Americans and most of the meat that they do receive is canned and high in fat and sodium. 
   Two years ago USDA purchase $2 million in bison, and then another $6 million in 1999 through a bonus buy purchase and had enormous success  with it. My office has received numerous requests from Tribal Food Distribution Program Directors, tribal recipients and buffalo producers to help secure additional of bison. I sent a letter to Secretary Glickman requesting such purchases and his response is not encouraging. 
   Mr. President, the amendment I offered will direct USDA to use $7.3 million of the Food Stamp Program to purchase bison meat. 
   The Food Stamp Program, funded at around $21 billion, is expected to have a substantial surplus from lower participation given our healthy economy and low unemployment rate. It only seems reasonable that we could use a very small portion of those funds to help provide a healthier and culturally preferred choice of food for Native Americans. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the Chairman and the Committee including $123,000,000 in emergency funding for the Customs Service Automated Commercial System, or ACS. The current legacy computer system of the Customs Service is in dire need of this emergency funding. This 16 year old system regularly experiences what is called ``brownouts'' or system-wide outages. When this system goes down, believe it or not, the Customs Service must process all entries by hand. These outages are only becoming more frequent and they are lasting longer and longer. You can imagine the delays at the border that this situation causes. For example, in an outage in March at the Buffalo port, a five-hour delay generated so much paper that the entry documents were piled so high Customs could not see their customers on the other side of the counter. Not only do these outages create long lines at the ports, but after the system is back up and running, Customs employees must then work overtime trying to enter all of the paper entries generated during the outage. Therefore, Mr. President, I am pleased that the Committee has included this funding to address this very serious issue.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to address the terrible loss the Senate suffered yesterday, when PAUL COVERDELL left this Earth. I was truly shocked by the news. Just last week, PAUL was on the floor of the Senate, working in his quiet and non-assuming way. Yesterday, I was writing him a get-well card. Today, he is gone. 
   PAUL was a dedicated public servant. He served the state of Georgia and this nation in the Army, the legislature, as a businessman, as the head of the Peace Corps and in the U.S. Senate. The respect he had earned from his colleagues here is evident in his appointment to numerous task forces and his election to a leadership position. His passing is a major loss to this body and this great country. 
   Since I am also from a state where agriculture is an important part of the economy, PAUL was a valuable ally in ensuring the family farms do not disappear. I also admired his work to keep our children safe from drugs and crime, a priority he and I shared. PAUL represented the best of America: a belief that people flourish when they have the freedom to work and make their own decisions. 
   PAUL will truly be missed. He stood out in the Senate for the simple reason that he never drew attention to himself. In a business where egos can run rampant, PAUL did not display one. He preferred to get things done. 
   My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Nancy, and their family. They have some tough days ahead of them. I hope they can look back, as I do, at the impressive record of PAUL's work with a sense of pride. I am thankful for the chance to know such a man.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator BINGAMAN and others in this Sense of the Senate Resolution related to a class action lawsuit that was filed some years ago by several Indian tribes against Secretary Babbitt for failure to fully pay for contract support costs necessary for tribal contractors to carry out Federal programs and services under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450 et seq. 
   To fully understand this issue a little background is in order. I was the proud sponsors of S. Res. 277, commemorating the 30th anniversary of President Nixon's ``Special Message to Congress on Indian Affairs'' in which he laid the foundation for modern Federal Indian policy--Indian Self Determination. Built on the twin pillars of political self determination and economic self sufficiency, this policy continues to be a driving force in the economic progress some tribes are making.  
   The 1975 ISDEA was enacted to further this policy by authorizing Indian tribes to contract for the performance of Federal programs and services by ``stepping into the shoes'' of the United States. 
   Now, 25 years later, nearly one-half of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service programs and services are subject to tribal contracts and compacts. 
   To facilitate these contracts, the United States is obligated to provide the administration costs--or ``contract support costs''--to those tribes that carry out ISDEA contracts, just as it does to military contractors, research universities and other entities. 
   The Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Babbitt case resulted in a judgment of $82 million against the U.S. to be paid from the Judgment Fund for failure to pay these contract support costs. Under the law applicable to this case, the Treasury Department may seek to have the BIA reimburse the Judgment Fund for this amount. The funds for reimbursement would come from the BIA's operating budget, resulting in manifest inequity for not only the plaintiff tribes but for all tribes who depend on BIA funds for core programs such as law enforcement, education, child care, and others. 
   This sense of the Senate amendment would not prevent the kind of reimbursement that the tribes and I fear, but expresses the consensus of the Senate that the agencies involved--the BIA and the IHS--should declare Indian program funds unavailable for purposes of reimbursement. 
   I remain hopeful that stronger language can be crafted to protect these funds, and in the interim lend my support to this amendment. I want to commend Senator BINGAMAN for his hard work in finding a solution that does not run afoul of the budget rules and commit to working with him and others as we proceed to conference in this bill.

   In 1989 and 1990 I had the pleasure of working on legislation that became the 1990 Act which was enacted with two goals in mind: (1) to promote the market for Indian arts and crafts; and (2) to enforce the provisions of the Act to protect the integrity of authentic Indian goods and Indian artisans. 
   Today's market for Indian-made goods is roughly $1 billion, but by some estimates half of that demand, or nearly $500 million, is satisfied by counterfeit goods, much of which is produced off-shore and imported illegally into the United States. 
   The growing influx of inauthentic Indian arts and crafts has not only weakened the market and consumer confidence in Indian goods, but has also endangered traditional Indian customs and practices. 
   Native communities are plagued by rampant unemployment and a stagnant economy, and the growing influx of inauthentic Indian arts and crafts continues to decimate one of the few forms of entrepreneurship and economic development on Indian reservations. 
   In addition, this influx also erodes the propagation and practice of traditional beliefs and customs by Native people and must be stopped for that reason alone. 
   Under the existing Act, the Indian Arts and Crafts Board (``IACB'') is charged with not only promoting Indian arts and crafts, but also has a key role in the enforcement of the Act's civil and criminal provisions. In this role the IACB is required by law to work with the Department of justice to bring complaints against potential violators of the Act. 
   As of July, 2000, neither the IACB nor the Department of Justice have produced the kind of enforcement results Congress intended when it enacted the 1990 Act. In fact, there has yet to be a single criminal or civil prosecution of the Act, with Indian tribes themselves being forced to take up the slack. 
   The bill that I am introducing today, would improve enforcement of the Act by (1) enhancing the ability of the plaintiff to assess and calculate damages; (2) authorizing Indian arts and crafts organizations and individual Indians to bring suit for alleged violations of the Act; (3) authorizing a portion of the damages collected to reimburse the IACB for the costs of its role in investigating and bringing about the successful prosecution of the suit; and (4) requiring more precise definitions through the regulations process. 
   This bill will provide the tools needed to stem the flow of these goods, protect legitimate Indian artisans, and eliminate the economic incentive to steal from Native people that which is theirs. 
   I am hopeful that this legislation will signal a new day in the enforcement of the Act and encourage both the economic and cultural benefits of authentic Indian arts and crafts.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I intend to vote for H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act, as amended. On January 19, 1999, I introduced the companion bill, S. 38, to the original House bill, along with my colleagues, Senators MACK and HUTCHISON. I felt then, as I do now, this legislation is of vital importance to farmers and family business owners. 
   Since the time that I introduced the original companion to H.R. 8, I have heard from hundreds of Coloradans and numerous national organizations about the need to eliminate this burdensome and overreaching tax. I believe that eliminating this tax is a fundamental issue of fairness. Death should not be an event government prospers from. 
   Estate and gift taxes continue to be an enormous burden on American families, particularly those who pursue the American dream of owning their own business. It is often the family-owned businesses and farms that are hit with the highest tax rate when they are handed down to descendants--often immediately following the death of a loved one. Families ought to be encouraged, not discouraged, from building successful farms, ranches and businesses and keeping the ownership of those enterprises within the families that worked to make them successful. 
   These taxes, and the financial burdens and difficulties they create come at the worst possible time. Making a terrible situation worse is the fact that the rate of this estate tax is crushing, reaching as high as 55 percent for the highest bracket. That's higher than even the highest income tax rate bracket of 39 percent. Furthermore, the tax is due as soon as the business is turned over to the heir, allowing no time for financial planning or the setting aside of money to pay the tax bills. Estate and gift taxes right now are one of the leading reasons why the number of family-owned farms and businesses are declining; the burden of this tax is simply too much for many American families to bear. 
   This tax sends the troubling message that families should either sell the business while they are still alive in order to spare their descendants this huge tax after their passing, or rundown the value of the business, so that  it won't make it into their higher tax brackets. This is not how America was built. Private investment and initiative has historically been a strong part of our American heritage and we should encourage those values, not tax successful family businesses into submission. 
   That is why I will vote for this important legislation. We need to change the message we are sending to farmers and family business owners. The Death-tax repeal has been endorsed by numerous organizations that represent family farms and businesses such as the National Federation of Independent Business, the Farm Bureau, the Family Business Estate Tax Coalition, National Association of Women Business Owners, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the National Indian Business Association, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Neighborhoods. 
   Mr. President, if there is one thing Congress absolutely ought to do while we are trusted with our jobs it should be to protect American families and their interests. This tax is fundamentally unfair and would never survive if it were being proposed today. I urge my colleagues to support the repeal of the Death-tax and help restore a small degree of integrity to the tax structure imposed on America's families. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend. 
   Mr. President, certainly there are Members of this Chamber who are downright against gaming. I understand that. As Senator INOUYE mentioned, even his State has no gaming. But I do not believe that is what this debate is about. For me, very frankly, it is about whether we keep our word or we do not keep our word. 
   The Senator mentioned that literally for every treaty ever signed by the Federal Government, Indian tribes ended up losing by virtue of the Government breaking the treaty. 
   No one speaks more eloquently than Senator INOUYE about the destructive forces that have been heaped upon American Indians at the hands of the U.S. Government. I think he does it very eloquently because of his own background. He is a man of great bravery, who just received America's highest award. He is a Medal of Honor recipient. Yet he fought in a war during which his own people were interned in camps at the hands of the Federal Government. Certainly, Senator INOUYE is held in the highest esteem throughout Indian country, as he is in this body. 
   But I think many of our colleagues ought to study the old treaties, even though most of them were broken--not all--by the Federal Government. Indian people have a very special relationship with the Federal Government. It would do us well if we read some of the old promises we made and didn't keep. 
   The Senator talked a little about the problems we have on reservations. But  I don't think it is really understood by people who spend most of their time, as we say, ``outside the reservation.'' You ought to go to Pine Ridge, SD, where unemployment is 70 percent, usually. It is rarely less than 50 percent. It is sometimes higher than 70 percent--where every third young lady tries suicide before she is out of her teenage years; and young men, too. Too many of them succeed. 
   With fetal alcohol syndrome compared to the national average, 1 out of every 50,000 babies born in America suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome. For those who do not know what that is, that is a disease they get when they are inside of their mother because their mother drinks. It is about 1 out of 50,000 nationwide. But in Pine Ridge, SD, in some years it is 1 out of 4 babies. It is a disease that is totally preventable. Yet it is incurable once they have it. They get it from their mother drinking too much. They are institutionalized for life, at a huge cost in terms of human tragedy and the American taxpayer. 
   If you had those numbers in any town in America--whether it is the high school dropout rate, or the suicide rate, whether it is death by violent actions, whether it is fetal alcohol syndrome, or anything else--if you had anything near that in the outside culture, it would be considered devastating to that community. Believe me, people would be here on the floor clamoring for the Senate to do something about it. 
   There are very few things that work on Indian reservations that try to bring new money to the reservation. 
   In 1988, when Senator INOUYE was the leader on the Senate side on the Indian Gaming and Regulatory Act, and I was on the House side as one of the people involved originally in the writing of that bill, certainly then none of us knew that it would grow to such proportions. But clearly it has done some good. It is not all good. Obviously, there are stresses and pressures. When you increase any kind of economic activity in a 
   local community, there are more people on the highways. There are more people in the schools and parks. We understand that. 
   If you look at the outside of it in terms of what it has done to help youngsters with scholarships, what it has done to help senior citizens who had no other income, and what it has done to provide money for tribes that have been able to invest that money into other enterprises, it is overwhelmingly positive. 
   I have to tell you that it seems that every year we have to fight this fight. Almost every year, somebody comes down here with a microphone who wants to take a hit at the little opportunities Indians have in Indian country because of gaming. 
   I point out, my gosh, that I live on the Southern Ute Reservation in Colorado 150 yards from a tribal casino. I see who works it. I see if there is any increase in crime--or other kinds of wild accusations we sometimes hear on the Senate floor. Believe me, they are mostly wrong. 
   First of all, the majority of people who work in the Indian reservations are not Indian. At least 50 percent in most of the casinos are not Indians. It has helped whole communities. They pay income taxes just as anybody else--Indian people and non-Indian. It has put revenue into the coffers of the Federal Government and State governments. 
   Under Federal law, in 1988, as you know, tribes were limited to the types of gaming allowed under the laws of the States in which they reside. Some States simply don't allow gaming at all. Therefore, those tribes in those States can't do it. We made sure that the tribes were factored in in 1988. In my own State, tribes are limited to just slot machines and low-stakes table games. 
   The State of our friend from New Mexico has a little higher limit. Other States have higher limits. But it is with the approval of the States under a contractual agreement between the States and the tribes. 
   In Utah, there is no gambling whatsoever. Therefore, the tribes cannot have any form of gaming. 
   The intent of the Federal Indian Gaming Act was that in States where gaming is limited or prohibited, tribes would be similarly limited or prohibited. It was an agreement made with the States. They were not locked out. They were completely included in the process and certainly in the dialog when we wrote this bill in the first place. 
   There are many tribes and States that sat down and worked out their agreements that are binding and effective. 
   We often hear about an isolated case where something is not working very well. But often we don't study all of the overwhelmingly positive effects. 
   There are some Governors whom we know who have refused to negotiate at all with the tribes in their States, leaving those tribes without the ability to legally conduct gaming activities. That wasn't assumed. We passed the IGRA Act in 1988. We didn't think there would be some Governors who simply wouldn't negotiate and would stonewall and not come to the table. But there have been some. 
   We should remember how we got here. 
   In the wake of the 1987 Cabazon decision by the Supreme Court which held that State gaming laws did not apply to Indian gaming conducted on Indian lands, States clamored for a role in the writing of IGRA and regulating of the gaming on Indian lands. They got it. 
   Congress responded in 1988 by enacting the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act which provided an unprecedented opportunity for States to participate in the conduct and regulation of Indian gaming conducted entirely on Indian lands. 
   Reverse that a little bit. Do you think Indian tribes are in the loop or are able to participate in the conduct of regulation of State activities that are off Indian lands? They don't have the voice that States do within tribal governments. 
   That act was a compromise and for the first time gave the State governments a role in what gaming would occur on Indian lands. While Congress intended State participation, we intended to participate but we never intended that the States' refusal to negotiate would serve as an effective veto by any State over a tribe's right to conduct such gaming. 
   Today's debate is about whether a Governor or State can limit the type of activity of certain groups simply by refusing to negotiate. That is unfair. I think it is un-American. 
   As my colleagues know, I happen to be from the West. Most westerners are strong States rights people. We continually harangue the Federal Government for eroding States rights. We are always down here over business development or use of public lands. If it is good enough for a tribe to have to negotiate, then it should also be good enough for the State to have to negotiate, as was implied in IGRA. 
   While I believe that each State's public policy should determine the scope of gaming in that State, I also believe the current state of the law gives States what is in reality a veto over tribes. That is unacceptable. 
   I should point out to my colleagues that in many cases non-Indian gaming is promoted and even operated by State governments, such as State lotteries. It is an element of competition that should not be lost on this body. No one wants to share the revenue if they think they can make it all. I understand that. That is American business. But I believe some States have refused to bargain simply in order to preserve that monopoly on gaming. 
   To begin to break the stalemate, the Interior Department proposed a process based on the IGRA statute. Senator INOUYE alluded to that. Though the process may need refinement, I don't believe the Secretary should be stopped from developing alternative approaches to this impasse. 
   I believe it is in the interests of all parties that the Federal courts be allowed to render final, binding decisions to clarify the authority of the Secretary. That has not been finished. That is ongoing now. Adoption of this amendment would certainly short circuit that process. 
   By the way, there has been a similar amendment already rejected by the House of Representatives. I think it will unduly interfere with the litigation that is now at hand and deny the parties the clarification they need. 
   Last year, Secretary Babbitt made a commitment to Chairman GORTON, to the Senate as a whole, to refrain from implementing any further regulations until the Federal courts, including the  appellate level, rule on the merits of the legal issues involved. That litigation is now endangered by this amendment, which prohibits the Secretary from taking any action to implement those regulations, including the actions that will allow the matter to ``ripen'' and allow it to be pursued to a conclusion. 
   Coming from a Western State, I am as supportive as anyone in this body of States rights, but those who say this process ``overrides the Governors'' are wrong. 
   Under the proposal, if a State objects to a decision made by the Interior Secretary, that State can challenge the decision in Federal court. 
   For those who fear the Department is acting without oversight I point out that Congress has the authority to review any proposed regulations before they take effect. 
   As the proposal comes before the authorizing committees, any new regulations will get a careful review and if they are found wanting, they will not pass. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and allow the process to work. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am delighted to speak on behalf of Senator DANIEL K. INOUYE, a man who has distinguished himself in the House and now in the Senate for more than 40 years. He is also a man for whom I have tremendous respect and regard as a truly national leader on a wide range of issues. Later today at a White House ceremony, DANIEL INOUYE will be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by the President. 
   This memorable occasion is one that has been much anticipated and long  overdue. I have had the honor and opportunity to serve with Senator INOUYE in Congress over the past 14 years, and we have worked side by side on the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs over the past 8 years. On many occasions, I have witnessed his courage and leadership in standing up for serious issues and problems that have affected all Americans including our collective national defense. 
   These qualities and traits can be witnessed throughout Senator INOUYE's life, career, and his service in the United States Army during World War II. I would like to recount for those unfamiliar with the experience of DAN INOUYE and the ``Go for Broke'' regiment a brief history of the heroics and commitment to his men and the United States during his service in the 2nd Battalion, 442nd ``Go for Broke'' Regimental Combat Team in the War. 
   In April of 1945, Army 1st Lieutenant DANIEL K. INOUYE, was leading a platoon of the 2nd Battalion, when it came under fire from a bunker manned by Italian Fascists fighting for their Axis partners the Nazis. There was no cover on the hill, so INOUYE crawled up alone to scout. As he was taking out a hand grenade to destroy the first position, he was hit in the abdomen by a bullet which came out his back, barely missing his spine. Although wounded, INOUYE was still able to pull the pin out of the grenade and run to within five yards of the nearest of the three machine guns, and throw the grenade inside the position. He continued to lead the platoon and advance alone against a machine gun nest which had his men pinned down. He tossed two hand grenades with devastating effect before his right arm was shattered by a German rifle grenade at close range. With his left hand, he tossed his last grenade and attacked the Italian Fascists with a submachine gun. Then he was hit in his right leg and fell down the hill. INOUYE refused to be evacuated until his men were deployed in defensive positions. 
   First Lieutenant INOUYE spent 20 months in Army hospitals after losing his right arm. He returned to Hawaii as a Captain with a Distinguished Service Cross, Bronze Star, Purple Heart with cluster, and 12 other medals and citations. 
   After graduating with a law degree from George Washington University, he entered politics, and after Hawaii became a state DAN INOUYE won election to the United States House of Representatives as the state's first Congressman. He was reelected to a full term in 1960 and won election to the United States Senate in 1962. Mr. President, I cannot fully express to you or others the deep respect I have for this man, to the leadership he has provided to this country and the sacrifices he has made during these accomplishments. Senator INOUYE continues to inspire admiration and respect among all who serve with him--Republicans and Democrats alike. DAN INOUYE is a leader and hero to Americans across the country and a man that I am proud to consider my colleague as well as my friend. 
   I am pleased that the President has chosen to recognize his service and bestow upon such a deserving man as DAN INOUYE the Medal of Honor. It is my hope that young people around our country will look to DAN INOUYE and his many traits and accomplishments--Army officer, Congressman, Senator--and realize as he does that first and foremost, he is an American. In this regard I would like to quote Major General Jacob Devers, Chief of the Army Field Offices, ``These men ..... more than earned the right to be called just Americans, not Japanese Americans. Their Americanism may be described only by degree, and that the highest.'' 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I seek recognition to raise an issue of importance to my home state of Colorado with the distinguished chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator SHELBY. 
   I commend my friend and colleague from Alabama, Senator SHELBY, for his effective leadership on this important Transportation Appropriations bill. I take this opportunity to call to his attention a matter of highway safety in the increasingly congested Denver Metro area, particularly the I-25 ramps project near downtown Denver. 
   I-25 is the most congested highway artery in the State of Colorado and has more accidents per miles driven than any other traffic corridor in the State. All of the ramps in this project area are separated by inadequate distances. Funds for this project would increase these distances and therefore increase safety. 
   The amount of traffic directed onto the 17th Avenue and 23rd Avenue ramps off of I-25 is expected to grow to a point that would overwhelm the already unsafe traffic volumes on these ramps. 
   I am concerned that even today, the ramps are substandard and could be considered unsafe. Under the design recommendations of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the minimum safe distance between an ON and OFF ramp is 1,600 feet. These ramps are only 435 and 750 feet apart. 
   The Average Daily Traffic (ADT) for these ramps is 40,800 yet the current ramps are designed for only 12,000 ADT. These ramps are currently at 340 percent over capacity and they can't handle more traffic without funding for this project. 
   I have been working with the Subcommittee on Transportation Appropriations to help the Denver Metro area and Colorado and very much appreciate the Chairman's assistance. A key priority for me is to improve highway safety in Metro Denver through this ramps project. Because of the budget constraints, however, the subcommittee was not able to include the project at this time. Will the Chairman be able to assist my efforts in seeking this funding as we move towards Conference?

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Motor Carrier Fairness Act of 2000. This legislation would prohibit the Secretary of Transportation and Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration from taking action to finalize, implement, or enforce a rule relating to the hours of service of drivers for motor carriers. 
   Trucking is the backbone of the U.S. economy. The industry transports approximately 80 percent of the nation's freight, and well over 70 percent of communities in the United States depend solely on trucking to deliver their goods. The hours of service are arguably the single most important rule  governing how trucking companies and truck drivers operate. However, the Department's proposed rules fail to consider the impact of the proposal on the nation's economy as well as the drivers. 
   The fundamental change in hours is a shift from an 18 hour, to a 24-hour clock. Under DOT's proposed rules, a driver's basic workday would be 12 hours on, 12 hours off with mandatory two consecutive days off. I was amazed to find out that by imposing these changes and increasing the number of off-duty hours DOT creates the need for a 50 percent increase in the number of refrigerated and dry van trucks. This in turn translates into an additional 180,000 drivers and trucks on already crowded roads, just to keep the current economy moving. I know, from speaking to freight carriers in my home state of Colorado, that the job market is already short approximately 80,000 drivers, and these trucking companies are experiencing substantial problems finding the necessary number of drivers for their operations. 
   There are many reasons why this bill is necessary. For example DOT's proposals would: 
   Reduce driver's salaries since they are paid per mile. By reducing the overall working time from 15 to 12 hours, salaries will also decrease. A 12-hour day will not allow drivers to take advantage of income opportunities that fluctuating freight volumes provide. Furthermore, as an article in the Denver Post reported today, the mandatory weekend time off could result in thousands of dollars of lost income per year for drivers. 
   Overcrowded rest stops. There are an estimated 187,000 parking stalls in truck stops around the country and the 2.5 to 3 million Class 8 trucks, and the result is overcrowded rest stops. Most drivers will be forced to use public rest stops, gas stations or even highway ramps to comply with the proposed rules. In fact the DOT held a field hearing yesterday at the Jefferson County 
   Fairgrounds in Colorado. Truckers there specifically warned of the re-emergence of thieves, scam artists, and prostitutes who linger around truck stops, preying on resting truckers. 
   These rules would inevitably crowd the highways with more trucks. Since waiting time at loading docks is considered ``on-duty'' hours, refrigerated carriers will need 70 percent more trucks in order to meet delivery times and dry-freight haulers another 50 percent. This means that 600,000 to 700,000 more trucks will be needed in order to keep with the current delivery pace. In another example from the afore mentioned article, a mozzarella cheese maker in Denver will have to add 23 new truck tractors in order to compensate for the down time of drivers forced to idle because of these new rules. I might also add that this proposal claims to reduce the number of highway fatalities, but as we can see the need to add more trucks to our roads will only increase the possibility of highway accidents occurring. The number of truck related accidents has actually decreased 34 percent in the last 10 years, so we should not allow the DOT to reverse this trend through its proposed rule. 
   Another area of concern regards the issue of the ``electronic onboard recorders'' that will track the drivers hours. The cost of equipping Type I and II long haul trucks with these devices is most certainly going to be passed on for the companies to bear. These devices, at approximately $1,000 apiece, could put some smaller hauling companies out of business. 
   Mr. President, I have been and still am a trucker. In fact, I just renewed my commercial drivers license last year. I understand first hand the concerns that most workers in this industry have with the proposed regulations. The trucking industry provides millions of Americans with on-time delivery. Our economy is dependent on this, and I believe that these proposed rules have not taken the impact of this aspect into consideration. 
   The cost of DOT's plan is not limited to the trucking industry as a whole, but will disrupt our nation's supply chain which consequentially will have a ripple effect on the rest of our economy, not to mention American jobs. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. Today in my capacity as Co-Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I introduce a resolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, one of the key international agreements of our time. I am pleased to be joined by all Senate Commissioners, Senators HUTCHISON, LAUTENBERG, ABRAHAM, BROWNBACK, HUTCHINSON, GRAHAM, DODD, and FEINGOLD, who are original cosponsors. A companion resolution also is being introduced today in the House by our colleague, Congressman CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey, who chairs the Helsinki Commission. 
   Five years ago, during the 20th anniversary celebrations in Helsinki, President Gerald Ford said: ``The Helsinki Accords, the Final Act, was the final nail in the coffin of Marxism and communism in many, many countries, and helped to bring about the change to a more democratic political system and a change to a more market-oriented economic system.'' Indeed, the Helsinki Final Act, signed by President Ford in 1975, marked the beginning of a process which has served U.S. interests in advancing democracy, human rights and the rule of law within a comprehensive framework covering the security, economic and human dimensions. 
   The legacy of Helsinki is especially historic with respect to what is now referred to as the ``human dimension.'' The Helsinki process--now named the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), is rightly credited with playing a contributing role in bringing down the Berlin Wall and Iron Curtain, and, in 1991, the Soviet Union. In short, the Helsinki process helped make it possible for the people of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to regain their freedom and independence. 
   Both Western governments and private individuals increasingly cited the Final Act, adopted by consensus, as a yardstick for measuring human rights performance, citing commitments which the violating governments freely undertook. 
   Human rights groups, including the Helsinki Monitoring Groups in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia, Armenia, as well as in Czechoslovakia and Poland grounded their activities in the Helsinki principles. During the communist era, members of these groups often sacrificed their personal freedom and in some instances their lives for their courageous and vocal support for the principles enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act. The pressure of governmental efforts and public opinion in both East and West contributed greatly to change in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
   Responding to a dramatically changed, post-Cold War world, the OSCE has evolved into a useful institutional tool for addressing many of the challenges confronting Europe and the Euro-Atlantic community today. The OSCE is the one political organization that unites all the countries of Europe, including all of the former Soviet republics, the United States and Canada, to face today's challenges. One of the primary strengths of the Helsinki process is its comprehensive nature and membership, where current human rights, military security, and trade and economic issues can be pursued. 
   The OSCE, now expanded to 55 from the original 35 countries, has been working hard to minimize conflict and bring all sides together, especially in the last decade which has seen several horrible regional conflicts, including in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Chechnya. 
   The OSCE has played an increasingly active role in civilian police-related activities, including training, as an integral part of the Organization's efforts in conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation. It has also played an important role in promoting greater transparency through the adoption and implementation of various confidence and security-building measures designed to reduce the risk of conflict in Europe. Other challenges that the OSCE is increasingly addressing include the promotion of economic reforms through enhanced transparency for market economic activity, environmental responsibility, the importance of the rule of law and fighting organized crime and corruption. And, of course, human rights remains very much on the OSCE's agenda, including but not limited to, the eradication of torture, free media, respect for the rights of individuals belonging to national minorities, and ending discrimination against Roma and Sinti. Unfortunately, serious human rights abuses continue in all too many OSCE countries. The main challenge facing the participating States of the OSCE remains the implementation of the commitments contained in the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE documents. The Helsinki Commission, which I co-chair, will continue to work in accordance with our mandate to monitor and encourage compliance by all the signatory States with their Helsinki commitments. 
   Mr. President, this resolution commemorates the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act and authorizes the President to issue a proclamation reasserting America's commitment to full implementation of the Helsinki Final Act, and request that he convey to all signatories that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and democratic principles as well as economic liberty and the implementation of related commitments continue to be vital elements in promoting a new era of democracy, peace and unity in the OSCE region. 
   Twenty-five years after the signing of the Helsinki Final Act, the principles enshrined in that historic document remain valid and continue to serve as an important tool in advancing U.S. interests in a region stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to recognize the 13th Annual Rolling Thunder ``Ride for Freedom'' and highlight the important role Rolling Thunder plays in making sure that our nation's POW/MIAs are honored and never forgotten. 
   The first time that Rolling Thunder's Ride for Freedom roared and rumbled its way to the Vietnam Memorial on Memorial Day 1988, 2,400 motorcycles banded together for the ride. Some 5,000 Veterans, their wives, children, and other citizens of all backgrounds gathered near the Vietnam Memorial Wall to honor and remember our nation's POW/MIAs. Since then, Rolling Thunder has grown into an international event that garners national attention and focuses it on remembering our POW/MIAs. In fact, Rolling Thunder has become such a large presence that anyone who happens to be anywhere near our nation's Capital cannot help but notice it. For example, last year's Rolling Thunder run included over 250,000 motorcycles and 400,000 participants. There were people at last year's run from every state in the nation, and many foreign countries including Canada, England, Germany, France, Austria, Holland, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Made up of over 40 Chapters throughout the United States, Rolling Thunder is a volunteer, non-profit organization. 
   I would like to thank the several organizations whose support and efforts have helped make Rolling Thunder possible here in Washington D.C. for the past twelve years: the Virginia Police, Virginia State Police, Maryland Police, D.C. Metropolitan Police, Park Police, Park Services and the Pentagon. 
   I also want to take this opportunity to highlight some legislation I sponsored and Rolling Thunder supports. Rolling Thunder's input and support has been invaluable to the legislative process. 
   The first bill I want to mention is S. 484, the Bring Them Home Alive Act of 1999. This legislation would grant asylum in the United States to foreign nationals from key countries who personally deliver a living American POW/MIA from either the Vietnam War or the Korean War to the United States. 
   A key section of this bill would help spread news of the Bring Them Home Alive Act around the world. This is needed to help make sure that the key foreign nationals who need to hear about this act, hear about it. The bill calls on the International Broadcasting Bureau to use its assets, including WORLDNET Television and its Internet sites, to spread the news. The bill also calls on Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia to participate. 
   If this bill leads to even one long-held POW/MIA being returned home to America alive this effort will be well worth it--10,000 times over. Even though it has been decades since these two wars ended, they have not ended for any Americans who may have been left behind and are still alive or their families and friends. As long as there remains even the slightest possibility that there may be surviving POWs in these regions, we owe it to our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines to do everything possible to bring them home alive. This is the least we can do after all they have sacrificed. 
   Today, I am especially pleased to announce that S. 484 passed the Senate last Wednesday, May 24th. Now we need to get it passed in the House of Representatives and enacted into law. 
   Rolling Thunder was also helpful in getting another important bill enacted into law, the National POW-MIA Recognition Act, legislation I sponsored in the 105th Congress. 
   This law requires that the POW-MIA flag be displayed on important national buildings--all across America--on six important days. These days include: Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Independence Day, Armed Forces Day, Flag Day and National POW-MIA Recognition Day. 
   Rolling Thunder captures the American people's attention--and those elected to represent them--and then brightly focuses our attention on remembrance of, and continuing duty to, our nation's POWs and MIAs. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to recognize Drug Courts and highlight the invaluable role they play in our Nation's war on drugs. As I have done at this time of the year for the past two years, I take this opportunity to call my colleagues' attention to the significant contribution Drug Courts make. Above all, I want to take this opportunity to once again recognize and applaud the dedicated professionals who have made our Nation's Drug Courts the successes they are today. 
   As our Drug Courts enter their eleventh year of operation, they are as important as ever in our Nation's battle against drug abuse and the devastating impact drugs have on our Nation and its families. Over the past year 100-plus new Drug Courts have been established throughout the country, bringing the  total number to over 700. Additionally, Drug Courts are now expanding internationally, underscoring their value around the world. 
   I am especially glad to hear that some of our Drug Courts' best practices are now being tailored to the needs and values of native communities, which for many years have suffered disproportionally from the scourge of substance abuse. The kinds of programs offered by Drug Courts could play a vital role in breaking the ``Iron Triangle'' of substance abuse, gangs and crime that trap far too many of our Nation's Native Americans and others in a cycle of poverty and hopelessness. 
   Next week--from June 1st and 3rd, 2000--the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) will host the 6th Annual NADCP Drug Court Training Conference entitled ``Expanding the Vision: The New Drug Court Pioneers.'' in San Francisco, California. The NADCP expects that this year's drug court conference will be the largest ever, with over 3,000 drug court professionals slated to attend. 
   This year, six individuals will receive the 2000 NADCP New Pioneers Award. I congratulate and thank each of these six outstanding people. I especially want to recognize an award recipient from my home state of Colorado, the Denver District Attorney, William Ritter, Jr. 
   The Denver Drug Court is the first--ever drug court system which now handles 75 percent of all drug cases filed in the city and county of Denver. All offenders, with the exception of illegal aliens, those arrested with a companion non-drug felony case or who have two or more prior felony convictions, are handled in this court. Most individuals are assessed within 24 hours of arrest. The pre-trial case managers monitor offenders on bond, while they await entry into the program. Over 8,000 participants have entered the program since it began operations on July 1, 1994. 
   As the Chairman of the Treasury and General Government Subcommittee, which funds the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), I took the opportunity to visit the Denver Drug Court with ONDCP Director Barry McCaffrey. We met with the Drug Court professionals and observed their judicial procedures. We also saw first-hand how the court's programs have a direct impact on drug-abusing offenders. I believe the Denver Drug Court serves as a role model for the next generation of Drug Court practitioners 
   Drug Courts continue to revolutionize the criminal justice system. The strategy behind Drug Courts departs from traditional criminal justice practice by placing non-violent drug abusing offenders into intensive court supervised drug treatment programs instead of prison. Drug Courts aim to reduce drug abuse and crime by employing tools like comprehensive judicial monitoring, drug testing, supervision, treatment, rehabilitative services, as well as other sanctions and incentives for drug offenders. 
   Statistics show us that Drug Courts work. More than 70 percent of Drug Court clients have successfully completed the program or remain as active participants. Drug Courts are also cost-effective. They help convert many drug-using offenders into productive members of society. This is clearly preferable to lengthy or repeated incarceration, which traditionally has yielded few gains for those struggling with drugs or our Nation as a whole. Drug Courts are proving to be an effective tool in our fight against both drug abuse and other drug-related crime. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing those Drug Court professionals who are improving their communities by dedicating themselves to this worthwhile concept and expanding the vision for the next generation of practitioners.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my fellow chairman Senator BOND in introducing the HUBZones in Native America Act of 2000. 
   The act is designed to make sure that federal procurement dollars are targeted to the areas that are most in need of an economic boost. These areas are called ``historically underutilized business zones'' and under the Act, Indian reservations are defined as ``historically underutilized business zones''. 
   Tribal economies continue to be among the most depressed and economically stagnant in the country. Though some well-situated tribes are benefiting from gambling, most tribes and Indian people live in Third World conditions. 
   In the 106th Congress, the emphasis of the Committee on Indian Affairs has been that of Indian economic development. The ultimate goal for Native economies is self-sufficiency. Programs, such as this, bridge the gap between Native economies and private enterprise. 
   On May 10, 1999, the Committee on Small Business and the Committee on Indian Affairs held a joint hearing on the implementation of the HUBZones Act of 1997 and its impact on Indian communities. 
   During that hearing three main issues were aired that are remedied by the amendments we introduce today: 
   Eligibility of Indian Lands in Oklahoma; Eligibility of Indian Lands in Alaska; and Eligibility of Tribally-owned enterprises. 
   The original intent of the HUBZone program was to re-target existing federal contracting dollars into America's distressed communities, including Alaska Native and Indian communities. The changes reflected in the HUBZones in Native America Act of 2000 build on the original intent of the Act, and make further steps to ensure that Alaska Native and Indian communities fully participate in this competitive program. I look forward to perfecting the obstacles that remain. 
   I am hopeful that the legislation introduced today will encourage long-term economic growth in Native communities by expanding business opportunities and job creation activities.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator INOUYE today in introducing a bill to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (the ``IHCIA'' or the ``Act''). 
   The United States first began to provide health services to Indians in 1824 as part of the War Department's handling of Indian affairs. In 1849 this responsibility went to the newly-created Interior Department where it rested until 1955 when it was transferred to the Public Health Service's Indian Health Agency. 
   In 1970, President Nixon issued his now-famous ``Special Message to Congress on Indian Affairs'' laying out the rationale for a more enlightened Indian Policy--Indian Self Determination. 
   The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, and the amendments to each over the years can be traced directly to the fundamental change proposed in 1970. 
   I am happy to say that legislation I proposed earlier this session, the Indian Self Governance Amendments of 1999, have passed the House and the Senate and awaits final action. 
   With the introduction of this bill, we re-affirm the core principles that were part of the 1976 legislation: (1) that federal health services are consistent with the unique federal-tribal relationship; (2) that a goal of the U.S. is to provide the quantity and quality of services to raise the health status of Indians; and (3) that Indian participation in the planning and management of health services should be maximized. 
   First enacted in 1976, this IHCIA provides the authorization for programs run by the Indian Health Service and is the legislation most responsible for raising the health status of Indian people to a level that, while still alarming, is not nearly as serious as it was just twenty-five years ago. 
   Before the passage of the Act in 1976 the mortality rate for Indian infants was 25% higher than that of non-Indian babies. The death rates for mothers was 82% higher and the mortality rates from infectious disease caused diarrhea and dehydration was 138% greater. 
   Today we can see marked improvements. Infant mortality rates have been reduced by 54%, maternal mortality rates have been reduced by 65%, tuberculosis mortality by 80% and overall mortality rates have been reduced by 42%. 
   While encouraging, these statistics mask the fact that the health status of Native people in America is still poor and below that of all other groups. 
   There are 3 issues in particular that need to be raised: urban Indians; Indian health facilities construction needs; and the booming problem of diabetes. 
   As past censuses have shown, the 2000 decennial census is likely to show that more than one-half of the 2.3 million American Indians and Alaska Natives reside off-reservation and are what commonly called ``urban Indians.'' Though the health services framework that now exists has slowly begun to acknowledge this trend, I am concerned that urban Indian health care needs require a more focused approach. 
   An ongoing problem that continues to confront the tribes, the IHS, and the Congress is the growing backlog in health care facilities construction. Recent estimates show that these needs top $900 million and federal appropriations simply will not satisfy these needs. I strongly believe that innovative proposals need to be made, refined and perfected in order to accomplish our common goal. I am heartened by the success of the Joint Venture Program and want to explore other proposals to get these facilities built. 
   Ailments of affluence continue to seep into native communities and erode the quality of life and very social fabric that holds these communities together. Alcohol and substance abuse continue to take a heavy toll and diabetes rates are reaching alarmingly high rates. Most troubling is the increasing obesity and diabetes that is showing up with alarming frequency in Native youngsters. 
   It is now time to take that extra step an to look at the positive things we have accomplished and build upon them. 
   This bill is a step in the right direction. It is the product of months-long consultations by a group of very dedicated individuals consisting of Indian tribal leaders, legal professionals and representatives of the private and public health care sectors. 
   The group reviewed existing law and has proposed changes to improve the current system by stressing local flexibility and choice, and making it more responsive to the health needs of Indian people. 
   The Committee on Indian Affairs has already had one hearing on the bill and will continue to review it in the months ahead.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendment of 2000, and take this opportunity to address promises broken, and the opportunity for this nation to finally keep the promises it made to the Southern and Ute Mountain Ute Indian tribes of Southern Colorado (Ute tribes). If we can find the resolve to get this done, we will have--for the first time--honored a treaty with an Indian tribe. 
   I am pleased to have my friend and colleague from Colorado, Senator WAYNE ALLARD, join me as an original cosponsor of this bill. 
   In the 1860's the United States promised the Ute tribes it would provide a permanent homeland for their people in the southwest. The water rights for that homeland remain senior over all others. Over a hundred years later, the tribes' water is being used by their neighbors. Our promise to the tribes gave them, the state, local water users, and the United States the choice of fighting for the water in court or negotiating and producing an enforceable agreement that all the parties can live with. 
   I am proud to have been a part of the effort over the past 12 years that resulted in an agreement to finally settle the tribal water rights claims, and provide water--not promises or financial compensation--for all involved. But, this fight is not a new one. The legal wrangling over the Ute Indian water rights was already over a decade old when the settlement was reached in 1986. Two years later Congress enacted the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. The Settlement Act promised the Ute tribes an adequate water supply to fulfill all of the promises made to them in the 1860's for a homeland and an adequate water supply. The Settlement Act promised; if the Ute tribes would give up their claims to the water under their treaties, we would provide them with an adequate alternative water supply. 
   As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and as one who has Indian blood coursing through my veins, I am reminded almost every day of the promises and treaties that have been broken by the United States. While we in the United States Congress are sometimes unable to undo the results of this chain of shattered 
   promises, we should at least agree that we will not continue to ignore treaties with any more American Indian tribes. The dismal truth is for the last ten years I have watched those opposed to the Animas-La Plata project work to prevent the federal government from fulfilling its commitment to the Ute Indian tribes manipulating facts and the law in an effort to deny our responsibilities as a nation. As a result we have squandered decades of time and millions of taxpayers dollars in an effort to not fulfill the promises made to the Ute tribes. I urge my colleagues to bring this sorry trail of broken promises to an end. 
   I remain committed to keeping our word to the Tribes of Colorado. Since the tribes have urged me to introduce this further A-LP compromise legislation, I am persuaded that this proposal will not violate the promises made to the tribes in 1988. However, if this bill is not enacted, or the permanent opponents of the project are able to further frustrate and delay the construction of the project, then this bill will be another broken promise to another Indian tribe and I refuse to be a part of that. Therefore, I have only introduced this bill with the understanding that it will include provisions that prevent needless delays. 
   I know there are people who will oppose any version of the Animas-La Plata project. In fact some groups had already signed letters rejecting the results of the draft supplemental environmental impact statement before it was made public. In part, they criticized the Department of Interior for prejudging the results of its analysis. I ask you, who is doing the prejudging? There are those who will oppose the project even if the final supplemental EIS reaches the same conclusion as the draft EIS: that constructing the facilities described by this bill is the least damaging way of fulfilling the federal government's promises to the Ute tribes. 
   It is absurd to continue to negotiate with those prepared to oppose any version of this project or to support efforts to continue to delay our moral and legal obligation to the Tribes. 
   First, my bill recognizes that a great deal of environmental review has already occurred, and that the facts have not changed, no matter what version of this project is discussed. The Interior Secretary is to continue his effort to produce a final supplemental EIS 
   for the project. However, this bill makes clear that if the Secretary ultimately selects ``alternative #4,'' it will reflect that the Congress will also have had the opportunity to review the same record, and we concur with this judgment. 
   Similarly, the bill makes clear that if the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determines that an annual diversion of 57,100 acre feet of water can occur without jeopardizing the habitat of endangered fish not known to be there, Congress concurs and believes that the project should move forward, and allocate quantities of water in the manner provided for in this bill. In short, this bill is the last, best chance to keep the Tribes from suing the federal government and, in all likelihood, prevail at an unknown cost to taxpayers. 
   For those who hope to wait even longer before proceeding with this  project, I will point out that as of January 1, 2000, federal law authorized the Ute tribes to return to court to assert their claims for the water already being used in southwestern Colorado. Perhaps they should. In a demonstration of their good faith, the tribes have not yet returned to court to assert their claims. But we only have a small window of opportunity before the tribes must either assert their claims or allow them to lapse. 
   At any time, the tribes could now choose to return to court. I am determined to bring this matter before the Senate, one last time. We cannot allow this bill to become another step in the long trail of broken promises. We are a nation based on the respect for the law. Our compassion, our limitless dedication to defending the truth, and our history of preserving the dignity of even the least of us is well documented. So, too, is our atrocious record of respect for the rights and the most basic tenets of human dignity when it comes to the first Americans on this continent.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, next Thursday, April 20th, marks an important date in the hearts of the families of those killed inside Columbine High School, and for those who survived the horrible events on that infamous day one year ago. Indeed, this day is important for everyone whose lives were touched by those tragic events. 
   I can think of no greater burden for a parent than to have to bury one of his or her children. That burden is only magnified when a loved one is taken with such unimaginable and unspeakable violence. 
   A year is not enough time to heal the scars created on that day; not for the families of those taken, not for the children who were spared, not for the community of Littleton, Colorado, and not for our nation. 
   While the events of that fateful day shall always be with us, so too is the memory of those slain and the strength of spirit they and their families have given to all of us. Like the Columbine flower which returns every Spring from under the darkness of winter, so too has a sense of community blossomed in Littleton and throughout the State of Colorado in response to the horror of that day. 
   As a step toward healing, many groups, individuals, and entities from both Colorado and our nation have worked to honor those who have died and to memorialize their passing in an appropriate and meaningful manner. 
   In seems especially fitting that today I recognize with honor the parents and the families of those killed and wounded in the school that day who are working to raise money to replace the library at Columbine High School, the scene of much of the violence that occurred last April 20.  
   They have, to date, received pledges for nearly all of the estimated $3 million it will take to replace the library at Columbine High School. Other pending pledges could bring them close to the full amount they need to replace this scene of horror with one of hope. This is just one outstanding example of a community pulling together in a grassroots effort to lift itself up free of governmental intervention and regulation. I would encourage every American capable of sharing to help all of the families whose lives were abruptly and forever changed by the events at Columbine in whatever way they can. 
   Mr. President, there is good and evil present among us in human nature. We never know when we will be faced with either. I pray no family has ever to face the sadness and grief visited on the victims and the families of those in Columbine High School one year ago today. I also pray that peace comes to all of our families through the gentle spirit of all the victims taken from us in Columbine High School, and those who will live with the pain caused that day. That spirit lives on in all of us and has been best described by the students and community of Littleton who proudly proclaim: ``We are Columbine.''

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity today to call my colleagues' attention to the extraordinary efforts of Dr. James Brownfox Jones who has made countless contributions to his profession and to the community at large. Recently, Dr. Jones was selected as an inductee in the Washington D.C. Hall of Fame in the area of education. Dr. Jones' selection to the Hall of Fame is a testament to his dependable and consistent standard of excellence as an educator and participant in his community. His career reflects his respect and affection for the young people who are our future leaders. And, his record reflects his predominate concern for the more vulnerable youth in this city. 
   Dr. Jones has distinguished himself in the District of Columbia as an educator and community activist with the mission of helping young people reach their full potential At the Washington School of Psychiatry, Dr. Jones developed and operated an experimental educational program designed to address the educational needs of ``hard core'' juvenile delinquents. And, as a public school teacher, he developed a unique program for special education students. 
   With a distinguished career spanning more than 30 years, Dr. Jones assisted the mayor in initiating a wide range of innovative programs for the children and youth of the city. These included a mobile recreation wagon, a hot lunch program, a neighborhood youth corps, and the building of go-kart tracks on lots left vacant by the 1968 riots. 
   Since 1983, Dr. Jones has designed and operated an Independent Living Program for abused and neglected youth in foster care in the District of Columbia. As part of this program, he has sent over 250 young people to college. 
   Education is a top priority for this Congress, and for me personally. I have served as a tutor and my wife Linda has dedicated her career to teaching in public schools. Both of us have always been strong supporters of public education. It is with that background that I want to express my support for the work of Dr. Jones and to congratulate him on his selection for the Washington, DC Hall of Fame. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would prohibit commercial tour overflight operators from flying in and over the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, our nation's 55th and newest national park is a breathtaking canyon of diverse magnitude, which is why I worked for over 13 years to get it dedicated as a national park. 
   I cannot imagine having the many visitors who tour my home state to view Colorado's newest national park enjoying the sound of airplanes or helicopters buzzing overhead while they are trying to listen to the flowing river at the bottom of the canyon. Because of the deep, narrow nature of the canyon, rescue and recovery operations for aircraft that experience problems would be extremely difficult, dangerous and costly. 
   My bill would amend the FAA reauthorization act of 2000 and would only restrict overflights on the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. I worked with my friend and colleague Senator ALLARD for over five years in support of his effort to get commercial overflights banned over the Rocky Mountain National Park. Similar action by Congress is now necessary for the Black Canyon of the Gunnison. 
   I believe National Park visitors seek peacefulness when they visit a national park and my legislation would help provide that. We contacted the Superintendent of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park and he informed us that currently no commercial overflights are taking place, but there may have been flights in the past. 
   My bill would amend already existing law and would not negatively affect the operation of emergency, military and commercial high-level airlines or private planes. 
   The Denver Post recently published an editorial supporting Congressional action on the issue of aircraft noise, citing how such operations would create noise which would echo terribly off the walls of the Canyon. As a member of the National Park and Historic Preservation Subcommittee, I have confronted these types of issues in the past and know how important it is for the visitors to our national parks to have everlasting and fond memories when they take the time and effort to visit the natural wonders we are blessed with in this country.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today Senator LEAHY and I are introducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, a bill to expand an existing matching grant program to help State, tribal, and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for the use by law enforcement officers. This bill represents another in a series of law enforcement legislative initiatives on which I have had the privilege to work with my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY. The Senator brings to the table invaluable experience in this area, from his distinguished service as a State's attorney in Vermont, a nationally recognized prosecutor, and as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We are pleased to be joined in this effort by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and Senators THURMOND, BINGAMAN, JEFFORDS, SARBANES, COVERDELL, ROBB, SCHUMER, REED, and REID. 
   Two years ago, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-181), which we were privileged to introduce. This highly successful Department of Justice grant program has already funded 92,000 new bulletproof vests for police officers across the country. 
   There are far too many law enforcement officers who patrol our streets and neighborhoods without the proper protective gear against violent criminals. As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law enforcement officers face every day on the front lines protecting our communities. 
   Today, more than ever, violent criminals have bulletproof vests and deadly weapons at their disposal. In fact, figures from the U.S. Department of Justice indicate that approximately 150,000 law enforcement officers--or 25 percent of the nation's 600,000 state and local officers--do not have access to bulletproof vests. 
   The evidence is clear that a bulletproof vest is one of the most important pieces of equipment that any law enforcement officer can have. Since the introduction of modern bulletproof material, the lives of more than 1,500 officers have been saved by bulletproof vests. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has concluded that officers who do not wear bulletproof vests are 14 times more likely to be killed by a firearm than those officers who do wear vests. Simply put, bulletproof vests save lives. 
   Unfortunately, many police departments do not have the resources to purchase vests on their own. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 would continue the partnership with state and local law enforcement agencies to make sure that every police officer who needs a bulletproof vest gets one. It would do so by authorizing up to $50 million per year for the grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, the program would provide 50-50 matching grants to state and local law enforcement agencies and Indian tribes with under 100,000 residents to assist in purchasing bulletproof vests and body armor. Finally, this bill will make the purchase of stabproof vests eligible for grant awards. 
   While we know that there is no way to end the risks inherent to a career in law enforcement, we must do everything possible to ensure that officers who put their lives on the line every day also put on a vest. Body armor is one of the most important pieces of equipment an officer can have and often means the difference between life and death. The United States Senate can help, and I urge our colleagues to support prompt passage of this legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I intend to vote for cloture this afternoon on the Federal fuels tax holiday bill to help address the soaring cost of fuel and our rising dependency on foreign oil. We have had numerous hearings and many statements have been given on the floor to address this grave situation we are in. Unfortunately, it seems like we are going to have to endure this problem for a while longer. 
   Over the last few weeks, I have had many conversations with truckers, shippers, and concerned citizens about how this problem affects them. Specifically, my conversations boiled down how this crisis affects our American truck drivers. Over 95 percent of all commercial manufacturing goods and agricultural products are shipped by truck at some point. 9.6 million people have jobs directly or indirectly related to trucking. In addition, trucking contributes over 5 percent of America's gross domestic product which is the equivalent of $372 billion to the economy. 
   Along with these astonishing facts about trucking, here are some more facts about this fuel crisis: 
   fuel taxes account for about 28 percent of what you pay for a gallon of gas at the pump; 
   the government imposes 43 different direct and indirect taxes on the production and distribution of gas, bringing the total burden to 54 percent of the price of a gallon of gas; 
   U.S. oil production is down 17 percent from 1992, consumption is up 14 percent; 
   DOE estimates the United States will use 65 percent foreign oil by 2020; 
   the United States spends $300 million per day, and $100 billion per year on foreign oil; 
   and oil makes up one-third of our trade deficit. 
   I know what our truckers are going through. I put myself through college driving a truck and I just recently got my Colorado commercial driver's license so that I could get back into driving. Since I own a small rig, I know firsthand how the fuel crisis impacts those who depend on it. My fuel bills have doubled in the last year alone. 
   Hundreds of truckers from all over have come to Washington to ask for help on three different occasions in the last few weeks. One thing I have learned is that when many private citizens give their time to come to Washington, the issue is not profit margins, or stock prices, it is because they are fighting for their families' very livelihood. 
   I met a man named Wesley White from Oregon, who said he was on his last run. He could not afford to continue fueling his truck. He has spent his pension to buy the truck, but when he gets home, he's parking it for good. Without the income derived from delivering goods he will not be able to make truck payments and will lose the truck. Another trucker I met was living with his wife and two small children in the truck sleeper because the increase in diesel costs did not leave them enough money to pay their house rent. 
   Unfortunately, the administration has ignored the plight of these hard working Americans. This administration got us into this mess by their total lack of an energy policy. They stand in the way of domestic oil production by locking up public lands and refuse to release federal fuel stockpiles already in place. 
   Now, faced with skyrocketing diesel prices, they still do nothing of substance, instead they wanted to wait for OPEC to meet in Vienna which happened on March 27 and 28 of this year, hoping that the outcome would be 
   favorable for the U.S., which is debatable. But can we trust this outcome when the U.S. has sanction on 8 out of the 11 OPEC nations? 
   Recently, the Energy Secretary went to the Middle East with hat in hand, to beg for fuel. He claims that this increase in oil production will lower fuel costs by approximately 11 cents by the end of the summer. Well, what do we do until then? The crisis is happening now. Also administration officials come before Congress to propose studying alternative energy sources, which is fine, but I have news for them: Trucks today run on diesel, not wind or solar power. Everything we buy to eat and wear comes on a truck. If the trucks stop rolling, this Nation stops rolling.  
   The benefits from this recent increase in oil production will not be seen for months. We need solutions now before any more Americans lose their jobs because of high fuel prices. 
   I am pleased the pending legislation includes a provision which is similar to a bill I introduced more than a month ago on March 2, S. 2161 the American Transportation Recovery and Highway Trust Fund Protection Act of 2000. My bill would temporarily suspend the federal excise tax on diesel fuel for one year or until the price of crude oil is reduced to the December 31, 1999 level. It would replace the lost revenues with monies from the budget surplus in the general fund, while protecting the Highway Trust Fund. S. 2161 is endorsed by the American Trucking Association, the Independent Truckers Association, and the Colorado Motor Carriers Association to name just a few. 
   The provision in the pending legislation states that in the event the national average price of unleaded regular gasoline rises to $2 per gallon or more, it would further suspend all federal excise taxes on fuels, while retaining only the 0.1 percent portion devoted to Leaking Underground Storage Tanks Trust Fund. I believe this action would be an important step forward to help relieve the escalating burden on America's truckers and farmers. 
   But, these bills are only short-term solutions, and only one step which could be taken. Our real problem is our dependence on foreign oil. In 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo, the U.S. bought 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources. Today, we buy 56 percent, by some reports 62 percent. All the negotiations the administration is doing to get OPEC to open the spigots is not more than a band aid approach to a problem that will continually revisit us as long as we are dependent on foreign oil. It is unfortunate that we, a global superpower, are reduced to begging, and now we have to take what we can get from OPEC. More forceful actions need to be taken to expose the severity of this problem and address it now, not in the months to come. We cannot stand by and do nothing of consequence while good people lose their means of support. 
   The Federal fuels tax holiday bill is an important step forward to provide relief to hard working Americans from the burden of rising fuel prices, and I urge my colleagues to support cloture so we can pass this bill. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in 1997 this body considered wide-sweeping tobacco legislation and the Indian Affairs Committee held several hearings on the issue and in fact reported a bill to reduce smoking in Native communities. 
   The rate of smoking in Native communities is the highest in the country and Natives suffer emphysema, lung cancer, and related problems as a result of that smoking. 
   The resolution we are now considering would as a practical matter apply to smoke-shops that offer ``discount tobacco'' products without defining that term. 
   There are ``discount cigarette'' stores right across the river in Virginia, there are ``discount tobacco'' outlets in airports around the country, and there are ``discount stores'' on Indian lands. 
   Now, if this resolution were to apply to all tobacco outlets, I would support it. I am dismayed that Secretary Cuomo would support the amendment given that it would not affect Community Development Block Grant funds for non-Indian tobacco outlets. 
   As a practical matter only Indian outlets are affected and there are no potential non-Indian tobacco sellers that would be affected. Though it may not be the preferred economic activity of some in this chamber, many Indian tribes rely on selling tobacco, which is a legal commodity, to generate revenues. 
   The targeted nature of this resolution as well as the economic hardships created by it led me to support the Vice Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator INOUYE, and his Motion to Table the Bond Amendment.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, on March 25, Belarusian authorities harshly suppressed a pro-democracy demonstration in the capital of Minsk, arresting and detaining hundreds of peaceful protestors, including nearly 30 domestic and foreign journalists. Riot police, deployed with dogs and armored personnel carriers, used excessive force against some peaceful demonstrators. 
   Among those detained and beaten was democratic opposition leader Anatoly Lebedka, Deputy Chairman of the 13th Supreme Soviet. Many of my Senate colleagues met Mr. Lebedka last September when I introduced him right here on the Senate floor. Mr. Lebedka was just in Washington earlier this month to testify at a Helsinki Commission hearing about the deteriorating situation in Belarus. 
   Based on information I obtained from the State Department, I am advised that Anatoly Lebedka was arrested by plainclothes police during the demonstration, kept in detention, and reportedly beaten over the course of two days. He spent most of Monday in a police van outside the courthouse awaiting trial, but was released at 5:00 p.m. His trial has been scheduled for April 4. 
   Mr. President, the harsh overreaction by the authorities to this peaceful demonstration represents a clear violation of the freedom of association, assembly, and information guaranteed both by the Belarusian constitution and OSCE agreements. In addition, the Belarusian authorities detained a U.S. citizen who is an accredited diplomat and a member of the OSCE Advisory and Monitoring Group in Belarus, and who was observing the demonstration in line with his official responsibilities. This action also violates international conventions. 
   It appears that the green light for the most recent crackdown was given by Belarusian President Lukashenka, who praised the police for their actions. Reports indicate that earlier this month, he cautioned that the riot police will ``beat the stuffing out'' of any protestor who ``gets out of line.'' 
   Unfortunately, the suppression by the Belarusian authorities of peaceful protest, along with the sentencing last week of a prominent member of the opposition, does nothing to encourage a constructive dialogue with the democratic opposition that can lead Belarus  out of its continuing constitutional impasse and end its self-imposed international isolation. 
   Mr. President, I call upon the Government of Belarus to thoroughly investigate reports of police brutality during the course of the demonstration and subsequent detentions and take measures to ensure that citizens are guaranteed their rights to engage in peaceful protests, keeping with that country's OSCE commitments. 
   I was pleased to join Senator DURBIN as an original cosponsor to Senate Concurrent Resolution 75 which we introduced last November. That resolution summarized many of the political problems facing the democratic opposition in Belarus expressing strong opposition to the continued egregious violations of human rights, the lack of progress toward the establishment of democracy and the rule of law in Belarus, and calls on President Lukashenka to engage in negotiations with the representatives of the opposition and to restore the constitutional rights of the Belarusian people. In light of the recent violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last weekend, I urge my colleagues to support passage of the Durbin/Campbell resolution.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to proceed in morning business for about 10 minutes. I would like to add my comments to those of my colleagues who spoke yesterday who were concerned about the rising cost of fuel. Many of my friends and colleagues have spoken to the issue of our rising dependency on foreign oil. This morning, I would like to take a little different perspective and talk a little bit about how the crisis affects the backbone of American commerce, which is the backbone of the American trucking industry. 
   Over 95 percent of all commercial manufactured goods and agricultural products are shipped by truck at some point. Mr. President, 9.6 million people have jobs directly or indirectly related to trucking. In addition, trucking contributes over 5 percent of America's gross domestic product which is the equivalent of $272 billion in the economy every single year. Over 6.7 billion tons of goods are shipped in this Nation every year. Those are staggering numbers. I use them to emphasize the impact that trucks have in America. 
   I know the trucking life myself. I started driving when I was 21, when I got out of the service. I put myself through college by driving an 18-wheeler. Last year, I decided to renew my commercial driver's license in the State of Colorado and I attended a truck-driving school to do that. I have a small tractor trailer so I know firsthand the impact of the increase of fuel. Paying the bill for 200 gallons of fuel in a truck is not like filling up the family car, and these long-line trucks, by the way, fill up every day. 
   Last week, while the Senate was in recess, I spent the week making deliveries in a truck along Colorado's Front Range. I did it so I could see and hear firsthand what truckers, as well as shippers and other related businesses, are going through. At diners, gas stations, and delivery points, they told me from their perspective it is much worse than anyone in Washington may imagine. 
   While I was driving, I met a man named Wesley White from Oregon who said he was on his last run. He couldn't afford to continue fueling his truck. He had been a policeman for over 20 years and at the end of his police service he retired, took his pension, and bought a truck with the intent of going into business for himself. But, this time around when he gets home he is going to park the truck for good. Without the income from delivering goods, he is not going to be able to make his truck payments. He will lose the business of the truck and he will also lose his pension which he used to buy the truck. 
   Wesly is not alone. Three times in the last 2 months, hundreds of truckers from all over the United States have come to Washington to ask for help. I attended the first rally in February, and I went to another one yesterday. One thing I did learn, when these people come to Washington, they are not here to complain about profit margins or stock prices. They are here because their very livelihood is on the line. 
   I have to tell you, Mr. President, I never met a trucker who wanted a handout. They want a job, a fair shake, and fairness from Congress. One trucker I met at the last rally I went to had a wife and two small children. The four of them were actually living in the sleeper of the truck because the increased price of diesel fuel did not leave them enough money at the end of the month to even pay house rent. 
   Unfortunately, this administration has ignored the plight of these hard-working Americans. The administration has got us into this mess by the total lack of any energy policy. They stand in the way of domestic oil production, they refuse to release Federal fuel stockpiles to drive the cost of fuel down, and they continually lock up public lands so we cannot explore for  new resources. Now faced with skyrocketing diesel prices, they still do nothing of substance, instead they are hoping the OPEC oil 
   ministers will reverse their strategy to limit production and increase fuel prices. 
   We fought the gulf war, as you and I know, and this is how we get repaid. In fact, in a rather strange twist of fate we are now also dependent on Iraqi oil. 
   Instead of increasing our own resources, the Secretary recently went to the Middle East, hat in hand, to beg for fuel. Now administration officials are coming before Congress to propose we study alternative energy resources. I have news for them. Trucks don't run on solar and they don't run on wind; they run on diesel. Everything we buy, eat or wear is delivered on a truck. If they stop rolling, very simply this Nation also comes to a stop. 
   Even if OPEC increases production, the effect on the American consumers will be months away, we need immediate relief. In that context, I recently introduced S. 2161 entitled ``The American Transportation Recovery and Highway Trust Fund Protection Act of 2000.'' This bill would temporarily suspend the Federal excise tax on diesel fuel for 1 year, or until the price of crude oil is reduced to the December 31, 1999, level. It would replace lost revenues with moneys from the budget surplus in the general fund while protecting the highway trust fund. The bill has bipartisan support, with 12 cosponsors. Even at that, we know it is only a short-term solution. 
   The real problem is our dependency on foreign oil. All the negotiations this administration is doing to get OPEC to open its spigots is not more than a Band-Aid approach to the problem that will continually revisit us as long as we are dependent on foreign oil. The administration has known this and the danger to our national security since 1994. Senator MURKOWSKI spoke to that yesterday. 
   It is unfortunate we, as a global superpower, are reduced to begging. More forceful actions are needed and must be taken to expose the severity of the problem and to address it now and in months to come. We cannot simply stand by and do nothing. 
   We can do better. We should be opening new oil fields. We should be doing better incentive work to keep the stripper wells from closing, and certainly we should renew our efforts in oil shale and other renewable fuels that can be turned into gasoline oil. Most of all, we have to untether ourselves from Mideast oil. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator TIM JOHNSON in introducing the Native American Agriculture Research, Development and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to encourage the development of the Indian agricultural sector. This bill will help make efficient use of Federal agriculture research, development and export resources in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
   Agriculture has been a central part of the Native American culture, way of life, self sufficiency, and economies from time immemorial. This is still true today with many Indian tribes using agriculture and agribusiness to sustain their livelihoods and economies. 
   There are some 55 million acres of Indian lands in the United States, approximately 2 percent of all lands in the country, with nearly 47 million of these acres made up of crop and range land. 
   Indian agriculture production is not limited to just farming and ranching, it also includes such diverse products as timber and forest goods, fish and seafood, bison, wild rice, fruits and nuts, cotton and a host of other Native-made and gathered products. 
   Agriculture constitutes the second largest revenue generator and employer in Indian country but often takes a back seat to other initiatives in the development of tribal resources and economies. By reinvigorating the Indian agriculture sector we can develop the value-added industries to provide food security, as well as increase employment and raise incomes in Indian communities. 
   Although there are many programs within the Department of Agriculture for which tribal and individual Indian producers are eligible, Indian producers have not fully benefitted from these programs because of a lack of thoughtful coordination and attention within the Department. 
   In fact, these is now pending a class action lawsuit filed by Indian farmers against the Department charging discrimination and neglect in the availability and use of funds, programs, and services. 
   This bill will afford Indian farmers and producers the same benefits, assistance and organization that non-Indian producers currently enjoy by promoting the coordination of existing agriculture and related programs within  the Department to provide maximum benefit to Indian tribes and their members. 
   It is my hope that this initiative will encourage intertribal, regional, and international trade and business development in order to assist in increasing productivity, access to specialty markets, export promotion, marketing assistance, access to capital, and at the same time help facilitate agricultural ventures with non-Indian entities. 
   Under the provisions of this bill, a Native American Research, Development, and Export Office would be established within the Department and would have a Director appointed by the Secretary to ensure the intra-agency and inter-agency coordination of programs that assist Indian agriculture and economic development. 
   This bill is not intended to reduce, rather than create, more federal bureaucracy. Therefore, this office will be formed using funds already appropriated to the Department. 
   Within this office, the Director would establish the Native American Trade and Export Promotion Program to help coordinate and cooperate with the other appropriate Federal agencies to promote Indian agriculture and related value-added industries.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator TIM JOHNSON in introducing today a bill to make needed clarifications in the law to aid in the administration of the Indian Reservation Road and Bridge Program to better meet the transportation needs in Indian country. 
   There is an enormous need for physical infrastructure on Indian lands throughout the country. This infrastructure is necessary for Indian tribes and their citizens to carry out emergency services, law enforcement, and the transportation of goods and services. 
   In addition, physical infrastructure is just as important for Indian communities as it is for other communities because Indian economies are still in need of significant investment and private sector activity. 
   When entrepreneurs or investors are calculating whether to invest in any community they look first to see if basic building blocks are there: roads, highways, electricity, potable water, and other factors. 
   So for Indian communities an efficient federal roads financing and construction system holds the key to healthier economies and higher standards of living for their members. 
   In 1998, Congress enacted the Transportation Equity Act of the Twenty-First Century (``TEA-21'') to authorize Federal surface transportation programs with the goals of improved highways, increased safety, protecting the environment, and increased economic growth. 
   In passing TEA-21, Congress approved several Indian amendments that I was happy to propose to require a negotiated rule-making to determine the allocation formula to allow the kind of flexibility needed for an Indian country-wide formula; as well as a provision to ensure that all TEA funds set aside for Indians would be made available to tribes that choose to enter contracts under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, P.L. 93-638, as amended. 
   On October 20, 1999, the Committee on Indian Affairs, which I chair, held an oversight hearing on the Indian reservation roads program and TEA-21. From testimony and other evidence presented it is evident that there remain serious obstacles to a more efficient functioning of TEA-21 in Indian communities. I am sorry to say that one of the obstacles appears to be the administration of the program by the Bureau of Indian Affairs itself. 
   The Indian reservation roads program is set up in such a way that the roads funding is transferred from the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration [FHWA] to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which in turn allocates the funds to Indian tribes based on a pre-existing formula. 
   Although reservation roads compose 2.63 percent of the Federal highway system, less than 1 percent of Federal aid had been allocated to Indian roads. 
   This bill would remove the so-called ``obligation limitation'' contained within TEA-21 and in effect would allow the already-authorized funds for Indians to reach the intended beneficiaries. 
   In 1999, the amount of funds that reached the Indian communities was $34 million less than that authorized in TEA-21 because of the obligation limitation. 
   This bill also authorizes the Federal Lands Highway Program to establish a Pilot Program to contract directly with Indian tribes for the administration of these tribes' roads programs. By allowing tribes to voluntary enter this program, it is intended that a better use can be made of existing resources and at the same time encourage Indian tribal self-determination. 
   Under current law, the BIA is authorized to use ``up to 6 percent'' of the roads funding for oversight and administration of the Indian roads program. If it was not clear in 1998, it should be clear now that these funds are not intended to be available to subsidize other BIA roads operations nor are they intended to be used for any other purposes. 
   The bill I am introducing today contains an amendment that clarifies the ``up to 6 percent'' language by reiterating Congress' intention that the figure was and is intended as a maximum, not a minimum, funding level with regard to BIA administrative costs. 
   Finally, with regard to the option to tribes to administer these funds and programs, the bill clarifies that all Indian reservation roads program funds are to be made available to Indian tribes which want to assume the administration of their reservation roads program under Public Law 93-638. 
   The bill also seeks to eliminate the current redundancy is required health and safety certification by allowing tribes the option of meeting statutorily required Health and Safety Standards without the need for a second, duplicative effort by the BIA. It is important to note that the standards themselves will not change, nor will the need for tribal compliance with those standards change. 
   Mr. President, that is a brief description of the amendments in this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support them.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator MCCAIN and Senator TIM JOHNSON in submitting today a resolution to commemorate the anniversary of a little-noticed but critical event that took place 30 years ago this summer. 
   In July 1970, President Richard M. Nixon delivered his now-famous ``Special Message to the Congress on Indian Affairs'' that revolutionized how our nation deals with Native governments and Native people from Florida to Alaska, from Maine to Hawaii. 
   With centuries of ill-conceived and misdirected federal policies and practices behind us, I am happy to say that the Nixon Indian policy continues as the bedrock of America's promise to Native Americans. 
   In his Message to Congress, the President made the case for a more enlightened federal Indian policy. Citing historical injustices as well as the practical failure of all previous federal policies regarding Indian Nations, President Nixon called for the rejection of both the ``termination'' policy of the 1950s and the ``excessive dependence'' on the federal government by Indian tribes and people fostered by federal paternalism. 
   Nixon observed that ``[t]he first Americans--the Indians--are the most deprived and most isolated group in our nation. On virtually every scale of measurement--employment, income, education, health--the condition of the Indian people rank at the bottom.'' 
   Thirty years later, Indians continue to suffer high rates of unemployment, are mired in poverty, and still rank at or near the bottom of nearly every social and economic indicator in the nation. 
   Nonetheless, there is cause for hope that the conditions of Native Americans are improving, however slowly. 
   The twin pillars of the policy change initiated in 1970 are political self determination and economic self reliance. Without doubt, the most enduring legacy of the 1970 Message is the Indian self determination policy best embodied in the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, amended several times since then. 
   This Act, which has consistently been supported, promoted, and expanded with bipartisan support, authorizes Indian tribes to assume responsibility for and administer programs and services formerly provided by the federal government. 
   As of 1999, nearly 48% of all Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and 50% of all Indian Health Service (IHS) programs and services have been assumed by tribes under the Indian Self Determination Act. 
   With this transfer of resources and decision making authority, tribal governments have succeeded in improving the quality of services to their citizens, have developed more sophisticated tribal governing structures and practices, have improved their ability to govern, and have strengthened their economies. 
   Self determination contracting and compacting have improved the efficiency of federal programs and services and at the same time have devolved control over these resources from Washington, D.C. to the local, tribal governments which are much more in tune with the needs of their own people. 
   As steps are taken to provide tribes the tools they need to develop vigorous economies and generate tribal revenues, our policy in Congress and across the federal government should be to encourage and assist tribes to expand self determination and self governance into other agencies and programs, and in the process help Native people to achieve real and measurable success in improving their standard of living.  
   The challenge of the Nixon Message was not only to the federal government but to the tribes themselves: that by building strong tribal governments and more robust economies, real independence and true self determination can be achieved. 
   Our experience has shown that any cooperative efforts between the United States and the tribes must include a solemn assurance that the special relationship will endure and will not be terminated by the fits and starts of periodic economic success enjoyed by some Indian tribes. 
   President Nixon wisely realized that the mere threat of termination results in a tendency toward an unhealthy dependence on the federal government which has plagued Native people for decades. As President Nixon himself knew, Native people are not hapless bystanders in this process. His Message recognized that the story of the Indian in America is one of ``endurance, survival, of adaptation and creativity in the face of overwhelming obstacles.'' 
   This persistence and tenacity by Native people have been the foundation in forging a more enlightened Indian policy and with the assistance of the United States will, I am confident, result in true self determination for Native people in the United States. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Nixon Message and the combined efforts of Natives and non-Natives alike in making Indian self determination a reality.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Emergency Management Agency Buy American Compliance Act, legislation which would apply the requirements of the Buy American Act to non-emergency Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance payments. 
   The Buy American Act was designed to provide a preference to American businesses in the federal procurement process. Currently, when FEMA awards grants for non-emergency projects, the agency itself adheres to the requirements of the Buy American Act. However, when FEMA awards taxpayer money to 
   state or local entities in the form grants, those entities are not similarly required to comply with the Buy American Act's standards. This disparity needs to be changed. 
   Mr. President, the Buy American Act's requirements should be applied to all FEMA non-emergency grants. It should not make a difference whether FEMA is directly spending federal tax dollars or passing those same federal tax dollars on to states or local governments for them to spend. The Buy American Act's standards should apply to all federal dollars distributed by FEMA for non-emergency situations, no matter who is spending it. It is only right that we ensure that the American people's federal tax dollars are spent according to the Buy American Act. 
   The Buy American Act is necessary to protect American firms from unfair competition from foreign corporations. Many of the nations we trade with have significantly lower labor costs than the United States. Without the safeguard provided by the Buy American Act foreign companies are able to underbid American companies on U.S. government contracts. 
   It is important to understand the Buy American Act's criteria for determining whether a product is foreign or domestic. The nation where the corporation is headquartered is irrelevant--the Buy American Act is focused upon the origin of the materials used in the construction project. In order to be considered an American product, the product in question has to fulfill the following two criteria; first; the product must be manufactured in the United States, and second; the cost of the components manufactured in the United States must constitute over 50 percent of the cost of all the components used in the item. 
   My proposed legislation would stipulate that federal funds distributed by FEMA as financial assistance could only be used for projects in which the manufactured products are American made, according to the criteria established by the Buy American Act. The House version of this legislation has been recently introduced by Congressman MICHAEL COLLINS of Georgia. 
   Mr. President, it does not make sense that the American people's hard earned tax dollars should be allowed to slip through a loophole that makes it possible for some entities to avoid the Buy American Act. The Buy American Act should apply to all who spend FEMA non-emergency funds. When these federal funds are passed down from FEMA to another government agency, those other government agencies should also be required to abide by the Buy America Act. 
   Mr. President, I introduce this legislation in order to ensure there is consistency in the law, with regard to FEMA and the provisions of the Buy American Act. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting passage of this pro-American measure.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``American Transportation Recovery and Highway Trust Fund Protection Act of 2000.'' This is a new revised version of S. 2090 which I introduced on February 24, 2000, to address the escalating prices of fuel which supports our nation's truckers, farmers, public transportation, and other users. 
   Based on discussions with my colleagues and testimony presented at this morning's Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, I have drafted a new bill which would replace the lost revenues from the temporary suspension of the excise tax with monies from the budget surplus in the general fund to fully protect the Highway Trust Fund. Similar to the original bill, S. 2090, my new bill still would temporarily suspend the federal excise tax on diesel fuel for one year or until the price of crude oil is reduced to the December 31, 1999 level. 
   Americans fought their war in the Persian Gulf, lives were lost out in the sand, some came home with undiagnosed illnesses, defended them from their cousins while the Kuwaiti ruling family relaxed, and this is how we get repaid, with soaring fuel costs, jeopardizing America's livelihood. 
   While OPEC grows fat, Americans are growing thin, not because they want to, but because they have to choose between food or heating oil. Nice choice for some Americans, freeze or starve? The American people deserve better. 
   This problem will continually revisit us as long as we are dependent on foreign oil. I have seen news reports that OPEC will not boost production at least until July, and that quote came from Iran's oil minister. Norway, who is not a member of OPEC and is the world's second largest oil exporter, made no promise to increase oil production either. It is unfortunate that we, a global super power, are reduced to begging. 
   One of the things I have learned in my time in Congress is that too often we get bogged down in the details. The  current fuel crisis an example where the discussion tends toward international price fixing and our foreign dependence, rather than focusing on the daily effect on American people. 
   If we do not recognize the economic devastation the skyrocketing cost of fuel is already taking, wait until shipping by truck, rail, and ship starts to collapse. The total value of freight carried by truckers in 1996 was approximately $368 billion. This number would be higher today, but these were the most recent numbers that CRS could provide. If these current increases in oil prices do not stop, some trucks can not afford to run. If just 10 percent of the trucks on the road stop running, if you do the general math, it could amount to a $36.8 billion value decrease in freight. This is a hit to the economy I do not want to see. If the rigs stop rolling, this nation stops rolling. 
   Also, if we do not recognize the national security component of being dependent on OPEC oil, I want to know how many more American lives we have to risk to recognize it? We should have to grovel in front of the altars of the almighty oil ministries.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing America's Transportation Recovery Act of 2000 to address the skyrocketing prices of fuel which supports our Nation's truckers, farmers, public transportation, and other users. This bill would temporarily suspend the Federal excise tax on diesel fuel for 1 year, or until the price of crude oil is reduced to the December 31, 1999, price. 
   I am pleased to be joined by many of my colleagues and add as original cosponsors to this bill both the majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, as well as Senators CRAIG, FEINSTEIN, CONRAD, BUNNING, LANDRIEU, and KERREY of Nebraska. 
   The current fuel crisis is an example of how a discussion leans toward economic factors and international price fixing rather than focusing on the daily effect on American people. 
   Early this week, as Members know, nearly 300 truck drivers drove from all over the east coast--in fact, some from as far away as Texas--to rally at the steps of the Capitol. Their cause was the increasing price of diesel fuel, which is increasing their costs to the point that many may go out of business. 
   I know the trucking life. I put myself through college by driving an 18-wheeler. Just last December, I renewed my CDC driver's license. Although I don't drive commercially anymore, it does keep me in touch with the working men and women in the trucking industry. Since I own a small rig, I know firsthand how the fuel crisis impacts those who depend on it because my fuel bills have doubled in the last year alone, as have theirs. 
   When private citizens give their time to come to Washington, the issue is not about profit margins, stock prices, or other abstract matters; it is because they are fighting for their lives. Long-distance drivers, as Members probably know, need between 200 and 400 gallons of diesel every 24 hours. Add that to truck payments, permits, insurance, upkeep, road fees, and the many other costs for independent trucking, and many are barely scraping by. It is no wonder the price increase is putting so many out of business. The only way they can survive is to pass it on to the consumer. Most of them cannot do that because the small independents are, more often than not, subcontracting to other firms. 
   At Tuesday's rally, one driver told me he knew of two men who had gone bankrupt in the last week alone. Any person viewing the television coverage of the rally could not help but be moved by the young couple living in their truck with two small children, both under the age of 3, because they could not make house payments. Yet another driver told me he had only $8 to his name and made it here for the rally. 
   Many people think this probably does not affect them. Think about this: About 95 percent or more of everything in America, everything we buy, comes by truck. It may also be on a train, airplane, or ship, but from the point of origin to the point of delivery is often by truck. These people don't want handouts; they don't want food stamps; they don't want to be on welfare; they want to work. If those rigs stop rolling, very simply, the Nation stops rolling, too. 
   These trucks don't run on solar energy, as was mentioned this morning in our Energy Committee hearing by Senator CRAIG, and they don't run on wind power; they run on diesel fuel. This problem extends to our farmers and ranchers. The increased costs to our farmers and ranchers, coupled with declining commodity prices, makes it very difficult for them to run a farm. 
   In past Congresses, we have had to pass emergency agriculture relief packages which have allowed the smaller producers to receive enough assistance to get by financially one more year. Now, along with the truckers in public transportation, farmers will probably see future diesel prices 
   nearing $2 a gallon as they go into this year's planting season. 
   We cannot let this Nation come to a standstill because we are captive to foreign oil cartels. Not too many years ago, we fought a war in the Middle East to protect oil-producing countries from the Iraqi invasion. Our young men and women make up the bulk of the military might for many nations today. They put their lives on the line to protect some of the Arab countries against their own cousins, and now we are being repaid for our generosity by the rising cost of fuel from OPEC. 
   Certainly, if there is anyone who thinks there is not a national security component to being 55-percent dependent on foreign oil, they need to think again. The fact that we are too dependent on foreign oil and we currently have no national energy policy is a point of discussion for another day. 
   Right now, we face a crisis we need to do something about. That is why I and my colleagues are introducing this bill. This bill will temporarily suspend the excise tax on diesel fuel for 1 year, which is 24.4 cents a gallon, in an effort to ease the burdens on so many Americans based on our lack of a national long-term energy policy. This will help primarily truckers, farmers, and public transportation but in the long run will help everybody. While it does not address the long-term problem of our insufficient domestic oil supply, it will provide emergency temporary relief. I believe it is a modest and yet essential step. 
   At a time when our citizens are being shaken down by a foreign oil cartel and then again by rising taxes, it is somewhat offensive to go through the same kind of a shakedown twice. The Government is currently running a surplus, taking in more tax money than we are spending. We will have several years of surplus money, and I am sure we can afford to give a short-term break to the hard-working Americans who deliver our food and take our children to and from school as well as pick up our garbage. 
   This particular tax, as I understand, was never supposed to be permanent. It was imposed as a deficit reduction measure, and we simply do not have a deficit nor will we have in years to come. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation with prompt passage, to provide immediate relief for America's truckers, farmers, and other diesel fuel users.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, though there are glimmers of hope in Native communities, most Native Americans remain racked by unemployment, mired in poverty, and rank at or near the bottom of nearly every social and economic indicator in the nation. 
   For years the Committee on Indian Affairs, which I chair, has made strengthening Indian economies a top priority. Healthy tribal economies and lower unemployment rates are imperative if tribes are to achieve the goals of self-sufficiency and true self-determination. 
   Although federal economic development assistance has been available for years, poverty, ill health, and unemployment remain rampant. 
   One of the reasons for the lack of success despite spending billions of dollars, is the lack of a consistent or consolidated federal policy to target development resources. Indian business, economic and community development programs span the entire federal government and for any given project undertaken by a tribe, there may be 6 to 8 or more agencies involved. This fragmentation and lack of coordination is not producing the kind of progress Indian country so badly needs. 
   To begin to remedy this problem, today I am pleased to introduce legislation that builds on the most successful federal Indian policy to date: Indian self-determination. 
   The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, which was enacted in 1975, authorizes Indian tribes and tribal consortia to ``step into the shoes'' of the federal government to administer programs and services historically provided by the United States. 
   This Act has worked as it was intended and has resulted in improved efficiency of program delivery and service quality; better managed tribal institutions; stronger tribal economies; and a general shift away from federal control over Indian lives to more local, tribal authority. 
   What began as a Demonstration Project in 1975 has blossomed as more and more tribal governments realize the benefits of self governance. 
   As of 1999, nearly 48% of all Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and 50% of all Indian Health Service (IHS) programs and services have been assumed by tribes under the Indian Self-Determination Act. 
   The legislation I introduce today will begin the second phase of the Self-Determination experiment by assistant Indian tribes in their use and maximization of existing federal resources for purposes of economic development. 
   By authorizing tribes and tribal consortia to consolidate and target existing federal funds for development purposes, this bill will promote a more efficient use of federal resources. Perhaps more importantly, the legislation will lay the foundation for a development strategy that looks to employment creation, investment and improved standards of living in Indian country as the real measure of a successful development policy. 
   One of the key goals of this bill is to eliminate inconsistencies and duplication in federal policies that continue to be a barrier to Indian development through the issuance of uniform regulations and policies governing the use of funds across federal agencies. 
   By authorizing federal-tribal arrangements to combine and coordinate federal resources, this bill will make the best use of existing federal programs to assist tribes in attracting private investment and capital onto Indian reservations. 
   Already in this session we have addressed other building blocks to Indian development such as financing housing construction and physical infrastructure, the need for good governance practices at the federal and tribal levels, ensuring adequate capital for entrepreneurs, and encouraging private sector investment into Native communities. 
   I am hopeful that the legislation I introduce today will signal a new day for how the federal government assists Native communities in creating jobs and building a better future for their members.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Stamp Out Domestic Violence Act of 2000. 
   The bill will allow every American to easily contribute to the fight against domestic violence through the voluntary purchase of certain specially issued U.S. Postal stamps, generally referred to as semi-postals. Proceeds raised from the stamps would fund domestic violence programs nationwide. 
   The national statistics on domestic violence are reprehensible and shocking. Consider the following: A woman is battered every 15 seconds in the United States. According to the Justice Department, four million American women were victims of violent crime last year. Two thirds of these women were victimized by someone they knew. In fact, 30 percent of female murder victims are killed by current or former partners. In Colorado alone, the Colorado Coalition Against Domestic Violence reported 59 domestic violence related deaths in 1998. We can and must make every effort to change that. But, before we can eliminate the incidence of domestic violence we must acknowledge the problem and identify the resources needed to combat the problem. 
   Mr. President, I believe this bill represents an innovative way to generate money for the fight against domestic violence. In the 105th Congress, as Chairman of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, I supported the first semi-postal issued in the United States, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. So far, more than 104 million stamps have been sold nationally, raising $8 million for breast cancer research. My bill is modeled after the breast cancer stamp, and I am confident it will be just as successful. 
   Specifically, under the ``Stamp Out Domestic Violence Act of 2000,'' the Postal Service would establish a special rate of postage for first-class mail, not to exceed 25 percent of the first-class rate, as an alternative to the regular first-class postage. The additional sum would be contributed to domestic violence programs. The rate would be determined in part, by the Postal Service to cover administrative costs, and the remainder by the Governors of the Postal Service. All of the funds raised would go to the Department of Justice to support local domestic violence initiatives across the country. 
   In a country as blessed as America, the horrid truth is more women are injured by domestic violence each year than by automobile and cancer deaths--combined. We can no longer ignore that fact, for our denial is but a  small step from tacit approval. The funds raised by this stamp will represent another step forward in addressing this national concern. I urge my colleagues to act quickly on this important legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a resolution to recognize and support the United States Olympic Committee and the 2000 Olympic Games. 
   There are several reasons why I have a particular interest in the Olympic Movement and the U.S. Olympic Committee. I am the only Olympian in the United States Senate and Congressman JIM RYUN and I are the only two current Members of Congress to have been members of an Olympic Team. 
   Years ago, I founded the U.S. Olympic Caucus with former Senator Bill Bradley and former Congressman Tom McMillan. In addition, the United States Olympic Committee is headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, along with the Olympic Training Center. Many athletes are currently training at that facility for future Olympic Games and especially in preparation for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. 
   As I look back on the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, I remember how proud I was to be on the U.S. Olympic Team. Carrying the United States flag in the closing ceremonies was one of the greatest experiences of my life. I remember how proud I was to be an American and an Olympian. I hold that moment in my heart and relive it at each new Olympic Games to this day. 
   The Olympic motto is ``Swifter, Higher, Stronger'' and with that ideal, the Olympic Movement brings out the very best in all of us--athletes and spectators alike. I believe, along with the U.S. Olympic Committee, that competition and the athletes are the heart and soul of the Olympic Movement. This is the reason that I offer this resolution today. 
   The United States Olympic Committee is to be highly commended for the prompt and decisive action it took after accusations of inappropriate solicitations surfaced. I know how much good the games do for young men and women and for our country. I am convinced the U.S. Olympic Committee has done everything in its power to get to the bottom of allegations, punish those who deserve it, and return the focus of the Olympic Movement back where it should be, with the athletes. 
   Most people don't realize that unlike many of the world's Olympic teams, the U.S. Olympic Team gets not one dime of federal money to subsidize its sports operations. Our Olympic Team is solely supported by the contributions of millions of Americans and American businesses and corporations which are dedicated to the Olympic Movement. 
   The Olympic Movement will endure and prosper only by the continued vigilance and the ongoing commitment of organizers and supporters, and by our unwavering support of the athletes who are the future of the modern Olympic Games. 
   As we begin the countdown towards the first Olympic Games of the new millennium, my resolution would designate June 23, 2000, as Olympic Day in recognition of the anniversary of the founding of the modern Olympic Movement. I urge my colleagues to support prompt passage of this resolution.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will help ensure that priceless public lands, including the Yellow Jacket Canyon in the Southwestern corner of my beautiful home state of Colorado, are preserved and managed in the most farsighted and balanced manner possible. 
   I have developed this legislation with the Department of the Interior and the local government bodies. It successfully takes into account the concerns of all interested parties. The lands I hope we can protect were the home to a rich civilization before the existence of this hemisphere was known to the western world. 
   It is imperative we protect these lands now in a reasonable manner to recognize the historical, archeological and cultural value they hold. But, I do not believe we should lock these lands from the public. When public lands are suddenly grabbed away by executive decree it creates ill feelings and distrust. 
   The hardest hit are those people who live near the land, know it the best and whose livelihood is most connected to it. These are almost always hard working families. Elected local and state governments are also losers. Land grabs seriously erode the very tax base that enables towns, counties and states to provide the services the people need, including schools, law enforcement, and fire protection. Finally, participatory democracy, our nation's bedrock, also loses when an executive decree is used to end run the American people and those they have chosen to represent them in Congress.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. This year will mark the 50th anniversary of America's effort in Korea to halt the spread of Communist aggression. Today, I am introducing a bill that is of great importance to me and the more than 1.5 million American men and women who so valiantly fought and supported the U.S. effort in Korea. 
   On June 25, 1950, the Communist North Korean military invaded South Korea, provoking a swift U.S. response. Two days later, President Truman ordered the intervention that eventually involved 22 nations. In the three years that the U.S. led this multinational force, more than 54,000 Americans gave their lives in the fight to preserve our freedom and democratic way of life. As many as 92,000 soldiers were wounded and more than 8,000 were left behind. 
   Despite this struggle and sacrifice, I can clearly remember as a young man,  returning home from my years in Korea, feeling as if no one knew that we had ever been gone. It was a harsh, painful conflict that America very quickly wanted to place well behind it. I knew then and understand now why Korea came to be known as ``The Forgotten War.'' 
   If you visit the Korean War Memorial at the end of the Mall here in Washington, you will see the patrolling squad of 19 weary soldiers frozen in motion, their rustled ponchos and obstacles beneath them a testament to the harsh conditions and terrain that were endured each day of ground combat. On the adjacent granite wall, one will see the faint etchings of 2,400 unnamed faces of the men and women who contributed in the effort in so many different ways. Clearly displayed beyond these images is the message that so profoundly reminds us, ``Freedom is Not Free.'' 
   Mr. President, the joint resolution that I introduce today marks the passage of these 50 years since the Korean War and recognizes its extraordinary significance in our history. Most importantly, it thanks and honors the brave men and women who fought so hard to defeat the spread of Communism and preserve our freedom and democracy. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to recognize our nation's Korean War veterans and mark this historic anniversary.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am joined by 28 of my colleagues in submitting this resolution to keep alive in the memory of all Americans, the sacrifice and commitment of those men and women who lost their lives while serving as law enforcement officers. Specifically, this resolution would designate May 15, 2000, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. 
   As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law enforcement officers face everyday on the front lines protecting our communities. Currently, more than 700,000 men and women who serve this nation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Every year, about 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 officers is injured, and 1 in 4,400 officers is killed in the line of duty. There are few communities in this country that have not been impacted by the senseless death of a police officer. 
   In 1999, approximately 135 federal, state and local law enforcement officers have given their lives in the line of duty and nearly 15,000 men and women have made that supreme sacrifice during the past century. We can be heartened by knowing that fewer police officers died in 1999 than in any year since 1965. 
   According to National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund Chairman Craig W. Floyd, ``a combination of factors appears to be making life safer for our officers including better training, improved equipment, the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, and the overall drop of crime.'' 
   On May 15, 2000, more than 15,000 peace officers are expected to gather in our Nation's Capital to join with the families of their fallen comrades, past and present, who by their faithful and loyal devotion to their responsibilities have rendered a dedicated service to their communities and, in doing so, have established for themselves an enviable and enduring reputation for preserving the rights and security of all citizens. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important resolution.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today the Senate considers S. 692, entitled the ``Internet Gaming Prohibition Act.'' As my colleagues know, I support this measure but from the day this bill was introduced I have had concerns about its scope. As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs I have been concerned that existing law, namely the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, would be irreparably harmed unless we made certain changes to the bill. 
   This is an important bill and I support the intent of the bill's sponsors to make it more difficult for this kind of gaming to be conducted, particularly by underage players. 
   If enacted, this bill would prohibit Internet gambling, but make exceptions for certain segments of the gaming industry which currently use a variety of technologies to enhance traditional gaming. 
   It is important for my colleagues to realize that the bill does not prohibit all forms of gaming using available high-technology. When I reviewed S. 692 for the first time, I realized that certain gaming activities currently being conducted by Indian tribes would be prohibited by this bill. 
   My concerns centered on the fact that the same or similar activities were allowed to other entities--such as the states, the horse-racing industry and others--that were disallowed to tribes. This fundamental inequity is what led me to propose fair treatment for tribal governmental gaming. 
   In addition to issues of equity, the economic impacts of Indian gaming are substantial and should be acknowledged. These revenues provide an important source of development capital and jobs for many tribes across the country. Contrary to the views many here hold, Indian gaming is very highly regulated by federal, state and tribal officials, and has been subject to federal law for eleven years. 
   I addressed my concerns to the Senate Judiciary Committee in June of this year and began discussions on how best to address currently-legal Indian gaming in S. 692. My main concerns with drafting any language dealing with Indian gaming and the IGRA centered on the following requirements: 
   1. All gaming must be legal under current federal law; 
   2. All class III gaming (casino style) must be conducted pursuant to a tribal state compact; and 
   3. All aspects of the game must take place on Indian Lands (game, player, facility, server, etc.). 
   It is critical to note that there is no tribe in the U.S. that is currently offering online/Internet betting. Instead, several tribes currently use widely-available technology to broadcast bingo to numerous operations located on Indian lands or to link class III games for the purpose of determining an aggregate betting pool for the purpose of offering bigger prizes. 
   It is my understanding in supporting the substitute along with my amendment, that S. 692 allows tribes to continue their current practices regarding the use of technology to enhance the effectiveness and profitability of their operations, but does not authorize any tribe to operate betting on the Internet as it currently perceived by the general public. 
   The specific provisions of my amendment address all currently legal class II and class III gaming, as defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. &#167;2701 et seq. 
   Accordingly, for Indian gaming activities to not run afoul of the provisions of S. 692 
   1. The game must be conducted according to the requirements of IGRA. 
   2. All persons making or receiving a bet, or transmitting information regarding a bet must be on Indian lands. That means all aspects of the game must be located on tribal land, including the person playing the game, the actual machine which is the game, and any computer server which may be used to keep track of information relating to the play of the game. In the case of a satellite (which cannot be located on Indian land), all machinery used to receive the signal must be located on Indian land. 
   3. The game must be conducted on an interactive computer service which uses a closed-loop subscriber based service or a private network. 
   4. Where class III games are conducted, each tribe participating in a network must have a compact which authorizes games to be conducted using the technology described, that is, an interactive computer service which uses a closed-loop subscriber-based service or a private network. It is critical to understand that this means that a tribe must have a compact only in the state in which they are located, not that they compact with every state in which the network is located. 
   5. In jurisdictions where class III gaming is currently using technology to link games, but either have compacts which do not specifically authorize networked games, or that do authorize these games, but do not contain the specific authorization required in S. 692, the amendment allows them to continue the operations of those games until the expiration of their current compact. The current language addressing technology that is included in most compacts does not contain the exact terminology as defined in S. 692. 
   Additionally, there are other states where language that addresses the use of technology is not contained in the compact, but the state has consented to the use of technology. My amendment contains a ``grandfather clause'' for those operations, which will run until their compacts expire by their own terms. Once a tribe's compact expires, the compact must be renegotiated and will be required to contain language which conforms to the requirements of S. 692. 
   Contrary to the views of some, Indian tribes are not generally interested in operating games which are broadcast on the ``world wide web'' or the Internet, and in which a person sitting in their home may ``log on'' to a computer and begin placing bets. 
   Indian tribes are, however, interested in continuing the operation of the games they currently have, and which they have agreed with their states are legal. This amendment allows them to do just that.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which would create a plaque honoring those Vietnam veterans who died as a result of the war but who are not eligible to have their names placed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The ``Vietnam Veterans Recognition Act of 1999'' would authorize the placement of a plaque within the sight of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to honor those Vietnam veterans who died after their service in the Vietnam War, but as a direct result of that service. This bill is similar to H.R. 3293, which was introduced by my colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman GALLEGLY. 
   Deadly war wounds do not always kill right away. Sometimes these fatal  war wounds may linger on for many years after the fighting is done. Sometimes these wounds are clearly evident from the time they are inflicted, sometimes they are not. The terrible toll that Agent Orange has taken on our Vietnam veterans stands as one stark example. What we do know is that all too often these war wounds eventually take the lives of many of our brave Vietnam veterans. 
   Even though these veterans may not have been killed in action while they served in the tropical jungles of Vietnam, in the end they too made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Like their brothers and sisters who died on the field of battle, they too deserve to be duly recognized and honored. 
   Mr. President, duly honoring the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country should always be a priority. Unfortunately, the service and sacrifices made by some Vietnam veterans is still not being fully recognized since their names are not included on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. 
   This bill recognizes the sacrifices made by these Vietnam veterans by authorizing a plaque that will be engraved with an appropriate inscription honoring these fallen veterans. 
   Since no federal funds will be used for the plaque, it will be up to our nation's leading veteran's organizations and individual Americans to demonstrate their commitment to honoring these fallen veterans through charitable giving to help make it a reality. The American Battle Monument Commission will lead the effort in collecting the private funds necessary. 
   It is vital for us to have a place to honor all the men and women who have served and died for their country. It is also important for the families of these fallen heroes to have a place in our nation's capital where their loved one's sacrifice is honored and recognized for future generations.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which would better equip our nation's firefighters to fight the ever-increasing threat of property destruction and potential loss of life. 
   The ``Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act of 1999'' would authorize the newly-named Federal Fire and Emergency Management Agency to make available matching grants on a competitive basis to fire departments for the purpose of protecting the public and firefighting personnel against fire and fire-related hazards. This bill is a companion to H.R. 1168, which was introduced by my colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman PASCRELL. 
   Mr. President, each year approximately 100 of our nation's firefighters pay the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the safety of our communities. Increased demands on firefighting personnel have made it difficult for local governments to prepare for necessary fire safety precautions. The fire loss in the United States is serious, and the fire death rate is one of the highest per capita in the industrialized world. Fire kills more than 4,000 people and injures more than 25,000 people each year. Today, 11 people will die due to fire. Two of these people are likely to be children under the age of 5. Another 68 people will be injured due to fire. Financially, the impact of America's estimated 2.2 million fires annually is over $9 billion in direct property losses. Those numbers are staggering, and many of these losses could have been prevented. 
   The bill I introduce today would make grants available to train firefighter personnel in firefighting, emergency response, arson prevention and detection, and the handling of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants associated with the illegal manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine. 
   This bill also creates partnerships by allowing for the effective use of the capabilities of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Commerce, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission for research and development aimed at advancing the health and safety of firefighters; information technologies for fire management; technologies for fire prevention and protection; firefighting technologies; and burn care and rehabilitation. 
   In addition, this legislation would ensure that grants would be made to a wide variety of fire departments, including applicants from paid, volunteer, and combination fire departments, large and small, which are situated in urban, suburban and rural communities. 
   Mr. President, despite the risks, 1.2 million men and women firefighters willingly put their lives on the line responding to over 17 million calls, annually. Our greatest challenge is to put limited resources to work where they will make the most difference in saving lives and reducing losses. 
   I am pleased that the bill I introduce today has been endorsed by the Colorado State Fire Chief's Association.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a not-for-profit organization which has been on the national forefront of motorcyclists' rights. The Motorcycle Riders Foundation here in Washington, D.C. is a nation-wide grassroots activist group that is completing its tenth year representing motorcycling rights. As the year draws to an end and we look forward to a new century, we should be proud of an organization such as MRF which embodies our forefathers' commitment to the Constitution and the values of freedom and the self- determination of a citizen government. 
   In the mid-1980's the leadership of the various state motorcyclist associations, which had been around since the early 1970's, began to be concerned about the possibility of and need for becoming involved with federal legislation that had an impact on motorcyclists. In 1985, these leaders began hosting a national conference, the Meeting Of The Minds, to educate motorcyclists on how to be more effective in their state legislatures. 
   In September of this year the MRF hosted the Fifteenth Annual Meeting Of The Minds in Denver, Colorado. In 1986, the idea of establishing a national association and opening an office in Washington, DC, was conceived. In 1987, the Motorcycle Rights Fund (MRF) was incorporated as a 501 (4) not-for-profit association and fund raising began. In 1988, the name of the association was changed to the Motorcycle Riders Foundation, and with less than $30,000 in the bank, the MRF hired its first employee and opened its Washington, D.C. headquarters on November 8, 1988. 
   Since its inception the MRF has had two primary goals. One has been its educational program, which sponsors national and regional conferences every year, with the purpose of training and educating leaders of state motorcyclist associations. The MRF's second, and primary program, is its government relations activity. The MRF was recently recognized by the American Society of Association Executives with its Award of Excellence, for the overall federal legislative program. The awards committee recognized the commitment of the MRF and its on-going efforts for the past ten years. 
   In 1996 MRF's federal legislative program was also the recipient of ASAE's Excellence in Government Relations Award for a Single Issue. In its ten-year presence in the Nation's Capital, MRF has had a number of legislative accomplishments in diverse areas ranging from highway safety, personal liberty, law enforcement and discrimination issues; technology development policies, highway access, and state to federal relationships. 
   As we recognize MRF's 10-Year Anniversary, I look forward to hearing about MRF's future successes in the months and years to come.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I too have an interest in this matter, but from a different angle. The U.S. fabric industry consumes virtually all the wool fiber produced in the United States. My home state is a significant producer of wool. If we approve legislation that damages fabric makers, it will have a direct and adverse impact on wool growers. The growers in my state are already suffering from surging imports of lamb meat. In addition, the price of their wool has been severely depressed due to the fact that wool from Australia and New Zealand is routinely dumped on the world market. As a result, I am on the record as strongly opposing any legislation that cuts U.S. wool fabric duties. It is critical that in the discussions of this issue members from the wool producing regions are fully informed and involved. We simply cannot accept a move that would take steps to appease suit makers without fully understanding and considering the impact of such legislation all the way down the chain--from fabric makers to wool growers.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Seniors As Volunteers in Our Schools Act of 1999,'' a bill which will be an important step in ensuring that our schools provide a safe and caring place for our children to learn and grow. This bill will help build lasting partnerships between our local school systems, our children and our country's growing number of senior citizens. 
   Under the bill, school administrators and teachers are encouraged to use qualified seniors as volunteers in federally funded programs and activities authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA.) It specifically encourages the use of seniors as volunteers in the safe and drug free schools programs, Indian education programs, the 21st Century Community before- and after-school programs and gifted and talented programs. I believe the best way to get older Americans to serve as volunteers is to ask them. My bill does just that. 
   The Seniors as Volunteers in Our Schools Act creates no new programs; rather it suggests another allowable use of funds already allocated. The discretion whether to take advantage of this new resource continues to remain solely with the school systems. 
   Studies show that consistent guidance by a mentor or caring adult can help reduce teenage pregnancy, substance abuse and youth violence. Evidence also shows that the presence of adults on playgrounds, and in hallways and study halls, stabilizes the learning environment. And recently, the Colorado School Safety Summit, convened by Governor Bill Owens, recommended connecting each child to a caring adult as a way to reduce youth violence. 
   Our country is in the midst of an age revolution. There are twice as many older adults today as there were 30 years ago. America now possesses not only the largest, but also the healthiest, best-educated, and most vigorous group of seniors in history. 
   In the years ahead, an increasing number of us will be living decades longer than our own parents and grandparents. We need to think of those extra years of life as a resource. I believe seniors can be role models and share the wisdom, experience, and skills they have acquired over a lifetime of learning. 
   I know firsthand of the importance of mentoring based on my own experiences as a teacher. A mentor can have a profound positive impact on a child's life. 
   What better way to expand the number of mentors than to invite our seniors/elders to volunteer in schools? What better way to make our schools safer for our children than to have more adults visibly involved? 
   I do not expect this legislation to solve all the problems confronting our schools today. But, I see it as a practical way to help make our schools safer, more caring places for our children. If our institutions create opportunities that allow them to make a genuine contribution, I believe America's growing senior population can play an important role in supporting our nations' schools. And, older adults have what the working-age population lacks: time. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take the time today to reintroduce a bill that will help millions of water consumers throughout my state. This bill is based on S. 2140, legislation I introduced last year, which passed out of the full Senate. 
   The Denver Water Department has developed a unique plan to re-use non-potable water for irrigation and industrial uses. In the arid West, where growing populations and changing values are place increasing demands on existing water supplies, water and availability remain important issues. Recent conflicts are particularly apparent in the West where agricultural needs for water are often in direct conflict with urban needs. This legislation will help remedy some of this conflict. 
   This bill authorizes the Denver Water Department to access federal funds to assist in the implementation of this plan. The State of Colorado, the Colorado Water Congress, the Denver Board of Water Commissioners, and the Mayor of Denver have fully endorsed this legislation. I am pleased to assist these interested parties with this worthwhile proposal. 
   The Denver Water Department serves over a million customers and is the largest water supplier in the Rocky Mountain region. Over the past several years Denver Water has developed a plan to treat and re-use some of its water supply for uses not involving human consumption, such as irrigation and industrial purposes. In this manner, Denver will stretch its water supply without the cost and potential environmental disruption of building new reservoirs. It will also ease the demand on fresh drinking-quality water supplies. 
   The Denver Nonpotable Reuse Project will treat secondary wastewater, that is water which has already been used once in Denver's system. It is an environmentally and economically viable method for extending and conserving our limited water supplies. The water quality will meet all Colorado and federal standards. The water will still be clean and odorless, but since it will be used for irrigation and industrial uses around the Denver International Airport and the Rocky Mountain Wildlife Refuge, the additional expense to treat it for drinking will be avoided. 
   The nonpotable project will be constructed in three phases and ultimately will result in an additional useable water supply of 15,000 acre feet. The use of the nonpotable water for irrigation and industrial customers will make potable water supplies available for up to 30,000 homes. 
   Construction will include a treatment plant and a distribution system that is separate from the potable water system. Phase I will serve customers in the vicinity of the reuse plant, including a Public Service Company power plant, other industrial users and other public areas. Phase II will add irrigation for parks and golf courses in the former Stapleton Airport and the recently closed Lowry Air Force Base redevelopment areas. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal, which is being converted to a national wildlife refuge, will also use the reuse water to maintain lake levels on-site and to provide water for wildlife habitats. Phase III will serve existing parks as well as new development of a commercial corridor leading to the Denver International Airport. With the construction of Phase II, the irrigation, heating and cooling, and car washing facilities at Denver International Airport will convert to reuse water, where a dual distribution system has already been installed. 
   In the West, naturally scarce water supplies and increasing urban populations have furthered our need for water reuse, recycling, conservation, and storage proposals which are the keys to successfully meet the water needs of everyone. This plan would benefit many Coloradans, and would help relieve many of the water burdens faced in the Denver region. Again, I'd like to thank the interested parties for their support, and I am hopeful this bill can be quickly passed and put into effect.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I appreciate my good friend from Oklahoma bringing this to our attention. I have long been a supporter of Impact Aid, and I can speak to this issue from personal experience. For 20 years, my  wife Linda taught at a school in southwest Colorado which is dependent upon the program, so I know firsthand its vital importance. In fact, more than 24 million acres of land in Colorado are federally owned lands. Impact Aid eases the burden on surrounding school districts with a smaller tax base because of these Federal lands, ensuring a high-quality education for all students. 
   My home State of Colorado has lost 16 percent in funding since this program was reauthorized in 1994. As the Impact Aid reauthorization is considered early next year, I look forward to a fair and honest evaluation of the funding formula.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today, along with the Vice Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator INOUYE and many of our colleagues, a Senate resolution that designates the month of November 1999, as `National American Indian Heritage Month.' 
   I feel it is appropriate and deserving to honor American Indians and Alaska Natives, as the original inhabitants of the land that now constitutes the United States, with this November designation as Congress has done for almost a decade.  
   American Indians and Alaska Natives have left an indelible imprint on many aspects of our everyday life that most Americans often take for granted. The arts, education, science, medicine, industry, and government are areas that have been influenced by American Indian and Alaska Native people over the last 500 years. Many of the healing remedies that we use today were obtained from practices already in use by Indian people and are still utilized today in conjunction with western medicine. 
    Mr. President, many of the basic principles of democracy in our Constitution can be traced to practices and customs already in use by American Indian tribal governments including the doctrines of freedom of speech and separation of powers. Our Founding Fathers benefited greatly from the example of the Indian tribes in the early stages of our Nation. 
   The respect of Native people for the preservation of natural resources, reverence for elders, and adherence to tradition, mirrors our own values which we developed in part, through the contact with American Indians and Alaska Natives. These values and customs are deeply rooted, strongly embraced and thrive with generation after generation of Native people. 
   From the difficult days of Valley Forge through our peace keeping efforts around the world today, American Indian and Alaska Native people have proudly served and dedicated their lives in the military readiness and defense of our country in wartime and in peace. In fact, their participation rate in the Armed Forces far outstrips the rates of all other groups in this Nation. Many American Indian men and women gave their lives selflessly in the defense of this Nation even before they were granted American citizenship in 1924. 
   Many of the words in our language have been borrowed from Native languages, including many of the names of the rivers, cities, and States across our Nation. Indian arts and crafts have also made a distinct impression on our heritage. 
   It is my hope that by designating the month of November 1999, as ``National American Indian Heritage Month,'' we will continue to encourage self-esteem, pride, and self awareness amongst American Indians and Alaska Natives of all ages. Many schools, organizations, Federal, State, Tribal and local governments can also plan activities and programs to celebrate the achievements of American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
   November is a special time in the history of the United States; we celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday by remembering the American Indians and English settlers as they enjoyed the bounty of their harvest and the promise of new kinships. By recognizing the many Native contributions to the arts, governance, and culture of our Nation, we will honor their past and ensure a place in America for Native people for generations to come. I ask for the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this resolution, and urge the Senate to pass this important matter.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I support passage of the pending bill, S. 1791, that Senator LIEBERMAN and I introduced. This legislation would authorize the Librarian of Congress to acquire Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior's personal papers from his estate. 
   Dr. King, as a minister, civil rights leader, prolific writer and Nobel Price winner, was deeply committed to nonviolence in the struggle for civil rights. He is quite possible the most important and influential black leader in American history. 
   When Dr. King was tragically assassinated on April 4, 1968, he was in his prime, after having emerged as a true national hero and a chief advocate of peacefully uniting a racially divided nation. He strove to build communities of hope and opportunity for all. He recognized that all Americans must be free if we are to live in a truly great nation. 
   The acquisition of Dr. King's papers would permanently place them in the public domain. People from all over the United States, and the entire world, would have direct access to these important historic documents. Those people studying his life's work would have access to his messages of justice and peace, and also to reflect on the civil rights struggle. The Library of Congress would be the perfect place for these papers which already houses other great works of original American freedom fighters such as Frederick Douglass and Thurgood Marshall. It is altogether fitting that these documents be together under one roof. 
   Dr. King was a person who wanted all people to get along regardless of their race, color or creed. His call to all of us, that we should judge by the content of one's character rather than by the color of one's skin, sums up the very core of how we can all peacefully live together as well as any other words ever spoken. 
   The establishment of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a national holiday was the result of the work of many determined people who wanted to ensure that we and future generations duly honor and remember his legacy. In fact, our tradition of honoring Dr. King took another step forward when on October 25, 1999, the President signed into law S. 322, a bill I introduced earlier this year that authorizes the flying of the American flag on Martin Luther King Day, in addition to all of our Nation's national holidays. This legislation builds on this work and will ensure that Dr. King's legacy is preserved for generations to come. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am compelled to raise a recent, shocking example of racism in South Dakota. 
   An Indian woman residing on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota came across an ``advertisement'' in the local newspaper that bore the heading ``State of South Dakota, Game Fish and Parks Department''. She sent me a copy of the ad along with her letter. 
   The ``ad,'' which resembles a run-of-the-mill hunting and fishing season announcement, was located in the editorial section of the newspaper. The ``ad'' went on to outline the rules for ``Indian Hunting Season'' in the State of South Dakota, including a limit on the number of Indians a ``hunter'' was allowed to kill and the approved methods for killing them. 
   I cannot express to you the anger and deep disappointment I felt when I read this ad because for those who think anti-Indian sentiment and feelings is a ``relic of the past,'' I urge them to read this product of a twisted and hateful mind. 
   At the turn of the millennium in the greatest nation on Earth, there are pockets of hate that continue to thrive. After my tenure in Congress, I know full well the limits of government. I know we can pass no law forcing people to respect each other or forcing them to be tolerant. But this ad goes beyond mere hurtful words and actually advocates murder, and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms. 
   As chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, an enrolled member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana, and as an American, I am embarrassed and outraged at the same time. This is shameful. 
   Indian children are most affected by this kind of bile. They hear these hate-filled expressions in school, in public places like shopping malls and grocery stores, and they start to believe they are worthless, and they eventually stop trying to become or achieve anything. Many commit suicide. This is ongoing. 
   In a few days, the Nation will honor the contributions of generations of Native Americans by dedicating the month of November, 1999, as ``American Indian Heritage Month''. 
   Native people have fought and died for this country in every war from the Revolutionary War to WWII to Vietnam to the ongoing missions around the world. 
   Yet, as this ad shows, Indians are still targeted by these expressions of hate. 
   I condemn this and every instance of discrimination and hatred against any American--red, black, white or yellow--and call on my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would authorize the Librarian of Congress to acquire Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior's personal papers from his estate. I am pleased to be joined in this important initiative by my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator JOE LIEBERMAN. This bill is a companion to H.R. 2963, which was introduced by our colleagues in the House of Representatives, Congressman JAMES CLYBURN and Congressman J.C. WATTS.  
   Dr. King, as a minister, civil rights leader, prolific writer and Nobel Prize winner, was deeply committed to nonviolence in the struggle for civil rights. He is quite possibly the most important and influential black leader in American history.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago, many of my Senate colleagues met a young, dynamic parliamentarian from Belarus, Mr. Anatoly Lebedko, right here on the Senate floor. He impressed us with his dedication and commitment as he advocates for democracy and the rule of law in his home country currently being rule by a repressive regime. 
   You can imagine how shocked and concerned I was to receive a call from the State Department this week informing me Mr. Lebedko had been picked up by the authorities as part of the latest crackdown in Belarus. I am sure my colleagues who met Mr. Lebedko share my concern for his well-being and for the safety of all of those struggling for democracy and freedom of speech. 
   Eight years after the break-up of the Soviet Union, Belarus finds itself increasingly isolated from the rest of Europe as a direct consequence of the authoritarian policies pursued by its present government which have stifled that country's fledging democracy and market economy. 
   The Helsinki Commission, which I co-chair, held a hearing a few months ago to assess democracy and human rights in Belarus. In July, a number of Commission members and I had the opportunity to hear Mr. Lebedko address the annual Parliamentary Assembly meeting of the Organization of Security and Corporation in Europe (OSCE) in St. Petersburg, where he outlined developments in Belarus and the prospects for genuine political and economic reforms. 
   Clearly, the cycle of political and economic stagnation in Belarus will only come to an end through genuine dialogue based on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The Helsinki Commission has called on Belarus to adopt meaningful political and economic reforms in keeping with that country's obligations as a participating State of the OSCE. 
   On September 3, the government and opposition in Belarus began consultations at the office of the OSCE Advisory and Monitoring Group in Minsk. These talks, long urged by the international community and the Helsinki Commission could represent an important step in beginning the process of reversing the bleak human rights and democratization picture in Belarus. 
   Until recently I had been encouraged by what appeared to be the start of a dialog between the Belarusian Government and opposition. However, there have been a number of disturbing developments, including continued harassment of opposition members, a renewed crackdown on the independent media in recent weeks, and now the detainment of Mr. Lebedko. 
   We recently wrote to Secretary of State Albright voicing concern about the situation in Belarus and called on the State Department to intensify its work in this area. This most recent development underscores our concerns.

Mr. President, today I urge my colleagues to support passage of the pending resolution, Senate Resolution 190, designating October 10, 1999, through October 16, 1999, as ``National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Week.'' I introduced this legislation in September and am pleased that it garnered such strong bipartisan support from my Senate colleagues. I am hopeful that greater awareness of cystic fibrosis, CF will lead to a cure. 
   Incredibly, CF is the number one genetic killer in the United States. Approximately 30,000 Americans suffer from the life-threatening disease. Today, the average life expectancy for someone with CF is 31 years. We must do what we can to change that. 
   I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this resolution so that we can move one step closer to eradicating this disease.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joining Senator MCCAIN in co-sponsoring the Indian Tribal Government Unemployment Compensation Act Tax Relief Amendments of 1999. If enacted, this legislation will modify the Federal Unemployment Tax Act of 1935 (``FUTA'') to allow Indian tribal governments to receive the same unemployment compensation treatment as state and local governments. 
   FUTA imposes a tax on the wages paid by employers to their employees. From these tax proceeds, unemployment insurance and benefits for out-of-work citizens is provided. Under the bill introduced today, Indian tribal governments would be treated as state and local governments, and would be authorized to contribute to state unemployment funds on a reimbursable basis. 
   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that this bill would have a minimal impact, $10 million over 10 years, on the Federal budget. 
   However, the impact that this amendment would have on Indian economic development is immeasurable. The development of strong tribal economies is fundamental for tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination. 
   Private enterprise is often reluctant to do business and hire Indian workers if legal, tax, and regulatory regimes they face are confusing or unfriendly. This legislation would eliminate any confusion over the applicability of the FUTA tax and would create a level playing field for tribal governments and enhance their ability to attract and retain the best skilled employees.  
   By providing equitable FUTA treatment to tribal government employers, this legislation will assist in the long-term growth and stability of tribal economies. 
   I urge my colleagues to join Senator MCCAIN and I in supporting this important legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to amend the National Trails System Act to clarify federal authority relating to land acquisition from willing sellers. This bill is the companion to Congressman SCOTT MCINNIS' legislation. Congressman MCINNIS has been an advocate for this legislation for many years. 
   There are 20 trails in the national scenic and historic trail system. These trails are among some of the most beautiful areas in the United States and are deserving of preservation. This bill will enable the federal government to help conserve the special resources of all of these congressionally designated trails, enabling everyone to enjoy the benefit of these trails today and for future generations of Americans tomorrow. 
   This legislation does not appropriate any money, it only provides the federal government the authority to acquire lands from willing sellers. Once willing sellers are identified, Congress then appropriates the money so that the land can be purchased. It also will help to address the increasing development pressures that threaten the long-range continuity of the National Trails System. 
   Currently, the federal government only has authority to buy land along 11 of the 20 national scenic and historic trails. This bill gives authority to buy  land from willing sellers along the other nine trails to ensure that the entire trail can be preserved. 
   There are many unique and special historic sites along the nine affected scenic and historic trails. These sites have been voluntarily protected for several generations by responsible individual families. These families should have the right to sell these irreplaceable places of our nation's heritage to the federal government to continue their protection when and if they choose to do so.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution recognizing October 10, 1999, through October 16, 1999, as National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Week. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senators GRAMM, ASHCROFT, KERRY, and ROBB in submitting this resolution. We are hopeful that greater awareness of cystic fibrosis (CF) will lead to a cure. 
   Incredibly, CF is the number one genetic killer in the United States. Approximately 30,000 Americans suffer from the life-threatening disease. Today, the average life expectancy for someone with CF is 31 years. We must do what we can to change that. 
   While there remains no cure, early detection and prompt treatment can significantly improve and extend the lives of those with CF. For example, my home state of Colorado is one of the first and only states that requires CF screening for newborns, providing a greater quality of life for CF sufferers. And since the discovery of the defective CF gene in 1989, CF research has greatly accelerated. At Children's Hospital of Denver, researchers are participating in the innovative Therapeutics Development Program, a promising venture with the CF Foundation. Designed to aid the development of new therapeutics for CF, researchers in the program are expediting the early phases of clinical trials that evaluate safety and dosing regimens for new drugs. I applaud their efforts. 
   But while I am encouraged by the CF research in Colorado and elsewhere, more needs to be done. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to act quickly on this resolution so that we can move one step closer to eradicating this disease.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill which will help preserve our natural wonders. The bill contains an amendment that I offered which would direct the forest service to conduct a study of the severity of Mountain Pine Beetle in the Rocky Mountain Region and report back to Congress within six months after enactment on how to address this problem. As adopted the amendment would not have any budget ramifications. 
   My amendment is in the interest of our national forests. According to the Forest Service this outbreak of the Pine Beetle infestation is similar to the one that occurred in the 1970's. During that period there were peak annual losses of over 1 million trees as a result of the beetle. Right now we are seeing the beginning of another epidemic, which is continuing to grow. 
   There are a number of factors which contribute to the current Mountain Pine Beetle problem--the general lack of forest management, which includes proper timber harvesting, and increased susceptibility resulting from the suppression of forest fires. 
   The current infestation is in the northern two-thirds of the front range of Colorado where the largest number of people live in my home state. Surveys by the Forest Service and Colorado State Forest Service survey shows 12,891 dead trees detected in 1996; 32,445 in 1997; and 74,288 in 1998. All indications are that we will see a staggering 150,000 trees infested in 1999. It is clear that if this trend continues we will see an outbreak worse than the 1970's. I am also concerned about the high possibility that dead timber from the pine beetle will catch on fire and wreak havoc on Colorado's front range.  
   It is important for Congress to address this problem now before it gets out of control and the people of Colorado find themselves with thousands of dead trees. I urge my colleagues to support passage of the bill. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   At the outset, I thank the ranking member of the Treasury Subcommittee, Senator DORGAN, and his staff for all of their valuable assistance and support during that process. 
   The conference report provides a total of $28,239,811,000, of which $13,706,000,000 is discretionary spending. We have provided funding necessary for the Department of the Treasury, the United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and various independent agencies to move into the new millennium. 
   Here are some of the highlights of this conference report. 
   The conference provided $12.32 million to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to Expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative. This is $1.12 million more than the requested level, and brings the total funding for this very effective program to $51.32 million. 
   The conference also provided $13 million to ATF for grants to State and local law enforcement to allow participation in the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) Program. The GREAT Program provides our youth with the tools they need to resist the powerful pull of gangs and has been highly successful as a deterrent to the growth of youth gangs. 
   The conference report provides funding for the continued operation and growth of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. We are still very much committed to the consolidation of training for Federal law enforcement officers at FLETC. After completion of the five-year construction master plan, FLETC will be better able to serve the training demands of most Federal law enforcement agencies. 
   For the Customs Service, the conference has provided $4.3 million for pre-hiring polygraph examinations and $2.5 million for the creation of the Office of Assistant Commissioner for Training to continue integrity efforts begun last year. 
   The conference has funded the Customs Cyber-Smuggling Center at $4 million, which is a $1.6 million increase over last year. 
   The conference has provided full funding for the Internal Revenue Service to allow them to fulfill the requirements of the Restructuring and Reform Act, to proceed with their much-needed organizational modernization plan, and to continue necessary improvements in customer service. This funding also provides $6 million for grants to low income taxpayer clinics. 
   The conference has increased funding for the very critical technology transfer program under the Drug Czar's Office. This $13.25 million program provides drug interdiction technology to State and local law enforcement. For fiscal year 2000, the funding was increased by more than $10 million over the administration's request. 
   The conference has provided $185 million for the continued operation of the national youth anti-drug media campaign, and $192 million for the popular and effective high intensity drug trafficking areas (HIDTA) Program. In addition, the conference has included funding for a management review of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) by an independent entity in an effort to strengthen the office's operations and programs. 
   The conference included a combined total of $2 million for the model state drug law conferences and the National Drug Court Institute, programs which assist State and local enforcement in combating the end results of drug addiction and resulting crimes. 
   Mr. President, again I say that everyone did not get everything, and certainly everybody doesn't agree with every provision of this bill. But I think it is a very worthy conference report, on balance, and I think we brought to the Senate an excellent product. It certainly deserves the support of the entire Senate and signature of the President. 
   I again thank my friend and coworker, Senator DORGAN, for his hard  work, and also the staff we depended very heavily on this time around, including Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, Lula Edwards, of the majority staff, Barbara Retzlaf, who left a couple weeks to go to the Commerce Department, Chip Walgren, and Dylan Presman. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to amend the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA) of 1983 to address the issue of Indian land fractionation: the underlying factor in the Indian trust reform effort. Under the 1871 Allotment Act, or ``Dawes'' act as it became known, the President was authorized to break up Indian reservations, allotting to each member of the tribe a tract of land. The Act also directed the Secretary of Interior to acquire some of the remaining tribal lands; often for subsequent resale to non-Indians. The day the Allotment Act became law, this country probably violated more treaties than in the hundred years before this Act or in the hundred years since. 
   The negative effects of the Act continue to be felt even to this day. For example, the existence of hundreds of thousands of small, undivided fractional interests in Indian lands has swamped the Bureau of Indian Affairs' ability to keep track of who owns these interests, who is leasing them, how much is owed, and who has a right to the revenues from these lands. 
   In 1934, Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), ending the allotment policy and everything that it stood for by providing that no new allotments would be mandated by the federal government. 
   The IRA authorized the Secretary of Interior to acquire lands for tribes, enabling Indian tribes to re-establish their land bases which had been decimated by the allotment policy. Notwithstanding the IRA, the ownership of individual allotments continued to fragment. For example the four heirs of an Indian who died owning a 160 acre allotment would each receive a 25 percent interest in the entire allotment; not a 40 acre parcel. If all four of those heirs had four children, these 16 heirs would each receive only a 1.56 percent interest, divided among 64 owners. 
   In such situations, even locating the individuals to obtain their approval for a lease is nearly impossible. Clearly, getting a handle on the geometric rise in fractionated interests is necessary or the problem will be beyond our efforts to improve the management of tribal trust lands and funds. 
   Previous Congressional efforts to reverse fractionation were declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. This proposal makes use of the lessons we have learned from those efforts. 
   In 1983, Congress enacted the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), authorizing Indian tribes to enact land consolidation plans to sell or lease their lands to acquire fractional interests. The Act also allowed tribes to acquire, at fair market value, all of the interests in an allotment, and to enact probate codes to limit inheritance of allotted lands to Indians or tribal members. 
   The most controversial provision of the ILCA involved an escheat provision preventing the inheritance of any interest in land that was 2 percent or less of an undivided ownership in an allotment if it generated less than $100 before returning to the tribe. 
   The Supreme Court found this section unconstitutional because it restricted Indians' ability to pass their land interests to their heirs. 
   In 1984 Congress amended the ILCA to provide that undivided interests of 2 percent or less only returned to the tribe if they were incapable of earning $100 in any one of the five years from the date of its owner's death. In 1997, the Court once again ruled that the escheat provision of the act was unconstitutional. 
   The bill I am introducing today makes use of nearly two decades of Congressional efforts to deal with the problem of land fractionation. We have the benefit of two Supreme Court cases to guide our deliberations. I am pleased to report that associations of individual allotment owners, in particular the Indian Land Working Group, have made very constructive proposals and contributions to our understanding of how land consolidation legislation may affect their members. The bill also uses the Administration's proposed legislation as a framework for reforming the ILCA. 
   This bill establishes a three-pronged approach to dealing with the problems of fractionated ownership of allotted lands. 
   First, the bill provides desperately needed reform for the probate of interests in allotted lands, including limitations on who may inherit these interests. 
   Second, this bill would prohibit the inheritance of any interests that represent 2 percent or less of the ownership of an allotment unless it is specifically provided for in a valid will. This provision will be controversial, but the Administration insists that it is necessary to address: ``one of the root causes of our trust asset management difficulties.'' This provision will only apply in those situations where Indian owners are notified in advance that their interests could be lost unless they execute a will to address the 2 percent interest issues. 
   Finally, the bill establishes time-frames for BIA review of tribal probate codes, and authorizes the Secretary to acquire fractional interests on behalf of a tribe. The Secretary will apply the lease proceeds from these interests until the purchase price is recouped. Indian tribes with approved land consolidation plans may enter into agreements with the Secretary to use these funds for their acquisition program. In either case, the focus of this program will be consolidating small fractional interests that are choking the system. 
   The bill takes some steps to encourage and assist part-owners of allotments who are trying to consolidate the ownership of their allotments, and makes it federal policy to assist with transactions, such as land exchanges between those owning comparable fractional interests. 
   There is a demonstrable need for more resources to address the problems associated with land fractionation, including the need to educate allotment owners about probate planning options and opportunities. Creative solutions to this issue should be pursued. For example, some have proposed the use of federal income tax credits for those individuals who convey their fractional interest to a tribe. 
   This bill does not please all parties to the debate, but it is a good faith effort to achieve most of our shared goals. If these parties will work in good faith, I will do my part as Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee to convene hearings and work with them through the legislative process.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, the American Indian Trust Management Reform Act of 1994 established the Office of Special Trustee within the Department of Interior. Many believe that the reform efforts initiated by the Act were dealt a serious set-back when the person confirmed by the Senate for this position resigned in response to the Secretary's effort to re-organize the Office of the Special Trustee without notifying the Special Trustee, the Congress, the Advisory Commission established by the 1994 Act, affected Indian tribes, or Indian account holders. 
   A number of concerns have been raised by the absence of a Special Trustee appointed and confirmed in a manner consistent with the Act. Perhaps the most important concern raised in hearings on the trust fund crisis is the absence of a responsible official with either the independence or the appearance of independence of an appointed Special Trustee. The Act was designed to allow the Special Trustee to act and advise Congress in an independent manner. For example, the Act required the Special Trustee to certify in writing of the adequacy of the budget requests for those entities responsible for discharging the Secretary's trust responsibility. 
   In light of the federal government's dismal history of its management of trust funds, it is not surprising that Indian tribes and Indian account holders are concerned that the same institutions that produced this crisis are in complete control of the efforts to reform it. In addition, trust management experts have testified before joint hearings of the Indian Affairs and the Energy and Natural Resources Committees that it is simply naive to assume that comprehensive rethinking and reform will be carried out by the very institutions that are in desperate need of reform. 
   In an effort to regain the independence needed to assure individual and tribal account holders, the legislation I introduce today will establish the position of Special Trustee for Data Cleanup and Internal Control. Under this legislation, the person holding this position will be appointed by the Inspector General of the Department of Interior to ensure that the incumbent is not beholden to the entities responsible for developing or implementing the Administration's High Level Implementation Plan. This bill would allow the Secretary to remove the incumbent only for good cause. 
   Under this bill, the Special Trustee for Data Cleanup and Internal Control is directed to contract out for the matters under his or her control and to retain temporary employees to the greatest extent feasible. This will ensure those cleaning up the system and designing internal controls will not be subject to the criticism that they might be tempted to gloss over past mistakes or develop internal controls that can easily be fulfilled.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Native American Census Participation Enhancement Act of 1999. 
   Like all past censuses, the 2000 Decennial Census will play a vital role in American society. By counting the population of the United States, the decennial census serves as the statistical basis for distributing federal funds, redistricting for political representation, and planning for future infrastructure development. 
   Participating in this ritual every ten years is important for all Americans. But for Native Americans, this Federal tally is perhaps even more important. 
   As we all know, Native Americans have been under-represented in past census counts. The most recent census, conducted in 1990, was extremely inaccurate in its count of American Indians and Alaskan Natives who were living in rural reservation areas. 
   The effects of undercounting American Indians and Alaskan Natives have real consequences for Native communities. 
   An undercount of Native Americans skews population statistics which are used to allocate and distribute federal funds and services to tribes. For example, funds made available under the Federal Welfare-to-Work Grant program and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) are both determined by reference to census statistics. 
   These key programs offer millions of dollars in Federal assistance to help low-income Americans make the transition from welfare to work and to build healthier and more productive communities. 
   This direct correlation between an accurate census and whether or not Native communities will be treated fairly and more than that, whether they will be given the tools they need to strengthen their economies, is the reason for the bill I am introducing today. 
   There has been a lot of debate about the 2000 Census and whether the count can be more accurately done through statistical sampling or other methods. 
   In my opinion, article I of our Constitution is clear in requiring that ``an actual enumeration'' be taken of the population every ten years. 
   As chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs I have an obligation to see to it that Native Americans are treated fairly. At the same time I believe that Natives themselves bear a measure of responsibility for their destinies. 
   Just as the Census Bureau and the United States have a legal obligation to conduct an actual count, American Indians and Alaska Natives have a responsibility to answer the census and ensure that they are represented in the final tally. 
   This Congress and our nation can rightly demand that the United States fulfill its obligations to the Constitution and to Native Americans and achieve both a fair and complete count of American Indians and Alaskan Natives in Census 2000. 
   The bill I am introducing today will help ensure that Native Americans achieve a higher level of participation in the Census and ensure a more accurate count by authorizing the Secretary of Commerce to provide grants to Indian tribes and organizations to stimulate Native awareness of and participation in the 2000 Census. 
   It also provides incentives to help the Secretary and Indian tribes to recruit temporary employees and volunteer ``Census Assistants'' to work in and with Native communities and encourage Natives to answer the census. 
   I am hopeful that as the Census Bureau continues to lay the groundwork for the 2000 Census, it take into account the unique needs of the Native communities and the importance of getting an accurate count of all Native Americans.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President today I am pleased to introduce the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act Amendments of 1999. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, by the early 1990's, it was obvious that the Federal Government could not account for many of the funds it manages as the trustee to Indian tribes and their members. Most of these responsibilities were lodged in the Department of the Interior and its Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
   Studies by the General Accounting Office revealed that the Department and BIA lacked individuals with the knowledge, experience, or expertise needed to oversee and coordinate reform efforts. Congress reacted by enacting the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act (AITFRA) of 1994. 
   Responding to criticisms that the Department's reform efforts were uncoordinated and piecemeal, Congress called for the appointment of a ``Special Trustee'' to provide overall management of the reform activities. The 1994 Act called for the President to nominate and for the Senate to confirm a Special Trustee with demonstrated experience in the management of trust funds, including the investment and management of large sums of money. 
   The 1994 Act did not give the Special Trustee all of the tools he or she needed to ensure that the Federal Government would live up to the same trust  standards imposed on any other trustee. For example, although Congress sought to make the Special Trustee ``independent,'' he had little recourse when Secretary Bruce Babbitt unilaterally reorganized the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians through a Secretarial Order. In fact the Special Trustee resigned following the issuance of the Order in January 1999. 
   In 1997, the Special Trustee unveiled the Strategic Plan required by the 1994 Act. The Secretary declined an invitation by the Indian Affairs Committee to appear and explain his opposition to the Plan, especially those elements of the Plan that would allow some trust management functions to be performed by entities outside the Department of Interior. 
   Indian Country neither firmly embraced, nor rejected the proposed Strategic Plan. Indian Country has expressed strong concerns, and often opposition to the Department's own proposal, the High Level Implementation Plan. 
   In our joint Indian Affairs--Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearings, one theme has been repeated over and over: we cannot expect the institution that created the problem to design and implement comprehensive reforms for that system. It is also necessary to ensure that any reform proposal is the result of a broad-based consultation with all of the affected entities, especially Indian tribes, intertribal entities, and Indian account holders. It is likely that any reforms proposed by such a process will require legislative implementation. 
   The legislation I introduce today satisfies each of these factors. First, it 
   does not rely on those responsible for the current situation to determine the scope of reform. Second, it establishes a process that will give those with the greatest stake in this process a commensurate opportunity to develop and propose reforms. It also provides an opportunity for all those concerned to participate in this process. Finally, this legislation makes it clear that at the conclusion of this process, Congress should consider whether legislation is necessary. 
   This bill directs the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders, the Speaker of the House and Minority Leader, and the Secretary of Interior to consult and make appointments that equitably represent those who will be the most affected by the management of trust funds. The legislation also requires the Commission to consider whether private enterprise, a tribal or inter-tribal enterprise, or perhaps a government sponsored corporate entity should be part of the government's fulfillment of its trust obligation. This same commission will determine which federal regulatory agency is best suited to regulate the Federal Government's activities as trustee. 
   Every financial institution managing and investing the money of the citizens of the United States is regulated by some entity, for example by the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Federal Reserve Board, or the Office of Thrift Supervision. The only exception that I am aware of is the federal government when it acts as a trustee to Indians and Indian tribes. And by now we can all see the mess that has resulted from this lack of regulatory oversight. 
   This bill does not mandate the form of organization or entity best suited to oversee the Federal Government's activities as trustee. Instead, it creates an open and fair process for these issues to be decided by those who know the most about how financial institutions and their trust Departments are regulated. 
   This bill builds upon a proposal made by the Intertribal Monitoring Association and represents a starting point for determining how to strengthen the 1994 Act. 
   This bill is a necessary counterpart to another bill I am introducing to amend the Indian Land Consolidation Act of 1983 to address the fractionated ownership of Indian lands, one of the primary causes of the trust funds crisis. With both measures, it is essential that all parties involved--the tribes, individual Indians, the Interior Department, and Congress--set out to finally lay the groundwork for real trust fund reform. Native Americans deserve no less.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I don't think anyone has more disagreement with Secretary Babbitt than I do as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. Certainly Indian trust funds have been an issue on which we have been at odds for literally months with the Secretary. In addition to that, as a member of the Energy Committee, I have had my disagreements with him on grazing, water, and many other things, too. But there are at least four reasons to oppose this amendment. 
   I hope my friend, the Senator from Florida, will consider withdrawing it. 
   First, after the Supreme Court decided in Seminole v. Florida that Indian tribes cannot sue States for unwillingness to negotiate Indian gaming agreements, it created a terrific problem, as many Members know. We have spent a considerable amount of time in our committee, with me as the chairman of that Committee on Indian Affairs, looking for ways that States and tribes can come to some consensus. 
   We have a pending bill, S. 985. We have worked on it very hard. We want the legislative process to proceed. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires tribes to have compacts before they can operate class III gaming. Right now, unfortunately, the States hold all the cards since the court decided the States do not have to negotiate in good faith. 
   The Secretary of the Interior is now in Federal court over his ability to issue the kind of procedures that this amendment seeks to stop. As the Senator from Florida probably knows, these procedures can only be put into effect if they are published in the Federal Register. The States of Alabama and Florida have sued the Secretary of the Interior if this case moves ahead in the courts. It is in the interest of all parties, States and tribes, for the United States to allow the courts to decide once and for all if the Secretary has this authority.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Native American Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program Consolidation Act of 1999, to enable Indian tribes to consolidate and integrate alcohol and substance abuse prevention, diagnosis, and treatment programs to provide unified and more effective services to Native Americans. 
   Native communities continue to be plagued by alcohol and substance abuse at staggering rates and this abuse is wreaking havoc on Native families across the country. 
   Unfortunately, alcohol continues to be an important risk factor associated with the top three killers of Native youth--accidents, suicide, and homicide. 
   Based on 1993 data, the rate of mortality due to alcoholism among Native youth ages 15 to 24 was 5.2 per 100,000, which is 17 times the rate for whites of the same age. 
   Native Americans have higher rates of alcohol and drug use than any other racial or ethnic group. Despite previous treatment and preventive efforts, alcoholism and substance abuse continue to be prevalent among Native youth: 82 percent of Native adolescents admitted to having used alcohol, compared with 66 percent of non-Native youth. 
   In a 1994 school-based study, 39 percent of Native high school seniors reported having ``gotten drunk'' and 39 percent of Native kids admitted to using marijuana. 
   Alcohol and substance abuse also contributes to other social problems including sexually transmitted diseases, child and spousal abuse, poor school achievement and dropout, drunk-driving related deaths, mental health problems, hopelessness and, too commonly, suicide. 
   The Federal Government offers several disparate and currently uncoordinated substance abuse prevention and treatment programs for which Native Americans are eligible. This bill addresses how to best coordinate these programs so that the resources are effectively targeted at the communities that need them. 
   Program funds from the Department of Education include the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities--National Programs; and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities--State Grants. 
   In the Department of Health and Human Services the programs include the Administration for Children and Families' (ACF) Social Services Block Grant; the Indian Health Service's (IHS) Urban Indian Health Services funds; the IHS's Research funds; the IHS's Alcohol and Substance Abuse services including outpatient visits, inpatient days, regional treatment centers, admissions, aftercare referrals, and emergency placements; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Grants for Residential Treatment Programs for Pregnant and Postpartum Women; the SAMHSA Demonstration Grants for Residential Treatment for women and their Children; the SAMHSA Cooperative Agreements for Substance Abuse Treatment and Recovery Systems for Rural, Remote and Culturally Distinct Populations; the SAMHSA Mental Health Planning and Demonstration Projects; the SAMHSA Demonstration Grants for the Prevention of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Among High-Risk Populations; the SAMHSA Demonstration Grants on Model Projects for Pregnant and Postpartum Women and their Infants; the SAMHSA Comprehensive Residential Drug Prevention and Treatment, Projects for Substance-Using Women and their Children; and the SAMHSA Block Grants for Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse. 
   Programs in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) include Community Planning and Development, Shelter Plus Care; and HUD's Drug Elimination Grant funds. 
   Department of the Interior program funds include the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Services to Indian Children, Elderly and Families funds. 
   Programs in the Department of Justice include National Institute of Justice, Justice Research, Development, and Evaluation Project Grants. 
   The Department of Transportation funds include National Highway Traffic Safety Administration/Federal Highway Administration funds. 
   Funds available through the National Institutes of Health--National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism include several different grant programs for minorities and the prevention of alcohol abuse. 
   The goal of this bill is to authorize tribal governments and inter-tribal organizations to consolidate these programs through a single Federal office, in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and use a single implementation plan to reduce the administrative and bureaucratic processes and result in more and better services to Native Americans. 
   This legislation tracks the widely-hailed and very successful ``477 model''  that Indian tribes have had used to effectively coordinate employment training and related services through the Indian Employment Training and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 (Pub. Law 102-477). 
   Under the ``477 model,'' an applicant tribe can file a single comprehensive plan to draw and coordinate resources from many federal agencies and administer them through one office, the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior. 
   To facilitate this inter-agency resource transfer, Secretaries of named agencies are required to negotiate and enter into memoranda of understanding. 
   The bill I am introducing today mirrors the ``477 model'' for purposes of alcohol and drug abuse resources. 
   I am certain that with this authority, Indian tribes can achieve the same high level of success they have had in the employment training field.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Indian Tribal Justice System Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 1999'' to bolster earlier efforts to strengthen Indian tribal justice systems such as the Indian Tribal Justice Act of 1933. I want to be clear: the legislation I am introducing today is intended to complement, not substitute for, the 1993 Act. 
   Unfortunately, most Native Americans continue to live in abject poverty and as with other indigent groups, access to legal assistance is poor. 
   In 1997 the Department of Justice published a report showing that crime, particularly violent crime, is rampant on Indian lands. The Congress and the Administration both properly responded with an infusion of millions of dollars for crime prevention, prosecution and detention. 
   There is also a huge need civil legal assistance in Native communities that is not now being met and that is one of the aims of the bill I am introducing today. 
   Since the late 1960's Indian Legal Services (``ILS'') organizations have stepped into the fray to provide basic legal service to individual Native Americans and tribes whose members  fall within the federal poverty guidelines. 
   There are now 30 Indian legal service organizations--very small programs which receive the bulk of their funds from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). ILS programs provide basic, bread-and-butter legal representation to individual Indian people, and small tribes, throughout the United States. 
   In addition to providing legal help to individual Natives, ILS assists tribes in developing tribal justice systems, including training court personnel, and strengthening the capacity of tribal courts to handle both civil and criminal matters. 
   The ILS organizations have been involved in developing written codes on tribal law and practice and procedure in tribal courts, training 
   tribal judges, developing tribal court ``lay advocate'' programs and training lay advocates, and the developing tribal ``peacemaking'' systems which are traditional alternative dispute resolution methods. 
   The ILS programs carrying out these key functions include the DNA Legal Services of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah; the Michigan Indian Legal Services; the Dakota Plains Legal Services; Wisconsin Judicare; Idaho Legal Aid Services; Oklahoma Indian legal Services; Pine Tree Legal Assistance of Maine, and many others. 
   Together, tribal governments and the ILS organizations work to ensure that Native justice systems work and that Natives and non-Natives alike have confidence in tribal justice systems and institutions. 
   Generating that confidence is important for a variety of reasons. For instance, there are many factors determining whether or not a Native community can be competitive and attract investment and business activities to boost employment: a solid physical infrastructure, a skilled and healthy workforce, access to capital, and a governing structure that encourages risk taking and entrepreneurship. 
   Part of such an environment is a judicial system that instills confidence in businesses as well as individuals that disputes can be settled fairly, that contracts will be honored, and that the governed recognize the government's authority as legitimate. 
   A disordered system does not foster that confidence. Whether or not individuals will have access to legal services and well-ordered tribunals is key to development. 
   A strong ``legal infrastructure'' is widely recognized in American business circles as a necessary condition for business development whether it be in Russian, Indonesia, inner city America, or on Indian lands. 
   Within existing appropriations, the bill I am introducing authorizes the Attorney General, in consultation with the Office of Tribal Justice, to provide assistance to legal service organizations and non-profit entities to help build capacity of tribal courts and tribal justice systems so that confidence in these systems can be augmented, and much-needed legal assistance will be provided. 
   The three areas targeted for assistance are training for tribal judicial personnel, tribal civil legal assistance, and tribal criminal assistance. 
   I believe that in addition to regulatory reform, physical infrastructure, and development assistance, strengthening tribal justice systems is another component in bringing real development to tribal economies and government.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act Amendments of 1999. 
   This bill will amend Public Law 102-477, better known as ``the 477 law'' that authorizes Indian tribes and tribal organizations to bring together many federal employment and training programs, consolidate them into one plan, and in the process achieve an efficiency that otherwise would not be possible. 
   The 1992 Act allows tribes to submit one comprehensive plan, to one agency, and in the process to bring together resources from the Departments of Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, and others for purposes of employment training. 
   The keys to the success of ``477'' is that it is entirely voluntary--with tribes deciding for themselves whether to take advantage of its benefits; and second, it involves no federal appropriations of funds to administer it. Participating tribes report that the elimination of paperwork and bureaucracy are as important as is the administrative flexibility that ``477'' provides to tribes. 
   The focus of the 1996 federal welfare reform laws now being implemented by states and Indian tribes is on getting and retaining employment. 
   For Native American communities, many of whom suffer unemployment rates in the 80 to 90 percent range, job opportunities are difficult to come by and as a result the success of the 1996 law in Native communities is threatened. 
   In the 106th Congress the Committee on Indian Affairs has put economic and business development on Native lands at the center of its agenda. In addition to regulatory reform, physical infrastructure, and access to capital, part of the agenda must be to find creative efforts to maximize scarce federal resources for Indian development. 
   By all accounts, the 1992 Act has been a success for Native people struggling to get employment and training and other services related to 
   the world of work. 
   The bill I am introducing today will build on that success and liberalize tribal authority under the statute, authorize actual job-creation activities, permit regional consortia of Alaska Native entities to participate in the program, and require that the agencies and the ``477 tribes'' begin to take the next steps in enlarging the scope of ``477'' by bringing in the resources of additional agencies whose mission is related to human resource, physical infrastructure, and economic development assistance generally. 
   A feasibility study and report are due to the authorizing committees not later than one year after enactment of the legislation. 
   As the Self Governance model has already shown, putting tribes in the driver's seat results in better services to consumers, more efficient administrative frameworks, and often times a savings in federal resources. This bill will improve on an already-successful program and help Native communities provide employment training and jobs to their citizens.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the International Anti-Corruption Act of 1999 to address the growing problem of official and unofficial corruption abroad and the direct impact on U.S. business. This bill is based on S.1200, which I introduced in the 105th Congress. 
   As the Co-chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I intend to address this growing problem of corruption. Last month, I chaired a Commission hearing that focused on the issues of bribery and corruption in the OSCE region, an area stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. The Commission heard that, in economic terms, rampant corruption and organized crime in this vast region has cost U.S. businesses billions of dollars in lost contracts with direct implications for our economy. 
   Ironically, Mr. President, in some of the biggest recipients of U.S. foreign assistance--countries like Russia and Ukraine--the climate is either not conducive or outright hostile to American business. Last month, I also attended the annual session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in St. Petersburg, Russia, where I had an opportunity to sit down with U.S. business representatives to learn, first-hand, the obstacles they face. 
   Mr. President, the time has come to stop providing aid as usual to those countries which line up to receive our assistance, only to turn around and fleece U.S. businesses conducting legitimate operations in these countries. For this reason, I am introducing the International Anti-Corruption Act of 1999 to require the State Department to submit a report and the President to certify by March 1 of each year that countries which are receiving U.S. foreign aid are, in fact, conducive to American businesses and investors. If a country is found to be hostile to American businesses, aid from the United States would be cut off. The certification would be specifically based on whether a country is making progress  in, and is committed to, economic reform aimed at eliminating corruption. 
   Under my bill, if the President certifies that a country's business climate is not conducive for U.S. businesses, that country will, in effect, be put on probation. The country would continue to receive U.S. foreign aid through the end of the fiscal year, but aid would be cut off on the first day of the next fiscal year unless the President certifies the country is making significant progress in implementing the specified economic indicators and is committed to recognizing the involvement of U.S. business. 
   My bill also includes the customary waiver authority where the national interests of the United States are at stake. For countries certified as hostile to or not conducive for U.S. business, aid can continue if the President determines it is in the national security interest of the United States. However, the determination expires after 6 months unless the President determines its continuation is important to our national security interest. 
   I also included a provision which would allow aid to continue to meet urgent humanitarian needs, including food, medicine, disaster and refugee relief, to support democratic political reform and rule of law activities, and to create private sector and nongovernmental organizations that are independent of government control, or to develop a free market economic system. 
   Mr. President, instead of jumping on the bandwagon to pump millions of additional tax dollars into countries which are hostile to U.S. businesses and investors, we should be working to root out the kinds of bribery and corruption that have an overall chilling effect on much needed foreign investment. Left unchecked, such corruption will continue to undermine fledgling democracies worldwide and further impede moves toward a genuine free market economy. I believe the legislation I am introducing today is a critical step this direction, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Today I join my colleague, Senator HATCH, in introducing the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 1999. These amendments, which are desperately needed, will help to provide much needed relief and assistance to many victims of uranium exposure and make this Act more consistent with current medical knowledge. 
   From 1946 to 1971, the United States purchased domestically-mined uranium for our nuclear weapons arsenal. Many of these mines were located in western Colorado, affecting citizens in my state. With the uranium mined there, in my colleague's state of Utah and throughout the western United States, we were able to develop vast stores of nuclear weapons, which were the key to our national security. The cold war demanded that we keep producing these weapons in order to keep up with, and defend ourselves against, the former Soviet Union. It was not until many years later that scientists began to realize that, ironically, the uranium we were mining to help create weapons to protect us in a nuclear war, was actually killing those men who mined it. Also harmed were those brave men and women who participated in atmospheric tests of the weapons armed with the uranium. 
   By 1971, the Atomic Energy Commission had put in place, and fully implemented, ventilation and safety procedures which greatly reduced the threat of radiation exposure. But for those miners and test-site participants who were involved in the atomic weapons program in the years before the changes, there was little more available for them than a kind word and pat on the back as they developed cancer and other diseases. 
   In 1990, we took steps to change the way we treated these victims. I cosponsored a measure in the House which allowed victims of certain types of radiation exposure to file claims with the Department of Justice and collect up to $100,000 in damages. It was the first step toward acknowledging the unknown sacrifice many of those miners and test participants made to win the cold war. 
   With the passage of the law, the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) began further researching the health effects of radiation exposure. Their studies have revealed that several other types of cancer and nonmalignant respiratory diseases are caused by exposure to radiation, in addition to those listed in the original act. Furthermore, the BEIR Committee has discovered that many of the factors we thought contributed to cancer, such as coffee consumption, actually have no effect. Additionally, the unnecessarily long length of exposure, sometimes as high as 500 working level months, was determined by experts to be excessive and difficult to accurately measure and prove. The findings of the BEIR Committee have led us to seek to update the original law, with the advice and input of many experts in the health and mining fields, by amending the act with the latest scientific research. 
   It's time to finish what we started in the 1990 act. These victims need to be treated fairly and receive adequate care. We also owe it to the other people who worked with uranium to continue studying the effects of their contribution on their health. That's why this bill expands coverage to other uranium victims and establishes grant programs for education and the prevention and early detection of radiogenic diseases. 
   I ask my colleagues to join us today in making good on our promise to these people who so dutifully served their nation.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the 31 Tribal Colleges and Universities that provide hope to America's Native communities. The Tribal College movement began some 30 years ago and has a proven track record of success as an integral, viable part of Native American communities. 
   I believe the Tribal Colleges are the nation's best kept secrets in higher education, and it saddens me to report that the Tribal Colleges are the nation's most underfunded institutions in higher education 
   In comparison to the mainstream community colleges and universities system, the Tribal College movement is still in its infancy. Over a 30 year period, Tribal Colleges have managed to change the social landscape of Indian country, operating on a shoe-string budget while maintaining full national collegiate accreditation standards. 
   Tribal Colleges currently operate on a budget of forty percent less than what mainstream community colleges receive from government sources. This is a remarkable feat. Tribal Colleges continue to survive despite these and other difficulties such as problems in the recruitment and retention of faculty due to remote locations and inability to offer competitive salaries. 
   Unlike other schools, Tribal Colleges do not receive automatic state funding for non-Indian students since they are located on Indian trust lands even though they provide GED, remedial and adult literacy programs for all students, and also doubling as community, cultural and child centers. 
   Enrollment numbers exceed approximately 26,000 students being served, with growth rate averages of approximately eight percent per year. With this growth rate, these institutions must have adequate funding to meet the growing demands being placed on these tribal educational hubs. 
   Tribal Colleges are experiencing an enrollment boom and with steady level-funding, will actually see the quality of services deteriorate. I am supportive of efforts to find and provide additional funds for Tribal Colleges as are many of my colleagues. 
   Studies have shown that Tribal Colleges significantly decrease employment rates, substance abuse and teen pregnancy in some of the nation's poorest communities. More than forty percent of students who attend Tribal Colleges transfer to four-year institutions, and a majority of them return to assist their reservations after receiving their degrees. 
   I would like to cite two examples of many success stories of the positive impact of the Tribal Colleges: 
   Justin Finkbonner of the Lummi Nation graduated from Northwest Indian College in Bellingham, Washington with an Associate Arts Degree. Justin continued his education by transferring to complete a four-year Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Policy from the Huxley College of Environmental Studies at Western Washington University. Currently, he is serving as Morris K. Udall Foundation Native American Congressional Fellow this summer on Capitol Hill experiencing the legislative process with the intention to return to the Lummi Nation, help his people and one day achieve his goal of becoming a tribal leader. 
   In his own words,  
   The Northwest Indian College offered an academic setting and curriculum that no other mainstream institution could offer. For example, one would not receive Lummi tribal history and Lummi language classes at their college, plus the individual attention from faculty and staff to ensure my success. These key differences from mainstream colleges and universities still influence me to this day to aspire to achieve my goals. I had never had that much encouragement and support from this many people to show me that they car about me and my future. I owe a great deal to the Tribal Colleges.  
   Another success story: Julie Jefferson of the Nooksack tribe, forty-five years old, a wife, a mother of three, a grandmother of five--she has worked at the Northwest Indian College for twelve years as an Administrative Assistant for Instructional Services. She is currently a full-time college employee working her way through her academic pursuits. While working in full capacity, she has managed to complete a two year Associate Arts Degree and still currently working while pursuing a four-year Bachelor's Degree in Human Services at the Woodring College of Education at Western Washington University in Washington State. Ms. Jefferson expects to graduate in the Spring of 2000 with goals to continue her education pursuing a Master's Degree. She is a classic example of the tribal student profile of being a non-traditional female student with dependents from a nearby surrounding community. 
   Of the 31 Tribal Colleges, two offer Master's Degree programs, four offer Bachelor Degree Programs and many are in the process of developing four-year degree programs cooperatively with nearby mainstream institutions. Tribal Colleges are awarding more than 1,000 Associate Degrees each year, and these Degrees represent nineteen percent of all Associate Degrees awarded to American Indians. This is an impressive figure considering the Tribal Colleges enroll only about seven percent of all American Indian students. 
   In Academic Year 1996-1997 the Tribal Colleges awarded: 1,016 Associate Degrees, 88 Bachelor Degrees and 7 Masters Degrees. In Academic Year 1995-1996: 1,024 Associate Degrees, 57 Bachelor Degrees and 7 Masters Degrees were awarded. Obviously, these statistics from the National Center for Education solidifies the success of the Tribal College movement by producing graduates--future, productive members of their communities and of society. 
   Mr. President, I would like to conclude my statement with a quote from one of two special reports produced by The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching titled, ``Tribal Colleges: Shaping the Future of Native America''. I, again want to reinforce my support of this nation's 31 Tribal Colleges and to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to offer their support along with me:  
   Tribal Colleges offer hope. They can, with adequate support, continue to open doors of opportunity to the coming generations and help Native American communities bring together a cohesive society, one that draws inspiration from the past in order to shape a creative, inspired vision of the future.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I urge my colleagues to support passage of the pending legislation, H.R. 1175, a bill to help locate and secure the return of Zachary Baumel, a citizen of the United States, and two other Israeli soldiers who have been missing in action for more than sixteen years. I introduced the Senate version of this legislation, S. 676, which has gathered the support of 34 Senate cosponsors, and in June, the House passed H.R. 1175 by a recorded vote of 415-5. 
   Although information concerning the whereabouts of Sgt. Baumel and his comrades has been reported since their disappearance after a battle in Northern Lebanon in 1982, Palestinian cooperation on this situation has come to a halt as no new information has been forthcoming. This legislation requires the State Department to raise this issue with the Palestinian Authority and the Syrian government and requires cooperation on this issue to be considered in future aid to the Palestinian Authority. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senator HELMS, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for his leadership in moving this legislation to the full Senate. The passage of this legislation is a critical step in helping the families of these soldiers who have been forced to live with the pain and uncertainty of this loss for more than 16 years. Resolving the issue of these Israeli MIAs can only strengthen American efforts to make Middle East peace into a reality. 
   I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today the Senate is taking another important step toward enacting sweepstakes reform legislation. 
   Today we continue the good fight that was launched nearly fourteen months ago when the Senate first began consideration of sweepstakes reform legislation. I was pleased to lead the fight for sweepstakes reform on June 5th, 1998, in the 105th Congress, when I introduced S. 2414, the Honesty  in Sweepstakes Act of 1998. This was the first legislation of its kind. 
   A few months later, on September 1st, 1998, a high-impact Senate hearing focusing on the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1998 attracted national attention and widespread public support. That hearing, followed by a series of hearings chaired by Senator COLLINS this year, was the turning point in the battle for sweepstakes reform and helped generate the powerful momentum that has carried sweepstakes reform forward. 
   I was prompted to fight for Honesty in Sweepstakes when I heard far too many horrible stories about how consumers, especially our seniors, were being taken advantage of, and all too often seriously financially harmed by sweepstakes promotions that prey upon people's hopes and dreams by making convincing yet false promises of riches. They use massive mailing lists to deliberately target our most vulnerable consumers with false promises of riches and then bombard them again and again. 
   Since I first introduced the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act I have been contacted by many people from Colorado and all over the country with stories of their unfortunate experiences with sweepstakes promotions. They told stories of how their loved ones, often their elderly parents, had squandered many thousands of dollars after having been lured in by cleverly presented promotions promising instant riches. Many people from all over the country have also sent me large envelopes stuffed full of examples of the misleading sweepstakes promotions they and their loved ones have received. 
   I am pleased to be an early cosponsor of the bill we consider today, S. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, which was introduced by my colleague Senator COLLINS. This bill includes a number of provisions similar to those I included in the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act. There are two additional provisions included in S. 335 that I believe will be especially beneficial in the fight against misleading sweepstakes. The first calls for establishing centralized and easy to access toll free phone numbers where consumers' questions can be answered. The second provision makes it much easier for people to have their names removed from mailing lists. 
   Our nation's seniors and other vulnerable consumers are clearly being taken advantage of, and in some cases seriously financially harmed, by intentionally misleading sweepstakes promotions. Something needs to be done. I support passage of this legislation to bring this harmful practice to a halt.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. Today I express my support for S. 1429, The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. This is a sound bill based on real need and I believe the American taxpayers deserve and want this legislation. 
   The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 goes a long way to relieve taxpayers of an unfair tax burden. This bill provides: broad-based tax relief; family tax relief by addressing the Marriage Penalty Tax; retirement savings and education incentives; health care tax reductions; small business tax relief; international tax reform, and death and gift tax relief, among other provisions. 
   I am particularly interested in the estate tax relief because earlier this year I introduced the Estate and Gift Tax Rate Reduction Act of 1999, (S. 38). Estate and gift taxes remain a burden on American families, particularly those who pursue the American dream  of owning their own business. This is because family-owned businesses and farms are hit with the highest tax rate when they are handed down to descendants--often immediately following the death of a loved one. These taxes, and the financial burdens and difficulties they create come at the worst possible time. Making a terrible situation worse is the fact that the rate of this estate tax is crushing, reaching as high as 55 percent for the highest bracket. That's higher than even the highest income tax rate bracket of 39 percent. 
   Furthermore, the tax is due as soon as the business is turned over to the heir, allowing no time for financial planning or the setting aside of money to pay the tax bills. Estate and gift taxes right now are one of the leading reasons why the number of family-owned farms and businesses are declining; the burden of this tax is just too much. 
   This tax sends the troubling message that families should either sell the business while they are still alive, in order to spare their descendants this huge tax after their passing, or run-down the value of the business, so that it won't make it into their higher tax brackets. Whichever the case may be, it hardly seems to encourage private investment and initiative, which have always been such a strong part of our American heritage. 
   I am pleased that the bill before us takes the important step to address this unfair burden. I will continue to work with my colleagues for the complete elimination of the death tax. 
   I have heard the argument that this tax cut will threaten Social Security, but that's just not true. In fact, this bill saves every penny of the money set aside for Social Security. Social Security is safe and secure with this bill. This bill also leaves $277 billion to finance Medicare, emergencies or other priorities, so this bill does not threaten Medicare or Medicare beneficiaries. In contrast, the administration's budget would increase spending by $1 trillion and increase taxes by $100 billion over the next 10 years according to the Congressional Budget Office. How can this administration believe that they can increase spending and taxes even though they already admitted raising taxes too much? I think since we now have a balanced budget, then the American people deserve this tax cut. The American people have earned this tax cut, this is their money and I think we should give it back to them. 
   I know that $792 billion is a lot of money, but we have a $3 trillion surplus and one reason we have a $3 trillion surplus is the taxpayers got their taxes raised too much. I realize that we could just go ahead and spend that extra money like the administration wants to do, but I think that would be irresponsible. I think if the American people overpaid, then the American people should get their money back--that's just fair. 
   The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 is the largest middle-class tax relief since the Reagan administration and I think it's high time the hard-working taxpayer get this refund.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity today in my capacity as Co-Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, known as the Helsinki Commission, to draw the attention of my Senate colleagues to the growing problem of official and unofficial corruption abroad and the direct impact on U.S. business. 
   Last week I chaired a Commission hearing that focused on the issues of bribery and corruption in the OSCE region, an area stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. The Commission heard that, in economic terms, rampant corruption and organized crime in this vast region has cost U.S. businesses billions of dollars in lost contracts with direct implications for our economy here at home. 
   Ironically, Mr. President, in some of the biggest recipients of U.S. foreign assistance--countries like Russia and Ukraine--the climate is either not conducive or outright hostile to American business. This week a delegation of Russian officials led by Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin are meeting with the Vice President and other administration officials to seek support of the transfer of billions of dollars in loans and other assistance, money which ultimately comes from the pockets of U.S. taxpayers. 
   I recently returned from the annual session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in St. Petersburg, Russia, where I had an opportunity to sit down with U.S. business representatives to learn from their first-hand experiences and gain a deeper insight into the obstacles they face. During the 105th Congress, I introduced legislation--the International Anti-Corruption Act--to link U.S. foreign aid to how conducive recipient countries are to business investment. I intend to reintroduce that legislation shortly, taking into account testimony presented during last week's Commission hearing. 
   The time has come to stop doing business as usual with the Russians and others who gladly line up to receive our assistance then turn around and fleece U.S. businesses seeking to assist with the establishment of legitimate operations in these countries. An article in the Washington Post this week illustrates the type of rampant and blatant corruption faced by many in the U.S. business community, including companies based in my home state of Colorado.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the National Law Enforcement Museum Act of 1999. This legislation would authorize the construction of a National Law Enforcement Museum to be built here in our Nation's Capital. 
   Just over one year ago, this institution, along with millions of other Americans, were reminded about the risks that our officers must face on a daily basis. On July 24, 1998, U.S. Capitol Police Officer Jacob J. Chestnut  and Detective John Gibson were killed by a deranged man. This legislation I introduce today will ensure that their story of heroism and sacrifice is never forgotten, just as we must never forget the thousands of other officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to secure the safety and well-being of our communities. 
   As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks peace officers face in enforcing our laws. Throughout our nation's history, nearly 15,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement officers have lost their lives in the line of duty. Based on FBI statistics, nearly 63,000 officers are assaulted each year in this country, resulting in more than 21,000 injuries. On average, one police officer is killed somewhere in America every 54 hours. 
   Approximately 740,000 law enforcement professionals are continuing to put their lives on the line for the safety and protection of others. 
   We owe all of those officers a huge debt of gratitude, and it is only fitting that we properly commemorate this outstanding record of service and sacrifice. 
   My legislation seeks to achieve this important goal by authorizing the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization, to establish a comprehensive law enforcement museum and research repository on federal land in the District of Columbia. The Fund is the same group that so ably carried out the congressional mandate of 1984 to establish the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, which was dedicated in 1991 just a few blocks from the Capitol. Clearly, their record of significant achievement speaks volumes about their ability to meet this important challenge. 
   Since 1993, the Fund has efficiently operated a small-scale version of the National Law Enforcement Museum at a site located about two blocks from the Memorial. The time has come to broaden the scope of this museum and move it in closer proximity to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. 
   This museum would serve as a repository of information for researchers, practitioners, and the general public. The museum will become the premiere source of information on issues related to law enforcement history and safety, and obviously a popular tourist attraction in Washington, DC, as well. 
   The ideal location for this museum is directly across from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on a parcel of federal-owned property that now functions as a parking lot. The building, as planned, will have underground parking for the judicial officers who currently use this lot. 
   Under my legislation, no federal dollars are being proposed to establish this museum. Rather, the Fund would raise all of the money necessary to construct the museum through private donations. Recognizing the national importance of this museum, however, the legislation states that upon completion of the museum facility the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the General Services Administration will be responsible for the maintenance of the exterior grounds and interior space, respectively. The legislation places the responsibility of operating the museum in the hands of the Fund. 
   Finally, let me add that this legislation is supported by 15 national law enforcement organizations: the Concerns of Police Survivors; the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association; the Fraternal Order of Police; the Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary; the International Association of Chiefs of Police; the International Brotherhood of Police Officers; the International Union of Police Associations/AFL-CIO; the National Association of Police Organizations; the National Black Police Association; the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; the National Sheriffs Association; the National Troopers Coalition; the Police Executive Research Forum; the Police Foundation; the United Federation of Police; and the National Law Enforcement Council. Together, these organizations represent virtually every law enforcement officer, family member and police survivor in the United States. 
   Mr. President, as we remember the sacrifices made by Officer Chestnut, Detective Gibson and so many other brave officers, I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in support of this important legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to provide a report to my colleagues on the successful congressional delegate trip last week to St. Petersburg, Russia, to participate in the Eighth Annual Parliamentary Assembly Session of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, known as the OSCE PA. As Co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I headed the Senate delegation in coordination with the Commission Chairman, Congressman CHRIS SMITH.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. In the last Congress, I introduced the International Anti-Corruption Act of 1997 (S. 1200) which would tie U.S. foreign aid to how conducive foreign countries are to American businesses and investment. As I prepare to reintroduce this bill in the 106th Congress and to work on combating crime and corruption within the OSCE framework, I participated in a meeting of U.S. business representatives on Friday, July 9, convened by the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, headquartered in Denver. We were joined by my colleagues, Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, Senator GEORGE VOINOVICH and my fellow Coloradan, Congressman TOM TANCREDO. 
   We heard first-hand about the challenges of doing business in Russia from representatives of U.S. companies, including Lockheed Martin Astronautics, PepsiCo, the Gillette Company, Coudert Brothers, and Colliers HIB St. Petersburg. Some issues, such as export licensing, counterfeiting and corruption are being addressed in the Senate. But, many issues these companies face are integral to the Russian business culture, such as taxation, the devaluation of the rouble, and lack of infrastructure. My colleagues and I will be following up on ways to assist U.S. businesses and investment abroad. 
   In addition, on Wednesday, July 7, I participated in a meeting at the St. Petersburg Investment Center. The main focus of the meeting was the presentation of a replica of Fort Ross in California, the first Russian outpost in the United States, to the Acting U.S. Consul General on behalf of the Governor of California. We heard from Anatoly Razdoglin and Valentin Makarov of the St. Petersburg Administration; Slava Bychkov, American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, St. Petersburg Chapter; Valentin Mishanov, Russian State Marine Archive; and Vitaly Dozenko, Marine Academy. The discussion ranged from U.S. investment in St. Petersburg and the many redevelopment projects which are planned or underway in the city.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution in honor of the Women's World Cup Soccer Champions, the U.S. Women's Soccer Team. 
   From the first game of the Women's World Cup in New Jersey, which was played before a sold-out crowd, to the final game at the Rose Bowl filled with 90,185 screaming fans, setting the women's sports record for attendance, this U.S. Women's Soccer Team has inspired us all. The U.S. Women's Soccer Team had an outstanding run during the 1999 Women's World Cup which culminated in an amazing victory against the Chinese in the final game. 
   After 120 minutes of exciting soccer, the game came down to a shoot-out where the U.S. Women's Team prevailed 5 to 4 to become the champions. From Briana Scurry's game winning save to the nail-biting seconds before Brandi Chastain made the winning goal, they had us all sitting on the edge of our chairs. 
   As a former Olympic athlete, I know the dedication and determination that these women must have in order to achieve this tremendous accomplishment. I want to point out that every member of this team either has a college degree or is pursuing one. I can't think of better role models for today's youth than this World Cup Team.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I take this opportunity to comment on the pending bill. 
   In my view, what we are discussing today is the most costly big-government health care plan since the Clinton health care reform plan was debated earlier this decade. We all know the fate of that attempt, and it is my hope we might now allow common sense to play a part in creating a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The demands on our health care system have changed dramatically in the past decade. So has our health care system. But, those changes have not affected all people evenly, and it's clear many people have had unfortunate experiences. 
   Going from the traditional doctor-patient relationship into a system where all aspects of care are subject to approval and authorization is understandably difficult. But, as the cost of quality care became an obstacle to access, the concept of managing care has evolved as the predominate method of insured medical service. 
   While health care in America, and our advances in medical technology remain the envy of the world, it would be a serious mistake to pretend that all are well-served by our present health care system. 
   The Federal Government, in an effort to give all Americans access to affordable care, has, in fact, encouraged participation in managed care plans. All federally-sponsored health care, which includes Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employees Health Benefit program and military health care, has experienced the emergence of managed care. Now we must deal with the issue of ensuring health care quality as a first priority. And we must do it in a way that will not raise costs of care or cause employers to stop offering health insurance. 
   While managed care has become the dominant delivery method of cost-effective healthcare in our nation, what is missing are standards that will ensure fairness to both patients and providers, and clarify what are often confusing medical and legal terms and hidden rules for both parties. The question before us now is how best to protect these patients while giving the health care industry incentives for finding efficient methods of delivering care. 
   All of us expect the highest quality health care for the citizens of this country, but, that care must be affordable. Anyone that believes having Congress dictate a costly, one-size-fits-all mandate will make health care more affordable or more available is, I believe, severely out of touch with reality. 
   That is why I am concerned about the pending legislation. This bill mandates new regulations which would increase premiums by 6.1 percent, not including inflation. It could raise the cost of a typical family's health insurance policy by more than $300 per year. That is not logical, responsible or acceptable. We have been down this road before with the ``catastrophic health'' bill of 10 years ago. The Senate passed it because people were told premium increases would be minimal. Then people got their bill. This pending bill will drive up the number of uninsured Americans. In my State of Colorado, it is estimated that this legislation would add more than 32,000 persons to the rolls of the uninsured. Our biggest health care problem already is that there are currently 43.5 million uninsured Americans. Who pays for their inevitable medical care? You, I, and every other taxpayer. It is clear that increased mandates increase costs, and that those increased costs reduce coverage. 
   It is no secret that higher health insurance premiums will force employers to drop optional medical coverage they offer employees. That should not be the intention of this legislation, but it is the reality. Every time a mandate raises the cost of insurance by one percent, more than 200,000 Americans lose their coverage. 
   Small businesses would drop coverage if exposed to the pending bill's liability provisions. Canceling coverage leaves patients exposed to expensive medical bills. That's not patient protection. We cannot pass legislation that forces employers to provide health care. They will close shop, because they can't afford it. The pending bill will lead to government-run health care. The bill's mandates could cost the private sector more than $56 billion, greatly exceeding the annual threshold established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, which most Members of this body voted for. 
   Many States are currently developing patient-protection legislation through their State legislatures and assemblies. My State of Colorado has already established mandates concerning an independent external review process for denied claims, a ban on gag clauses, and direct access to OB-GYN services. 
   Despite that fact, the pending bill, in an attempt to tighten federal control over the entire U.S. health system, applies federal mandates to all health insurance products. 
   Mr. President, I believe it is time to put the brakes on the runaway one-size-fits-all mandates which are inflicting hardship on our most vulnerable citizens and legitimate health care providers. The time to protect patients and providers is before costly mandates are enacted into law. 
   Let us think ahead. We have already seen through our experience with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, that well-intentioned solutions enacted by Congress can turn into unworkable, burdensome regulations when imposed on the entire health care system. We are discussing sweeping legislation which, if passed and enacted, will have significant consequences for all Americans and their health care. I believe we can best protect these Americans by making reasonable changes which give them more choices. Let's provide access to affordable, quality care without inventing unnecessary new federal mandates for an already top-heavy health care structure. 
   I believe the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus will do just that. It will improve quality of care and expand consumer choice as well as protect patients' rights. 
   It will hold HMOs accountable for providing the care they promised. It places treatment decisions in the hands of doctors, not lawyers. And, patients have the right to coverage for emergency care that a prudent lay-person would consider medically necessary. 
   The purpose of our bill is to solve problems when care is needed, not later after harm has occurred. Common sense demands we act reasonably. More importantly, the future health care of hundreds of millions of Americans demands we act with their interests in mind. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, while we are waiting for Senators to come to the floor with amendments, I would like to speak to two sections of the Treasury and general government appropriations bill that are, I believe, of great importance. 
   The first is called the GREAT Program--the Gang Resistance Education and Training, or GREAT Program. This is a program that is administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, in partnership with State and local law enforcement. 
   Unfortunately, gang activity has increased in our country in recent years, as the Chair well knows. 
   ATF has developed a program to give our children the tools they need to be able to resist the temptation to belong to a gang. 
   The GREAT program is only seven years old, but has already grown from a pilot program in Arizona to classrooms all over the United States--and in Puerto Rico, Canada, and overseas military bases. ATF estimates that about 1.7 million students have received GREAT training. 
   GREAT was designed to provide gang prevention and anti-violence instruction to children in a classroom setting. ATF trains local law enforcement officers to teach these classes, and provides grants to their offices to help pay for their time. 
   Needless to say, working policemen in classrooms do a lot to dispel the sometimes erroneous myths that children have about working policemen. 
   This program is having a positive effect on student activities and behaviors, and is deterring them from involvement in gangs. A side benefit is that the graduates seem to be doing a better job of communicating with their parents and teachers, and getting better grades. 
   Last year the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government held a hearing on the GREAT Program. The highlight of the morning was listening to the students from Colorado, Wisconsin, Arizona and a number of other States as they told about what they learned when they took the classes. It was very encouraging to hear how some of these kids actually turned their lives around because of this training. 
   For the second year in a row, the administration is requesting only $10 million for grants for the GREAT program. Last year, Congress felt that wasn't enough to fund the many requests for help from State and local law enforcement and provided $13 million for GREAT grants. $10 million still isn't enough. 
   We are asking again in this bill to provide $13 million. I urge my colleagues to support the effort of the committee to again provide $13 million for grants to State and local law enforcement for this worthwhile and effective program. 
   The other section of the bill I would like to mention for the knowledge of my colleagues is what is called the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   This center was created in 1984, and is dedicated to finding every missing child and helping to prevent the abduction and sexual exploitation of all children. 
   Sadly, we are not 100 percent successful. Every year thousands of children are put at risk. In fact, every day in the United States 2,300 children are reported missing to different law enforcement agencies. 
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children works closely with three entities under the jurisdiction of this bill--the Customs Service, the Postal Inspection Service, and the Secret Service. I think it is important for my colleagues to be aware of the contributions of these different agencies. 
   In 1987, the Customs Service was the first Federal law enforcement agency to agree to be the contact point for tips and leads from the toll-free Child Pornography Tipline. Under direction provided by the committee, support for the Tipline will continue in the fiscal year 2000. This funding will be used for promotional brochures, public service announcements, and a campaign to educate teenage girls about the risks they may encounter and the ways to stay safer from crime. 
   In March of last year, the Customs Service and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children launched the new CyberTipline to allow parents to report incidents of suspicious or illegal internet activity. For the benefit of my computer literate friends, that internet address is ``www.missingkids.com/cybertip.''

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona for bringing this to the attention of the Senate. I certainly understand and sympathize with him. My State borders his, and I spend a good deal of time in Arizona. I am fully aware of the problem we have with our borders. They are like a sieve, very frankly. 
   I wish we could have found the additional $50 million he asked for, but, as he has already mentioned, we did have some budget constraints. We simply could not find it. 
   Let me tell my colleagues from where the Senator from Arizona would take the money to offset the $50 million additional money he would like to  put in this account. He would take $1,675,000 from the Federal Election Commission. He would take $1,095,000 from the Federal Labor Relations Authority. He would take $34,786,000 from the GSA. These are repairs and alterations that are badly needed for Federal buildings across the country. He would take $10,854,000 from the GSA policy and operations account, and $1,617,000 from the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
   I will talk for a few minutes about what we have done. First of all, in this bill the committee has provided $1.67 billion in funding for fiscal year 2000 for the Customs Service. This level is $263 million more than was requested by the administration and provides for maintaining current levels of funding and other related costs as well as nonrelated labor issues associated with the increase of inflation, with the exception of the fiscal year 1999 pay raise component. 
   The committee has provided new funding for the Customs integrity awareness effort, totaling $4.3 million. In addition, the committee provided an additional $2.5 million for the establishment of an assistant commissioner for training, which will provide in-service training and professional development of Customs personnel. There have been news reports about the breaches of integrity within the Customs Service. These programs are in response to those issues. This funding will assist the Customs Service in improving their hiring methodologies, ensuring that applicants are of the highest quality. In addition, the funding will improve the recruitment and redesign of the hiring process as well as support existing personnel. 
   The committee has continued level funding for the Customs Service child pornography efforts. The committee has been very pleased by the Customs Service's efforts, given the limited resources dedicated to that program. The committee has also provided $19 million in funding for items associated with technology and staffing along the Southwest border, to which the Senator alluded. 
   Last year, as part of the fiscal year 1999 emergency drug supplemental funding, this committee provided an additional $80 million for nonintrusive inspection equipment on top of the $40.6 million for a variety of technologies for the Southwest border. This funding provided for the purchase of a mobile truck X-ray system, railcar inspection systems, gamma ray inspection systems, and higher energy, heavy pallet X-ray systems. Of the $276 million of funds provided in that emergency supplemental, the Customs Service has not yet obligated all those funds. In fact, as of today, there is $143 million that has not been spent in the account. 
   In addition, there is sufficient funding to cover the costs of the annualization of Operation Hardline and GATEWAY, as well 
   as equipment annualization for fiscal year 1999. This will allow Treasury to annualize the cost of these border-related positions. 
   In addition, there is $1.29 million included to cover the cost for the mandatory workload increases during peak processing hours for the new crossings, including staffing and the dedicated commuter lane in El Paso, TX. 
   The committee has also included new funding for the Customs Integrity Awareness Program at $4.3 million, so the total cost of the effort is now $18 million. That is $6 million in the base and $4.3 million for this year for polygraphs and $8 million for agent inspector relocations. 
   I wish we could have done more. Very simply, as everybody in this body knows, we were up against budget constraints. We simply did not have the money to fund all the things that we would like to. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Senator REID addressed the Chair.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I have to tell you, I have no quarrel with my colleagues from Texas and Arizona in my efforts and interests in reducing the use of drugs in America, since I helped write this bill and I have been on the forefront of trying to reduce drugs and putting money where it is most needed. But I remind my friend from Texas that, in fact, in this bill we put in $263 million over the administration's request. In addition, as I have already said, of the $276 million of funds provided in the emergency supplement, which was signed into law on May 31 of this year, Customs has still not spent $143 million of that money. I know some of it is for equipment, but certainly some of that could be transferred within the Department to areas that need it. We have done the best we can.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend from New Jersey. I came from an alcoholic family. Believe me, I know firsthand the devastating effects of what it does in a family. I have had over a dozen relatives, uncles, cousins and so on, including a sister, who have died from some form of alcohol-related abuse. I know the devastating effects on a whole community; on society as a whole. I know the cost and I do not think anybody detests it more than I do. 
   As my colleague, Senator DORGAN, knows, coming from a State in which there are many Indian reservations, fetal alcohol syndrome, which is an effect on children from mothers drinking too much, is literally hundreds of times worse on those reservations. On one reservation in America, 1 out of 4 children is born with some degree of fetal alcohol syndrome as opposed to the national average of 1 out of 500. 
   I am concerned, but the question for this body is not whether we want to reduce the use of alcohol by youngsters. Of course all of us want to do that. The question here is whether the ONDCP is the right vehicle or not. My view is it is the wrong vehicle. 
   I have been the chairman of this committee since the inception of this media campaign, when Senator KOHL was the ranking minority, and this project is something the committee originally had a great deal of difficulty in doing, because we wanted to make sure we got the best use of taxpayers' money when we set this up. I believe this amendment would simply dilute that mission. The committee did 
   not provide as much as we would want this year. In fact, we are putting in $50 million less this year than we did for the ONDCP last year. I believe the inclusion of an anti-alcohol campaign would simply decrease the funds available for the antidrug campaign more than we want to. The House, in my opinion, made a mistake when they pursued this action. 
   I also tell you we are, in my view, increasing the jurisdiction of the Office of National Drug Control Policy without legislative authority to do so. This is the wrong vehicle, as I mentioned, and I am seriously concerned that the precedent it would set would cause us a great deal of controversy, maybe open a Pandora's box of other amendments to broaden the ONDCP into areas it should not be. 
   This amendment expands ONDCP's jurisdiction into alcohol prevention. As I mentioned, they do not have a statutory mandate to do that. There are other agencies, such as the Center of Substance Abuse Prevention, that are better equipped to handle this kind of campaign. When we originally put the money into this campaign a few years ago, we wanted to make sure we could measure the effects. So there was a GAO study authorized, a 5-year study to review the media campaign and give the results to our committee about the ongoing effects, to see if we, in fact, were reducing the use of alcohol consumption by youngsters as a result of the campaign. 
   That study is only halfway through. It still has several years to go. I think if we dilute this message, if we start expanding the role, we are simply going to completely throw out the validity of that study the GAO is doing. 
   So, although I do appreciate the efforts of the Senator from New Jersey, and I look forward to working with him on other ways we can reduce alcohol use by youngsters, I, at this time, oppose the amendment. I will move to table after my colleague speaks. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Senator DORGAN and I find ourselves in a strange debate indeed, because I think we as much as anyone in this body want to reduce teenage drinking. All of us have had personal tragedies in our families. As I say, as a former deputy sheriff and as a volunteer prison counselor, I know all the horror stories. We know a lot of them today. I don't deny any of them. I am sure they have created terrible problems in families and in society, too. But I think we are missing the point I tried to make a while ago. It is not whether we want to reduce teenage drinking. We all do. It is whether this is the right vehicle; and it is not. 
   I mentioned a while ago that ONDCP does not have statutory authority. If we are going to add statutory authority and just bypass the legislative part of this body, why don't we do away with the legislative part of this body and just do all legislation in appropriations bills? 
   I would join my friend from New Jersey if he wanted to introduce a bill to add alcohol to the ONDCP's agenda. That would be fine with me, to add more money to it, too. I would be a cosponsor. I will be more than willing to fight the battle with him to make sure we reduce teenage drinking in any kind of ad campaign that would be effective. I hope we will do that, too. But I believe this is the wrong vehicle for it. We ought to do it through the authorizing committees.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I intend to support the Manager's amendments package to the Fiscal Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000, which includes a modified version of a bill I introduced on June 10th, S.1212, the Kosovo Reconstruction Investment Act of 1999. I am pleased to have Senators RICK SANTORUM and ROBERT BYRD join me as original cosponsors of this amendment. 
   I also want to thank the Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator MCCONNELL, and the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Senator LEAHY, for their assistance and support of this amendment. 
   While this amendment's language is a compromise, and is not as strong as S. 1212 which I introduced earlier this month, it is an important first step in the right direction. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the coming months to help promote American taxpayers, workers and key industries as the U.S. begins to spend billions of dollars to rebuild Kosovo and, as expected in the future, the rest of Yugoslavia. 
   This amendment will help American workers and companies get the first best shot at those Kosovo reconstruction opportunities that are being paid for with U.S. foreign aid funds. As a result, a large portion of the American taxpayer's dollars destined for the Kosovo reconstruction effort will be invested in the purchase of American made goods and services whenever possible. 
   This legislation will benefit both the people of Kosovo and American workers. The people of Kosovo will have reconstructed homes, hospitals, factories, bridges, powerplants and telecommunication systems. The American people will benefit as a significant portion of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars come back to the U.S. in the form  of new orders for American made goods and services. New jobs will be created. With this legislation we can make the best out of a looming, costly, and long term burden on our nation's budget. 
   This will be especially important for some of our key industries, such as agriculture and steel, that are facing hard times here at home. Other hard working Americans from industries like manufacturing, engineering, construction, high tech and telecommunications will also enjoy new opportunities to produce goods and services destined for export overseas. 
   For example, our ranchers and farmers, many of whom are being severely harmed by a combination of tough competition at home, cheap imports and closed markets overseas will benefit. This bill will help provide them with the opportunity to strengthen their share in Europe's Southeastern markets. 
   Our steel workers, many of whom are also in a tough situation, will benefit as U.S. made steel is used to reconstruct, homes, hospitals, factories, bridges and other necessary infrastructure. American steel would also be used as American made construction equipment and tractors are delivered to the Balkans. American engineers, contractors and other service providers will play a key role in rebuilding telecommunications and other necessary infrastructure projects. 
   The American taxpayers have already borne the lion's share of waging the war in Kosovo. Our pilots flew the vast majority of the combat sorties. In addition, the Foreign Operations Supplemental Appropriations bill that passed last month provided $819 million 
   for humanitarian and refugee aid for Kosovo and surrounding countries. It has been estimated that peace keeping operations will cost an additional $3 billion in the first year alone. This is just the beginning. In the future, American taxpayers will be spending tens of billions of dollars more as we participate in what apparently is an open-ended peacekeeping effort. 
   Without this legislation those countries who largely sat on the sidelines while we fought will be allowed to sweep in and clean up. The American taxpayers' dollars should not be used to profit Western European conglomerates. The American people deserve better. This Kosovo Reconstruction Investment Amendment will help remedy this situation. 
   Yet another problem this bill would help alleviate is our exploding trade deficit which is on track to an all time high of approximately $250 billion by the end of this year. In March of this year alone, the U.S. posted a record one month trade deficit of $19.7 billion. 
   Furthermore, many of the other industrialized countries that regularly distribute foreign aid do not do so with no strings attached. For many years now, countries like Japan have also required that the foreign aid funds they distribute be used to buy products produced by their domestic companies. 
   The degree to which the Japanese government uses ``tied aid'' to the benefit of Japanese companies and boost their exports was underscored by a recent quote that can be found in the June, 1999, issue of the ``Look Japan'' magazine. When referring to Japanese efforts to help neighbor countries recover from the Asian economic crisis, Oshima Kenzo, the Director of the Economic Cooperation Bureau at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated:  
   This enormous machine of Japanese aid has barely begun to move. Aid to Asian countries in crisis is something that must be done on an ``all-Japan'' basis.......The purpose of aid to Asia is primarily to provide relief to Asian countries, but it has a secondary aspect of reenergizing the Japanese economy too, so there are many domestic hopes riding on this as well.  
   While my original Kosovo reconstruction language in S. 1212 included tougher ``Buy America'' provisions, this amendment's compromise language will allow U.S. foreign aid funds to be used to purchase goods and services produced in ``least-developed countries.'' This is something we can do while still serving the purpose of this amendment. For example, U.S. steel workers will still have the first shot at producing steel for the Kosovo reconstruction effort since countries such as Japan, South Korea and Brazil, all of whom have been taking a heavy toll on the U.S. steel industry here at home, most definitely are not ``least developed countries.'' American telecommunications, heavy equipment manufacturers and a wide variety of other U.S. industries will also benefit. 
   If America's Airmen, Sailors, Marines and Soldiers are good enough to wage a war, then America's hard working taxpayers, including steel and manufacturing workers, engineers and contractors are good enough to help rebuild shattered countries. If we are called on to put the Balkans back together, we should do it with a fair share of goods and services made in America. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this amendment.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am now pleased to lay before the Senate the committee recommendation for the Treasury Department, the Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and various independent agencies. The bill was crafted by the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government and contains a total of $27,737,971,000 in new budget authority. Of that, $14,533,811,000 is for mandatory accounts. 
   The committee recommendation is within the 302(b) allocations and strikes a delicate balance between congressional priorities, administration initiatives, and agency requirements. This would not have been possible without the hard work and cooperation of the new ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator DORGAN, and his staff. 
   This bill consists of mostly salaries and expenses accounts and the majority of the increases for agencies is to simply allow them to maintain current levels. There are very few new initiatives in this bill. 
   Title I provides a total of $12,213,529,000 for the Department of the Treasury. This is $162,601,000 less than the administration request. The committee has again placed a priority on Treasury's law enforcement needs as well as support for efforts by State and local law enforcement. 
   Here are a few highlights from Title I: 
   $312,400,000 to the Customs Service to retain 5,000 current Customs employees since the user fee proposed by the administration has not been enacted. 
   Emphasis on the need for the Gang Resistance Education and Training program--called GREAT--by including $3 million more than the administration request for grants to State and local law enforcement. 
   Expansion of the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative into 10 additional cities, bringing the total to 37 cities. This will allow ATF to track and prosecute those who supply guns to our youth. 
   Funding for the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy to allow AFT to more comprehensively investigate NICS denials in order to make sure that felons do not possess guns. 
   Full funding to the IRS for customer service training and to implement the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. 
   Title II provides $93,436,000 for the United States Postal Service, and continues to require free mailing for overseas voters and the blind as well as six-day delivery, and prohibit the closing or consolidation of small and rural post offices. 
   Title III recommends a total of $553,128,000 for the Executive Office of the President, $86,370,000 less than the administration request. This includes the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Federal drug control programs, and funding for the national anti-drug media campaign. 
   Of special note, the committee: 
   Recommends establishing a separate account for 
   the Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center, and has provided $31,100,000 for that program to transfer much needed technology to State and local law enforcement. 
   Provides $188,277,000 for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program which will allow continuation of existing HIDTA programs at their current levels. These programs highly acclaimed by local law enforcement. 
   Recommends a total of $145,500,000 for the national anti-drug media campaign. 
   Title IV is independent agencies such as the Federal Election Commission, the General Services Administration, and the National Archives, as well as agencies involved in Federal employment such as the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Office of Government Ethics, the Office of Special Counsel, and the Office of Personnel Management. Also included in this title are mandatory accounts to provide for Federal retirees, health benefits, and life insurance. The committee recommends a total of $14,877,878,000 for this title. 
   For the third year in a row, the administration has not requested funding for courthouse construction. Unfortunately, due to the very limited funding available to the committee, we have not included any new courthouse construction projects in this bill. 
   In order to stay within our 302(b) allocations, the subcommittee was forced  to make very difficult decisions, as were all Appropriations subcommittees. As a result, this bill is very tightly crafted to allow the agencies to continue their vital work. Very few new initiatives were recommended and we were not able to accommodate all of our colleagues' requests due to funding constraints. I remind my colleagues that any funding amendments must be offset and, frankly, there is very little fat in this bill. If amendments are offered, we would ask the sponsor to identify the accounts we should be reducing to accomplish their goal. 
   Finally, I would like to again thank the ranking member, Senator DORGAN, for his hard work and support. This bill would not have been possible without his assistance, and that of his staff Barbara Retzlaff and Elizabeth Blevins. I also thank my staff: Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin and Lula Edwards for their tireless and invaluable work on this bill. This bill has been a collaborative effort and it deserves the support of the Senate. 
   I yield the floor to Senator DORGAN.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to urge my colleagues to support passage of S. 322, the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Recognition Act of 1999. It is a fitting and appropriate tribute to have this legislation honoring Dr. King pass the full Senate on Flag Day which is being commemorated today. 
   This legislation will amend the Flag Code to add the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday to the list of days on which the American flag should be displayed nationwide. 
   It is a testament to the greatness of Martin Luther King, Jr., that nearly every major city in the U.S. has a street or school named after him. Dr. King, a minister, prolific writer and Nobel Prize winner originated the nonviolence strategy within the activist civil rights movement. He was one of the most important black leaders of his era and in American history. 
   When Dr. King was tragically assassinated on April 4, 1968, he had already transformed himself as a national hero and a pioneer in trying to unite a divided nation. He strove to build communities of hope and opportunity for all and recognized that all Americans must be free to truly have a great country. 
   Dr. King was a person who wanted all people to get along regardless of their race, color or creed. His holiday came about due to the work of many determined people who wanted all of us to  pause to remember his legacy. Senate passage of S. 322 will further recognize his legacy. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Private Property Protection Act of 1999. 
   This bill would require that Interior Department personnel obtain either the property owner's permission or a properly attained and legal search warrant before they enter someone's private property. 
   America's law abiding private property owners, especially our ranchers and farmers, should not be subject to unwarranted trespassing and egregious random searches by federal bureaucrats. They deserve to be treated fairly and according to the law, just like other Americans. They deserve the same private property rights that other Americans enjoy. 
   Under our legal system, if appropriate sworn law enforcement officers can demonstrate to a judge that there is probable cause to believe that a person has broken the law, and that there is a justified need to enter a property, then those law enforcement officials can obtain a search warrant to enter and search a private property. This is reasonable, just and how it should be. I have a firsthand understanding of this from the time I served as a Deputy Sheriff. 
   However, all too often our ranchers, farmers and other private property owners are being denied these same basic legal property rights when it comes to federal employees operating under endangered species laws. Interior Department employees are trespassing on private property without the owner's permission or a search warrant. Many of these Interior Department employees who are trespassing have no sworn legal authority whatsoever. 
   Disturbing incidents of federal agency personnel operating outside of the law, and willfully trespassing on private property without any legal just  cause, threatens to erode our fundamental property rights. One particular case that occurred in El Paso County, in my home state of Colorado, stands as a prime example.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Kosovo Reconstruction Investment Act of 1999. 
   This legislation would require that the United States foreign aid funds committed to the reconstruction of Kosovo and other parts of the Balkans in the wake of the Kosovo conflict will be used to purchase American-made goods and services whenever possible. 
   This legislation provides a win-win approach to reconstruction by helping the people of Kosovo and others who live in the Balkans who have suffered as a result of the Kosovo conflict while also looking out for American workers. 
   The people of Kosovo and the Balkans will win by having new homes, hospitals, factories, bridges, and much more rebuilt. They will have roofs over their heads, places to go for health care and to work, and the roads and bridges needed to get there. 
   The American people will win as a sizable portion of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars will come back to the United States in the form of new orders for American-made goods and services. New jobs will be created. With this legislation we can make the best out of a looming, costly, and long-term burden on our Nation's budget. 
   This will be especially important for some of our key industries, such as agriculture and steel, that are facing hard times here at home. Other hard-working Americans from industries like manufacturing, engineering, construction, and telecommunications will also enjoy new opportunities to produce goods and services for the people of Southeastern Europe. 
   For example, our ranchers and farmers, many of whom are being severely harmed by a combination of tough  competition at home, cheap imports and closed markets overseas will benefit. This bill will help provide them with the opportunity to strengthen their share in Europe's Southeastern markets. 
   Our steel workers, many of whom are also in a tough situation, will benefit as U.S. made steel is used to reconstruct homes, hospitals, factories, and bridges. American engineers, contractors, and other service providers will play a key role in rebuilding telecommunications and other necessary infrastructure projects. 
   To ensure that the Kosovo Reconstruction Investment Act does not unduly hinder the reconstruction effort, it allows for American foreign aid funds to be used to buy goods and services produced by other parties in cases where U.S. made goods and services are deemed to be ``prohibitively expensive.'' 
   The American taxpayers are already bearing the lion's share of waging the war in Kosovo. To date, our nation's military has spent about $3 billion Kosovo war effort. Our pilots flew the vast majority of the combat sorties. In addition, the Foreign Operations supplemental appropriations bill that passed last month provided $819 million for humanitarian and refugee aid for Kosovo and surrounding countries. It has been estimated that peace keeping operations will cost an additional $3 billion in the first year alone. This is just the beginning. In the future, American taxpayers will be spending many tens of billions of dollars more as we participate in the apparently open-ended peacekeeping effort. 
   Without this legislation, those countries who largely sat on the sidelines while we fought will be allowed to sweep in and clean up. The American taxpayers' dollars should not be used as a windfall profits program to boost Western European conglomerates. The American people deserve better. The Kosovo Reconstruction Investment Act of 1999 would remedy this situation. 
   Yet another problem this bill would help alleviate is our exploding trade deficit which is on track to an all time high of approximately $250 billion by the end of this year. In March of this year alone, the United States posted a record 1 month trade deficit of $19.7 billion. 
   Furthermore, many of the other industrialized countries that regularly distribute foreign aid do not distribute it with no strings attached. For many years now, countries like Japan have also required that the foreign aid funds they distribute be used to buy products produced by their domestic companies. 
   We also must face the reality that there is much more to rebuilding this region than money can buy. The various ethnic groups residing throughout the Balkans must realize that they have to change their hearts and ways if there is to be any lasting peace and prosperity. We cannot do this for them. They have to do it for themselves, as communities, families, and individuals. 
   If they commit themselves to rule of law, freedom of speech, free and open markets, the primacy of the ballot box over bullets and a live and let live tolerance of others, they will be well on their way as they head into the new millennium. 
   Once again, here we are reconstructing a part of Europe. Once again, we did not start the war, but we had to finish it and then were called on to come in, pick up the pieces, and put them back together again. 
   If America's airmen, sailors, marines, and soldiers are good enough to win a war, then America's hard-working taxpayers, including farmers, steel workers, and engineers are good enough to help rebuild shattered countries. If we are called on to put the Balkans back together, we should do it with a fair share of goods and services made in America. 
   The Kosovo Reconstruction Investment Act will help make sure that both the victims of the Kosovo conflict and the American people win. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit the Kosovo Reconstruction Fair Share Resolution of 1999. 
   This resolution's goal is to express the sense of the Senate that the United States should not end up paying more than its fair share of the Kosovo reconstruction effort. 
   Specifically, the Kosovo Reconstruction Fair Share Resolution states that the United States' share of the costs of reconstructing Kosovo and the surrounding region following the conflict in the Balkans should not exceed the United States' portion of NATO's three ``Common Funds Burdensharing'' budgets. 
   Our contributions to NATO come in two basic forms. The first and most significant portion by far comprises our direct deployment of troops and equipment. Over the years America has contributed the lion's share of the troops and equipment. 
   America's disproportionally heavy burden has continued into the late 1990s as the War in Kosovo clearly demonstrated. The vast majority of the fighting needed to wage the war in Kosovo was done in large part by American air power. We should not have to also carry the burden in the Kosovo reconstruction effort. 
   That's why the Kosovo Reconstruction Fair Share Resolution states that America's portion of the reconstruction costs should not exceed the portion we contribute to NATO's three Common Fund Accounts, which is smaller than our contributions of troops and equipment. 
   Factors considered when determining each country's portion includes its respective Gross Domestic Product and other considerations. Over the past three decades the U.S. portion has declined, as it should. 
   For the years 1996 through 1998, America's contribution to these three NATO common funds averaged around 23 percent according to the Congressional Research Service. Accordingly, this resolution calls for capping our portion of the reconstruction costs at the same level of 23 percent. 
   In light of the fact that we carried the vast majority of the burden in ending the fighting I think that this is still too much. Perhaps 10 percent is a fairer share. It is time for our European allies to do their fair share. 
   Following World War Two, a war that would not have been won without America, the American people invested in the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan was vital in the effort to rebuild Europe from the ashes of WWII. Fifty years later we won the Cold War. Now, just yesterday, we put an end to the fighting in Kosovo. It is time for our NATO European allies to shoulder the financial burden to rebuild a region of their own continent that has been ravaged by war. 
   The Kosovo Reconstruction Fair Share Resolution indicates that America will not pay more than our fair share. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity today to call my colleagues' attention to the importance of women's health care issues. I came to know the importance of women's health early in life. Some of you may know that my mother suffered from tuberculosis. Back in those days, patients with TB had to be isolated, so my mother was living in a sanatorium. I could not see her in person, only through the windows. 
   In the past, women's health did not receive the attention it deserves. I believe it is time to change that. If we are to eliminate the diseases that especially afflict women today, we will need real dedication to the task of developing new treatments and prevention techniques. 
   And because women make many of the health care decisions for families, their decisions touch the health of many people--children, spouses, elderly parents and relatives. In this great country of ours, where we emphasize personal responsibility, good health care decisions are fundamental to quality health. 
   As medical science advances into new territory, expanded choices will give women unprecedented opportunities to live better and longer lives, and to affect the quality of health care in our country. Women will be called upon to take charge of their own health as well  as to demand medical excellence for their families. Only with the help of such informed decision makers will we be able to develop policies which assure all Americans access to affordable, quality health care. 
   In an effort to highlight women's health care and to make women aware of the health care choices that are available to them, I recently co-hosted a forum, Health Care: What Every Woman Should Know, with our former colleague in the Senate, Hank Brown, now President of the University of Northern Colorado. The conference featured a number of panelists who discussed the latest research and treatment of various kinds of cancer as well as depression and eating disorders. Legislative initiatives and solutions were also part of the forum agenda. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the forum agenda and an article from the Greeley Tribune newspaper highlighting remarks of the keynote speaker Assistant Surgeon General Susan Blumenthal be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, June 6, 1999, was the 55th Anniversary of the historic Allied invasion of Europe on the beaches of Normandy, France, that spelled the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany. 
   In America today, with unprecedented prosperity and material comfort, it is hard to appreciate the American experience leading up to World War II and the war itself. 
   When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States was not only caught off guard, we were also caught unprepared for the war that loomed in Europe and in the Pacific that would involve the United States for 5 long years. 
   Still plagued by the Great Depression, unemployment sky high and poverty all around, Americans accepted the challenge and responded like no people ever had. 
   With scrap metal drives, rubber drives, gasoline and food rationing, and other efforts American men and women pulled together and contributed to the massive war effort. 
   Americans of all races, creeds, colors, and backgrounds joined the military, worked in industrial plants, and assisted in too many ways to mention as  the nation joined together to battle tyranny and oppression. 
   America's economic and military might was called on to produce hundreds of thousands of planes, tanks, trucks, ships, boats, and weapons. We not only produced the materials for our own efforts but kept our Allies supplied with civilian and military goods to ensure an Allied victory. 
   The ``Arsenal of Democracy'' was running at high gear from 1941 on, and all of these efforts came to a head in June, 1944. 
   Even after the successful Africa campaign showed that the German war machine was not invincible, America and her Allies looked for a ``second front'' to draw Nazi Germany's attention and resources into other battles. 
   Under the leadership of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allies began planning for just such a front with an amphibious invasion in Europe and America's fighting forces made the necessary preparations. 
   Millions of men, and millions of tons of equipment, supplies, vehicles and weapons were delivered from the United States to England in preparation for the assault. 
   Postponed several times because of poor weather in the English Channel, on June 5, 1944, General Eisenhower gave the final order that would unleash the historic battle. 
   In the morning hours of June 6th, over 175,000 men from the streets of Philadelphia to Indian reservations of Arizona, from Alaska to Florida, landed on the beaches of Normandy, France. 
   In the years since that day, we have seen movies about this, the most ambitious amphibious invasion ever attempted in history. Just last year we saw it vividly replayed with the movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' in what the soldiers themselves said was an accurate portrayal what occurred so many years ago. 
   As a veteran, and having read many eyewitness accounts of that day, I think that the real horrors of that day, and especially the first minutes of that historic landing, are simply unimaginable to us. 
   Though the Allies enjoyed complete air superiority in the Normandy area, clouds shrouded the beaches diminishing the effect of Allied air power. 
   At the landing beach that quickly became known as ``Bloody Omaha'', the Americans took the brunt of the German defenses. 
   Entire companies of men were chopped down seconds after the doors dropped on the landing craft. The Germans poured fire down on the Americans, but they kept coming ashore wave after wave. 
   Only alter an exhaustive day of fighting and dying, was the beachhead established. 
   In 1999, it is easy to think of the D-Day invasion and of the Allied success in World War II as pre-determined. In 1944, it just was not so and Eisenhower and the Allied leaders knew that at that point victory was not assured and that the war could still be lost. 
   It is humbling to read the never-delivered address General Eisenhower penned in case the Allies were driven back into the sea. 
   In it, Eisenhower assumed all fault for a failed invasion attempt. Thankfully, he never had to deliver that address. 
   From the beaches at Normandy, the Allies broke out, fought through the hedgerows, and went on to liberate Paris in July, 1944. 
   From Paris to the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes, through the low countries and ultimately sweeping on to Berlin the Allies--with the Americans taking the lead--secured victory over Nazi Germany in April, 1945. 
   It took four more months of island-to-island combat to defeat the Japanese Empire in August, 1945, and to achieve complete and total victory in World War II. 
   This nation owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women who made Normandy and the entire war effort the success it was. 
   With each day, scores of D-Day veterans, many in their late 70's and 80's, pass away. As a generation, this group was unique in living and making real their unspoken code: faithfulness and duty to God, family, and country. 
   The brave men of Normandy--both the survivors and those buried in the American Cemetery just up the hill from the landing beaches--from both humble and privileged beginnings, deserve to be honored by the Senate and the nation as whole. 
   In this spirit I urge my colleagues to support me in honoring the veterans of D-Day and all veterans who have sacrificed for this great nation.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as I did around this time last year, I want to recognize National Drug Court Week which is taking place next week. Since the Senate will be in recess at that time, I take this opportunity today to applaud our nation's drug courts and the people who have made them the successes they are today. 
   Next week, the National Association of Drug Court Professionals will sponsor a training conference, suitably titled ``Celebrating Ten Years of Drug Courts: Honoring the Past, Looking to the Future,'' which will be held in Miami Beach, Florida. This year approximately 3,000 professionals from across the country, including judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement officers, corrections personnel, rehabilitation and treatment providers, educators, researchers and community leaders will be attending the conference. These Drug Court professionals' dedication has had a significant positive impact on the communities they serve. 
   The two and a half day conference will coincide with National Drug Court Week, June 1st though 7th, 1999. All across America, state and local governments have been recognizing drug courts and their dedicated professionals with resolutions, ceremonies and celebrations. 
   The Drug Court growth rate has been accelerating over the past several years. While the first Drug Court was established in 1989, there are currently over 600 Drug Courts that are either operating or being established. This surge in growth is a product of success. 
   Drug Courts are revolutionizing the criminal justice system. The strategy behind Drug Courts departs from traditional criminal justice practice by placing non-violent drug abusing offenders into intensive court supervised drug treatment programs instead of prison. Some Drug Courts target first time offenders, while others concentrate on habitual offenders. They all aim to reduce drug abuse and crime by employing a number of tools including comprehensive judicial monitoring, drug testing and supervision, treatment and rehabilitative services, and sanctions and incentives for drug offenders. 
   Statistics show us that Drug Courts work. It has been well documented that both drug use and associated criminal behavior are substantially reduced among those offenders participating in the Drug Courts. More than 70 percent of drug court clients have successfully completed the program or remain as active participants. 
   Drug Courts are also clearly cost-effective and help convert many drug-using offenders into productive members of society. Traditional incarceration has yielded few gains for our drug offenders. The costs are too high and the rehabilitation rate is minimal. Our Drug Courts are proving to be an effective alternative to traditional rehabilitation methods and are make strides forward in our fight against both drugs and crime. 
   In 1997, General McCaffrey and I had the opportunity to visit the Denver Drug Court. Through this experience I was able to meet with Denver's Drug Court professionals and observe their judicial procedures and other program activities first hand. I was impressed with the Denver Drug Court professionals and procedures, and believe they will yield many successes. 
   Today, as the chairman of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Office of National Drug Control Policy, I feel it is fitting to recognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate the important contributions our nation's Drug Court professionals are making toward reducing drug use and crime in our communities in time for National Drug Court Week. 
   Thank you Mr. President.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of the pending amendment offered by my colleague, Senator ASHCROFT, to enhance school safety. This bill is based in large part on the work of the Republican Juvenile Crime Task Force, on which I served. I am pleased to see that the amendment includes three provisions I proposed to the Task Force to help make our children's schools safer. 
   The first provision authorizes the use of funds to train school personnel, including custodians and bus drivers. These key people on and near school grounds can be helpful in finding suspicious objects, pipe bombs, or other means of harm if they had the proper training. These personnel can be utilized for identifying potential threats, crisis preparedness, and emergency response. I intend to build on this work in the FY 2000 Treasury appropriations bill by supporting the role of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in training school personnel in the detection of weapons and explosives. 
   The second provision authorizes the use of funds for the purchase of school security equipment and technologies, such as metal detectors, electronic locks, and surveillance equipment. This provision is based on S. 996, the ``Students Learning in Safe Schools Act of 1999'' which I introduced on May 11, 1999. 
   The third provision would invest more resources in School Resource Officers, including community policing officers. This important initiative expands the Cops in Schools program which I was pleased to author as S. 2235 in the 105th Congress. This bill was enacted into law in 1998 and this Spring the Justice Department is making $60 million available for this program in this year alone. School Resource Officers would work in cooperation with children, parents, teachers and principals to identify dangers and potentially dangerous kids before violence erupts and innocent children get hurt. 
   The Ashcroft Amendment includes many other important provisions to enhance school safety. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this amendment. 
   I thank the chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that an important provision that is based on a bill I introduced earlier this year has been included in the pending legislation. 
   This provision would provide Federal matching grants to help our state and local law enforcement officers acquire life saving bullet resistant equipment. This provision is based on S. 726, the Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1999. S. 726 is named in memory of Dale Claxton, a Cortez, Colorado, police officer who was fatally shot through the windshield of his patrol car last year. A bullet resistant windshield could have saved his life. 
   Unfortunately, incidents like this are far from isolated. All across our nation law enforcement officers, whether in hot pursuit, driving through dangerous neighborhoods, or pulled over on the side of the road behind an automobile, are at risk of being shot through their windshields. We must do what we can to prevent these kinds of tragedies as better, lighter and more affordable types of bullet resistant glass and other equipment become available. 
   While I served as a deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, California, I became personally aware of the inherent dangers law enforcement officers encounter each day on the front lines. Now that I serve as a U.S. Senator here in Washington, DC, I believe we should do what we can to help our law enforcement officers protect themselves as they risk their lives while protecting the American people from violent criminals. 
   One important way we can do this is to help them acquire bullet resistant glass and armored panels for patrol cars, hand held bullet resistant shields and other life saving bullet resistant equipment. This assistance is especially crucial for small local jurisdictions that often lack the funds needed to provide their officers with the life saving bullet resistant equipment they need. 
   This Claxton bullet resistant equipment provision builds upon the successes of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, S. 1605, which I introduced in the 105th Congress and the president signed into law last June. This program provides matching grants to state and local law enforcement agencies to help them purchase body armor for their officers. This provision builds upon this worthy program by expanding it to help them acquire additional types of bullet resistant equipment. 
   The central part of the Claxton provision authorizes a new $40 million matching grant program to help state, local, tribal and other small law enforcement agencies acquire bullet resistant equipment such as bullet resistant glass and armored panels for patrol cars, hand held bullet resistant shields and other life saving equipment.  
   This matching grant program is authorized for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 and would be administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance according to a formula that ensures fair distribution for all states, local communities, tribes and U.S. territories. To help ensure that these matching grants get to the jurisdictions that need them the most the bureau is directed to make at least half of the funds available to those smaller jurisdictions whose budgets are the most financially constrained. 
   Another key part of the Claxton provision allocates $3 million over 3 years to the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to conduct an expedited research and development program to speed up the deployment of new bullet resistant technologies and equipment. The development of new bullet resistant materials in the next few years could be as revolutionary in the next few years as Kevlar was for body armor in the 1970s. Exciting new technologies such as bonded acrylic, polymers, polycarbons, aluminized material and transparent ceramics promise to provide for lighter, more versatile and hopefully less expensive bullet resistant equipment. 
   The Officer Dale Claxton provision also directs the NIJ to inventory existing technologies in the private sector, in surplus military property, and in use by other countries and to evaluate, develop standards, establish testing guidelines, and promote technology transfer. 
   Our nation's state, local and tribal law enforcement officers regularly put their lives in harm's way and deserve to have access to the bullet resistant equipment they need. The Officer Dale Claxton bill will both get life saving bullet resistant equipment deployed into the field where it is are needed and accelerate the development of new lifesaving bullet resistant technologies. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this provision.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, each year half a million guns are stolen and thousands of violent crimes are committed with stolen guns. Furthermore, approximately half of the juvenile gun related crimes in this country involve stolen guns. 
   To address this problem, I am pleased the amendment pending before the Senate to S. 254, includes provisions to increase the maximum prison sentence for existing stolen gun laws. This provision is based on S. 728, the Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1999, which I introduced on March 25, 1999. 
   The extent of this problem was recently underscored by several news reports and studies. Reports indicate that almost half a million guns are stolen each year. Each year, the Federal Bureau of Investigations alone receives an average of over 274,000 official reports of stolen guns. A large number of stolen guns also go unreported. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms studies note that convicted felons often choose to steal firearms as a way to avoid mandatory background checks. 
   In my home State of Colorado, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation receives over 500 reports of stolen guns each month. As of this March, the Bureau had a total of 36,000 guns on its unrecovered stolen firearms list, with about one-third of them being handguns. 
   As I mentioned earlier, the stolen gun problem is especially widespread and alarming among young people. A Justice Department study of juvenile inmates shows that over 50 percent of them had stolen a gun. 
   Clearly, with half a million guns being stolen each year, those criminals and juveniles stealing guns must not be very deterred by the current penalties. A provision within the bill before us today would address this problem by increasing prison sentences for violating current stolen firearms law provisions from a maximum of 10 years to a maximum of 15 years imprisonment. 
   Specifically, under current federal law, it is illegal to steal a firearm from any person including licensed firearm collectors, dealers, importers, and manufacturers. It is also illegal to knowingly transport, ship, receive, possess, conceal, store, sell, or otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. Current sentencing guidelines cap the penalty for violating these stolen gun laws at a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. My provision calls for increasing the maximum prison sentence from 10 years to 15 years, and directs the United States Sentencing Commission to revise the Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to these firearms offenses. 
   While I am a strong supporter of the rights of law abiding gun owners, I also firmly believe we need tougher penalties for criminals who steal guns or use stolen guns to commit crimes. This stolen gun penalty enhancement provision will send a clear signal to criminals that stealing or using stolen guns is something we take very seriously. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this provision. 
   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Students Learning in Safe Schools Act of 1999. 
   This legislation would build on the successes of two bills I sponsored in the 105th Congress and that were signed into law, S. 2235, which established the Cops in Schools program and S. 1605, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. 
   Juvenile crime prevention, of course, is on all of our minds, particularly since the recent tragedy in Littleton. I think all of us know that violence has  gone up among youngsters and it threatens a safe learning environment for our students at school. As a former teacher, a deputy sheriff, and parent, I developed a special sensitivity long before I came to the Senate. 
   On April 20, in my home State, 13 innocent victims, 12 students and 1 very heroic teacher, were murdered at Columbine High School. This town is a very nice town. Littleton is a wonderful community. The school of Columbine is a nice school with few problems. I guess people are prone to say if it could happen there, it certainly could happen anywhere. 
   Clearly, no student should have to go to school where they fear for their lives. Statistics on violence in schools are startling. In fact, recent reports indicated there were 173 violent deaths in U.S. schools between 1994 and 1998 and that 31% of children know someone their age who carries a gun. The National Education Association estimated that 100,000 youngsters carry guns to school and 160,000 children miss class every day because they fear physical harm. 
   We know that government cannot fix it all. We are being leaned on, of course, to pass more and more laws to correct all these problems, but most of us know there has to be teamwork involving students and parents and families and communities and religious leaders and school administrators. 
   This teamwork should also include law enforcement officers working closely with schools. Teachers and principals simply do not have the training or equipment or resources to deal with the problem. And they shouldn't have to, they should be focusing on teaching our kids. 
   That's why I introduced S..2235 last year, the School Resource Officers Partnership Grant Act of 1998, to help stop school violence. S..2235, which was signed into law last October, will create thousands of vital partnerships between state and local law enforcement agencies, and the schools, parents and children they serve and protect. Schools that establish these partnerships would be eligible to receive federal funding through the Justice Department to hire School Resource Officers, also known as SROs. SROs are career law enforcement officers, with sworn authority, within the Community Policing program, and will work in and around our schools. 
   Working in cooperation with youngsters, parents, teachers and principals, these SROs would be able to keep track of potentially dangerous kids and effectively deal with them before things escalate, violence errupts, and youngsters get hurt. These SROs would work in our schools, not as armed guards, but primarially as people who would help resolve conflicts. 
   There is $60 million in Cops in School grants which will be distributed this year alone. In fact, the Justice Department has just announced the first round of grants with hundreds of schools in 42 states benefiting. 
   The bill I am introducing today, the Students Learning in Safe Schools Act of 1999, would build on the Cops in Schools program to help improve school safety. The Students Learning in Safe Schools Act would provide federal matching grants to help schools buy metal detectors, metal detecting wands, video cameras, and other equipment needed to help make our schools safer. This bill calls for a matching grant of $40 million for each of the 3 fiscal years from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2002. The grants would be easily accessible to States, local governments, and school districts with a minimum of redtape. This is not a mandate, however. It is an opportunity for school districts to get some additional resources. 
   This legislation calls for posting this new school safety equipment grant program on the Internet right next to the Cops in Schools program which can now be found on the Justice Department's web sight. This would help provide one stop shopping where people can go for help in getting both the safety personnel and safety equipment they need to help make their schools safer. 
   I do not expect this legislation, of course, to solve all our problems but certainly it is another tool I hope will go a long way in reducing juvenile violence in schools. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce amendments to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (``ISDEA'') to provide for greater tribal self-governance for the programs and services of the Department of Health and Human Services (``HHS''). 
   Over the years the poor circumstances and conditions of Native Americans have been compounded by vacillating federal policies and federal domination of matters affecting Indian people. 
   This situation began to change in 1970, when President Nixon delivered his now-famous ``Message to Congress on Indian Affairs'', which laid the foundation for a more enlightened federal Indian policy. This new policy allowed tribes to forge their own destiny and challenged the federal government to find new, innovative ways to administer Indian programs. 
   Because of the tangible benefits it has brought, this shift away from federal domination and toward Indian self-determination has been supported by every Administration since 1970. 
   Indian self-determination fosters strong tribal governments and reservation economies. This policy has encouraged tribes to assume more responsibility for their own affairs, caused a reduction in the federal bureaucracy and, most importantly, improved the quality of services to tribal members. 
   The most definitive expression of the policy change brought about by President Nixon was the ISDEA which authorized tribes to negotiate and enter into agreements with the U.S. to assume control over and operate federal programs which had been previously administered by federal employees. 
   In the years after enactment of the ISDEA, Congress expanded on the framework by enacting tribal ``self-governance'' laws which created a demonstration project that authorized tribes to enter into ``compacts'' with the U.S., so that they may administer an array of services. 
   The principles of the ISDEA are similar to those of block granting to the states. Instead of the federal government micro-managing Indian tribes, the federal government is contracting with tribes to perform those functions. Like states, tribes know best which governmental programs best serve their communities and how programs should be delivered. In short, the concept of local administration of federal dollars works. 
   By continuing to build tribal capacity and expertise in the administration of programs and services previously administered by employees of the Department of the Interior and the HHS, the Act has forged stronger tribal governments and economies and led to a smaller federal presence in Indian affairs. 
   The current self governance ``demonstration project'' in health care involves approximately 50 tribes. The legislation I introduce today builds on these successes, makes the self governance program permanent and expands an array of eligible functions available for tribal self governance to include the many programs, services and activities of the HHS, such as clinical services, public health nursing, mental health, substance abuse, community health representatives, and dental health. 
   The bill ensures continued participation by the tribes now participating in the self governance project, and provides for participation by an additional 50 tribes or tribal organizations annually. 
   This is far from a ``no-strings attached'' approach to federal programs. To participate, tribes must successfully complete legal and accounting requirements, as well as demonstrate financial stability and financial management capability. 
   This legislation also addresses the issue of which functions may be performed by tribes and which may not. This bill differentiates between those services and activities that are federal, and therefore ineligible for tribal performance through a self-governance compact, and those that are not inherently federal, and therefore eligible for tribal performance through a self-governance compact. 
   To track the progress made in raising the health status of Indians, the bill requires participating tribes to report health-related data to the Secretary so that an accurate picture of Indian health can be drawn.  
   I am mindful that there are issues we need to explore further, such as contract support cost funding, and I fully anticipate that interested parties will have full and fair opportunity to raise their concerns during the legislative process. 
   I am hopeful that after working with the tribes, the Administration and other interested parties, and after careful consideration by the Committee on Indian Affairs, we will be able to enact this important legislation to raise the health status of Native Americans and continue the unparalleled success of the Indian self-determination policies.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce The Intergovernmental Gaming Agreement Act of 1999 to address an area of contention between tribes and states that centers on the ability of tribes to operate gaming activities on their lands. 
   In 1988, virtually no one contemplated that Indian gaming would become the billion dollar industry that exists today, providing some tribes with much needed capital for development and employment opportunities where none previously existed. 
   Because of gaming, some tribes have been very successful, fortunate mostly because of their geographical location. These tribes employ thousands of people, both Indian and non-Indian, and have greatly reduced the welfare rolls in their local area. 
   It is extremely important for us to keep these facts, and the goals of the gaming statute in mind and to remember that where gaming exists, it provides a great opportunity for tribes to develop other business and development projects. However, it must also be recognized that not all tribes will find the keys to a brighter economic future in gaming. 
   In the 1987 Cabazon case, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that tribes could operate casino style gaming without the consent or regulation of the state, in cases where the state otherwise allowed such gambling. 
   In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, otherwise known as ``IGRA'', as a compromise between states and tribes. IGRA was an attempt to allow tribes to continue to develop the gaming operations allowed under federal case law, but gave states for the first time the right to have some say in how those operations would be regulated. 
   It was not Congress' intention in enacting IGRA to provide States with veto authority over a tribe's plans to develop gaming operations. 
   Unfortunately, a few States have attempted to do just this, and at least two states have effectively prevented tribes from opening gaming operations by simply refusing to negotiate with them. 
   A group of tribes and states has been attempting to negotiate their differences and have been doing so for some 18 months, to no avail. As the Committee on Indian Affairs knows well after numerous hearings, each side has presented demands in such a way that the other is simply unwilling to consider. 
   I firmly believe The Intergovernmental Gaming Agreement Act of 1999 will go a long way in solving this problem by encouraging full and fair negotiations and by allowing each side recourse to federal court at the critical stage in the mediation stage of the proposed process. 
   The Intergovernmental Gaming Agreement Act of 1999 requires tribes to negotiate with states for purposes of concluding a class III gaming agreement. Only when states refuse to negotiate outright or reach an impasse during negotiations by failing to come to agreement within six months of the tribe's request for negotiation, can a tribe access the alternative procedures outlined in this bill.  
   Once the tribe applies for procedures with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary first must attempt to reconcile state-tribal differences by referring the parties to mediation. Even when a tribe has applied to begin the procedure for developing a class III compact, the state has full and unfettered access to the procedure at every stage. 
   This legislation allows the state to intervene in the process at the point of their choosing and, when all is said and done, the states have the right to challenge the outcome in federal district court.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, on Sunday, May 2nd, John Elway, who for 16 seasons has been the uncontested leader of the Denver Broncos and a valuable civic leader and mentor for young Americans, officially announced his retirement from the NFL. He will be sorely missed. From extraordinary moments like ``The Drive'' in the 1986 AFC Championship Game to countless other picturesque instances, all we have are the many memories now. How do you replace a legend? You can't. 
   Exactly 16 years from the date of his announcement--May 2, 1983--the Denver Broncos acquired John Elway from, the then Baltimore Colts in return for offensive lineman Chris Hinton, quarterback Mark Herrman, and the Broncos' first round draft pick in the 1984 draft. That day will go down as arguably the best day in Broncos' history, and one of the best in football history. 
   I had the pleasure on January 27, 1998 of addressing my colleagues on the Senate floor regarding the accomplishments of one of the best quarterbacks in the history of the NFL, John Elway, with Senate Resolution 167. On February 3, 1999, I again had the honor of calling to my colleagues' attention the outstanding accomplishments of the Denver Broncos and John Elway for capturing another Super Bowl victory. Today I have the distinct honor of congratulating John Elway for a remarkable career and would like to thank him for all he contributed to Colorado and to our nation. 
   Mr. President, John Elway's career has been packed with astonishing statistics; 148 victories, the NFL record for a quarterback; nine Pro Bowl selections; 5 Super Bowl starts, another NFL record; two Super bowl Championships; 300 career touchdown passes; over 50,000 passing yards; Super Bowl XXXIII's Most Valuable Player; the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 1987; the American Football Conference's Most Valuable Player in 1993; and 47 fourth-quarter comebacks, to name just a few of the many highlights of a stellar career. 
   John Elway's leadership and dedication to excellence have benefitted the Broncos, the city of Denver, the state of Colorado, and America. John Elway, your place in Canton, Ohio in the Pro Football Hall of Fame awaits. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Bureaucracy Accountability Act of 1999. 
   This legislation is clearly needed because when federal bureaucracies are faced with a decision between enforcing their rules and regulations or complying with our nation's laws they all to often choose to ignore the law and follow their rules. These bureaucracies can get away with ignoring laws passed by Congress, signed into law and then interpreted by our federal courts because of a technical, legal loophole. Bureaucracies ought not ignore our laws and courts simply because they may find it easier and more convenient to stick with their familiar rules and regulations rather than changing their ways and complying with the law. And when these bureaucracies choose to ignore the law it is almost always average Americans who end up suffering. 
   There are thousands of stories of Americans who have been wrongfully denied their rightful benefits because some federal agency refuses to follow the legal decisions reached by our federal courts. In these situations ordinary American citizens must comply with the law, but federal agencies may simply choose to ignore that same law whenever they may so choose. This is not equal justice under the law. 
   Our Founding Fathers envisioned a justice system in which everyone is required to obey the laws as they are interpreted and enforced through our courts. When there are disagreements appeals can be made to higher courts. But otherwise, when the courts have spoken, we all must obey the law or face the consequences, as it was intended. 
   Currently, if a federal court in one jurisdiction rules against a federal 
   agency's rule, that same federal agency can continue to follow that same rule in other jurisdictions, even if it is to the detriment of the American citizens they are purportedly serving. This needlessly leads to years of costly legal wrangling while also compounding the pain and suffering American citizens endure as they try to secure the same services other Americans are already receiving in neighboring jurisdictions. 
   Some of the more egregious actions are seen in the Social Security Administration, the federal agencies running Medicare and Medicaid, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Internal Revenue Service. 
   In legal terms, this bill would prevent federal agencies from pursuing policies of unjustifiable nonacquiesence with, or the relitigation of, judicial precedents as established through the federal courts. 
   This legislation is a revised version of S. 1166, a bill I introduced in the 105th Congress. The bill I am introducing today contains perfecting language reflecting the valuable input I received during a June 15, 1998, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts hearing on S. 1166. 
   During that hearing, a fellow Coloradan, Lynn Conforti, testified about how her claims for disability benefits were repeatedly denied by the Social Security Administration, not on the basis of existing law, but on the basis of bureaucratic policies. Her testimony highlighted how her physical suffering was compounded by severe financial troubles and mental anguish as a result of her 32-month struggle with the Social Security Administration. This was her return for 27 years of contributing to Social Security. Ms. Conforti hopes to be able to return to work in the future, but she still requires access to the resources she needs to continue her rehabilitation efforts. Finally, Ms. Conforti was awarded her disability benefits by an Administrative Law Judge in an on the record determination. 
   Ms. Conforti's story is just one sad example of how agencies too often fail to help the very people whose need is real. Thousands of other Americans go through similar experiences each year. Something clearly must be done to ensure that federal agencies comply with federal law. 
   There are important organizations that also make it clear that something needs to be done. The Judicial Conference of the United States, chaired by Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, serves as the Federal Judiciary's governing body. The Judicial Conference has identified federal agency nonacquiesence as a policy that undermines legal certainty and the fair application of the law. The American Bar Association has also strongly recommended that Congress pass legislation to stop federal agencies from disregarding federal judicial decisions. In addition, organizations such as the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Diabetes Research Institute also came out in support of last year's bill, S. 1166. 
   It's time we made sure federal agencies comply with the law. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the 25th year anniversary of the Blue Knights International Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club. 
   The Blue Knights International Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club is a fraternal organization of law enforcement professionals and their families actively serving communities throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, France, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and Mexico. 
   This fraternal organization was established in Bangor, Maine, in 1974 and has grown to more than 10,000 members both male and female. They share a common bond of promoting motorcycling, which includes safety and awareness to the non-motorcycle riding public. 
   In addition, the Blue Knights also assists many organizations and communities with developing and implementing fund-raising programs such as the March of Dimes ``Bikers for Babies,'' the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the Breast Cancer Foundation's ``Race for the Cure'' and the Blue Knights ``Youth Identification Program.'' The combined efforts of the Blue Knights has made a positive contribution to society. 
   The Blue Knights began in April 1974 when Ed Gallant, a police officer with the Bangor Police Department, had an idea and several of his colleagues worked with him to see the idea become a reality. The idea was to form a motorcycle club for people in law enforcement. The news of the Blue Knights organization spread after an article in the Bangor Daily News was picked up by U.P.I. inquiries started pouring in and consequently chapters started to form worldwide. 
   As an honorary member of the Blue Knights, I have had the privilege of meeting numerous members from around the world and participate in many worthy causes. On this, their 25th anniversary, I applaud the efforts of the Blue Knights and look forward to learning of their future successes.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I, too, thank the leadership for affording the Senate an opportunity to express our profound sorrow and to offer condolences to the families and friends of the fallen people of Littleton, CO. 
   I understand that a resolution addressing this issue will arrive from the House of Representatives at about 4:30 today. I expect that many Members may want to make comments at that time. 
   The tragic truth is that the angels are now carrying the souls of 13 innocent people to the everlasting glory of heaven. A resolution alone would never express the degree of sorrow we feel. Certainly all of America has much to do to heal our Nation and to rid ourselves of hate and vengeance. 
   Until that resolution is pending, and in order to observe, acknowledge, and honor a moment of silence called for throughout the State of Colorado, I now ask that the Senate observe a moment of silent prayer for 2 minutes.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, many of my colleagues in the Senate will speak on this resolution today. I know that the families and, indeed, all of Colorado appreciate their deep and heartfelt sorrow. 
   On my father's side, as you know, Mr. President, I am Cheyenne, so I would like to begin speaking in the manner of his people. 
   This fan comes from the eagle. The old people call the eagle the keeper of the Earth, the one that watches over the domain of the Grandfather Spirit. 
   This pipe carries the smoke with the words and the thoughts from the people who use it to the Creator. 
   This flute is used to carry songs of love, forgiveness, and brotherhood. 
   So, Mr. President, I hope that the voices of all the council fires and pipes send our pleas as Senators as we ask for guidance as we try to rid ourselves of violence in this Nation. 
   I would like the great winged brother that he has chosen as our national symbol of freedom and justice to oversee all of his children. Further, I would like the winds to carry the sweetness and harmony and tolerance of the flute to the Grandfather Spirit. 
   Mr. President, traditional Indian people do not believe that death is finite. Indeed, they believe that mortal remains return to Mother Earth from  which they came, but the soul, which is the part of you that is timeless, goes on to the next world to be forever in the presence of the Great Spirit in a place that is absent of avarice and greed, devoid of hunger and sickness, barren of anger, jealousy, and hate. It is a place of goodness where springtime is forever. 
   That is the place where Indian people believe the innocent victims of Columbine High School have journeyed. Although their time on Earth was far too short, the elders remind us that the grace of the Creator made our lives so much better by allowing them to be with us for a time, however short. 
   Columbine High School will go on because our departed friends would have it so, but it will never forget. 
   I have heard the debate thus far on this terrible tragedy, and I have to ask: Are more laws the answer? I frankly do not know, Mr. President. Seventeen Federal laws and I think over 6 State laws were broken during that terrible tragedy. Would 1 more or 100 more have helped? I do not know. 
   I suppose there will be a rush to judgment. And I expect a torrent of proposed legislation, and perhaps some of it will help, perhaps not. But certainly I, as one Senator, will consider any proposal to make things better. 
   Mr. President, none of us have all the answers. But we know we cannot legislate tolerance. We cannot mandate that you love your neighbor. We can pass no law requiring Americans to respect each other. Those qualities are learned, as is hate and intolerance. 
   Government has its place, Mr. President, but so do churches, families, clubs, schools, teams, and indeed complete communities. I hope that we do not confuse who should do what. And let our actions reflect the Good Book at least as much as it does the law book. But above all, let us keep the memory of these innocent children and a heroic teacher alive as we strive for a solution. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my friends, the Senator from  Nevada, Mr. REID, and the Senator from California for the condolences and well wishes they have offered. 
   Yesterday, the parents in Jefferson County, CO, said goodbye to their children on their way to school as they have done on countless mornings, and as I have done, and as you have also done as a parent over the years. But for some, that goodbye must now be their final farewell. As a parent and grandparent and the husband of a person who taught school for over 10 years, I can't imagine the agony those families are feeling this morning. Today, my whole State is paralyzed with grief, as you might know. 
   Hundreds of families in Colorado endured a life-or-death lottery--knowing students at Columbine High School were dead, but not knowing if their youngsters were among those killed. It is tragic that on Earth Day the remains of those students will be returned to the Earth while their souls go to heaven. 
   The community of Littleton is a very nice town. I visit there often. Mr. President, Columbine High School is a fine school, with a fine staff, a good curriculum and nice youngsters. It has no history of racial violence or gang trouble or anything of that nature. It was not a school you would ever expect something like this to happen in. Certainly, there is a story in that and a tragedy. For those families, there will be no more hurried breakfasts, no more arguments over curfews when they send the youngsters to school, no more report cards, no more money for trips to the malls, and no more plans for after they leave high school. 
   What really frightens me is that, despite our best intentions to prevent this from happening, these horrors find a way to continue. In fact, Colorado has had a law on the books since 1994 that prevents any weapons from going into a public school. But they still do. With a gun, a bomb, a knife, a club, or whatever, young people are using violence as a way to resolve disagreements. 
   I don't know how we got there. Perhaps nobody does. I can remember the days when young people decided it was OK to have disagreements in the streets and they might have fist fights after school, or drag races, things of that nature. Those means were not right or acceptable, but those days are long gone. Now, too often they tend to kill their way to solutions. The disputes in those days were between two individuals, and they ended up shaking hands. Somebody lost and somebody won. In those days, we all lived through it. Now, all too often some of the parties to a conflict lose their lives. I don't know when we traded pugilism for pipe bombs. Frankly, I don't think they have found all the bombs at Littleton High School. They are still searching. 
   In fact, one went off at 2 o'clock this morning. 
   I don't know when these youngsters got accustomed to killing each other. But I know we often blame television, we blame movies, we blame video games, and we blame a number of other things. 
   But those children in Jefferson County and their families ache every day. I just wanted to tell the people of Colorado that my colleagues, Senator WYDEN, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator REID, Senator LAUTENBERG, and a number of others have all offered their sympathies, and want people in Colorado to know that our hearts in the United States Senate are with all of the families through this terrible and tragic time. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I address an issue that is of vital importance to the national security of our country and the stability of the Middle East. While Iran's development of nuclear technologies has been a growing concern for the last few years, recent developments demand a response to this serious situation. 
   Last November, Iran signed an accord with Russia to speed up completion of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, calling for an expansion of the current design and construction of the $800 million, 1,000 megawatt light-water reactor in southern Iran. Despite serious United States objections and concerns about the project, Russia maintains its longstanding support for the project and the development of Iran's nuclear program. Though Russian and Iranian governments insist that the reactor will be used for civilian energy purposes, the United States national security community believes that the project is too easy a cover for Iran to obtain vital Russian nuclear weapons technology. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu condemned the Iranian-Russian nuclear cooperation accord as a threat to the entire region, stating:  
   The building of a nuclear reactor in Iran only makes it likelier that Iran will equip its ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads. ..... Such a development threatens peace, the whole region and in the end, the Russians themselves.  
   On January 13 of this year, the administration underscored the gravity of this situation and imposed economic sanctions against three Russian institutes for supplying Iran with nuclear technology. But, I believe more needs to be done. 
   While the Khatami government in Iran has made some reform efforts since it was elected in 1997, Iran continues to oppose the Middle East peace process, has broadened its efforts to increase its weapons of mass destruction, and remains subject to the influences of its hard-line defense establishment. As reports of Iran's human rights violations continue, State Department reports on international terrorism indicate Iran's continued assistance to terrorist forces such as Hamas, Hizballah, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. This clear and consistent record of behavior seriously calls to question Iran's active pursuit to enhance its nuclear facilities. 
   Though Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction have been a growing global concern for several years, international fears were confirmed when in July of last year, Iran demonstrated the strength of its offensive muscle by test-firing its latest Shahab-3 missle. Capable of propelling a 2,200-pound warhead for a range of 800 miles, this missile now allows Iran to pose a significant threat to our allies in the Middle East. 
   The potential results of Iran's successful development of effective nuclear technologies hold horrific implications for the stability of the Middle East. As an original cosponsor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997, and signatory of two letters in the 105th Congress to the administration to raise this issue with the Russian leadership, I believe the Senate must continue the effort in light of this growing threat. 
   Today I am joined by Senator SESSIONS in introducing the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1999 as a means to hinder the development of Iran's nuclear weapons program. The House version of this legislation is also being introduced today by Congressman MENENDEZ of New Jersey. This bill requires the withholding of proportional voluntary United States assistance to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for programs and projects supported by the Agency in Iran. This legislation specifically aims to limit the Agency's assistance of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant. 
   Last October, this legislation was passed in the House by a recorded vote of 405 to 13, but was not considered by the Senate before the adjournment of the 105th Congress. In the interest of United States national security and for that of our allies, it is vital we ensure that United States funds are not promoting the development of Iran's nuclear capabilities.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I offer an important piece of legislation. The bill I offer today, called the American Family Tax Relief Act of 1999, is a modest, but important tax relief package. This bill is important for both substantive and symbolic reasons. Substantively, this bill provides all Americans with needed tax relief. If the need for tax relief isn't yet apparent to everyone, tomorrow will remind all Americans of the need when they submit tax returns which reflect an ever larger percentage of their income going to the federal government. 
   This bill is also important as a symbol to the American public that Congress remains committed to the principle of a smaller federal government and lower taxes. We should not use the unusually good economic times we enjoy as an excuse to delay providing tax relief to hard-working American families. No, we should instead take this wonderful opportunity to recommit ourselves to fiscal discipline and responsibility. 
   We are already taking important steps in this regard by locking up the social security trust fund to ensure its solvency. We are also devoting a significant portion of the surplus to retiring publicly held debt, which will reduce the drain on federal spending for interest on this debt. The next step is to provide tax relief. This is a platform many of us have stood upon, and is therefore a pledge we must honor. If we can't provide tax cuts in good times, think how difficult it would be in bad times. 
   This bill I offer today has five different components: the largest component of this legislation would lower all individual income tax 
   rates by 5%. Although this is substantially less than the 10% tax cut I have also supported, this modest reduction will more easily fit in the budget offsets after social security solvency and debt retirement have been addressed. By letting all Americans keep more of their income, they will be free to spend or save more of it. By now, we all know that the end result of this is a healthier, more robust economy. 
   The second component would expand the lowest income tax bracket, a targeted tax break for middle income tax payers. In addition to the 5% across the board reduction, many middle income earners would now fall into the lowest tax bracket, thereby paying even lower taxes than they would under the existing tax code. 
   Third, I would repeal the marriage penalty. Last year during my reelection campaign, I heard from hundreds of Coloradans asking me to repeal this offensive part of the tax code. I agree with all of them that we need a tax code that underscores the value we place on encouraging families, not one that discourages or penalizes marriage. This bill would do that. 
   Fourth, this bill would bring needed relief to many taxpayers by allowing the full deductibility of health insurance. Even folks who don't meet the minimum criteria needed to itemize their deductions, often single folks or lower income folks, could still deduct their health insurance. This is a critical step towards providing all Americans with health insurance coverage and reducing the cost of this critical component of modern life.  
   The last piece of this bill would encourage greater individual responsibility for retirement planning. By allowing a taxpayer to contribute more into an IRA without being taxed, more individuals will contribute more to their own retirement. The end result would be less reliance and less strain on Social Security and other entitlement programs. The more Congress can lead the way in weaning ourselves off of federal entitlements by encouraging individual retirement planning, the more government will shrink while increasing its efficiency. 
   I conclude by inviting my colleagues to take a good look at this bill and work with me on reasonable changes and to support its passage.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a truly remarkable woman, Mrs. Isabel ``Bella'' Romero, of Greeley, Colorado. This gallant woman's life was prematurely cut short last year after courageously fighting ovarian cancer for six years. Bella's dedication to improving our world transcends her career as an inspirational middle school principal and educator and as a woman devoted to her family. Her selfless pursuit of bringing out the best in all she came in contact with has made her passing that much greater. She is fondly missed by her friends and family, but her legacy lives on through all those whose lives she touched.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help our nation's state and local law enforcement officers acquire the bullet resistant equipment they need to protect themselves from would-be killers. 
   I am joined today by my colleague, Senator TORRICELLI, as an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
   This bill, the ``Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1999,'' is based on S. 2253, which I introduced in the 105th Congress. This bill is named in memory of Dale Claxton, a Cortez, Colorado, police officer who was fatally shot through the windshield of his patrol car last year. A bullet resistant windshield could have saved his life. 
   Unfortunately, incidents like this are far from isolated. All across our nation law enforcement officers, whether in hot pursuit, driving through dangerous neighborhoods, or pulled over on the side of the road behind an automobile, are at risk of being shot through their windshields. We must do what we can to prevent these kinds of tragedies as better, lighter and more affordable types of bullet resistant glass and other equipment become available. For the purposes of this bill I use the technically more accurate term ``bullet resistant'' instead of the more commonplace ``bullet proof'' since, even though we all wish they could be, few things are truly ``bullet proof.'' 
   While I served as a deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, California, I became personally aware of the inherent dangers law enforcement officers encounter each day on the front lines. Now that I serve as a U.S. senator here in Washington, DC, I believe we should do what we can to help our law enforcement officers protect themselves as they risk their lives while protecting the American people from violent criminals. 
   One important way we can do this is to help them acquire bullet resistant glass and armored panels for patrol cars, hand held bullet resistant shields and other life saving bullet resistant equipment. This assistance is especially crucial for small local jurisdictions that often lack the funds needed to provide their officers with the life saving bullet resistant equipment they need. 
   The Officer Dale Claxton bill builds upon the successes of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, S. 1605, which I 
   introduced in the 105th Congress and the president signed into law last June. This program provides matching grants to state and local law enforcement agencies to help them purchase body armor for their officers. This bill builds upon this worthy program by expanding it to help them acquire additional types of bullet resistant equipment. 
   The bill I introduce today has four main components. The first part authorizes continued funding for the current Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act program at $25 million per year. 
   The second and central part of this legislation authorizes a new $40 million matching grant program to help state, local, tribal and other small law enforcement agencies acquire bullet resistant equipment such as bullet resistant glass and armored panels for patrol cars, hand held bullet resistant shields and other life saving equipment. 
   The third component of this bill, as promoted by Senator TORRICELLI, would authorize a $25 million matching grant program for the purchase of video cameras for use in law enforcement vehicles. 
   These three matching grants are authorized for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 and would be allocated by the Bureau of Justice Assistance according to a formula that ensures fair distribution for all states, local communities, tribes and U.S. territories. To help ensure that these matching grants get to the jurisdictions that need them the most the bureau is directed to make at least half of the funds available to those smaller jurisdictions whose budgets are the most financially constrained. 
   The final key part of this bill provides the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) with $3 million over 3 years to conduct an expedited research and development program to speed up the deployment of new bullet resistant technologies and equipment. The development of new bullet resistant materials in the next few years could be as revolutionary in the next few years as Kevlar was for body armor in the 1970s. Exciting new technologies such as bonded acrylic, polymers, polycarbons, aluminized material and transparent ceramics promise to provide for lighter, more versatile and hopefully less expensive bullet resistant equipment. 
   The Officer Dale Claxton bill also directs the NIJ to inventory existing technologies in the private sector, in surplus military property, and in use by other countries and to evaluate, develop standards, establish testing guidelines, and promote technology transfer. 
   Under the bill, the Institute would give priority in testing and feasibility studies to law enforcement partnerships developed in coordination with existing High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs). 
   Our nation's state, local and tribal law enforcement officers regularly put their lives in harm's way and deserve to have access to the bullet resistant equipment they need. The Officer Dale Claxton bill will both get life saving bullet resistant equipment deployed into the field where it is needed and accelerate the development of new lifesaving bullet resistant technologies. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to authorize States to recognize each other's concealed weapons laws and exempt qualified current and former law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms. This legislation is designed to support the rights of States and to facilitate the right of law-abiding citizens as well as law enforcement officers to protect themselves, their families, and their property. I am pleased to be joined by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH as an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
   The language of this bill is based on my bill, S. 837, in the 105th Congress and is similar to a provision in S. 3, the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1997, introduced by Senator HATCH. In light of the importance of this provision to law-abiding gunowners and law enforcement officers, I am introducing this freestanding bill today for the Senate's consideration and prompt action. 
   This bill allows States to enter into agreements, known as ``compacts,'' to recognize the concealed weapons laws of those States included in the compacts. This is not a Federal mandate; it is strictly voluntary for those States interested in this approach. States would also be allowed to include provisions which best meet their needs, such as special provisions for law enforcement personnel. 
   This legislation would allow anyone possessing a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm in their respective State to also carry it in another State, provided that the States have entered into a compact agreement which recognizes the host State's right-to-carry laws. This is needed if you want to protect the security individuals enjoy in their own State when they travel or simply cross State lines to avoid a crazy quilt of differing laws. 
   Currently, a Federal standard governs the conduct of nonresidents in those States that do not have a right-to-carry statute. Many of us in this body have always strived to protect the interests of States and communities by allowing them to make important decisions on how their affairs should be conducted. We are taking to the floor almost every day to talk about mandating certain things to the States. This bill would allow States to decide for themselves. 
   Specifically, the bill allows that the law of each State govern conduct within that State where the State has a right-to-carry statute, and States determine through a compact agreement which out-of-State right-to-carry statute will be recognized. 
   To date, 31 States have passed legislation making it legal to carry concealed weapons. These State laws enable citizens of those States to exercise their right to protect themselves, their families, and their property. 
   The second major provision of this bill would allow qualified current and former law enforcement officers who are carrying appropriate written identification of that status to be exempt from State laws that prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons. This provision sets forth a checklist of stringent criteria that law enforcement officers must meet in order to qualify for this exemption status. Exempting qualified current and former law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons, I believe, would add additional forces to our law enforcement community in our unwavering fight against crime.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, many crimes in our country are being committed with stolen guns. The extent of this problem is reflected in a number of recent studies and news reports. Therefore, today I am introducing the Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1999 to increase the maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws. 
   Reports indicate that almost half a million guns are stolen each year. As of March 1995 there were over 2 million reports in the stolen gun file of the FBI's National Crime Information Center including 7,700 reports of stolen machine guns and submachine guns. In a 9 year period between 1985 and 1994, the FBI received an annual average of over 274,000 reports of stolen guns. 
   Studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms note that felons steal firearms to avoid background checks. A 1991 Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of State prison inmates notes that almost 10 percent had stolen a handgun, and over 10 percent of all inmates had traded or sold a stolen firearm. 
   This problem is especially alarming among young people. A Justice Department study of juvenile inmates in four states shows that over 50 percent of those inmates had stolen a gun. In the same study, gang members and drug sellers were more likely to have stolen a gun. 
   In my home State of Colorado, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation receives over 500 reports of stolen guns each month. As of this month, the Bureau has a total of 36,000 firearms on its unrecovered firearms list. It is estimated that 
   one-third of these firearms are categorized as handguns. 
   All these studies and statistics show the extent of the problem of stolen guns. Therefore, the bill I am introducing today will increase the maximum prison sentences for violation of existing stolen gun laws. 
   Specifically, my bill increases the maximum penalty for violating four provisions of the firearms laws. Under title 18 of the U.S. Code, it is illegal to knowingly transport or ship a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. It is also illegal to knowingly receive, possess, conceal, store, sell, or otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. 
   The penalty for violating either of these provisions is a fine, a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, or both. My bill increases the maximum prison sentence to 15 years. 
   The third statutory provision makes it illegal to steal a firearm from a licensed dealer, importer, or manufacturer. For violating this provision, the maximum term of imprisonment would be increased to a maximum 15 years under by bill. 
   And the fourth provision makes it illegal to steal a firearm from any person, including a licensed firearm collector, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. As with the other three provisions, my bill increases this maximum penalty to 15 years. 
   In addition to these amendments to title 18 of the U.S. Code, the bill I introduce today directs the United States Sentencing Commission to revise the Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to these firearms offenses. 
   Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the rights of law-abiding gun owners. However, I firmly believe we need tough penalties for the illegal use of firearms. 
   The Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1999 will send a strong signal to criminals who are even thinking about stealing a firearm. I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague Senator MURKOWSKI as an original co-sponsor of legislation to amend the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994. This is the first step in reforming the way Indian trust funds are managed and invested for the benefit of the Indian tribes and their citizens. 
   On March 3, 1999, the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a joint hearing on trust fund management practices in the Department of the Interior. 
   We held the hearing because the Secretary of the Interior issued an order in January that I believe undermined the authority of the Special Trustee for American Indians and violated the spirit and letter of the 1994 Act. 
   Nothing at the hearing changed my mind. As a result, I proposed an amendment to the FY 1999 Supplemental Appropriations bill to suspend the implementation of this order while we sort out the legitimacy and effectiveness of ongoing trust management reforms within the Department. This should be done through legislation and congressional oversight, not secretarial orders drafted with no tribal input. 
   Today's bill is the next step. It will enable Congress, Indian tribes, and the Administration to begin the difficult task of undoing 100 years of mismanagement and neglect by the United States. 
   Most Americans are unfamiliar with this issue so let me describe what we are talking about. Beginning in 1849, the federal government, as trustee for the tribes, built a system to identify and track Indian land holdings, land leases, income from those leases, and other Indian assets, and created ``trust funds'' to be managed for the benefit of their Indian beneficiaries. 
   Over the years, the United States has failed to keep track of the funds and the documents supporting the funds. In addition, the Department is prevented by law from investing these funds in anything other than U.S.-guaranteed investments which bring returns much lower than what is possible in the open market. For these reasons, the trustee has failed to adequately maintain this system and to maximize returns on investment, with Indians as the predictable losers once again. These facts raise the question of whether the federal government is the appropriate place for these accounts. 
   The money in these accounts, or that is supposed to be in these trust fund accounts, is Indian money that has been entrusted to the United States. It is not federal money. There are billions of dollars at stake: in 1997, the Department's Tribal Reconciliation Project stated that it was unable to reconcile some $2.4 billion in tribal funds. 
   For Indians that means they have no access to the money and do not receive the benefit from their own money. 
   There are at least three major aspects to the problem. First, efforts by the Department to identify and gather all documentation to determine accurate trust fund balances; second, the efforts to put in place new computers and management systems; and third, the need to provide Indian tribes with the flexibility to maximize the return on fund investments in the interim as the first two initiatives continue. 
   This legislation is aimed at the third of these problems. As the Committees work to fix the mistakes of the past, we can give tribes the flexibility and freedom to invest their money in the financial instruments they choose. This legislation will allow Indian tribes the option to leave their funds with the Department for management and investment or to transfer the funds to qualified financial institutions, including Indian-owned banks, in order to receive competitive returns on investment. 
   The bill will direct the Secretary of Interior to consult with the nation's top banker, the Comptroller of the Currency, in negotiating contracts with federally-approved financial institutions for the 
   investment of funds now managed by the United States. 
   Let me be clear: tribes are not required to move their accounts into the private market. It is an option. 
   This bill does not represent a ``surrender'' in the efforts to find the missing funds and documents. In fact, just the opposite. Under the bill, the Secretary is obligated to continue to search for documents that will give a more accurate account balance to the tribes. 
   That brings up another troubling issue--the possibility that some documents will never be found. It is bad enough that some have been permanently lost due to neglect. But a story in today's Washington Times raises the possibility that, even worse, some documents may have been purposely destroyed. The story says that the plaintiffs suing the government over trust funds mismanagement have given the judge affidavits accusing Interior Department officials of destroying trust fund documents to conceal them from the court.  
   If this is true, it would be the worst violation of the trust responsibility in decades. 
   I should point out that this bill is the first, not the last, word on our efforts to clean up the trust funds mess and to give Indians the chance to take risks, generate higher rates of returns, and bring economic opportunities where none now exist. Also, this bill is subject to change. I welcome input from Indian Country as we work to perfect it. 
   As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I am committed to working with and assisting the tribes in the many reforms that are necessary to bring increased hope and opportunities to their communities. 
   I urge my colleagues to join Senator MURKOWSKI and me in bringing real reform and real change to Indian trust funds management. After 150 years, it's about time we think and act boldly to bring this sad chapter in American history to a close.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I continue to voice my support for the Middle East peace process and my work on behalf of soldiers Missing in Action and Prisoners of War. During the last Congress, I introduced the Missing Service Personnel Act, provisions of which were signed into law to restore critical Department of Defense procedures for identifying and recovering POW/MIAs. The Act ensures that our government is and will do everything in its power to return those lost during times of conflict. Last month, I introduced S. 484, the ``Bring Them Home Alive Act of 1999'' which creates a significant incentive for foreign nationals to return any possibly surviving American POW/MIAs. 
   Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that continues my support for POW/MIAs and assists our Israeli allies in their efforts to learn the fate of several soldiers who were overtaken by Syrian forces in June 1982. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators TORRICELLI, MCCAIN, KERRY of Massachusetts, SMITH of New Hampshire, LUGAR, COVERDELL, LIEBERMAN, LAUTENBERG, ASHCROFT, KENNEDY, SCHUMER, ALLARD, and SANTORUM. This bill is a companion to legislation which Congressmen LANTOS, GILMAN, and 65 other members introduced in the House. 
   Reports indicate that three soldiers of an Israeli tank crew were captured by Syrian forces at the 1982 battle of Sultan Yaqub in northern Lebanon. These men were later paraded through the streets of the Syrian capital of Damascus. They were never seen nor heard from again. Zachary Baumel, an American citizen and sergeant in the Israeli Defense Forces was one of those men. For over sixteen years, the Syrian government and the leadership of the PLO have failed to cooperate in the effort to determine their fate. In 1993, Yasser Arafat produced the most tangible link to the missing men, returning half of Baumel's identification dog tag. For the last five years, however, no additional information has been forthcoming. 
   The bill I introduce today requires the State Department to raise this issue with the Syrian government and leaders of the Palestinian Authority and provide the Congress with a report on the information that has been uncovered. It also requires that Palestinian and Syrian cooperation in this effort be a factor in the consideration for future U.S. assistance. 
   This legislation is a targeted approach to address the unique and compelling merits of this case in which an American-born Israeli soldier and his comrades remain unaccounted for in a time of war. As Americans know all too well, the bitter legacy of missing soldiers and POWs can haunt a nation and interfere with efforts to build better relations between former enemies. Clearly, resolving the issue of the MIAs can only strengthen American efforts to make Middle East peace into a reality. 
   This is the first week of the Jewish month of Nissan--the month of the Jewish holiday of Passover--the ancient festival that celebrates freedom. I can think of no time that is more appropriate to propose this legislation, and to hopefully begin a process that will help to resolve the fate of Zachary Baumel and his comrades after so many years.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am opposed the Enzi-Reid amendment on Indian gaming because it will continue the ``stand-off'' that exists between the tribes and states, preventing them from reaching fair gaming agreements. 
   There are members in the Chamber who are downright against gaming. That is not what this debate is about. 
   Under Federal law, tribes are limited to the types of gaming allowed under the laws of the State in which they reside. In my own State of Colorado as an example, there are two tribes, the Southern Ute and the Ute Mountain Ute. They are limited to slot machines and low-stakes table games, just as the other gaming towns in Colorado. 
   In Utah, State law prohibits all gaming: tribal, non-tribal or otherwise. The intention of the Federal law, IGRA, was that in States where gaming is limited or prohibited, tribes would be limited or prohibited from operating gaming as well. 
   But today's debate is about whether a Governor of a State can limit a type of business activity to certain groups simply by refusing to negotiate. That is unfair and un-American. 
   There are many tribes and States that have sat down and negotiated such agreements that are binding and effective. 
   There are some States that refuse to negotiate at all with tribes--leaving  those tribes without the ability to conduct gaming and without the ability to generate much-needed revenues. 
   This is the core problem: whether accomplished through legislation, through the kind of secretarial procedures we are talking about today, or whether through tribal-State negotiations, these impasses should be brought to an end. 
   Let's not forget how we got here. In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled in Cabazon that unless a State prohibited gaming entirely, such as Utah and Hawaii now do, the State's regulations would not apply to gaming conducted on Indian lands within that State. 
   This caused a clamor by the States and a year later the Congress responded by passing the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
   This act was a compromise and for the first time gave State governments a role in what kind of gaming would occur on Indian reservations within a State's borders. 
   In 1996, the High Court ruled in Seminole that tribes cannot sue States and require them to negotiate for gaming compacts. Some States, have used the Seminole case to refuse to talk to tribes completely. 
   That is unfair at the very least. As my colleagues know, I am a big supporter of tribal-State negotiations on matters from business development, to jurisdictional issues, to taxes. If it is good enough for tribes to have to negotiate, it is good enough for States as well. 
   So while I think that each State's public policy should determine the scope of all gaming conducted in that State, I also believe the current State of the law gives States what is in reality a Veto over tribes in this field. 
   I was here in 1988, in fact, and helped write the IGRA legislation, and I can tell you it was never the intent of Congress to provide such a veto. 
   I should point out to my colleagues that in many cases non-Indian gaming is promoted and even operated by State governments, so there is an element of competition. I believe some States have refused to negotiate in order to preserve their monopoly on gaming. 
   To begin to address this situation, the Department of Interior has proposed a process that is based on the IGRA statute. Though the process does need refinement, I do not believe the secretary should be stopped from developing alternative approaches to these impasses. 
   Coming from a Western State, I am as supportive as anybody in this chamber of States rights, but those who say this process overrides the States are wrong. 
   Under the proposal, if a State objected to a decision made by the Interior Secretary, that State could challenge that decision in Federal court. 
   For those who fear the department is acting without oversight, I point out that Congress will have the authority to review any proposed regulations before they take effect. 
   As the proposal comes before the authorizing committees, any new regulations will get a careful review and if those regulations are found to be unacceptable, they simply will not pass. We will legislate a new approach if they do not pass. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and allow the regulatory and legislative process to work. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, although Communism released its oppressive grip on the people of Russia nearly ten years ago, its fingerprints of racism and ethnic intolerance persist. Today, I call the attention of my colleagues to the troubling surge of anti-Semitic rhetoric by the Russian Duma's Communist Party leaders who have sought to place the blame of Russia's social and economic ills on its Jewish community. As the new co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am submitting a resolution to help address this disturbing situation. This  resolution is a companion to H.Con.Res. 37 which was introduced by Congressman CHRIS SMITH, Chairman of the Helsinki Commission. 
   In October of last year, General Albert Makashov, Communist Party member of the Duma, insulted and threatened the Jewish community with physical retribution for what he asserted as being a cause of Russia's current instabilities. When other members of the Duma sought to censure General Makashov for his comments, Communist party members blocked the measure on two different occasions and the Duma failed to condemn his statements. Then in December, Viktor Ilyukhin, Communist Party member and Chairman of the Security Committee, asserted that the Jews were committing `genocide against the Russian people'. He further referenced the influence of President Yeltsin's `Jewish entourage' and called for ethnic quotas in these posts to counter Jewish influence. 
   It is imperative that the Russian Duma be sent a clear message that these expressions of racism and ethnic hatred will not go unnoticed by the U.S. 
   Today, I am joined by Senators LAUTENBERG, ABRAHAM, SMITH of Oregon, BROWNBACK, TORRICELLI, REID, CLELAND, BURNS, and FEINGOLD in submitting a resolution which condemns these anti-Semitic statements made by the Russian Duma. It likewise commends the actions taken by those in the Duma who sought to censure the Communist Party leaders and commends President Yeltsin for his forceful rejection of the statements. This resolution also reiterates the firm belief of the Congress that peace and justice cannot be achieved as long as governments and legislatures promote policies based upon anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia. 
   In light of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's upcoming visit to the U.S., this resolution is especially timely. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution which underscores the U.S. commitment to religious freedom and human rights.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, just as it recognizes foreign governments, the United States is called upon to consider extending its recognition to Indian tribal governments here at home. 
   From the first days of the republic, the Congress has acted to recognize the unique legal and political relationship the United States has with the Indian tribes. Reforming the process of recognition is the goal of the legislation I am introducing today. 
   Just as the United States at times refuses to recognize foreign governments, there are and always have been tribal governments which have not been recognized by the Federal government. This lack of recognition does not alter the ``Indian-ness'' of a tribe's members; rather it merely means that there is no formal political relationship between that tribal group and the United States. 
   Federal recognition is critical to tribal groups because it triggers eligibility for services and benefits provided by the United States because of their status as members of federally recognized Indian tribes. 
   I want to be clear--I am not advocating for the approval of every petition for recognition, and I am not proposing that the petitions receive a limited or cursory review. I am concerned with the viability of the current recognition process and am interested in seeing fairness, promptness, and finality brought into that process while providing basic assurances to already-recognized tribes regarding their inherent rights. 
   Federal recognition can be accomplished in two ways: through the enactment of federal legislation; or through the administrative process that occurs, or more accurately does not occur, within the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  
   Over the years, uncertainty has developed over just how or when the Bureau would process tribal group applications for recognition. In short, the current process is not getting the job done. 
   The process in the Department of the Interior is time consuming and costly, although it has improved from its original state. Some tribal groups allege that the Department's process leads to unfair and unfounded results. It has frequently been hindered by a lack of staff and resources needed to fairly and promptly review all petitions. At the same time, the Congress extends recognition to tribes with little or no reference to the legal standards and criteria employed by the Department. 
   The amount of time some tribal groups have had to wait before their petitions are acted on in some cases is outrageous. Sometimes these applications for recognition are pending literally for decades. The concerns expressed go beyond the delays I mentioned and involve the viability of the current recognition process itself. 
   As with any decision-making body, fairness and timeliness are the keys to maintaining a credible system which holds the confidence of affected parties. I believe that it is in the interests of all parties to have 
   a clear deadline for the completion of the recognition process. 
   In 1978, the Department of the Interior promulgated regulations to establish criteria and procedures for the recognition of Indian tribes by the Secretary. 
   Since that time to date, tribal groups have filed hundreds of petitions for review. Of those, 42 have been resolved, and 179 are new petitioners; During this same time, 89 expressed letters of intent to petition, and 5 required legislative authority to proceed which are now deemed inactive. 
   The remainder are in various stages of consideration by the Department either ready for active status or are already placed on active status. During this same time to date, the Congress has recognized 7 other tribal groups through legislation. 
   In the last twenty years, the Committee on Indian Affairs held oversight hearings on the Federal recognition process. At each of those hearings the record clearly showed that the process is not working properly. At a Committee on Indian Affairs hearing in 1995, the Bureau testified that at the current rate of review and consideration, it would take several decades to eliminate the entire backlog of tribal petitions. The record from numerous previous hearings reveals a clear need for the Congress to address the problems affecting the recognition process. 
   The bill I am introducing today will go a long way toward resolving the problems which have plagued both the Department of the Interior and tribal petitioners over the years. 
   This bill, the Indian Federal Recognition Administrative Procedures Act of 1999, provides the required clarification and changes that will help tribal petitioners and the United States in providing fair and orderly administrative procedures to extend Federal recognition to eligible Indian groups. The key element of this bill is that it removes the recognition process from the BIA and places it in a temporary and independent ``Commission on Indian Recognition.'' 
   This bill provides that the Commission will be an independent agency, composed of three members appointed by the President, and authorized to hold hearings, take testimony and reach final determinations on petitions for recognition. 
   The bill provides strict but realistic time-lines to guide the Commission in the review and decision making process. Under the existing process in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, some petitioners have waited ten years or more for even a cursory review of their petition. 
   The bill I am introducing today requires the Commission to set a date for a preliminary hearing on a petition not later than 60 days after the filing of a documented petition. Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of a preliminary hearing, the Commission would be required to either decide to extend federal acknowledgment to the petitioner or to require the petitioner to proceed to an adjudicatory hearing. 
   The current recognition process becomes so expensive that the consideration of petitions are stretched out over a number of years because there have been no real deadlines for these decisions. 
   This bill will allow for a cost-effective process for the BIA and the petitioners, will provide definite time-lines for the administrative recognition process, and ``sunsets'' the Commission in 12 years. 
   To ensure fairness, the bill provides for appeals of adverse decisions to the federal district court here in the District of Columbia. 
   To ensure promptness, the bill authorizes adequate funding for the costs of processing petitions through the Commission. 
   The bill also provides finality for both the petitioners and the Department by requiring all interested tribal groups to file their petitions within 6 years after the date of enactment and requiring the Commission to complete its work within 12 years from enactment.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator INOUYE in introducing the Indian Needs Assessment, Program Evaluation and Policy Coordination Act of 1999 to bring about needed reforms in the way Indian programs are designed and funded. 
   As the annual funding debates over Indian programs show us year after year, rational and equitable funding decisions are made more difficult because of the lack of accurate and up to date information about the needs of tribal governments and tribal members. 
   The ability of the Congress to target unmet needs and make available adequate funds for tribes and tribal members is directly related to the quantity and quality of information available about the type and degree of demand for federal programs and services. 
   Within one year of the enactment of this Act, and every 5 years thereafter, each Federal agency or department is required to conduct an ``Indian Needs Assessment'' (``INA'') aimed at determining the needs of tribes and Indians eligible for programs and services administered by such agency or department. 
   To facilitate information collection and analysis, the bill requires the development of a uniform method, criteria and procedures for determining, analyzing, and compiling the program and service needs of tribes and Indians. 
   The resulting ``Indian Needs Assessments'' are to be filed with the Committees on Appropriations and Indian Affairs of the Senate, and the Committees on Appropriations and Resources of the House of Representatives. 
   In addition to a Needs Assessment, the bill also requires that each Federal agency or department responsible for providing services to Indians file an ``Annual Indian Program Evaluation'' (``AIPE'') with these same committees. The AIPE will measure the performance and effectiveness of the programs under the jurisdiction of that agency or department, and include recommendations as to how such programs can be improved.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Indian Tribal Economic Development and Contract Encouragement Act of 1999 to encourage tribal economic development, provide for disclosures regarding tribal sovereign immunity, and eliminate excessive and unproductive bureaucratic oversight of tribal decisions. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, most Indian tribes are not in the position to fund all, or even most of their governmental operations through taxes imposed on reservation-based activities or assets. Often a tribe's own land and other natural resources are the only means a tribe has to fund its activities or to promote economic development within its reservation boundaries. 
   Since land is the basic trust resource, the United States has the authority and the responsibility to oversee the lease of tribal lands. Where tribes propose to enter leases of their lands, a federal statute provides that the lease is only valid if it is approved by the Interior Department. My proposed bill does not affect the federal government's authority to approve leases. My bill addresses non-lease agreements between Indian tribes and those that provide services that relate to the tribe's lands. 
   Not that long ago, tribes had to rely on federal bureaucrats to devise ways to develop their lands, to negotiate leases, and to then approve those leases. In many instances, tribes are now developing their own proposals. To assist in the development of a private sector, I want to encourage this entrepreneurial spirit. 
   There are strong indications, however, that an ancient federal statute is impeding every Indian tribe's ability to enter into agreements with those who might be hired by the tribe to assist it in developing its lands. Like most laws, this statute was enacted with the best intentions. I speak of a law enacted over 125 years ago; a law enacted when many Indians had to rely on translators to read the treaties between the United States and their tribal government. The statute I propose to amend was enacted in 1871, and it survives in much the same form today as it did then--64 Congresses ago. 
   Section 81, as it is known, provides that a contract ``relating to Indian lands'' is not valid unless it is approved by the Secretary. Section 81 imposes no limits on how long the BIA may take to review the agreement or even what standards apply to decide whether the contract should be approved or denied. 
   The bill I introduce today addresses these issues and others. 
   First, the bill gives the Secretary 90 days to review a proposed contract. This is the same amount of time the Secretary has to review contracts relating to the management of gaming facilities. My bill provides that if the government takes no action for 90  days, then the tribe can proceed with the project unhindered by the lack of approval. 
   All other federal laws will still apply to the agreement. 
   Second, the Secretary must identify the types of contracts that are not covered by this statute. A tribe can submit such contracts and the BIA has 45 days to determine whether they are covered by the law. The Secretary is still authorized to reject any contract that violates federal law. 
   Finally, the bill incorporates a suggestion made in 1988 by then-Assistant Secretary Ross Swimmer to ``eliminate the current statutory requirements that the Secretary approve the tribal selection of attorneys and attorney fees.'' To allow the selection of counsel, without the Secretary's oversight, is fundamental to Indian self-determination. 
   My bill addresses one other key matter. Like other sovereign governments, Indian tribes are free to negotiate with potential business partners whether, in what form, and to what extent the parties can sue and be sued under a contract they enter. My bill recognizes a tribe's discretion in this area and it leaves it in place. 
   After numerous hearings conducted in the 105th Congress and in previous congresses, I believe the record is clear: Indian tribes have been increasingly responsible in their consideration of immunity decisions. 
   I am concerned, however, about those who may enter into agreements with Indian tribes knowing that the tribe retains immunity but at a later time insist that they have been treated unfairly by the tribe raising the immunity defense. 
   Under my bill, the Secretary must deny approval of contracts if the agreement in question fails to state that the parties recognize that the tribe is immune from suit unless immunity is expressly waived. 
   Excessive federal regulation, especially if it impedes business and economic development in Indian Country, needs to be eliminated. Whether we put this belief in terms of the Contract with America, or the initiative to reinvent government, our objective is the same. 
   There is no group of people who have experienced more federal regulation of every aspect of their lives than Indians. This bill represents a commitment to reduce unnecessary and anachronistic federal bureaucratic requirements.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce another key piece of legislation to encourage private sector development on Indian lands. This bill is aimed at removing the obstacles that stand in the way of responsive government and greater levels of business activity in Indian country--the Indian Tribal Regulatory Reform and Business Development Act of 1999. 
   Over the years, laws, regulations and policies have been built up--often with good intentions--but have outlived their usefulness or relevance to the contemporary needs of Indian tribal governments and economies. 
   More importantly, the multi-layered bureaucracies, federal as well as tribal, have been repeatedly identified as a barrier to Indian entrepreneurship and business development on and around Indian lands. 
   Efforts to reduce bureaucracy are not new or unique to Indian country. Governments around the world have begun  embarking on efforts to downsize and streamline government operations to an appropriate level--one that complements human endeavors rather than hindering them. 
   The bill I am introducing today is part of the much-needed effort to accomplish the same goal to benefit the business environments on Indian lands nationwide. 
   The legislation requires a comprehensive review of the laws and regulations affecting investment and business decisions on Indian lands, and requires the Regulatory Reform and Business Development on Indian lands Authority to determine the extent to which such laws and regulations unnecessarily or inappropriately impair investment and business development on Indian lands. 
   The Authority is also required to determine how such laws and regulations impact the financial stability and management efficiency of tribal governments. 
   Under the provisions of this bill, the Authority is required to conduct the review and within one year report the findings and recommendations to the Congress and the President for further actions. 
   Mr. President, this is not the first time an effort of this sort has been proposed, but I believe that if conducted properly, it can serve as a lasting and constructive initiative to further the long-term health and prosperity of tribal governments and economies.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, to encourage states and tribes to negotiate and enter fair and binding tax compacts, I introduce today the Inter-Governmental Tax Agreement Act of 1999. 
   In 1998, I introduced similar legislation to provide a mechanism, short of litigation, for the collection of state retail sales taxes. The Committee on Indian Affairs held several hearings on the issue of taxation involving tribes and sales made on Indian lands and heard from tribal leaders, state tax officials, private retailers, and other affected parties. Though no resolution was reached, the voluminous record developed by the Committee has helped flesh out the issue of taxation and has led to a fuller picture being developed. 
   Because there is much confusion about Indians and tax matters, I should be clear and explain exactly what we are talking about when we address these matters. Indian tribal governments, like state governments, pay no federal taxes on income earned by the tribe. Individual members of Indian tribes pay the same taxes other citizens of the United States pay: federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, and a host of other taxes. 
   What we are focusing on with this bill are state taxes on retail sales made to non-Indians on goods such as tobacco and fuel when the transaction occurs on Indian lands. As late as 1991, the Supreme Court ruled that such taxes are legitimately levied taxes and set out several possible remedies available to states including lawsuits against tribal officials and negotiating a tax compact. The court was equally clear, however, that because of tribal common law immunity from lawsuits, tribes cannot be sued to collect the tax revenues. 
   Consistent with that opinion, at least 18 states and dozens of Indian tribes have chosen to negotiate and enter into tax agreements. At the Committee hearing in March 1998, it was estimated that more than 200 ``intergovernmental tax agreements'' are now in place covering a variety of retail goods. 
   These agreements detail the collection and remittance of tax revenues by the tribe to the state on sales to non-members of the tribe, and often allow for an ``administrative fee'' paid to the tribe for their efforts to collect and remit the tax revenues. 
   Two factors were presented to the Committee which are legitimate issues for debate in the 106th Congress. First, the question of services provided by the state and/or the tribe to Indians and non-Indians living on tribal lands; and second, the devastating impact on Indian economies as a result of ``dual'' state and tribal taxes levied on the same transaction. 
   This legislation encourages state-tribal agreements by requiring that states and tribes attempt to resolve their differences in good faith through negotiations aimed at entering into a tax compact. 
   If efforts to reach agreement through negotiations and mediation fail, under this bill the Interior Secretary may refer the matter to the ``Intergovernmental Dispute Resolution Panel'' consisting of representatives of the departments of Interior, Justice, and Treasury, Indian tribal governments, and State governments. 
   Rather than create an entirely new mechanism, the framework provided by this bill relies on existing mediation services provided by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to assist the Panel in carrying out its duties in arriving at fair agreements. 
   The history of state-tribal relations is one full of acrimony with brief periods of cooperation. The tax issue is an emotional one with a long history, Mr. President, but I am hopeful that fair and equitable solutions to matters involving states, tribes and taxation can be developed with the input of all affected parties.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the confirmation by the Senate last night of Mr. Montie Deer to become Chairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission--the federal regulatory body overseeing certain Indian gaming activities nationwide. 
   After a hearing in February of this year, the Committee on Indian Affairs reported Mr. Deer to the full Senate. Mr. Deer is a qualified and dedicated public servant who most recently was the United States Attorney in Kansas. 
   Since 1988, Indian gaming has become a source of much-needed revenue for Indian tribal governments to provide jobs, services and frankly, hope, where there is not much. There are now some 185 tribes operating some form of gaming operations, with annual revenues of nearly $7 billion. 
   The National Indian Gaming Commission was created 11 years ago. This three-member agency has the responsibility to monitor and regulate certain forms of gaming conducted on Indian lands. The NIGC has the authority to approve management contracts; conduct background investigations; approve tribal gaming ordinances; and review and conduct audits of the books and records of Indian gaming operations. 
   The NIGC also has the authority and the responsibility to enforce violations of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, NIGC regulations and approved tribal gaming ordinances. Those involved with Indian gaming understand the need for a strong, effective Commission--one that protects the integrity of games offered by tribes. As we did last session, the Committee on Indian Affairs will soon consider legislation to strengthen the Commission and ensure it has the resources it needs to fulfill its obligations. 
   A strong Commission is meaningless without strong leadership and last night the Senate acted to ensure that strong and effective leadership will be the order of the day.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Drug Certification Improvement Act of 1999 to strengthen and improve the annual drug certification process of countries which are fully cooperating with the United States to fight drug trafficking. This bill is based on legislation, S. 457, which I introduced in the 105th Congress. 
   I am concerned that the current system, in place since 1986, no longer works as Congress intended. As we witnessed last Friday, February 26th, the administration issued its certification for 1999. This certification penalizes only two countries--Burma and Afghanistan--for not fully cooperating with the United States to combat drug trafficking. The administration's certification also granted waivers on national security grounds to four countries--Paraguay, Haiti, Cambodia, and Nigeria--so they will continue to receive United States aid. 
   This certification, with only two countries sanctioned, raises serious concerns about the viability and effectiveness of the existing certification process and its underlying statutory authority. This concern is reflected in a Washington Post news report of February 27, 1999, which stated: ``The Administration's relatively forgiving approach reflects an effort to lower the profile on the certification reviews and thereby reduce the political tensions it has often created.'' 
   Under current law, notice provided to the target country is often too late and not specific enough to address the problems. Congress also lacks timely and specific information that would assist in exercising its legislative and oversight responsibilities. 
   The existing law also gives a free ride to countries which are decertified but then granted waivers and continue to receive aid because it is deemed to be in the national interest of the United States. These waivers allow the provision of aid year after year to countries not fully cooperating with the United States. What incentive do these countries have to improve their cooperation? 
   The current certification process is set forth in section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. It requires the president to submit to Congress by March 1 of each year a list of major illicit drug producing and transiting countries which he certifies are fully cooperating with the United States 
   Under existing law, the president has three options: One, certify a country which has cooperated fully with U.S. anti-drug efforts or has taken adequate steps on its own to comply with the 1988 U.N. anti-drug trafficking convention. Two, decertify a country for not fully cooperating. Or three, decertify a country but provide a waiver because it is in the national interests of the United States to continue to provide aid. 
   Currently, when a country is decertified, at least 50 percent of U.S. bilateral foreign aid is suspended in the current fiscal year. In fact, that country may lose more than 50 percent of its current funding if the State Department has not yet released the aid. Unless the country is recertified, all U.S. aid is suspended in subsequent fiscal years. And, the United States is required to vote against loans in the multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. 
   Congress has 30 days from receipt of the President's certification to enact a joint resolution disapproving the President's action. If Congress passes such a resolution, the President can veto it and require a two-thirds majority vote in Congress to override the veto. Congress also has its prerogative to pass a resolution at other times, but it too would be subject to a presidential veto. 
   The alternative I am proposing today would basically put countries ``on probation.'' By putting countries on notice that the United States has serious concerns about their lack of cooperation, it would provide a fair period of time during which those countries could address U.S. concerns. 
   My legislation builds on the existing carrot and stick approach in the certification process. The carrot is certification although for a finite period of time of 7 months. During this ``probationary period,'' all U.S. aid continues to flow and the United States remains supportive in international development banks. The President also stipulates which specific conditions must be met by that country to improve its cooperation with the United States and to continue receiving U.S. aid. Not only is sufficient notice provided to the country, but to the Congress as well. 
   The stick is a penalty similar to that under existing law. If after 7 months the country does not comply with the stipulations made by the President to improve its cooperation with the United States, 100 percent of U.S. bilateral aid is cut off. The United States also would vote against aid in the multilateral development banks if the country does not comply with U.S. stipulations, as provided for under current law. These penalties would remain in effect until the President notifies Congress that the country has complied with the stipulations made in the President's original probationary certification. 
   My bill also provides reasonable notice to Congress. Under this alternative, Congress would be informed about those specific concerns which the President identified regarding a country's lack of cooperation. Congress also would be able to track that country's progress during the 7-month probationary period and, of course, maintain its prerogative to pass legislation as it deems necessary. I believe this would help avoid contentious battles between Congress and the administration which appear to be a main reason for the limited certification we see from the administration this year. 
   It is clear that the existing certification process is flawed. The Drug Certification Improvement Act of 1999 provides a new certification option to fix the process, and I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, as an original cosponsor of his resolution to recognize the life and achievements of a remarkable man, the late Congressman from Arizona, Morris K. ``Mo'' Udall. 
   Congressman Udall served with distinction in the House of Representatives from 1961 to 1991. Until the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease forced him into early retirement, Mo was an active and vital member of Congress. I came to know him well during my years in the House when Congressman Udall chaired the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. 
   Congressman Udall's death this past December marked the end of his courageous battle against Parkinson's disease and of a life-long dedication to public service. His commitment and devotion to the environment, government reform, health care and civil rights advanced these causes and established a legacy that will not soon be forgotten. However, as a former athlete myself, I will forever remember Mo as the 6-foot, 5-inch former professional basketball player, with a heart of gold and wonderful sense of humor. 
   It is impossible to fully recognize the impact that Congressman Udall's tireless efforts have had on this Congress, the State of Arizona, and our Nation. 
   Mere words cannot express the respect, gratitude and sense of loss that we feel for this extraordinary man. I can only say, ``Thank you, Mo.'' We will all miss you.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators CRAIG, KYL, CRAPO, GORTON, and GRAMS who are original cosponsors of the bill. 
   This bill enforces our position as strong supporters of American public lands and private property rights, and is based upon legislation which I introduced in the 105th Congress, S. 2098. Since then I have received input from Coloradans and revised the bill accordingly, as I am concerned about the setting aside of public lands by the federal government for international agreements and oversight. 
   The absence of congressional oversight in such programs as the United Nations Biosphere Reserve is of special concern to me. The United Nations has designated 47 Biosphere Reserves in the United States which contain a total area greater than the size of my home state of Colorado. 
   The United Nations remains the only multi-national body to share perspectives on a global scale. The United States, as the leading economic and military world power, should maintain an influential role. However, the intrusive implications of the U.N. Biosphere Reserve program have created a problem that must be addressed by the Congress.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Bring Them Home Alive Act of 1999. This bill would persuade foreign nationals to take the bold steps needed to return any possibly surviving American POW/MIAs home alive. I am pleased to be joined today by Senators GREGG and HELMS as original cosponsors. 
   With the passage of the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, the Senate this week has made great strides in providing for the men and women of our armed forces. I am continuing this effort today. 
   This bill would grant asylum in the United States to foreign nationals who personally deliver a living American POW/MIA from either the Vietnam War or the Korean War to the United States. Citizens of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, China, or any of the states of the former Soviet Union who deliver living American POW/MIAs from the Vietnam War would be granted asylum here. Similarly, citizens of North Korea, China, or any of the states of the former Soviet Union who deliver living American POW/MIAs from the Korean War would also be granted asylum. Of course, that foreign national's immediate family, including their spouse and children, would also be granted asylum in the U.S. since their safety, and even their lives, would most likely  be imperiled by such a daring rescue of surviving American POW/MIAs. 
   While some may doubt that any American POW/MIAs from these two wars remain alive, official U.S. policy distinctly recognizes the possibility that U.S. POW/MIAs from the Vietnam War could still be alive and held captive in Indochina. As the Defense Department's current position states:  
   Although we have thus far been unable to prove that Americans are still being held against their will, the information available to us precludes ruling out that possibility. Actions to investigate live-sighting reports receive and will continue to receive necessary priority and resources based on the assumption that at least some Americans are still held captive. Should any report prove true, we will take appropriate action to ensure the return of those involved.  
   The bill I am introducing today supports this official position and enables the possibility of bringing any surviving U.S. servicemen home alive. 
   Since the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, there have been reports of live sightings of American POW/MIAs being held in Indochina. While the majority of these live-sightings have been resolved over the years, and have decreased in recent years, the possibility of Americans still being held remains. Two Russian translations of Vietnamese documents were discovered in Soviet archives in 1993 which contain detailed statistics indicating that approximately twice as many American POWs were 
   being held by Vietnam in late 1972 than were actually ever returned to the United States. 
   Furthermore, the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs' final report in 1993 concluded that about 100 U.S. POWs that were expected to be returned by Vietnam were never returned and that at least some of them may still be alive and held captive in Indochina. 
   It is also possible that American POW/MIAs are still being held in North Korea. A few years ago a 1996 Defense Department internal report was uncovered that concluded that between 10-15 POW/MIAs may still be alive and held against their will in North Korea. 
   The Bring Them Home Alive Act includes the states of the former Soviet Union, for just cause. Longstanding rumors that American POW/MIAs from both the Vietnam War and the Korean War were transferred to the Soviet Union were recently reinforced by the memoirs of recently deceased Soviet General Dmitri Volkogonov. As reported in a January 12, 1999, Washington Times article, Gen. Volkogonov wrote of seeing a secret KGB document from the 1960s outlining a plan to transfer U.S. POWs being held in Vietnam to the Soviet Union. The goal of this secret KGB plan was ``to bring knowledgeable Americans to the Soviet Union for intelligence (gathering) purposes.'' During a Congressional Delegation visit to Russia late last year, Russian General Sergeyev tacitly confirmed the existence of this document. While some officials contend this plan was never carried out, this is far from certain. In addition, the cumulative weight of compelling circumstantial evidence supports the assertion that American POWs were also transferred to the Soviet Union during the Korean War. 
   Finally, a key section of this bill would help spread news of the Bring Them Home Alive Act around the world. This is needed to help make sure that the key foreign nationals who need to hear about this act, do so. My bill calls on the International Broadcasting Bureau to use its assets, including Worldnet Television and its Internet sites, to spread the news. The bill also calls on Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia to participate. 
   If this bill leads to even one long-held POW/MIA being returned home to America alive, this effort will be well worth it, 10,000 times over. Even though it has been many years since these two wars ended, they have not ended for any Americans who may have been left behind and are still alive. As long as there remains even the remotest possibility that there may be any surviving POWs, we owe it to our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines, and their families, to do everything possible to bring them home alive. This is the least we can do after all they have sacrificed. 
   Key groups involved in Veterans and POW/MIA issues have endorsed this legislation, including the National Vietnam & Gulf War Veterans Coalition, the VietNow National POW/MIA Committee, and the Coalition of Families of Korean and Cold War POW/MIAs. Naturally, I welcome any additional endorsements that any of the other important organizations involved in POW/MIA related issues may wish to provide.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. Chief Justice and colleagues, my friends, I am not going to try to dazzle you with my knowledge of the law which is minimal, or the forty hand-written pages I've taken during these proceedings. But, I signed the same oath you did with a pen that should have had on it ``United States Senate,'' but did not. It said, ``Untied States Senate.'' 
   We were asked to turn the pens back in. I heard they are going to be valuable collectors' items, and I am not turning mine in. I want to see what it's worth. 
   And there you have it. An imperfect Senator being asked to judge an imperfect President. 
   One of our colleagues noted yesterday that we all come from different backgrounds. It's true and, perhaps, I am living proof that the greatness of this nation because I could be here at all. 
   The same body where someone named Daniel Webster, John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman once served also welcomed a mixed blood kid from the wrong side of the tracks. The offspring of an alcoholic father and a tubercular mother; in and out of orphanages; a law breaker and high school drop out who lied, cheated, stole and did many other shameful things make me a poor judge indeed of someone else who used poor judgment. 
   I would rather take a beating than to judge someone else for their indiscretions. But, as one of our colleagues said yesterday, ``We didn't ask for this.'' 
   Still, with all my own human failings, I, like you, must try to separate them from the rule of law. I wish I had the historical knowledge of Senator BYRD or the legal knowledge of ORRIN HATCH or the government experience of JOHN WARNER. But, I don't--I must use common sense. 
   I want to tell you an anecdote--about a conversation I had with the President right after he made his rather startling confession before this nation and a group of reverends which I watched from my Denver office as millions of others were also watching at the same time. 
   I was so moved by his statement that I wrote him a personal note telling him how sorry I was for what his family was going through. I told him I would not be one to pile on; that I would make no statements to the press; nor would I be a party to the impeachment process going on in the other body. 
   As I look around this room, I see several others who subscribed to that same conduct as this proceeding moved to the Senate and took on soap opera proportions, and members of both parties ran pell mell to the cameras at each recess. 
   I sit right there in the back row fifteen feet from the cloakroom. But, at each recess by the time I walk to the cloakroom and glance at the TV, some of my colleagues have already sprinted somewhere else to be in front of the cameras. As you know, I used to be on the U.S. Olympic Team, and I tell 
   my speedy friends--you could have made the team. 
   About three days after I wrote to the President, he called me to thank me for my note and we spoke for about 15 minutes. I asked him how his family was dealing with it and he told me they were having good days and bad, but it was hardest on his daughter, Chelsea, because she was away at college without the family unit to console her. He told me he would keep my note always. I felt badly then, and I do now. 
   As I look around this room in which so many great people in our history have spoken and I read their names written in the desk drawers along with those who no one remembers, I tell you that I like this President. 
   He came through a difficult childhood as I did, and I genuinely like him and feel sorry for both him and his family. But after agonizing as many of my Senate friends have, I remember the first question my then nine-year-old son, Colin, asked me 17 years ago when I told him I was going to run for public office. He asked, ``Dad, are you going to lie and stuff?'' 
   I told him, ``No.'' I don't have to learn how to lie--I still remembered how to lie from my delinquent days. I'm still trying to forget it. 
   I told him, human frailties not withstanding, elected officials should not ``lie and stuff.'' 
   Every one of us knows that when we step into the public arena, we are judged by a different standard. Being honest and truthful becomes more important because we must set the examples. 
   As a senator, if I ever forget it, this body will not have to throw me out because I will have brought it on myself, and I'll save this body the time and expense and resign. 
   I would not fear being thrown out. When I was young and not yet house-broken, I was thrown out of a lot of places. I swore a lot of oaths--not when I went in, but when I came out. 
   There is a difference: one is about anger in private--the other is about honor in public. If we are not going to honor our oath, why don't we get rid of it and have an every-man-for-himself kind of elected official? 
   Better yet, let's change it. Mr. Chief Justice, you could say: ``Senators-elect. Raise your right hand and repeat after me: `On my honor, I'll do my best, to help myself and lie like the rest.'' 
   I took a solemn oath--perhaps it is the only thing in common I share with John F. Kennedy, Harry Truman and Daniel Webster as well as the founders of this nation--and that is why honoring it is all the more important to me. 
   Simply speaking, the President did, too. And, so even though I like him personally, I find I can only vote one way. And that is guilty on both articles. 
   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a Senate Concurrent Resolution which addresses the controversy surrounding the Food Quality Protection Act. I am pleased to be joined today by my colleagues, Senators CONRAD, BROWNBACK, HUTCHISON, FRIST, GRAMM of Texas, LANDRIEU, and HUTCHINSON who are original cosponsors of the resolution. 
   The Food Quality Protection Act directs the EPA to base its tolerance review decisions pertaining to pesticides on reliable data that is currently available. Or, the EPA can require the development of new data through the  data call-in provisions of the Food Quality Protection Act. 
   In order to meet the review deadlines, the EPA is basing some critical decisions on assumptions, which are primarily EPA's preliminary findings. This could lead to needless and questionable product cancellations, and have a significant impact on the agricultural industry. 
   It is essential that the EPA's insect tolerance assessment process be based on sound scientific data. If the EPA's current approach to pesticide risk assessments is not modified, it is likely that many uses of crop protection products will be unjustifiably terminated. The sudden adoption of new restrictions of certain pesticide applications and products could needlessly cripple a host of agricultural commodities, including corn; soybeans; wheat; rice; cotton; and dozens of fruit and vegetable crops. It could also add a public health threat to the urban environment from mosquitos, cockroaches, and termites that might go unchecked. American farmers, ranchers, and consumers will feel the unnecessary and avoidable repercussions of the EPA's actions. 
   We all know pesticide use must be closely monitored and some pesticides need to be replaced. The protection of the environment must always be foremost in our minds. But, common sense and real science must be involved in this matter so that all parties will benefit. Certain pesticides that warrant replacement or removal must have suitable, affordable, and effective replacements. And, any changes must be made in a sufficient time frame to allow producers to learn the safe use of the new products as they transition away from old dated products. 
   Also, the current Food Quality Protection Act puts the United States at a distinct disadvantage in the global marketplace. Other countries do not have the same requirements that our producers have, but we still import and consume their products. We need to offer every advantage to our producers and safeguard consumers instead of providing other countries an upper hand in the world's agricultural market. 
   To address this issue, the resolution I introduce today expresses the sense and intent of Congress for the fair and equitable implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. The resolution calls on the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture to use sound science to protect the public health while effectively administering the Food Quality Protection Act. 
   Some important organizations have endorsed my resolution, including the Colorado Farm Bureau and the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union. 
   We must modify the enforcement mechanisms in the Food Quality Protection Act to ensure the act is properly implemented, so that it can help, not hurt the people and our environment it was intended to protect. The resolution I submit today will help accomplish this goal, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Buffalo Nickel Coin Act, a bill based on legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress, S. 1112 and Senate Amendment 3013. This bill authorizes the minting of a limited-edition commemorative coin, based on the design of the original Buffalo Nickel, which was in circulation from 1913 to 1938. It also directs the dedication of profits from the sale of the coin to the construction of the Smithsonian's Museum of the Native American. This bill is in compliance with USC Title 31, the Commemorative Coin Act. 
   In February 1998, I presented the design of the coin to the Mint and provided testimony regarding the history of the nickel and its design. Former Ambassador to Austria and Colorado buffalo rancher, Swanee Hunt, joined me at this presentation to share her support. 
   Since then I have been working closely with officials at the Treasury and the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. The recommendation of the Committee is necessary in order to bring the coin into circulation. In their 1998 annual report, the Committee approved the minting of a half-dollar coin, based on the design of the Buffalo Nickel, which will go into circulation in 2001. The Committee's recommendation to put the coin into circulation in 2001 will coincide well with the Museum's scheduled opening date of 2002. 
   This legislation reflects the goals of all interested parties, and still maintains the original goal of raising funds for the preservation of Native American artifacts in the Museum of the American Indian. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Indian Gaming Regulatory Improvement Act of 1999, co-sponsored by Senator INOUYE, to address two critical elements related to the federal component of Indian gaming regulation. 
   With any legislation affecting Indian gaming, it is important to keep in mind the aims of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA): ensuring that gaming continues to be a tool for Indian economic development, and ensuring that the games conducted are kept free from corrupting forces to maintain the integrity of the industry. 
   First, this bill provides necessary reforms in the area of gaming regulation by requiring that the National Indian Gaming Commission and the gaming tribes themselves, develop and implement a system of minimum internal control, background investigation and licensing standards for all tribes that operate class II and class III gaming. 
   My intention in proposing these standards is to guarantee that gaming is conducted in a safe and fair manner at every tribal gaming facility in the United States not only to preserve gaming integrity but to provide certainty and security to the consumers of Indian gaming. 
   Second, this legislation provides that the fees assessed are used only for the regulatory activities of the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) by requiring that all fees be paid into a trust fund, which may only be accessed by the NIGC for purposes approved by Congress. 
   The existing federal Indian gaming law was passed by Congress more than ten years ago. At that time, gaming was a small industry, consisting mainly of high stakes bingo operations, termed ``class II'' gaming under the statute. 
   In 1988, virtually no one contemplated that gaming would become the billion dollar industry that exists today, providing tribes with much needed capital for development and employment opportunities where none previously existed. 
   Because of gaming, some tribes have been wildly successful, fortunate because of their geographical location. These tribes employ thousands of people, both Indian and non-Indian, and have greatly reduced the welfare rolls in their local area. 
   Though gaming revenues have exploded in the last ten years, the IGRA has been significantly amended only one time. In 1997, I introduced an  amendment that would allow the NIGC to assess fees against casino-style gaming operations, termed ``class III'' gaming under the statute, and to fund its regulatory efforts in Indian Country. 
   Mr. President, these additional fees are necessary to ensure meaningful federal involvement in the regulation of class III gaming. As of January 1, 1998, approximately 77% of NIGC-approved management contracts were for class III operations. In 1997, the NIGC processed some 18,000 fingerprint cards and 21,000 investigative reports. The Commission also approved some 241 tribal gaming ordinances and, importantly, took 53 formal enforcement actions. The vast majority of these enforcement actions were issued against class III operations. Most striking, before the 1997 amendment was enacted, the NIGC employed only 7 investigators who were responsible for monitoring the entire Indian gaming industry. 
   The 1997 amendment has enabled the NIGC to take steps to increase its regulation and enforcement efforts. Additionally, the Commission has been able to hire much-needed field investigators who are personally responsible for monitoring local tribal gaming operations. The Commission should be applauded for these activities. 
   What these facts and figures do not reveal, however, is the significant amount of tribal and joint tribal-state regulatory activities undertaken at the local level. It should be noted that many Indian tribes, often working with the states where gaming is located, have developed sophisticated regulatory frameworks for their gaming operations. 
   Many of those tribes have put in place standards regarding rules of play for their games, as well as financial and accounting standards for their operations. They are significant and for many tribes contribute the bulk of regulatory activities under the IGRA. 
   The amendment I propose today would require the NIGC, prior to assessing any fee against an Indian gaming operation, to determine the nature and level of any such tribal or joint tribal-state regulatory activities and to reduce the fees assessed accordingly. 
   The goals of this provision are two-fold: to provide the NIGC with the resources it needs to carry out its obligations under the IGRA, but to recognize the often significant regulatory activities at the local level. 
   It is important for us to keep these facts, and the goals of the gaming statute, in mind. Where gaming exists, it provides a great opportunity for tribes to develop other business and development projects. However, it must be our goal, and it is my mission, to assist the tribes in the development of their economies through clean and efficient gaming operations. 
   I urge my colleagues to support these reasonable and necessary amendments.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in 1996 Congress enacted historic legislation involving the financing, construction, and maintenance of housing for American Indians and Alaska Natives. With this initiative, called the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA), decisions regarding Indian housing are no longer solely a matter for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
   Consistent with principles of local autonomy and Indian self-determination, NAHASDA enables tribes--for the first time--to develop and implement housing plans that meet their needs, and in a way that is more efficient. The Act requires that funds for Indian housing be provided to Indian tribes in housing block grants with monitoring and oversight provided by HUD. 
   I am hopeful that the successes achieved by tribes who participate in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Act and the Tribal Self-Governance Act can now be duplicated in the housing arena with the implementation of NAHASDA. With housing as the anchor for community development, we can turn our attention to other initiatives such as banking, business development, and infrastructure construction. 
   NAHASDA became effective October 1, 1997. In implementing the Act both HUD and the tribes have told us that there are provisions in the statute in need of clarification. I would like to cite two examples. 
   Prior to the passage of NAHASDA, Indian tribes receiving HOME block grant funds could use those funds to leverage low income housing tax credits. Unlike HOME funds, block grants to tribes under the new NAHASDA are considered ``federal funds'' and cannot be used to access these tax credits. 
   Therefore, tribes cannot use designated new block grant funds to access a program which they formerly could is an unintended consequence affecting housing development in Indian country. This bill would restore tribal eligibility for the low income housing tax credit by placing NAHASDA funds on the same footing as HOME funds, with no change to current low income housing tax credit programs. 
   In addition, there are conflicting provisions in the statute with regard to the authority of the HUD Secretary to enforce the act against non-compliant entities. This bill clarifies that authority and provides clear guidance for the Secretary in such instances. 
   Tribal leaders, Indian housing experts, and federal officials testified at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in March 1997 about funding and other anticipated problems, including achieving the appropriate level of oversight and monitoring. The focus of the hearing was constructive and encouraged all parties to work for a better managed and more efficient Indian housing system. 
   The bill I am introducing today, joined by Senator INOUYE, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act Amendments of 1999, provides the required clarification and changes that will help the tribes and HUD in achieving a smoother transition from the old housing regime to the new framework of NAHASDA. 
   In the last session, I originally introduced a bill identical to this legislation, S.1280, and I am hopeful that these amendments can be enacted this year. 
   As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs I am committed to ensuring that funds for Indian housing are used efficiently, properly and within the bounds provided by law. I also want to ensure that, consistent with the federal obligation to Indian tribes, tribal members have safe, decent, and affordable housing. That is the goal of NAHASDA and that is the policy of this Congress. 
   I am confident that the implementation of NAHASDA has given tribes the  ability to better design and implement their own housing plans and in the process provide better housing opportunities to their tribal members. In making the transition from dominating the housing realm to monitoring the activities of the tribes, HUD needs guidance from the Committee as to its proper role and responsibilities under the Act. 
   The Act, and the amendments I am proposing today, will go a long way in making sure that the management problems that were associated with the old, HUD-dominated housing system will be eliminated, paving the way for more and better housing for American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting these reasonable and necessary amendments.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill to assist Indians and tribal businesses to foster entrepreneurship and healthy reservation economies. I am pleased to be joined by Senator INOUYE. As we stand ready to enter the next century, Indian tribes and their members continue to face many challenges--poor health, substandard housing and educational facilities, substance abuse, and a host of other social and economic problems. 
   A top priority for the Committee on Indian Affairs and me in the next two years will be to help tribal governments build stronger and healthier economies to provide jobs and hope to their members. 
   The results of centuries of federal domination of Indian affairs and Indian economies is predictable: stagnant reservation economies and the absence of a private sector to create the kind of job opportunities and business-creating activities that Indians so desperately need. 
   Despite the popular myth that ``all Indians are rich'' from gambling, the realities of life for the great majority of Native Americans are harsh and have shown little sign of improvement in recent years. In the Great Depression of the 1930s, the national unemployment rate was 25 percent, and it was a national crisis. 
   In 1999, Indian country has a collective unemployment rate running at 50% and there are few comments made, little urgency heard, and very little being done to address the problem. We sympathize, as we should, with Third World countries torn by strife and lack of economic development. We provide loan guarantees, technical assistance, and aid and trade. 
   For Indians, the response is usually that ``they should just get a job''. The fact is there are few if any job opportunities on most Indian lands in this nation. 
   The requirement that people on federal assistance get and keep a job is the long-term goal of the 1996 welfare reform laws, and frankly, the tribes are behind the curve in preparing for the full implementation of the law. The goal of the legislation I introduce today and other bills this session will be on helping attract capital and value-added activities to Indian lands in such fields as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, livestock and fisheries, high technology and electronic commerce, arts and crafts and a host of service industries. 
   This bill aims to make best use of existing programs to provide the necessary tools to tribes to attract and retain capital and employment. The model I am encouraging with this bill has proven highly successful in the self governance arena and in the Indian job training program, known as the ``477 program''. 
   By providing for an efficient coordination of existing business development programs in the Commerce Department and maximizing resources  available to tribes, this bill is a first step toward better cooperation between and within agencies across the federal government. 
   Building healthy Indian economies will require efforts by the tribal as well as the federal government. The tribes have a responsibility as well. A fundamental principle of Indian self determination requires that the tribes play a greater role in their own affairs. In many areas such as self governance, the tribes are increasingly administering federal services, programs, and activities in lieu of the federal government. This has led to more capable and accountable tribal governments. 
   A corollary of Indian political self government is a reduction in the dependence on the federal bureaucracy and federal funds, through assuming a greater role in the tribes funding their own government activities. A number of tribes are achieving some success in reaching this stage, and it should be our policy to assist more tribes in achieving this transition from federal to tribal-domination of tribal affairs. 
   Under this bill, the Native American Business Development Office (NABDO) will coordinate existing programs within the Department of Commerce, including those geared to encouraging American businesses in the fields of international trade and tourism. 
   I want to be clear: this bill does not create any new programs but will achieve more efficiency in those that already exist, and within existing budget authority. Because the central aim of the legislation is to encourage non-gaming development, the bill also prohibits assistance under the act from being used for gaming on Indian lands. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in providing the tools necessary to build strong and diversified Indian economies so that tribal members have the same job opportunities enjoyed by other Americans.

Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each committee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the Committee and to publish those rules in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD not later than March 1 of the first year of each Congress. On January 6, 1999, the Committee on Indian Affairs held a business meeting during which the members of the Committee unanimously adopted rules to govern the procedures of the Committee. Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, today I am submitting for printing in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a copy of the Rules of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I recognize the members of the World Champion Denver Broncos of the National Football League and their stunning Super Bowl victory this past weekend. 
   For the second consecutive year, the Denver Broncos have proven the value of dedication, preparation and execution as they played through the regular football season, into the playoffs and in the league championship, Super Bowl XXXIII. 
   I would also like to recognize the Atlanta Falcons for a terrific season. They deserve praise for their efforts and a well fought game. Few gave them a chance to make it as far as they did; but, they proved to everyone that they are a team of the future. 
   Most folks know how close the Denver Broncos came during the past season to going undefeated. In addition, the Denver Bronco players and the entire organization won more games during the three most recent seasons than any other NFL team. Great teams are measured by sustained success and by any measure, the Denver Broncos rank among the greatest teams in history. For the first time in nearly 20 years the Broncos, an American Football Conference team, won back to back Super Bowls. A total team effort was exemplified by the Denver Broncos this season. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to recognize several members of the Denver Broncos organization for their outstanding achievements during this past season. Specifically, Owner Pat Bowlen and Head Coach Mike Shanahan for their proven ability to assemble the necessary players and develop game plans that consistently provide victories for this franchise; Quarterback John Elway, Super Bowl XXXIII's Most Valuable Player and a consistent Pro Bowl caliber quarterback who for 16 seasons has been the uncontested leader of the Denver Broncos and a valuable civic leader and role model for young Americans; and running back Terrell Davis, the NFL's Most Valuable Player for the 1998-99 season. 
   These people are the most recognizable names in the Broncos' organization and are major contributors to the Broncos' success. But, like in my office, the total team effort is what made the Broncos victorious. The entire team worked together and went after and achieved a common goal. Each team member deserves to be recognized and I will mention them in numerical order: Jason Elam, Bubby Brister, Brian Griese, Tom Rouen, Tory James, Darrien Gordon, Vaughn Hebron, Darrius Johnson, Eric Brown, Steve Atwater, Tito Paul, Howard Griffith, Derek Loville, Tyrone Braxton, Anthony Lynn, Ray Crockett, Detron Smith, George Coghill, John Mobley, Bill Romanowski, Nate Wayne, Keith Burns, Glenn Cadrez, K.C. Johns, Dan Neil, David Diaz-Infante, Tom Nalen, Mark Schlereth, Trey Teague, Cyron Brown, Harry Swayne, Tony Jones, Matt Lepsis, Chris Banks, Rod Smith, Marcus Nash, Justin Armour, Shannon Sharpe, Willie Green, Byron Chamberlain, Ed McCaffrey, Dwayne Carswell, Neil Smith, Alfred Williams, Trevor Pryce, Keith Traylor, Marvin Washington, Harald Hasselbach, Mike Lodish, Maa Tanuvasa, Seth Joyner, Steve Russ, Jeff Lewis, Chris Gizzi, Andre Cooper, Tori Noel, Curtis Alexander, Viliami Maumau, Marvin Thomas; and the coaching staff, Frank Bush, Barney Chavous, Rick Dennison, Ed Donatell, George Dyer, Alex Gibbs, Mike Heimerdinger, Gary Kubiak, Pat McPherson, Brian Pariani, Ricky Porter, Greg Robinson, Greg Saporta, Rick Smith, John Teerlinck, Bobby Turner, and Rich Tuten. 
   Many people also underestimated the strength of the Denver Broncos' defense. When push came to shove, the defense kept the second best running back in the game this season from gaining 100 rushing yards and intercepted three passes from the opposing quarterback in the Super Bowl. Defense wins championships, and Denver's defense proved this to be true. 
   Mr. President, the offensive line needs to be recognized for an outstanding effort--season after season. The reason the Denver Broncos running and passing attack was so dominant was, in large part, due to the efforts of the offensive line. 
   The Denver Broncos have come a long way since their introduction into the American Football League in 1960, with their mustard and brown vertical striped socks, to the Denver Broncos of today which have dominated the NFL with two consecutive world championships. 
   It is a special honor for me to make a Senate floor statement for the second year in a row to congratulate the Denver Broncos. Today I invite my Senate colleagues to join me in a Mile High Salute to the World Champion Denver Broncos.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the National Park Service Commercial Filming Permit Fee Act of 1999. This bill gives the National Park Service (NPS) and the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) the authority to require fee-based permits for the use of Park Service and National Wildlife Reserve lands in the production of motion pictures, television programs, advertisements or other similar commercial purposes. This bill is based on legislation which I introduced in the 105th Congress, S. 1614. 
   Our National Parks are among our nation's most valuable resources. The National Park Service Commercial Filming Permit Fee Act of 1999 would help us to protect them and ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy their beauty by making sure the parks are reimbursed for their commercial use. 
   The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service already have a similar permit and fee system for commercial filming on public lands. It doesn't make sense that our National Parks, which have been deemed to be even more precious by their designation, should be used commercially for free. This is especially important now when taxpayers are facing increased fees to enter the national parks and more people are enjoying our natural wonders every year in record numbers. 
   My bill allows the National Park Service to collect a fair return fee when the American peoples' parks are used in these commercial media ventures and then devotes those fees to the preservation of our National Parks. Common sense directs us to do this, and I believe this bill is fair for the commercial users of our National Parks, and more importantly, for the American taxpayers. 
   This bill builds upon progress made through hearings, conferences, and other valuable input received during the 105th Congress. The revised legislative language reflects input from the administration, industry groups--including the Motion Picture Association of America--and public interest groups such as the National Parks and Conservation Association. This bill is similar to legislation that my friend and colleague from Colorado, Congressman HEFLEY, introduced in the 105th and reintroduced in the 106th Congress as H.R. 154.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would amend the ``Flag Code'' to add the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday to the list of days on which the American flag should be displayed nationwide. 
   It is a testament to the greatness of Martin Luther King, Jr., that nearly every major city in the U.S. has a street or school named after him. I have to admit, I was surprised to learn that the American flag was not flown to commemorate the Dr. King holiday. 
   Dr. King, a minister, prolific writer and Nobel Prize winner originated the nonviolence strategy within the activist civil rights movement. He was one of the most important black leaders of his era and in American history. 
   When Dr. King was tragically assassinated on April 4, 1968, he had already transformed himself as a national hero and a pioneer in trying to unite a divided nation. He strove to build communities of hope and opportunity for  all and recognized that all Americans must be free to truly have a great country. 
   Dr. King was a person who wanted all people to get along regardless of their race, color or creed. His holiday came about due to the work of many determined people who wanted all of us to pause to remember his legacy. 
   This legislation simply would make sure that we celebrate his birthday as a federal holiday in the fashion afforded to other great Americans whose birthdays are cause for national commemoration. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to create the Black Canyon National Park. This bill is based on legislation which I introduced in the 104th Congress, but has been revised to include additional input from the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. In 1996, as the former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation, I conducted a field hearing and received input from local groups and individuals which I also incorporated into my new bill. 
   With its narrow opening, sheer walls, and scenic depths, the Black Canyon is a jewel in North America. Nearly everyone who has visited the site is struck by the breathtaking beauty of this 2,000 foot deep, nearly impenetrable canyon. The canyon is also home to a vast assortment of wildlife that range from chipmunks to black bear, from bobcats to coyotes. Its unique combination of geologic features makes the Black Canyon deserving of National Park status. 
   This legislation has been a long time coming to the State of Colorado, and in particular, the Western Slope of my state. My Black Canyon bill incorporates the input of the federal agencies involved and, in my view, represents an innovative approach to protecting unique natural resources for future generations in the most fiscally responsible manner possible. 
   This legislation does far more than simply create a new national park from what is now a national monument. This legislation establishes a cooperative approach to managing this natural resource and calls on all affected resource management agencies in the area to play key collaborative roles. 
   I want to stress that this legislation does not increase federal expenditures, and the collective management approach this legislation creates does not in any way require, imply, or contemplate an attempt by the Federal Government to usurp state water rights, state water law, or intrude upon private property rights. 
   The Secretary of the Interior will manage the entire area and will be able to utilize all available fiscal and human resources in the administration and management of this natural resource in a unique, money-saving manner. This legislation will also eliminate duplicate operations and form a coordinated, efficient and fiscally responsible management structure.

    Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1999. This bill addresses one of the most troubling and persistent consumer abuse issues we face today: highly deceptive, and all too often financially damaging, sweepstakes and other mass mail promotions. 
   Our nation's seniors and other vulnerable consumers are clearly being taken advantage of, and in some cases seriously financially harmed, by intentionally misleading sweepstakes promotions. Thousands of nationwide victims are being deliberately misled into believing that they have just won or are likely to win a sweepstakes when in fact they have neither won nor are in fact likely to win such a prize. 
   Each year American consumers also receive hundreds of millions of cashier's check look-alikes that deceptively masquerade as real cashier's checks while actually being worthless. These ploys unfairly prey upon some people's hopes and dreams. 
   Over the years sweepstakes have become increasingly sophisticated and deceptive. While these promotional tactics may be technically legal they are designed to skirt the intentions and outer limits of the law. These deceptive tactics run counter to core American values of honesty and forthrightness. There is abundant evidence, including the deceptive sweepstakes and other promotions each of us receives in our mailboxes on a regular basis, that current laws aimed at stopping these deceptive promotions simply are not working. Something needs to be done. 
   This bill addresses these deceptive sweepstakes and cashier's checks look-alikes by requiring up-front, clear and easy to read Honesty in Sweepstakes disclosures that will help protect consumers by counterbalancing false promises and deception. While honest and straight-forward sweepstakes promoters have nothing to fear from this bill, those promotions that revert to false and deceptive tactics will feel the heat. 
   The Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1999 is a refined version of my original legislation, S. 2141, that I introduced during the 105th Congress. The bill I am introducing today incorporates valuable input I received during a Senate hearing on S.2141 and from productive discussions and negotiations involving key interested parties. Included among those who have made valuable contributions are: my Senate colleagues; the U.S. Postal Service; the General Accounting Office; Attorneys General from several states including Colorado, Florida, Michigan and New York; the American Association of Retired Persons; the Consumer Federation of America; the National Consumers League; the Direct Marketing Association; the Magazine Publishers of America and other industry representatives and experts. I want to thank them for their contributions to the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1999. 
   The AARP has informed me that ``Research has shown that older Americans may be particularly vulnerable to techniques used by sweepstakes companies. At times they end up purchasing products that they do not want in the hopes of improving their chances of winning. Additionally, it has been shown that participation in these sweepstakes can lead to a rise in the number of telemarketing calls a person receives as well as an increase in mailed solicitations.'' 
   The Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1999 will go a long way toward protecting our nation's seniors and other vulnerable consumers from misleading and deceptive sweepstakes promotions. The most vulnerable consumers among us deserve this protection. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that I feel is of vital importance to farmers and family business owners, the Estate and Gift Tax Rate Reduction Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senators MACK and HUTCHISON. 
   This bill is based on legislation I introduced last year, S. 2318. Unfortunately, the 105th Congress adjourned before we could debate and pass this bill. Since then, I have heard from numerous Coloradans and national organizations and am fully aware that the problems the bill would correct still exist. 
   Estate and gift taxes remain a burden of American families, particularly those who pursue the American dream of owning their own business. This is because family-owned businesses and farms are hit with the highest tax rate when they are handed down to descendants--often immediately following the death of a loved one. These taxes, and the financial burdens and difficulties they create come at the worst possible time. Making a terrible situation worse is the fact that the rate of this estate tax is crushing, reaching as high as 55 percent for the highest bracket. That's higher than even the highest income tax rate bracket of 39 percent. Furthermore, the tax is due as soon as the business is turned over to the heir, allowing no time for financial planning or the setting aside of money to pay the tax bills. Estate and gift taxes right now are one of the leading reasons why the number of family-owned farms and businesses are declining; the burden of this tax is just too much. 
   This tax sends the troubling message that families should either sell the business while they are still alive, in order to spare their descendants this huge tax after their passing, or run-down the value of the business, so that it won't make it into their higher tax brackets. Whichever the case may be, it hardly seems to encourage private investment and initiative, which have always been such a strong part of our American heritage. 
   That is why I again introduce this bill. It will gradually eliminate this tax by phasing it out--reducing the amount of the tax 5% each year, beginning with the highest rate bracket 55%, until the tax rate reaches zero. Several states have already adopted similar plans, and I believe we ought to follow their example. We need to change the message we are sending to farmers and family business owners. Leading organizations agree, and have endorsed this legislation. In fact, over 100 organizations, like the National Federation of Independent Business and the Farm Bureau, have joined together to form the Family Business Estate Tax Coalition, which strongly endorses the bill. 
   Mr. President, this tax should be eliminated across the board, and I ask my colleagues' help in working to achieve that goal.

   Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am joined with my colleagues in submitting this resolution to keep alive in the memory of all Americans, the sacrifice and commitment of those  men and women who lost their lives while serving as law enforcement officers. Specifically, this resolution would designate May 15, 1999, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. 
   Currently, more than 700,000 men and women who serve this nation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Every year, about 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 officers is injured, and 1 in 4,400 officers is killed in the line of duty. There are few communities in this country that have not been impacted by the senseless death of a police officer. 
   In 1998, over 158 federal, state and local law enforcement officers have given their lives in the line of duty and nearly 15,000 men and women have made that supreme sacrifice. And, our Capitol community as well as the nation were shocked and saddened last year by the tragic and senseless shooting of Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut and Special Agent John Gibson. 
   According to National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund Chairman Craig W. Floyd,  
   Since crime began its steady downward slide in 1992, more than 1,100 federal, state and local law enforcement officers have lost their lives in the performance of duty. That averages out to 158 police deaths each year, or one officer killed somewhere in America roughly every 54 hours.  
   As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law enforcement officers face every day on the front lines protecting our communities. Last year for example, in Cortez, Colorado, police officer Dale Claxton was fatally shot through the windshield of his patrol car after stopping a stolen truck. Officer Claxton was tragically and prematurely taken away from his wife and four children. Today, two of the three suspects are still at large, even after an extensive manhunt. 
   On May 15, 1999, more than 15,000 peace officers are expected to gather in our Nation's Capital to join with the families of their fallen comrades, past and present, who by their faithful and loyal devotion to their responsibilities have rendered a dedicated service to their communities and, in doing so, have established for themselves an enviable and enduring reputation for preserving the rights and security of all citizens. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important resolution.
