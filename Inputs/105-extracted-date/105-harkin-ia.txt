Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the legislation that is pending provides funding for nearly all domestic discretionary programs for the upcoming year. As we know, it combines 8 of the 13 regular spending bills, as well as a large number of other unrelated legislative provisions. 
It truly is a legislative behemoth, and is one which I have very mixed feelings about. One part I don't have any mixed feelings about is the process, particularly for the unrelated nonappropriation measures. It is the worst that I have witnessed in my years in Congress. Here we have a 40-pound, nearly 4,000-page bill which not only includes over half of the year's appropriations bills, but countless other unrelated measures, many of which were never debated and never brought to the floor of the Senate. Then we are given less than a day--just a matter of hours--to look it over. 
That certainly is not any way to do the people's business. In fact, I say that the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House has shown a tremendous disrespect for the taxpayers' dollars. 
This is really a cavalier treatment of taxpayers dollars when you think about the way this bill was put together. Nobody knows how much is in there. Billions of dollars are being spent, and a lot of it was never debated or shown the light of day in either the House or the Senate. The taxpayers deserve a little bit better treatment for their tax dollars than that. 
Before I get into my other concerns, I want to speak about what I see as one of the true bright spots, which will lead me to vote in favor of the overall measure, even with all my misgivings about it, and that is the progress it makes toward improving the quality and affordability of education, health care and job training for American families. 
As the ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of Health and Human Services and Education, I want to focus my comments initially on that section of the bill. 
First, I want to thank Senator Specter for his outstanding leadership on the legislation. He has worked tirelessly to put together a strong, bipartisan bill. I want to publicly thank Bettilou Taylor, Jim Sourwine, Jack Chow, Mary Deitrich, Mark Laisch and Jennifer Stiefel. I also thank those on my staff, on the minority side--Marsha Simon and Ellen Murray--for their long and hard work in taking care of all of the important details of the legislation. They literally have been here around the clock for the last several weeks putting the bill and report together. 
I also extend my sincere appreciation to our colleagues in the House--Chairman Porter and ranking member Obey. There were many significant differences between our two bills and it required much work to bridge the gulf. I appreciate their willingness to work with us to craft a strong Labor-HHS-Education bill to send to the President. 
The Labor-HHS-Education component of this bill is notable in a number of areas. It makes many vital investments in the human infrastructure of our Nation. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased that the bill before us provides the biggest funding increase in history in our search for medical breakthroughs. Almost every day, the paper has a new story about one advance or another in medical research. New therapies, more effective intervention and treatment strategies--we are making great progress. We aren't suffering from a shortfall of ideas, but a shortfall of resources. 
At the present time, the National Institutes of Health is able to fund only one-fourth of their peer-reviewed grant proposals. As a result, too many worthy projects never get off the ground. The tragedy is that the 3 of 4 unfunded grants could have led to a cure for breast cancer, or a more effective treatment for Parkinson's disease, or a way to reverse spinal chord injury. 
This must change, and the pending legislation provides a generous 15 percent increase for the NIH and is the first step toward doubling the budget for biomedical research. 
Another important victory for improved health is the inclusion of a proposal I authored to substantially improve research on complementary and alternative medicine. Consumers need and deserve reliable information about these promising therapies. And, if appropriately implemented, the new National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH will provide just that. 
Mr. President, one of the great disappointments of the 105th Congress was the defeat by the Republican leadership of comprehensive legislation to protect children from tobacco. Their action is costly: Every day, more than 3,000 young people will start smoking, and one-third will die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases. 
I am pleased, however, that the bill before us makes at least a very modest downpayment on fighting tobacco. It provides $46 million to fund antitobacco activities--the largest increase for preventing and treating the addiction, disease, and death caused by tobacco use. The CDC will receive additional funding to help communities keep tobacco products out of the hands of children, help smokers kick the habit, and combat the tobacco industry's daily multimillion dollar misinformation campaigns. 
I want to be clear, however, that this is by no means a replacement for comprehensive reform. We should make reform of the tobacco scourge a major agenda item for the next Congress. 
Another important drug problem--and tobacco is a drug problem--facing us in this Nation is the scourge of methamphetamine. It is ravaging my State and other States in the Midwest. So I am pleased that the bill before us includes my proposal to expand support for prevention and treatment of meth addiction. It also contains a significant increase to boost our law enforcement efforts to combat this problem. But I am extremely disappointed that the leadership blocked inclusion of my Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act. Their action, I think, is extremely shortsighted and is a defeat for our efforts to get tougher on methamphetamine. 
The bill before us includes the important initiative to combat fraud, waste and abuse in Medicare. It would expand nationwide a program I started 2 years ago to train retired nurses, doctors, accountants, insurance writers, and other professionals to be expert resources in their local communities to help fellow seniors identify and report suspect cases of abuse. The Senior Waste Patrol, as it is known, has been a great success in Iowa and the 11 other States in which it now exists on a pilot program basis. This bill, as I said, will extend the Senior Waste Patrol to every State in the Nation. I believe it will be one of the keys that we will have in really cutting down on the waste, fraud and abuse that is so rampant in Medicare. 
Mr. President, for the last several years, I have worked to eradicate abusive child labor around the world, and I am pleased that the legislation provides resources to help end this exploitative practice here at home and around the world. 
The bill signals a strong commitment by the United States to ending this unconscionable practice of child labor by providing a $27 million increase, from $3 million to $30 million, to the International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labor, otherwise known as IPEC. In the past, IPEC initiatives have been instrumental in reaching agreements in Bangladesh for child garment workers, and in Pakistan for the children making soccer balls. As a result, thousands of these children in both countries have been moved from factories to schools. This increase for IPEC will ensure that we can do in those countries and in other countries to get child laborers out of factories and into schools. 
However, if we intend to lead the world in ending this terrible practice of child labor, we must here lead by example. I am deeply concerned about the rising incidence of child labor in our own country. Although no official estimate exists, studies place the number of illegally employed children in the U.S. at between 300,000 a 800,000. To respond to the problem, this legislation has fully funded the President's child labor initiative by providing $15 million for migrant education and $5 million for at-risk youth in agriculture. Additionally, $4 million was added for 36 new investigators to enforce child labor laws. We must make eradication of child labor a top priority, and these resources will make that possible. 
I do want to publicly thank and compliment Secretary of Labor Herman for her leadership in this area and for her focus and determination to crack down on the use of child labor in our country. She has taken great leadership on this. The additional funding we put in this bill will enable her to do her job even more effectively. 
Mr. President, this legislation makes some significant investments in education, which are critical to the future of our country. The bill provides an additional $2.1 billion--that's $2.1 billion more than last year--to improve our Nation's schools and help them meet the needs of our schoolchildren. 
There are many problems facing our nation's schools. 14 million students attend classes in schools that are literally crumbling around them; too many students are in classes that are too big; and too many children do not have a safe place to be in the hours after school. We can and must address these important matters. 
The pending legislation provides us with a good foundation. The bill provides additional resources through the Title I program to reduce class size and it fully funds the President's after-school initiative. 
However, I was disappointed that we could not hold on to the funds provided in the Senate bill to help modernize and repair our nation's crumbling schools. 
I might add that I just came back, like so many Senators, last night from my home State to discover that in my State of Iowa over one-third--36 percent--of the elementary and secondary schools in Iowa don't even meet the fire and safety codes. I know that our State is very good. If it is that bad in Iowa, it has to be bad in other States, too. 
That is why the money is needed so desperately from the Federal Government--to help rebuild the infrastructure of our schools, not just in meeting the fire and safety codes but to make sure that they are wired, that they get the technology that they need to hookup to the Internet, and to get the technology to our kids in elementary and secondary schools. 
The legislation also makes other important investments in education. The bill provides a $500 million increase for special education and additional funds for Head Start to make sure that students are ready to start school. 
Education must be our Nation's top priority and while I am pleased with the investments made in this legislation, we must recognize that this is just the first step forward. Our future depends on us to do even more next year and the year after. 
The bill provides new funding to higher and train up to 100,000 new teachers, increases the maximum Pell grant to its highest level ever, $3,125, and provides additional resources for child care and eliminates cuts to worker protection programs. 
Mr. President, I am also pleased that the final bill restored the massive cuts contained in the House bill for the Summer Jobs Program and the Low-Income Heat and Energy Assistance Program. These cuts in the House bill--not in the Senate bill--unfairly targeted some of our Nation's most needy citizens, and had to be reversed. I am glad it was reversed. 
As has been the case in recent years, the appropriations committees was confronted with a number of legislative riders. This is a source of continuing frustration for our committee because we continue to believe there should be no authorizing legislation on appropriations bills. 
The House bill included an amendment to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, that would have given school officials expanded authorities to remove children with disabilities from school. I vigorously opposed that amendment, because it would have removed critical civil rights protections for children with disabilities--this on the heels of just a little over a year ago, after years of negotiation, when Congress enacted the 1997 amendments to IDEA. These amendments made a number of important changes to the law, including provisions governing the discipline of children with disabilities. The '97 amendments give schools new tools for addressing the behavior of children with disabilities, including more flexible authorities for removing children with disabilities engaged in misconduct involving weapons, drugs, or behavior substantially likely to result in injury. More information is needed on the implementation of these amendments before any additional changes to the law are considered by the Congress. 
For example, I keep hearing from some people that if a child with a disability brings a gun to school there is nothing they can do with them, but if a nondisabled kid brought a gun to school they could expel them. Nothing could be further from the truth. If any child, such as a child with disabilities, under IDEA brings a gun, a weapon, a drug to school, they can be immediately dismissed, expelled, for up to 10 days, and then placed in an alternative setting for 45 more days. Again, people can expel a child right away who brings a gun or a dangerous weapon to school. 
I just say that as a way of pointing out that there is a lot of misinformation out there about the law, because the law was changed last year, and the rules and regulations have not yet been promulgated by the Department of Education. Hopefully, that will be done prior to the end of this year. 
Again, I would like to close these remarks on this section of the bill by thanking Chairman Specter for his outstanding leadership throughout the process of putting this part of the bill together. 
I therefore support the recommendation of the conferees for a GAO study on the discipline of children with disabilities in lieu of making any changes to the authorizing legislation itself. The conference agreement charges GAO with obtaining information on how the '97 amendments have affected the ability of schools to maintain safe school environments conducive to learning. In order to enable the Congress to differentiate between the need for amendments as opposed to better implementation of the law, it is critical that GAO look at the extent to which school personnel understand the provisions in the IDEA and make use of the options available under the law. 
For example, in the past, there has been considerable confusion and misunderstanding regarding the options available to school districts in disciplining children with disabilities. The GAO should determine whether schools are using the authorities currently available for removing children. These include: removing a child for up to 10 school days per incident; placing the child in an interim alternative educational setting; extending a child's placement in an interim alternative educational setting; suspending and expelling a child for behavior that is not a manifestation of the child's disability; seeking removal of the child through injunctive relief; and proposing a change in the child's placement. 
In addition, the law now explicitly requires schools to consider the need for behavioral strategies for children with behavior problems. I continue to believes that the incidence of misconduct by children with disabilities is closely related to how well these children are served, including whether they have appropriate individualized education plans, with behavioral interventions where necessary. Again, to enable the Congress to interpret information on the effect of the IDEA on dealing with misconduct, this GAO report should provide information on the extent to which the schools are appropriately addressing the needs of students engaged in this misconduct. I would be opposed to giving school officials expanded authority for removing children who engage in misconduct, if such misconduct could be ameliorated by giving these children the services to which they are entitled. We need information on the effect of appropriate implementation of the IDEA on the ability of schools to provide for safe and orderly environments, and that is what the GAO study should evaluate. 
Finally on this matter, I want to emphasize that the provisions in the IDEA for removing children are only needed in those cases in which parents and school officials disagree about a proposed disciplinary action. Therefore, it is important that the GAO study also provides us information on the extent to which parents are requesting due process hearings on discipline-related matters and the outcomes of three hearings. 
Turning to another important component of this bill, Mr. President, I'd like to talk for a few minutes about agriculture. Since early summer, I have been working, along with a number of my colleagues, to inform this body about the very serious economic crisis gripping our nation's agriculture sector and to develop an emergency assistance package. Farm families and rural communities are not currently sharing in the prosperity of our broader economy. With farm income down over 20 percent from just two years ago, our farm economy is suffering its worst downturn in over a decade. 
There are ominous signs that unless we turn this situation around, we are on the path to a full-blown agricultural depression on a scale of the 1980s farm crisis. My State of Iowa simply cannot stand to go down that road again, nor can our nation. 
So I am pleased that through our concerted efforts, this bill includes a substantial package of emergency assistance for America's farmers. 
President Clinton vetoed the first Agriculture appropriations bill. He was right to do so. It was woefully inadequate. So we brought it back. And that veto by the President set the stage for the extensive improvements that we now have in this bill. 
This bill increases funding by about 85 percent above the amount that was in the vetoed bill for assistance to replace income lost because of low commodity prices--an 85-percent increase over the bill that was vetoed. This is a victory but a partial victory. While this bill will provide a good deal of assistance in the form of a one-time payment, it falls far short of what is needed for the future. 
This bill really has been a `missed opportunity' in which we could have put underneath the so-called Freedom to Farm bill a farm income safety net, but did not. When the so-called Freedom to Farm bill was passed in 1996, commodity prices were high and the safety net was thrown out the window. But prices go down as well as go up. 
Since 1996 farm commodity prices have plummeted across our country. Now it is clear that the 1996 farm bill has failed, and has failed drastically, in protecting against disastrous losses in farm income. The bill that is before us just plows more money right into the Freedom to Farm payment system, which has already proven itself incapable of responding to low commodity prices. 
We proposed a better way. We proposed to focus assistance more carefully on farmers who really need it because of low prices. We proposed to direct the benefits towards actual farmers instead of toward landlords. We proposed to restore a farm income safety net responsive to commodity prices. And we proposed to link assistance to actual production to avoid windfalls for those choosing not to plant the supported crop. Lastly, we supported a measure of fiscal responsibility so that rising commodity prices would limit USDA farm program spending. 
Despite all of these advantages, the Republican majority rejected any alternative to the Freedom to Farm payment scheme. So what is going to happen is farmers will get a payment this fall. Even farmers who chose not to plant a crop will get a payment for it. They will get a payment having no relationship to the market price--just a flat payment across the board--fairly generous for those commodities with relatively better prices, much too little for commodities suffering the worst price losses. Also, a good number of farmers who will not be farming next year will get payments this fall, and somehow that will all have to be sorted out. 
With fixed cash payments, landlords are in a great position to put the pressure on and claim a lot of that money in the form of rent for next year. Again, farmers fortunate enough to produce a good crop and whose commodities already have high prices and who are not suffering will still get a payment. This scheme makes no sense whatsoever. And yet it is strictly the triumph of ideology over practicality. The Republican ideology is not to have any farm income safety net and if there is a crisis to throw money at it. 
So what we have done for the farm crisis is we have just thrown a lot of money at it. Well, that will help for this year, but it still won't be as good as what we proposed. Equally important, this bill does nothing toward restoring a farm income safety net for the longer term. What we proposed would have provided more income support for farmers and done so in a way that helps farmers deal with the practical reality of commodity markets. But, no, the Republican majority's ideology said we are going to stick with Freedom to Farm no matter what. And yet we know that a majority of farmers, a majority, a huge majority of the farmers wanted to take the caps off of marketing loan rates and they wanted to have some storage payments. Why? So they could take the bumper crop we are having this year, store it, wait for the grain prices to go up and market it later on. 
Well, this bill gives them nothing in this regard. Oh, they will get a payment this fall. But it will not be as much income protection as what we would have provided by taking the caps off of the marketing loan rates. Will it help? Sure, it will help. But it is a wasteful and fundamentally unsound way of helping our farmers. 
Well, as I said, Republicans just decided to throw money at the problem--a triumph of ideology over practicality. 
One last point. One of my biggest concerns about this bill is the $9 billion add-on to the Pentagon budget--$9 billion thrown in at the last minute. Despite the rhetoric from the Republican side, precious little of this fiscally irresponsible add-on is targeted at troop readiness and other emergencies in the military. 
Congressional leadership talks a lot about shortages of spare parts and about troop pay problems. So where are the proposals to fix the Pentagon's antiquated supply system? Where are the proposals to increase pay for the troops? Not in this bill. But there is $1 billion for star wars. There are billions more in pork barrel projects not requested by the Pentagon. And at the same time that this bill piles on the Pentagon pork, it is shortchanging reform. The General Accounting Office and the Pentagon's own inspector general constantly report rampant waste and mismanagement in the military's purchasing and supply system, yet this bill lets the waste and mismangement continue unchecked, and throws in a few more gold-plated weapons systems to boot. 
What a boondoggle. What a boondoggle. We talk about troop readiness, so where does this bill put the money? It puts it into star wars. It puts it into pork projects that the Pentagon doesn't want, some more gold-plated weapons systems, but precious little in fact, for troop readiness. 
I have mixed feelings about this 40-pound, 4,000-page whopper that we have before us. It has some important provisions that we worked together on in a bipartisan fashion--to improve medical research, for example, and to improve education. A number of the components of this bill truly will improve the lives of hard-working American families, but the bill also has a number of awful provisions, add-ons, fiscally irresponsible giveaways. 
In the end, I will vote for it because I believe the good does outweigh the bad, but I want to be clear that if this bill were in the many separate pieces of legislation as it should have been, a lot of them I would have voted against, and I don't think a lot of them would ever have gotten through this body. 
As I have said earlier, and as many of my colleagues have said, this process which we just went through is bad for Americans. This is no way to do the Nation's business. The Republican leadership, as I said earlier, has treated our taxpayer dollars cavalierly. This is no way to flagrantly throw around the hard-earned tax dollars of the taxpayers of this country, to throw it away on boondoggles, to throw it away on items that were never debated or saw the light of day in the Senate or the House. 
I can only hope that the next Congress will not go through this exercise again. I hope the leadership of the next Congress will get the appropriations bills through on time, will debate these matters openly so that we can have the opportunity to discuss them openly, so we will know what is in the bills before we vote on them. I think Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia said it best--as I read in the newspaper. He said, `Only God knows what's in this bill.' 
Well, I don't know, Mr. President, I don't know if we will ever know what all is in this bill, but I am certain, certain as I am standing here, we are going to see inquiring reporters, investigative journalists who will begin looking at this bill. They will begin looking at all of those hidden items, and I bet you piece by piece, bit by bit, it is going to come out, maybe next month, maybe in January, maybe in March, all of the little hidden things that were in there. And I say, shame on this Congress, shame on the leadership for treating the American taxpayers this way. We have got to do better in the way we do the Nation's business. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Campbell for his hard work, commitment, and dedication to increasing the funding level for the high-intensity drug trafficking areas in the fiscal year 1999 Treasury and General Government appropriations bill. When the Senate version of this legislation was being debated on the floor, Chairman Campbell and I worked together to increase funding for several of these areas, including an additional $3.5 million for the Midwest HIDTA. 
Mr. President, in the last three years, the Midwest has experienced a phenomenal increase in the importation, distribution, and clandestine manufacturing of methamphetamine. The region's central location, variety of interstate highway systems, along with its air and rail hubs enhance, its popularity as a market for Mexican methamphetamine trafficking operating out of the Southwest border areas. The Midwest HIDTA is integral to the strategy employed by each state to reduce methamphetamine importation, distribution, manufacturing, and related criminal activity. 
Although the conference report for the fiscal year 1999 Treasury and General Government appropriations bill did not include specific funding for each HIDTA, the conferees did include a significant increase in HIDTA funding. 
Therefore, I would like to ask the Chairman of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee if it was the intent of the conferees that a large portion of the increase in HIDTA funding should go to the areas which were specifically listed in S. 2312 as passed by the Senate. These areas include the current Midwest HIDTA, an expansion of the Midwest HIDTA to include the State of North Dakota, the Central Florida HIDTA, the Cascade HIDTA, and the Southwest Border HIDTA.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before this Congress ends, I want to bring to my colleagues' attention an important issue confronting our nation's biomedical research enterprise and its search for medical breakthroughs as we move into the next century. 
First, I want to say how pleased I am that we were able to provide the biggest increase ever for medical research this year. We worked hard to make that happen and I want to commend my colleague, Senator Arlen Specter, for his leadership and work with me on this important accomplishment. The Conference Agreement of the Fiscal 1999 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, provides a $2 billion, or 15 percent, increase for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the principal source of Federal funding for medical research conducted at our nation's universities and other research institutions. That 15 percent increase puts Congress on course to double funding for the NIH over the next five years, a target I've called for and agreed to by the Senate earlier in this Congress. 
However, as Congress embarks on this important investment in improved health, we must strengthen the totality of the biomedical research enterprise. While it is critical to focus on high quality, cutting edge basic and clinical research, we must also consider the quality of the laboratories and buildings where that research is being conducted, as well as the training of future scientists and the salaries of those scientists. 
In fact, Mr. President, the infrastructure of research institutions, including the need for new physical facilities, is central to our nation's leadership in medical research. Despite the significant scientific advances produced by Federally-funded research, most of that research is currently being done in medical facilities built in the 1950's and 1960's, a time when the Federal government obligated from $30 million to $100 million a year for facility and equipment modernization. Since then, however, annual appropriations for modernization of our biomedical research infrastructure have been greatly reduced, ranging from zero to $20 million annually over the past decade. As a result, many of our research facilities and laboratories are outdated and inadequate to meet the challenge of the next millennium. 
Over the past decade, I've worked hard both as chair and now Ranking Member of the health subcommittee to get the NIH budget increased to $15.5 billion. Yet, over that same period, support for facility and laboratory modernization totaled only $110 million. In the Fiscal 1999 appropriations bill, only 0.2 percent of the NIH budget will be directly devoted to improvement of the extramural laboratories that house NIH-funded scientists and support their research. 
As we work to double funding for medical research over the next 5 years, the already serious shortfall in the modernization of our nation's aging research facilities will grow unless we take specific action. According to the most recent National Science Foundation study of the status of biomedical research facilities (1996), 47 percent of all biomedical research-performing institutions classified the amount of biological science research space as inadequate, and 51 percent indicated that they had an inadequate amount of medical science research space. Only 45 percent of biomedical research space at research-performing institutions was considered `suitable for scientifically competitive research.' 
The 1996 NSF Report further found that 36 percent of all institutions with biomedical research space reported capital projects, involving either construction or renovation, that were needed but had to be deferred because funding was not available. The estimated costs for deferred biomedical research construction and renovation projects totaled $4.1 billion. The problem is more severe for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, where only 36 percent of their biomedical research space was rated as being suitable for use in the most competitive scientific research. 
The extramural facilities gap has been recognized by leading research organizations, the members of which have recommended a major construction and renovation funding initiative as part of any proposal to significantly increase funding for the NIH. In a March 1998 report, the Association of American Medical Colleges found that `recent advances in science have generated demand for new facilities and instruments, much of which could most rationally be provided through federal programs that are merit reviewed. The AAMC report concluded that `the government should establish and fund an NIH construction authority, consistent with the general recommendations of the Wyngaarden Committee report of 1988, which projected at that time the need for a 10-year spending plan of $5 billion for new facilities and renovation.' 
These sentiments are echoed by a June 1998 report of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), one of the leading organizations of basic researchers. The FASEB report concluded that `laboratories must be built and equipped for the science of the 21st century. Infrastructure investments should include renovation of existing space as well as new construction, where appropriate.' 
Mr. President I am committed to addressing this need. I believe future increases in federal funding for the NIH must be matched with increased funding for repair, renovation, and construction of our extramural research facilities. To this end, I plan on introducing legislation next year to significantly expand our investment in research facility modernization to assure that 21st century research is conducted in 21st century labs and facilities. And over the next year I plan to meet with patients, health professionals, and academic leaders from across the country to discuss this initiative which is so vitally important for the future of the entire medical research enterprise. 
Mr. President, this is a very exciting time in the field of biomedical research. We are on the verge of major medical breakthroughs which hold the promise of improved health and reduced costs for the people of this nation and the world. The ravage of killers like cancer, heart disease and Parkinson's and the scores of other illnesses and conditions which take the lives and health of millions of Americans can be ended if we devote the resources. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months and years to assure that this promise is realized.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Appropriations Committee and as the ranking member on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee--my chairman is the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter--we have been involved, as I am sure everyone knows, in a lot of negotiations over the last several days regarding the education portion of the bill. There are some other items there also, but basically on education. 
After reading some of the newspaper accounts and listening to some of the speeches on the Senate floor, I can only come to the realization that perhaps the American people are a little bit confused now about what is going on. I respectfully submit that may be the point of what is going on--to try to confuse the American people. I am going to try to set the record a little bit straight here, in my limited amount of time. 
I was in my office a little while ago listening to the Senator from Texas talk about education. He had a chart. He went on to say that only 37 cents of every dollar that comes in here, I think in the Department of Education, actually gets back out to the local schools. 
Having been involved both on the authorizing committee for now 14 years and on the Appropriations Committee, an equal amount of time on Education, I was quite astounded by this figure because I never heard this figure before. 
 So I decided to go back and find out exactly what were the facts. 
So I guess the best place to look is in the committee report, compiled not by the Democrats but by the Republicans,--by Senator Specter for the Committee on Appropriations. Of course, I will say this, and most gratefully say, he and his staff have worked very closely with me and our appropriations staff in putting out this report. 
So I looked in the report, to check on administrative costs for the Department of Education, because I never heard that figure, 37 cents. I thought, `Boy, if that's the truth, I might join the Senator from Texas in this argument.' So I looked it up. In this report--this is the document right here; big and thick, has a lot of numbers in it, very boring reading--the committee recommendation for the Department of Education is $34.4 billion. That number is likely to increase as a result of the negotiations on the final bill. 
So then I said, `OK, how much does the Department of Education spend administering these programs?' Well, here is the line item. It is right here in the book. You do not have to go very far. General Departmental Management: $101 million. Well, I am not the best at math, but I tried to figure this out. And as best I can come, that is less than one-half of 1 percent of the total money that we appropriate to the Department of Education goes for administration--less than one-half of 1 percent. 
I then asked my staff to find out how much of was spent for administration at the State level. And that is about 2 percent. So 2.5 percent of all the money we take in that we give the Department of Education goes for administration; therefore providing 97.5 percent to local school districts and students. That is right; out of every $1 that goes to the Department of Education, 97 cents-plus goes out to schools and to students. 
Where the heck that 37-cent figure, that the Senator from Texas had, came from, I have not the foggiest idea. I have his comments. I still do not understand where he got that figure. The only thing I can expect is that maybe he did not take into account Pell grants that go directly to students that are paid to schools. I do not know. Whatever the reason is, that is not the correct figure. It is not chewed up in administration. 
The documentation is right here in black and white in the committee report. It just seems that all we have is we just have a lot of rhetoric around here and somehow we are supposed to take the rhetoric for substance. 
The substance is there. It is not a secret. You can find out how much goes for administration, and it is not as much as the Senator from Texas said. Fully 97 cents of every dollar that goes to the Department of Education goes out to schools, goes out to students. 
Again, it seems now that what I am hearing is that the Republicans, in the negotiations, are saying that they are going to match us dollar-for-dollar, but they just want to throw the money out there in the Title VI block grant to the States, so they can do with it basically what they want. So the sort of hue and cry is `We'll give money to the States and let the States do what they want.' 
There is a better way. To deal with class size, the President has an initiative to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size in this country. The President and those of us on this side of the aisle, what we want to do is put that money through title I reading and math program to reduce class sizes. I am told the Republicans want to send it out through the Title VI block grant. 
Again, I am sure that the American people watching me speak here are saying, `Gobbledygook, Title I, Title VI, so what?' Well, so what is a big difference in whether more money gets out to the students or not. 
There is a big difference. For example, in title I, we have a cap by law that says that no more than 1 percent of the money that goes out to Title I can be used for administration at the State level. One cent of every dollar, that is all, no more; so that 99 cents actually gets to the schools and the students. 
However, under Title VI, 15 percent of the money that goes out to the States is held at the State level; 15 cents out of every dollar is held at the State level. The remaining 85 cents then goes out to the school districts. 
Title I is more efficient and will get more resources into the classrooms and schools--99 cents of every dollar, to actually hire the teachers and reduce class size. What the Republicans are saying is, turn it over to the States. They keep 15 cents and send only 85 cents to the schools. 
So I submit, Mr. President, that if you really want to cut administrative costs, if you want to get the most money out there to get the most bang for the buck, let's put the money in Title I and not the Title VI program. 
There seems to be another strain going on around here and that is that `the Federal Government is doing too much in education. The Federal Government should do less. We have got leave this to States and local communities.' 
I would be the first to defend and the last person standing in defense of the right of local jurisdictions to control their schools. That does not mean that the Federal Government does not have a role to play in helping those schools. I believe it does; a significant role. And we have owned up to that over the years. But to say that the Federal Government is doing too much, I think, is to ignore what we have done in the past. 
In 1980--of every dollar that went for elementary and secondary education in America, for every dollar that went out, the Federal Government provided about 10 cents. So about 10 cents of every dollar that went out for elementary and secondary education came from the Federal Government. That was 1980. 
To those who say that today, in 1998, the Federal Government is doing too much in elementary and secondary education, I point out that from that point in 1980 to now the Federal Government is only providing about 6 percent of the money for elementary and secondary education. In other words, in the intervening 18 years, the Federal role in support of elementary and secondary education has been cut by almost. 
I always tell my constituents in Iowa, and other places, obviously, you wonder why your property taxes are going up. That is why. In order to keep the schools up and to meet their constitutional requirements to provide for new technology, to help fix up crumbling schools, the States then have to put it back on the local jurisdictions, and they have to raise property taxes. That is why the property taxes seem to be going up all over this country. 
So I always say to people, if you want property tax relief, the best thing is to get the Federal Government back up to where we were in 1980. You do that and you will find out we will be able to fix our crumbling schools, we will be able to hire 100,000 teachers and reduce class size, we will be able to wire the schools for the Internet, and get the technology these kids need at an early level. 
Mr. President, if we had just held constant from where we were in 1980 to today--do not increase but do not decrease; simply held constant--the Federal Government's share of elementary and secondary education would be about a 44-percent increase. We would be providing an additional $10 billion more each year our local schools. And any way you cut it, that spells property tax relief. 
That spells more technology for our schools. 
If I might digress just a moment, there are some who think that our kids in elementary school have to learn the basics first and then they can get on to computers. There are some who say that what our kids need is a No. 2 lead pencil and a Big Chief tablet; they learn that first, and then they can go into computers. They fail to recognize that the No. 2 lead pencil and the Big Chief tablet of today are the desktop computer. 
I know the occupant of the Chair is a little bit younger than I am, but when I was a kid in a two-room country schoolhouse in rural Iowa back in the 1940s and early 1950s, we had a blackboard and a piece of chalk. That was our computer. We used that blackboard and a piece of chalk; we had our Big Chief tablet and No. 2 lead pencil. That might have been OK for my generation. It is not OK for this generation; it is not OK for the kids today. It is not something they use after they get smart, it is something they use to help them learn smart, to understand what we are going to need in the 21st century to meet our needs. 
We could have that if the Federal Government would meet its obligations, if we just held constant where we were in 1980. That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to support the President's goal of reducing class size and getting 100,000 teachers out there. We are trying to support the President in his goal of getting money out to help fix our crumbling schools, so the kids don't have to go out and learn in trailers, so we don't have 30 to 35 kids in the class but something like 18 or 19, at the maximum, in any class. 
Last, we hear all the speeches about turning the money over to the States and let them decide how to respond. That all sounds good. What about all of the bipartisan accomplishments that we also hear about in this Congress? We passed the Higher Education Act; we reauthorized the vocational and technical education bill; we expanded the Federal Charter Schools Program. Senators on both sides of the aisle brag about this. How can you brag about it in one breath and turn around and say that we have to turn over all the money to the States? I am a little confused about that. If you are proud of the vocational and technical education and the fact that the Federal Government has supported it and we just reauthorized it, how can you then turn around and said we shouldn't do any of this? 
There is a role, a limited role, for the Federal Government, but a very powerful and important role. I believe this Congress is turning its back on its responsibilities, unless in the closing days of this session we can get an agreement to provide resources to reduce class size and fix our crumbling schools. We need the money in there right now so the kids don't have to go out in trailers in the back of the school to learn. 
I hope in the closing days we will be able to get the education funding that we need.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I turn my attention to another issue that is closely akin to education, an issue I have been working on for a long time, one which has come to the front now because of all the negotiations going on. That is the issue of child labor. 
In January of this year, my staff, Rosemary Gutierrez, and I traveled to Nepal, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to look at the issue of child labor. While we were in Nepal, the exotic city of Katmandu, I met with a young man who had been a former child laborer. He told me about the awful conditions that were in some of these countries, yet the official government line is, there is no child labor; it is prohibited. 
On a Sunday evening, right after it got dark, about dusk, we got into an unmarked car--the former child laborer, a driver, my staff person, and I--and drove to the outskirts of Katmandu to a carpet factory. It was thought by my host, this young man who had been a former child laborer, that the owner of the factory was not going to be there. He kind of knew the guard at the gate and said we could get through. So we drove out to the outskirts. Sure enough, there was a gate, there was a wire fence. The guard let us through. We went up, and the young man talked to him in Nepalese, since I don't speak Nepalese, and we were let through. 
What was on the outside of the gate before we entered? This sign right here, in Nepalese and in English. This is the sign; I took this picture with my camera. The brick wall states: 
Child labor [sic] under the age of 14 is strictly prohibited. 
Right on the gate it says this. I took the picture. We went through a gate, down a long hallway, turned left; there were doors; we opened the doors and walked in. 
Remember:  
Child labor under the age of 14 is strictly prohibited. 
Here are some more pictures I took. These are kids working at the looms. We asked our host to ask them their ages. We have a boy here who is 9 and a girl about 12. That is just two of them. This place was loaded with kids that age, working on a Sunday at 7 o'clock in the evening; it was getting dark. They are still working full-time in dirty, dusty conditions, making these carpets. 
Here is another picture I took. Again, don't tell me these are phony pictures. I took them with my camera. I was there. More kids are working at their looms--kids, 11, 12, 13, 10, 9 years old. And I have other pictures. I had my staff take a photo with me included with the kids to show that I was there. Again, there are other kids--not the same kids--other kids in the same place, all of whom basically are under the age of 14--there were some older, I admit, but a lot of them under the age of 14, working. 
What we are trying to do is do something about the issue of child labor. What can we do? In 1930, Congress passed what was infamously known as the Smoot-Hawley bill. Aside from the bad things Smoot-Hawley did in terms of restricting trade, there was section 307, which is part of the law today, which has been in existence since 1930. I will read the first sentence: 
All goods, wares, articles, and merchandise, mined, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by convict labor or/and forced labor, or/and indentured labor, under penal sanctions, shall not be entitled to entry at any of the ports of the United States, and the importation thereof is hereby prohibited, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the enforcement of this provision. 
It covers forced and indentured labor. We have prohibited that ever since. 
A couple of years ago, I made an inquiry of the Department of the Treasury. I asked if any items made with forced or indentured child labor had been prohibited from entering the United States under this section on forced labor. To my surprise, the answer was no. Furthermore, the Department of Treasury was not sure whether or not forced or indentured child labor was included in the definition of `forced or indentured labor.' 
This is outrageous. The law says `forced or indentured labor,' but we don't know if it covers kids. 
Last year, during consideration of the fiscal year 1998 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, I inserted a provision which instructed the U.S. Customs Service to block from entry into the United States any imports made by forced or indentured child labor as they are inherently imports made with forced and indentured labor. 
However, this was only a 1-year provision. It was on an appropriations bill. But it passed. It was supported by the House and Senate. But it only lasted 1 year. That year is now up. That provision no longer is valid because it was only good for 1 year. 
In order to ensure that goods made with forced and indentured child labor are treated the same as goods made with forced or indentured adult labor, we need to change the law permanently. Well, this summer, the Senate approved my amendment to reflect the intent of Congress to include forced and indentured child labor under this umbrella. My amendment was quite simple. The Tariff Act already says that goods made with forced or indentured labor are prohibited from entering the U.S. market. I included the words `forced and indentured child labor,' so there is no ambiguity in the statute's interpretation. 
Unfortunately, my amendment was struck from the bill during conference because Members did not feel a tariff measure belonged on the defense authorization bill. I was told to find a more relevant measure. Well, I have it. Congress is considering a tariff measure, H.R. 4342, the Miscellaneous Tariff and Technical Corrections Act of 1998, which passed the House on August 4. It has a lot of provisions in it. There is page after page after page of technical corrections to the tariff laws. Examples: Over 100 provisions that would suspend or reduce the tariff applicable to certain specified products, most of these being a wide variety of chemicals and organic pigments, including a temporary suspension on the duties for a variety of HIV medications and anticancer drugs and other trade-related provisions--hundreds of provisions. 
Here is the report. As you go through it, there is page after page, including things like pigment yellow No. 151, pigment yellow No. 175, chloroacetone, benzenepropanal. Section 2143, textile machinery. Section 2144. Here are some things and chemicals I can't even pronounce that are being changed here. A lot of chemicals. Here is 4-hexylresorcinol. I don't even know what it is. 
My point is this: There are hundreds of tariff changes in this bill. This is a tariff bill. My amendment on child labor amends the Tariff Act of 1930--a tariff measure. So we have the right vehicle. But, Mr. President, because the House passed it on suspension, it came over here and it was never brought out on the floor for debate so that I could offer this amendment--an amendment which is noncontroversial. It passed the Senate twice, and passed the House once. It has been in effect for one year because it was on an appropriations bill. I just want to get an amendment to the tariff bill to indicate that forced and indentured labor includes forced and indentured `child' labor. 
Well, I don't know why we can't include it. I did have a conversation on the telephone with the chairman of the Finance Committee last week. I asked why this noncontroversial provision couldn't be put in. I don't know that anyone would come to the floor and object to taking the Tariff Law of 1930, which forbids the importation of goods made by forced and indentured labor, and adding the words `child labor,' so that forced and indentured labor would cover forced and indentured child labor. Would someone come to the floor and say, OK, we have to keep everything out of this country made with forced and indentured adult labor, but if you have forced and indentured child labor, that's OK, we will bring it in. Does anybody want to come to the floor and make that argument? I doubt it. I don't think anybody would want to make that argument, because it doesn't make sense. I think we are all fairly reasonable people around here. 
So I would like to get my amendment on the tariff bill--an amendment that, as I said, passed both Houses--it passed this body twice--and has been in effect for one year. I didn't hear any hue and cry from anyone. As far as I know, I never had one corporation, one business, one importer yell about it or say that `this is awful that we are keeping goods out made with forced and indentured child labor.' My amendment gives our Treasury Department, our Customs people, is a permanent law whereby it would say, in unambiguous terms, forced and indentured labor means forced and indentured child labor, also. 
Now, could there be an objection that costs money? Well, I have an opinion here from CBO, from back on July 16 of this year.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I hope not to even take that long. Here is the analysis from CBO on my amendment: `This proposal would not affect direct spending or receipts, so there would be no pay-as-you-go scoring under section 252 of the Balanced Budget Act.' 
There you are. It doesn't cost any money. It has no effect on the budget. It has been passed. All I want to do is get it added to this bill and, since I didn't have a chance to offer it as an amendment, I only have one recourse. I put a hold on the tariff bill. I don't want it to pass by unanimous consent. Am I opposed to the tariff bill? No. I assume everything in it is fine. It has all been cleared. The chairman of the Finance Committee assured me that it has been cleared by everybody. I don't know every section and title, but I assume it's all right. I want the opportunity to put this into permanent law on a tariff bill. I don't know when the next tariff bill will come across the Senate floor. I don't believe this language can be held hostage simply because the Senate didn't do its work. The House passed this on August 4. We had plenty of time to take it up here, but we never brought it up. So I am left in the position of having to do something that I don't like to do, which is to put a hold on the bill and not give my consent to pass the bill by unanimous consent, unless we can get this amendment added. An amendment, which I swear, I would like to know one person that could come over here and argue against it. I don't think you could find such a person. 
So I see no reason why it can't be added. It's time that we say about kids what we said in 1930--in 1930--what we said about adults. This Congress said that no goods, no merchandise, or anything that is mined by forced or indentured labor can come into this country. Here we are, 68 years later, and we can't add the words `forced and indentured child labor.' 
Nonsense. I hope that those who are working on the tariff bill would be so kind as to include this amendment so that we can take away any ambiguity, clean it up once and for all, and prohibit the importation of goods made with child labor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk in as glowing terms as I can about a great friend, a great Senator, and a person I have admired both as a Senator and as a plain good person for all the years I have been in Washington. And he is leaving us. He is retiring at the end of this session. I am speaking about perhaps the epitome of what I believe to be a good Senator, and that Senator is Dale Bumpers of Arkansas. 
I am really going to miss him, and this country is going to miss him as well. So will this Chamber. He is truly one of the finest Senators to have ever graced this body. He has done so many good things over the years. It is hard to know where to begin. 
I know he started out as someone in the Marine Corps. As a Navy person I will not hold that against him. I can overlook that. But then he came back to Arkansas and practiced law, had a small business, and even raised some cattle. He had good practical experience, and knows the people of Arkansas and he knows the people of this country. The people of Arkansas rewarded that--first as Governor, and now finishing his tenure as a Senator. He was elected by more than 60 percent of the vote in the last two terms. 
Senator Bumpers came to the Senate at the same time I came to the House in 1974. For 24 years he has been here. 
Someone said once about Senators in general that some Senators come here to coin a phrase, or coin a slogan, and think they have solved the problem. But not Dale Bumpers. He has worked very hard to solve the problems of this country. 
He has been a close friend, a person of immense common sense. When it comes to helping farmers, seniors, working people, and children there is no better person to have as an ally than Dale Bumpers. He stuck to what he believed. He had the determination to get the job done with a strong commitment to the people of Arkansas. He is certainly one of the finest orators and debaters this Chamber has ever seen. He has led the fight in the Senate against government waste. 
I loved to listen to his speeches on that $12 billion boondoggle called the superconductor super collider. And he won. Unfortunately, we wasted a lot of money on it. But, the people finally came to their senses and saw it as the boondoggle that it was. 
I wasn't in the Senate at the time. I was in the House working to kill that other boondoggle called the Clinch River breeder reactor. Boy, you would think at that time it was the most important thing to civilization that we built that breeder reactor. But finally people came to their senses, and we stopped it. And we are better and we are stronger because of it. We saved billions of dollars that would have been wasted. Dale led the fight on that in the Senate. 
He has led the fight against other wasteful spending such as star wars and the space station. 
I believe that he has finally brought home to the American conscience the issue of mining interests and the abuse of our public lands and the fact that we need to update our laws. 
Anyway, with a common sense approach he has been a strong ally on the Appropriations Committee where we need that kind of common sense approach. 
On the Agriculture Committee, he placed the needs of America's rural communities at the top of the national debate including rural housing and rural economic development. He has been the strongest fighter for protecting the environment. On the Clean Air Act, and Clean Water Act, Dale Bumpers has been in the forefront of America's fight to keep our country clean. 
As the National Journal put it, Dale Bumpers is the Senator to whom `other Senators pay attention.' 
In numerous polls of Senate staffers, Dale Bumpers has consistently ranked as one of the best liked Senators. 
So we are going to miss him when we start the 106th Congress in January. We are going to miss Dale and his eloquence, his determination and his stick-to-itness. 
So to the entire Bumpers family, Dale and Betty, their children--Brent, Bill and Brooke--and their five grandchildren, I want to extend my gratitude, and the gratitude of the citizens of my State, that I am so proud to represent, for loaning Dale to us for the past 24 years. America is a much better place because of Dale's service in the Senate. 
Mr. President, I want to close on the one note--the one area in which Dale has devoted so much of his time and effort, along with Betty on protecting our children from illnesses and diseases that have ravaged kids since time immemorial. 
No one has fought harder for childhood vaccinations, and to make them universal, affordable, and accessible than Dale and Betty Bumpers. 
So in recognition of their contributions, the Appropriations Committee, on which Dale served, voted unanimously, Republican and Democrats, to name a new vaccine facility at the National Institutes of Health after Senator Bumpers and his wife, Betty. This new facility, now under construction, will be named the `Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Facility.' 
As I said, Dale has been our resident expert on immunization since early in his Senate career. He has been a tireless advocate for funding to purchase vaccines and provide the public health system with the resources necessary to deliver those vaccines to the children who are most in need. He advocated a grant incentive program in the Senate that the Appropriations Committee has used each year to reward States that have been successful in preventing unnecessary diseases. 
So there have been a lot of tributes that have been paid to Dale. But, the most lasting tribute will be his and Betty Bumpers' name on that research facility at NIH because, that is truly where his heart has been in making sure that kids in places like rural Arkansas and rural Iowa, and all over America--including our inner cities--to make sure they have a healthy start in life by getting immunized. To me that says it all about Dale Bumpers. 
We are going to miss him. I hope that he doesn't go too far away. I for one look forward to his continued advice and counsel as I serve out my career in the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I want to recognize the anniversaries of some important milestones along the road to ending nuclear weapons testing. This month marks some major steps we have taken toward an international ban on nuclear weapons tests, a cornerstone of our Nation's nuclear weapons non-proliferation policy. These anniversaries also remind us how much more remains to be done if we are to honor the vision of those who have worked to reduce the threat of nuclear war. 
On October 11, 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty entered into force after being ratified by the Senate in an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 80-14 just a few weeks earlier. This treaty paved the way for future nuclear weapons testing agreements by prohibiting tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater. This treaty was signed by 108 countries. 
Our Nation's agreement to the Limited Test Ban Treaty marked the end of our Nation's aboveground testing of nuclear weapons, including those at the U.S. test site in Nevada. We now know, all too well, the terrible impact of exploding nuclear weapons over the Nevada desert. Among other consequences, these tests in the 1950's exposed millions of Americans to large amounts of radioactive Iodine-131, which accumulates in the thyroid gland and has been linked to thyroid cancer. `Hot Spots,' where the Iodine-131 fallout was the greatest, were identified by a National Cancer Institute report as receiving 5-16 rads of Iodine-131. The `Hot Spots' included many areas far away from Nevada, including New York, Massachusetts and Iowa. Outside reviewers have shown that the 5-16 rad level is only an average, with many people having received much higher exposure levels, especially those who were children at the time. 
To put that in perspective, federal standards for nuclear power plants require that protective action be taken for 15 rads. To further understand the enormity of the potential exposure, consider this: 150 million curies of Iodine-131 were released by the above ground nuclear weapons testing in the United States, about three times more than from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in the former Soviet Union. 
It is all too clear that outlawing above-ground tests were in the interest of our Nation. I strongly believe that banning all nuclear tests is also in our interests. 
October also marked some key steps the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or CTBT. On October 2, 1992, President Bush signed into law the U.S. moratorium on all nuclear tests. The moratorium was internationalized when, just a few year later, on September 24, 1996, a second step was taken--the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or CTBT, was opened for signature. The United States was the first to sign this landmark treaty. 
Mr. President, a little more than a year ago, President Clinton took a third important step in abolishing nuclear weapons tests by transmitting the CTBT to the United States Senate for ratification. Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to take the additional step of ratifying the CTBT. I am hopeful that we in the Senate will debate and vote on ratification of the Treaty, and continue the momentum toward the important goal of a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons testing. 
Many believed we had conquered the dangerous specter of nuclear war after the Cold War came to an end and many former Soviet states became our allies. Unfortunately, recent developments in South Asia remind us that we need to be vigilant in our cooperative international efforts to reduce the dangers of nuclear weapons. 
It is especially important that the Senate act before the September 1999 deadline for ratification by 44 countries. If the United States fails to ratify the CTBT, then we will not have a voice in the special international conference which will negotiate how to accelerate the treaty into force. Yet, as a signatory, we will still be bound by its provisions. 
The CTBT is a major milestone in the effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It would establish a permanent ban on all nuclear explosions in all environments for any purpose. Its `zero-yield' prohibition on nuclear tests would help to halt the development and deployment of new nuclear weapons. The Treaty would also establish a far-reaching verification regime that includes a global network of sophisticated seismic, hydro-acoustic and radionuclide monitoring stations, as well as on-site inspection of test sites to deter and detect violations. 
It is vital to our national security for the nuclear arms race to come to an end, and the American people recognize this. In a recent poll commissioned by the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear dangers, nearly 50 percent of voters supported `eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide' and an additional third support `reducing the number of nuclear weapons worldwide'. In addition, a 1997 poll by the Mellman Group for the Henry J. Stimson Center found that 69 percent of voters believe the goal of the United States should be to reduce or eliminate nuclear weapons. 
It is heartening to know that the American people understand the risks of a world with nuclear weapons. It is now time for policymakers to recognize this as well. There is no better way to honor the hard work and dedication of those who developed the LTBT and the CTBT than for the U.S. Senate to immediately ratify the CTBT. Our Nation's role as the world's only remaining superpower demands no less.

Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator from Indiana yielding to me to explain why I object to this. 
Before I get into that, let me say that I was here for part of his speech. He thanked his staff. I thought it was a very gracious and wonderful thing the Senator did. It was really nice. 
I must say, I will miss you here in the Senate, Dan. As I said before, you have been a wonderful person to work with. I hate to end it on this note, where I am objecting to something that you are bringing up. You have been a great Senator. You have been a great human being to work with. We will miss you. I will miss you, personally. All of my friends who have left said there is a life beyond the Senate. Quite frankly, it is probably a lot better, considering we are here at 7:30 on a Friday night. 
Mr. President, I just want to explain why I object to this bill. This is the bill that would have increased the number of H-1B visas from 65,000 per year to 115,000 for next year and the year after, then drop down to 107,500 in 2001 and back down to 65,000 thereafter. 
Now, ostensibly, the reason for doing this, and why this came up in the last couple of years, is that there was projected to be a big shortage in computer programmers. Thus, there was this big push to increase the number of H-1B visas, to get these computer programmers. 
It turns out that has, indeed, not happened. In fact, I have three recent articles. One is from the San Jose Mercury News dated October 6, 1998. It says:  
High-tech Layoffs are Accelerating. 
They pointed out in the article: 
Computers ranked second in total job-cut announcements, with 44,000. That represented nearly three times the number from last year. 
The article goes on to say: 
The changing job market can be seen at the Career Action Center, a career resource center in Cupertino, where counselors are seeing more people come in. Job searches are taking more time, companies are taking longer to make their hiring decision, and some businesses have even enacted hiring freezes, said Betsy Collard, the center's strategic development director. 
While the center posted 10,000 jobs in August, that was down from 13,500 it posted a year earlier.

Mr. HARKIN. Another recent article from Computer World, dated October 5, 1998, talked about the same subject: 
The year 2000 retention drama is playing out differently from what was expected. The widely anticipated programmer shortage never quite materialized, but another shortage has proved far more dangerous. 
`We'd always heard the industry speak of demand for programmers, but the more critical and unexpected demand is for project managers,' says Irene Dec, vice president of information systems at the Prudential Insurance Company of America in Newark, NJ. 
The article pointed out, quite frankly, that the programmers are in fine shape. What they are really looking for are program managers. I understand the H-1B visa does not in any way address that problem at all.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I object because I think while this maybe had some legitimacy at some time because of the projected shortage in computer programmers, every indication is that has not happened. 
Obviously, we don't need to pass this bill right now. I think we can take another look at it next year to see if, in fact, there is any problem. We can always come back and look at this again next year, but right now it does not appear that the demand is there that they anticipated a couple of years ago.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last evening, President Clinton did the right thing, did the right thing for this country and did the right thing for our farmers and for people who live all across rural America. He did the right thing for farmers who are suffering because of a drastic drop in prices. He did the right thing for farmers who are suffering because of a loss of crop in disaster areas in the South and Upper Midwest. The President did the right thing by vetoing the woefully inadequate farm disaster bill that this Congress passed and sent to him for his signature. Now it is up to us to see what we can do to make that bill better and get it back to the President for his signature. 
Rural America needs help. Farmers need assistance. Disaster-hit areas need help. And yet they do not need the woefully inadequate bill that was passed here. I likened the bill that was passed by the Congress as giving a thimbleful of water to a person dying of thirst. It may assuage their thirst momentarily, but it is not going to keep them alive. We need to give those farmers who are dying of thirst out there the adequate water they need to get them through this year and the next to keep them alive. 
Mr. President, I was encouraged by what I read in Congress Daily, that the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Congressman Livingston, has said that they expected a veto and that after the veto comes negotiations. I do not have the exact quote, but that is about what he said. I think that gives us some hope that we can work together here, we can negotiate out some differences, and we can come up with a bill that the President will sign and that will, indeed, benefit our producers. 
There are some principles that we must maintain, however. First of all, there must be adequate disaster assistance. There needs to be equitable treatment regionally both within the distribution of the disaster assistance and within the overall package of disaster-related, commodity-based assistance. That means it has to be equitable, and it has to be adequate. It does not necessarily mean the dollars have to be spread around evenly. Equitable treatment is the key for farmers who have suffered from natural disasters. 
A second principle is that assistance must go to producers who need it. Assistance based on low commodity prices should be delivered to producers suffering from low commodity prices. That is the advantage of the marketing loan proposal that those on our side have advocated. The proposal just to add on some money to this so-called AMTA payment has no relationship to the level of commodity prices. And not all commodity prices are depressed equally or substantially, particularly in cotton and rice. So assistance must have some relation to market conditions. 
I always wonder what it is about some of my friends on the other side. They always talk about the market, the market, the market, yet the direct payment that goes out to farmers has no relationship to the market. 
Removing the loan rate caps, as we want to do, does have a relationship to the market. If the market price goes up, the exposure to the Government is less and farmers will get their money from the market and not from the Government. Just giving out a direct payment has no relationship to the market whatsoever. 
I think a third principle that we must have in any negotiated settlement is assistance to actual producers. Lump cash payments in a fixed amount are less likely to remain in the hands of the actual farmer than is assistance provided in a way that is contingent on market conditions. The additional AMTA payment that is in the vetoed bill is readily identified by landlords who are in a strong position to capture the payment in land rental rates. That is why raising the marketing loans, raising those caps will get to the producers. 
Another principle. We must restore the safety net. Farmers are in their current predicament in large measure because the safety net feature of previous farm bills was abandoned in the 1996 farm bill. A set cash payment does nothing to restore the safety net because it is not responsive to market conditions. By contrast, removing loan rate caps would help restore a safety net responsive to market conditions. 
Two last and final principles. Some linkage to actual production. The marketing assistance loan is tied directly to actual production. The Republican plan in the vetoed bill would have provided an additional money windfall even though no crop had been produced on the land. Why would we want to do that? Let's have assistance out to farmers who actually produced a crop. 
And last, let's have a major measure of fiscal responsibility. This idea of just throwing out another payment to farmers is not fiscally responsible. If commodity prices should rise next year, which we all hope will happen, our plan would cost less than expected. But if the commodity prices rise next year, after the Republican plan payment went out, we would not recapture any of that money. It would be gone. That is why raising the marketing loan caps is, indeed, more fiscally responsible than just giving out a payment. 
Mr. President, I believe within those principles there is room for negotiation. I look forward to the negotiations. I hope we can very rapidly come up with a bill that will meet these principles and that the President will sign into law, because our farmers need the assistance, and the disaster areas also need that assistance. 
I will yield the floor.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for many years I have spoken of the promise of hydrogen energy as our best hope for an environmentally safe sustainable energy future. My vision, and the vision of many of our top scientists is simple. Hydrogen, which is produced by renewable energy with absolutely no pollution and no resource depletion of any kind, will prove a truly sustainable energy option. 
I recognize that hydrogen is not yet a form of energy widely known to the American public. In fact, hydrogen has an unfortunate association. I would like to spend a few minutes dispelling one unfortunate myth of hydrogen energy. 
Mr. President, mention the word `hydrogen' and many people remember the Hindenburg--the dirigible that caught fire back in May of 1937, killing 36 of the 97 people on board. Now, thanks to the scientific sleuthing of Addison Bain, a retired NASA scientist with 30 years experience with hydrogen, we can state with a fair degree of certainty that the Hindenburg would have caught fire even without any hydrogen on board. 
This detective story was reported in a recent issue of Popular Science. I ask that the Popular Science article be printed in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks. 
Addison Bain collected actual samples from the Hindenburg--the cloth bags that contained the hydrogen--which were saved as souvenirs by the crowd awaiting the Hindenburg at Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. When these samples were analyzed by modern techniques, Bain discovered that the bags had been coated with cellulose nitrate or cellulose acetate--both flammable materials. Furthermore, the cellulose material was impregnated with aluminum flakes to reflect sunlight, and aluminum powder is used in rocket fuel. Essentially the outside of the Hindenburg was coated with rocket fuel! 
Addison now believes that the Hindenburg probably caught fire from an electrical discharge igniting the cellulose-coated gas bags. Remember, the ship docked at Lakehurst with electrical storms in the area, which was against regulations. 
I would like to personally thank Addison Bain for his valuable contribution to the history of the Hindenburg, and to lessening the public's concerns over the safety of hydrogen. Hydrogen, in my judgment, will become a premier fuel in the 21st century, since burning hydrogen produces no pollution of any kind, just pure, clean water. And hydrogen can be produced by using sunlight or wind electricity to split water. 
Hydrogen energy has been used safely in the Nation's space program for many decades, and I believe it can be used safely for many other applications here on Earth. For example, hydrogen could be a safe alternative fuel for cars. It would be much less dangerous than gasoline in an accident. Hydrogen gas disperses rapidly, while gasoline lingers in the vicinity of the accident, increasing the risks to survivors of the crash. I believe there are also countless other uses for hydrogen. We can pursue those options without fear because of Addison Bain's efforts. Thanks to Addison Bain, we can continue down the path toward a renewable hydrogen future without the undue fear of a singular event from 60 years ago.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I was listening to what the distinguished Senator from Idaho was saying. He raised one question. He asked the question, What do farmers want? That is a fair question. But there is an answer. 
A poll was prepared by Rock Wood Research, a subsidiary of the Farm Journal, Inc: we are all familiar with Farm Journal--for the Nebraska Wheat Growers Association, the American Corn Growers Association, and the Nebraska Farmers Union. It was a widely disseminated poll. It was done between September 4 and September 10 of this year. And 1,000 farmers, actual producers, were interviewed--500 corn growers and 500 wheat growers. 
There were a number of questions. One of the questions asked was whether Congress should lift loan caps and raise loan rates 59 cents per bushel on wheat and 32 cents on corn, and 72.5 percent of the farmers polled said yes, they wanted the loan rates raised; only 19 percent said no. 
So if you are asking the question about what farmers want, I have a scientific poll done of 1,000 farmers, a pretty good cross section, and 72.5 percent said they wanted the loan rates raised. 
Another question: A farm program should retain planting flexibility, including farmer-owned and farmer-controlled grain reserves; 85.9 percent of the farmers interviewed said they would support that proposal. Only 9.9 percent opposed it. 
Yet the Republicans in this body and in the House would never vote to give farmers a farmer-owned and farmer-controlled grain reserve. We have had that in the past. I, for one, happen to be in favor of reinstituting it. But, obviously, the party in power will not countenance that. So when you ask what farmers want, it is here in this poll; it is as plain as can be. If we were voting on what farmers wanted, we would have lifted the caps from the commodity marketing assistance loan rates and we would have a farmer-owned and farmer-controlled grain reserve. 
So much for that question. 
It has also been said that our marketing loan proposals are undermining Freedom to Farm. That is not so. What has undermined Freedom to Farm is external events, which is weak export demand from the Asian markets, along with the strong dollar, generally favorable weather and bumper crops in many areas. Those are the factors that have undermined the hoped-for success of Freedom to Farm. 
Actually, the proposal that we have made would in some ways help Freedom to Farm. It is kind of odd that I find myself, who was opposed to Freedom to Farm because of its lack of income protection, saying that our proposal probably will help save it more than what is being done in this conference report. But, be that as it may, I still think that, looking at it both in the short and the long term, raising the caps on the marketing loans is the way to go. 
One other point that I wanted to raise is that I really take issue with any suggestion that Secretary of Agriculture Glickman has flip-flopped on loan rates. I don't believe that assertion is supported by the facts. Secretary Glickman for some time has talked about the need to restore a farm income safety net. In fact, he said that when the President signed the 1996 farm bill into law. He was not saying that he opposed taking the loan rate caps off; he just said there needed to be a safety net. When a specific proposal to lift the caps on loan rates was made, he endorsed it, as did President Clinton. So I can't see that as any kind of a flip-flop. 
A lot has been said here about generosity and how generous the Republican proposal in the conference report is for farmers, for disaster-related assistance. I divide the conference report in this regard into two areas. There is the part that goes for the natural disaster assistance and the part that goes for the income losses related to commodity prices. 
On the disaster side, the proposal that we offered in conference would provide $2.486 billion in disaster assistance. The conference report has $2.350 billion. Actually, the proposal that we offered would have been more generous overall to farmers suffering from disasters than the conference report in front of us. 
Mr. President, having said all of that, I must also say that there are many good features in this conference report. I commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member for their outstanding work under very difficult constraints to pull this conference report together. It has a number of provisions important not only to my State of Iowa but to the Nation that I am pleased to see included. So there are a lot of good things in the bill. 
But there is one overriding shortcoming in the bill that will, of course, compel me to oppose the conference report. And that is what we have been speaking about most of the afternoon, those of us who have been on the floor; that is, what I feel to be the lack of adequate assistance to help our farmers--our farm families--deal with the worst economic devastation in over a decade. It is a matter that is simply too important to let go. I regret that I must urge my colleagues to vote against the adoption of the conference report. 
Again, just to refresh my colleagues about the seriousness of the crisis facing American farm families and rural communities, in July, when this legislation was last on the Senate floor, 99 Senators voted in favor of a resolution recognizing the severity of the crisis that confronts us in agriculture and calling for immediate action. What was bad then has become even worse since. 
Commodity prices have fallen even further. In the period of 11 weeks, corn and soybean prices at Central Illinois Terminal Elevators have declined 39 cents a bushel for corn and $1.49 a bushel for soybeans. At Iowa Interior Elevators, prices have fallen by similar amounts to about $1.53 a bushel for corn, and about $4.65 a bushel for soybeans. And on the livestock side, hog prices have continued at low levels, remaining at or below $30 a hundredweight in southern Iowa markets since early September. Country elevator prices are expected to fall even lower as the fall harvest gets fully in swing. Cattle prices remain low. Wheat prices have been depressed for a long time and are expected to continue so. 
In addition to the low commodity prices, farmers in several regions of the country have suffered devastating losses from damaging weather, crop diseases, and other natural disasters. There has been severe drought in the South, Southwest, Southeast, and now followed by devastating hurricanes. 
In the northern plains, several years of crop disease have put farmers on the ropes. As a result of all of these forces, farm income is falling drastically. It is estimated that this year net farm income will be down by more than $11 billion from last year. 
That is over a 20-percent drop in farm income in 1 year. Again, this loss of income is having a horrendous effect on farm families and their communities. And there appears to be no relief in the market on the horizon. 
We are all talking about the market. The theory of Freedom to Farm supposedly was that farmers can plant for the market. Well, there is no market to speak of now. We have too large a quantity of commodities for the market. We have a glut on the market, and our Asian markets and other markets are suffering. I don't know when they are going to come back. So if the response is that farmers can plant for the market, I assume the advice to farmers is not to plant because there is no market. 
Well, how can that be when the farmer has his fixed costs. He has land. He has his equipment. He has all this money tied up. He has to plant. He has to plant his crops to try to make something. In fact, economically, that farmer will try to plant more. He will try to get more out of his fixed asset base to make up for his losses. He will try to get more production out of his fixed base to make up for lower prices. Therefore, we look again next year for another bumper crop coming on and continued low prices. The Asian economy is not expected to turn around quickly, the Russian economy is in the tank, and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar means that other exporting countries can offer more competitive prices than we can. 
So we are now in what appears to be a prolonged period of low commodity prices. And unless we take some action, action that is truly effective, we are headed into another round of farm foreclosures and families forced out of business and off the land. 
A recent Iowa State University study, for example, concluded that 2 to 3 straight years of low prices could push as many as a third of Iowa farmers into restructuring or liquidation with disastrous consequences for Iowa's economy. 
I want also to underscore the broad ramifications of this farm crisis on the wider economy. Agriculture is the largest industry in my State of Iowa, as it is in a number of States. When agriculture is in a downturn in Iowa, the entire State economy feels it. 
If we consider the drop in corn and soybean prices alone this year, leaving aside the precipitous drop in hog prices, Iowa's economy this year is going to take a hit of about $1.4 billion. Chopping that much out of Iowa's economy could cost upwards of 26,000 jobs, jobs that we can ill-afford to lose in my State. 
Again, I want to make it clear exactly what part of the conference report I disagree with--the part dealing with loss of income caused by low commodity prices. 
Again, I am not opposing that part of the conference report dealing with disaster assistance, although I did point out that what we had in our package was a little bit more generous to those farmers hard hit by the disasters than what is in this conference report. 
We had worked, Senator Daschle and a number of my colleagues and I had worked on an emergency request sent up by the administration. We made some modifications and additions to the administration's request. We came up with what we considered to be a well-balanced bill. The emergency package that we put together would have provided about $130 million more in disaster-related assistance than the provisions now in the conference report. 
The other essential part of the package, apart from the disaster assistance, is to restore some of the farm income safety net. If we consider those two aspects of the emergency package in tandem, then every State in the United States would have come out better under our proposal than under what is now in the conference report, and that includes the States hard hit by natural disasters. 
Let me explain further why what is in this conference report is inadequate to deal with the problem of low commodity prices. The conference report includes $1.65 billion that would be added to the Agriculture Market Transition Act, otherwise known as AMTA, payments that farmers will receive for fiscal 1999. I understand that these payments would mean an addition of about 19 cents a bushel for wheat and about 11 cents a bushel for corn when considered on the basis of program payment yield. 
Keep in mind there are no payments directed for soybeans or oilseeds in this conference report even though soybean prices have dropped dramatically. 
Also, keep in mind that actual yields are greater than the program payment yields used for calculating the AMTA payments. So if we consider the actual production on farms, the conference report would provide about 13 cents a bushel for wheat and about 7 cents a bushel for corn. Again, no direct assistance for soybeans. 
These levels of assistance are totally inadequate. In fact, a spokesman for one Member of this body said it better than I could. He said the proposal is a `slap in the face' to farmers. Well, it really is. I likened it to giving a person dying of thirst a thimbleful of water; it might relieve suffering momentarily but it really doesn't solve the problem of the person dying of thirst. 
The proposal that Senator Daschle and I along with others put forward is different. This proposal, which has been talked about by others this afternoon, simply would lift the caps from the commodity marketing assistance loan rates. If that was done, our proposal would add about 57 cents a bushel in added income protection for wheat, compared to 13 cents in the conference report, 28 cents a bushel for corn compared to 7 cents a bushel for corn in the conference report, and about 28 cents a bushel for soybeans compared to zero for soybeans in the conference report. I might also point out it would provide higher loan rates for both cotton and rice. 
Our proposal obviously was rejected in conference. That is very unfortunate because it goes much further than what is in the conference report toward addressing the devastating loss of farm income due to low commodity prices. Again, if we have low commodity prices caused by a glut, bumper crops, combined with the loss of foreign markets we are going to have to enact some reasonable income protection to help farmers make it through this economic disaster--a disaster not of their own making. I know there has been a lot of discussion about fast track as though that is the magical solution to everything that is wrong in the farm economy. If only we had fast track, it is suggested, everything would be beautiful. Let's be honest and let's be real about it. Fast track could help us 5 or 7 years from now, which is how long it took to get the Uruguay Round completed. But fast track doesn't help us now. Not in any way does it help the farm families who face foreclosure in the next few months. I say that as someone who has voted for fast track in the past, who voted for NAFTA and voted for the Uruguay Round agreement. I defy anyone to come to the floor and tell me how, if fast track were passed right now, it could possibly help farmers who are in dire straits this year and next year. So fast track may have some benefits down the pike, depending on what comes out of the negotiations, but none in the immediate future. 
Again, I and others who have proposed lifting the caps on marketing loan rates have been accused of going beyond the scope of the farm bill, of reopening the farm bill. Well, the fact is marketing loan are in the farm bill. The bill set a formula for loan rates, but then put an arbitrary cap on the loan rates for budgetary reasons. Taking off the caps and letting the formula already in the bill work, as we are proposing, is not really reopening the farm bill. We are simply taking what is in the farm bill, a tool that is in there, and using the tool to enhance the farm income protections within the basic structure of the 1996 farm bill--simply by removing the caps. That change, combined with extending the loan period, will help farmers well into next year--and next year and the year after if the policy were adopted for the long term as I believe would be desirable. Added AMTA payments will go out this year, and that is it. A lot of the new AMTA payments will go to farmers who will not be farming next year. A lot of that AMTA payment will go to farmers whose landlords will seize the opportunity to increase the rent and take it back in rent payments. So basically the AMTA payment is sort of a one-time payment to farmers, but it really is not going to solve the problem. 
Again, I would like to illustrate the difference between the conference report and what the Democratic plan was. For a 650-acre corn and soybean farm in Iowa with 390 acres of corn base, 260 acres of soybeans, the conference report will provide a $4,230 payment to that farmer. The Democratic proposal, in removing the marketing loan caps, would provide increased income protection of $18,455 or a difference of $14,225 to the farmer with 390 acres of corn and 260 acres of soybeans in Iowa. 
So again, that is a very substantial difference, and it is a difference that would carry through into next year because of the improved income safety net aspect of the marketing assistance loan. The small AMTA supplement is a short term one-time payment. 
So again, I just ask my colleagues from the Corn Belt whether 7 cents a bushel paid out now, but soon gone, is anywhere near enough to address severe farm income problems. Is 13 cents a bushel enough even to begin to address the economic devastation in wheat country? And I ask my colleagues whether a proposal with no direct support for soybeans is adequate to address the steep decline in soybean prices. 
So that is really the question today. The question is whether or not those very small cash payments are going to be adequate for the tremendous farm income problems that are out there. I do not believe so. I do not believe that will help nearly enough--

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, this conference report needs to be rejected and sent back for further work to restore farm income protection by removing the marketing loan rate caps. There are also two other areas in which the conference report is not acceptable. 
I would mention the labeling of beef and lamb for country of origin. The House Republicans rejected this idea. It is too bad, because under the WTO it is allowed, to have country of origin labeling. It is not just for our beef and lamb producers in this country. I believe our consumers have the right to know, when they buy a steak or chop or other cut of beef or lamb at the meat counter, what its country of origin is. 
Second, we had mandatory price reporting in the Senate bill so livestock producers will have information to help them evaluate packer bids for fairness. The conference report converted that bill language into weak report language. We have had study after study after study on pricing practices in the livestock and meat business and the need for more openness and transparency. It is time we have real action, not another study on that. 
For those reasons I believe the conference report ought to be rejected and sent back for further work. If it is not, then I am afraid we will have a one-time payment to farmers this fall and we will be back again here next year with fewer farmers and even more economic devastation in rural America.

Mr. HARKIN. I would like to engage my colleague, Senator Bumpers, the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies in a colloquy regarding the pending legislation. For clarification, I would like the Senator to provide further explanation of language included in the Statement of Managers accompanying the conference report to H.R. 4101. 
It is my understanding that language under the heading of the Agricultural Research Service imposes a limitation on funding for the National Swine Research Center at Ames, Iowa, but is related to operational and maintenance costs for that facility beyond those normally associated with assignments of ARS personnel. This interpretation would not be inconsistent with the general provision of the conference report that prohibits the transfer of title of the Center to USDA.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from South Dakota. This an important issue. Audiologic services are critical in the diagnosis and management of hearing loss. I am concerned that under FEHBP, an efficient and effective avenue to appropriate care is unavailable because FEHBP law does not explicitly identify the option of direct access to audiologists. 
Senator Cochran introduced, and I supported, along with Senator Frist and Pryor, legislation in the 104th Congress to ensure that FEHBP beneficiaries who require audiological services would have the option of direct access to them. 
Earlier this year, I received a letter from Kenneth W. Kizer, M.D., Under Secretary for Health with the Department of Veterans Affairs. In 1992, the VA instituted a policy allowing veterans who suspect a hearing loss to make appointments directly with an audiologist. According to Dr. Kizer, `The VA experience suggests that providing direct access to audiologists for civilian federal employees will result in high quality hearing care and reduce the cost of services.' 
We are not talking about mandating additional benefits. In addition, I believe it would be advisable to add provider non-discrimination assurances to FEHBP plans. 
Of course, these matters involve a number of complicated issues, and to this point, the Governmental Affairs Committee has been unable to hold hearings to consider those issues. I would appreciate hearing Senator Cochran's and Senator Thompson's sense of what can be done, in this Congress or the next, to ensure that those issues are fully considered.

Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues, Chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator Kit Bond, and Ranking Member, Senator John Kerry, for their work in moving H.R. 3412 through Committee. I would also like to thank Senators Bond and Kerry for agreeing to my language requesting a report from the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the 7(A) loan program's reporting requirements on the subsidy rate. I have heard from a number of community bankers in Iowa who have expressed concerns with the monthly reporting requirement. Previously, these reports were submitted quarterly. I am concerned that small banks, especially small rural banks, lack the loan volume or personnel to meet this requirment in a cost effective manner. I look forward to reviewing this report and working with my colleagues and the SBA in addressing this concern. 
In addition to improvements in popular SBA programs, H.R. 3412 also contains a Committee passed amendment, sponsored by Senator Max Cleland and cosponsored by myself, which will allow the SBA to conduct a disaster mitigation pilot program. It is my hope that this program will afford small business owners, particularly in rural areas, the ability to invest in their property to help prevent against natural disasters. By providing small businesses with the tools to invest in their business before disasters strike, property destruction can be avoided and insurance claims can be reduced.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, few individual pieces of legislation embody the spirit of the American dream as does the Higher Education Act. First passed in 1965, this legislation opened the doors of college and a more prosperous future to millions of students. Without federal college grants and loans, most Americans would not be able to get the postsecondary education that is essential in today's competitive international economy. 
The pending legislation--the Higher Education Amendments of 1998--strengthens our nation's commitment to a higher education and I am pleased to support this important piece of legislation. I congratulate Senators Jeffords, Coats, Kennedy, and Dodd for crafting a genuinely bipartisan bill. I appreciate their leadership and commitment to ensuring access to college for millions of Americans. 
My colleagues have extolled the many fine features of this legislation--lower interest rates for students, improved teacher preparation programs and a modernization of the system for delivering student aid. I am in full agreement on the positive aspects of this legislation. 
However, as we all know, legislation involves many compromises and I would feel remiss if I did not also express my disappointment about two provisions in the legislation. 
We are all acutely aware of the soaring debt accumulated by U.S. students. The reduction in the interest rate by nearly eight tenths of a point, will provide critical relief to students. As a result, they will save hundreds of dollars. 
The bill also allows individuals to refinance outstanding loans at a lower interest rate by extending the current interest rate on direct loans for four more months. Thereafter, the interest rate on consolidation loans will increase to the weighted average of the outstanding loans with a cap of 8.25%. The conferees rejected attempts to provide a longer period for consolidation at the lower interest rate with means that many students will be unable to refinance their loans to get more favorable rates. 
Modest cuts in the generous subsidies to lenders and guarantee agencies would have enabled us to provide a longer window for consolidation. It is my sincere hope that we will continue to work together to extent this important benefit to make it easier for individuals to pay off their students loans. 
Secondly, to pay for a lender subsidy for students, the legislation increased the fee that FHA mortgage borrowers will pay to Ginnie Mae in the future from 6 to 9 basis points. If not overturned at a later point, this provision will cost hundreds of extra dollars to modest income homebuyers in order to acquire a mortgage. Clearly, Ginnie Mae which makes insures the mortgages does not need the funding. This is a straightforward tax on modest income homebuyers, often making $25,000 to $40,000 per year inserted into this measure. The conferees may talk about their hope that the 3 basis points will be absorbed by mortgage bankers. But, given that competitive market, most of that cost will be passed on. I will work to overturn this inappropriate source of funds. 
Even though I have reservations about some provisions in this legislation, I believe it is a strong bill and worthy of our support. The bill strengthens Federal student aid programs for the future, and I urge my colleagues to support the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first all, I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island for letting me jump in front of him. I will only take a couple minutes. 
The chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, was in the Chamber earlier talking about the fact that I had not permitted the energy and water conference report to proceed under a unanimous consent agreement. I objected to that. And the reason I did so not objection to the energy bill; I have none. Rather I objected because I wanted to once again bring the attention of the Senate to the fact that we have a very unfair situation presented to us in terms of the allocation of money for the defense portion of fiscal year 1999 Appropriations and for the nondefense portion. 
I again ask Senators to look at the July 30 Congressional Record, page S9404, when I spoke, and there was a short colloquy with Senator Specter, myself, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Domenici at that time. 
Basically, it goes back to a letter that was written on April 2, 1998, by Senator Domenici to Senator Stevens which basically said that by using OMB scoring figures and policy decisions, they had identified $2.2 billion more in outlays for defense by using the OMB policy assumptions rather than CBO policy assumptions. 
At the end of the letter Senator Domenici writes, `Pursuant to your amendment, we are also looking at the issue of nondefense outlay scoring and will report back to you shortly.' 
That was April 27, and we still don't have a report. 
Right now, based on informal preliminary meetings being held with the House, it is clear that a considerable increase over the funding in the Senate bill will be required to meet all of the demands and get this bill signed into law. 
Now, earlier today I spoke to Senator Domenici about this, and Senator Domenici mentioned something to me about $300 million that he had already given. That unfortunately is not my understanding of where we officially stand. We still haven't seen it, and I do not know where it is. If it is $215 million or even $300 million, that still means we are going to have to trim over half a billion dollars from what the preliminary discussions with the House have led us to. 
So where are we going to trim? Head Start? Are we going to cut IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act? Are we going to cut community health centers? Are we going to cut the Ryan White AIDS Program? Drug treatment? How about our vitally important medical research at NIH? Are we going to cut all those? A half a billion dollars we are going to have to cut. 
Well, I and others have said what is fair is fair, and if you use OMB policy statements for defense scoring, you ought to use them for nondefense also. If that were the case, the Labor, Health, and Human Services Subcommittee would not be getting $215 million; it would, in fact, get $770 million--not $215 million. 
So the reason I have said that we need this time--and I will not take a lot of time now because I know that Senator Reed has prepared a speech here, and I don't want to interrupt his time. He was kind enough to give me a couple minutes here just to lay this out. But right now we need fair treatment for these domestic programs, and $215 million doesn't do it. But if we have the same kind of scoring as we got for defense, we should get about $770 million. 
So I just wanted to alert Senators as to why I was taking this course of action. We have been waiting since April 22. We talked about it on July 30. Here we are in the final closing days of the Congress and programs vital to the health, to the education, and the security of the people of this country are going underfunded. 
I don't know what kind of games are being played. I don't know what all is going on behind the scenes. But we are going to continue to demand fairness until we get it. I am sorry that Senator Specter can't be here. Of course, he is home because of the Jewish holy day. I would just again refer to Senator Specter's comments on July 30 of this year in which he basically echoed what I was saying, and that is that we need to get this correct scoring. I would not want to put words in Senator Specter's mouth without him being here, but I believe he feels the same way I do. 
I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for letting me get ahead of him. I yield the floor.  
Mr. REED addressed the Chair.

Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, and I won't object, but I did want to engage in a brief colloquy here with the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee regarding statements I made earlier on the floor that Senator Domenici also made earlier on the floor. 
I did not want to hold up the energy and water bill at all, but I did want to make a strong case that the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee is having some very, very severe problems in meeting the basic health and education needs of the country and the requirements that other Senators and House Members have imposed on us. We simply don't have the outlays necessary to do the job. I asked the help of the Budget Committee chairman in this regard. 
At the outset, again, I want to make clear for the record that Senator Domenici has been a strong supporter of our subcommittee. I know he has worked very hard and very diligently to make sure we do have the kind of resources that we need. However, it is clear that we have come up short. 
I just wanted to ask the Senator from New Mexico if he could, perhaps, enlighten me further as to where we might be on this issue.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee for his diligence in looking at this. 
Believe me, I know it is a tough job. I can only imagine being chairman of the Budget Committee in these times, working under the constraints under which we have to work. I have a lot of sympathy for the Senator's position on this. 
As I said in my opening remarks, I know from my past experience in dealing with the Senator from New Mexico of his strong support for those programs that we have, whether it is IDEA, whether it is drug treatment, or NIH research or community health centers. I could go down the list. I know the Senator from New Mexico has been a strong supporter of these. I am very grateful for his work in diligently finding this extra money in terms of finding the policy differences. And I appreciate his commitment to continue to review these differences and to make other appropriate adjustments. Hopefully, as we move along, there will be others. I pledge to him that I will work closely with him as we move towards completion of the important work on this bill. 
Again, I thank the distinguished Senator for his consideration and his efforts in helping us to get to this point. I appreciate it very much.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding for a question. First of all, I thank the Senator for a very eloquent and forceful statement on what is happening out there and, really, the shame of this Congress in not addressing it. 
As I look at your charts here and see the free-fall in the price of wheat over the last couple of years--since the 1996 so-called Freedom to Farm bill was passed--I look at that and I wonder what happened to the price of bread. Has that come down? What about all the wheat products, like pasta and all the things into which wheat goes? I ask the Senator, what happened? Are the consumers making out on this and getting a cut-rate deal at the grocery store? 
</TEXT>

Mr. HARKIN. One of my neighbors keeps asking me. He said, `I hear about all these farm problems.' He lives in a city. He said, `I can't understand, if the farmers aren't making money, how come I'm not seeing lower prices in the store?' They don't understand that. I think the Senator from North Dakota pointed out that consumers aren't seeing it in the store. The fact is that bread has gone up in the last couple years, not down. The large grain companies, the shippers, the monopolies are reaping a windfall. They are buying these products from the farmer, not at wholesale, but at fire sale prices. 
In listening to the Senator, I could not help but remember what John Kennedy said in Sioux City, IA, when he was running for President in 1960. He made the statement: `The farmer is the only person who buys retail, sells wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.' Well, now today farmers aren't even selling wholesale. They are selling at fire sale prices--not only wheat, but corn and soybeans. And pork prices, this year, are probably going to average their lowest since 1974. They are working at extremely low cattle prices. So all across the agricultural sector, we have a terrible crisis. 
Now, as the Senator pointed out again last night in our conference committee, when we met to try to do something, to answer this crisis and need in rural America, we were told that, no, we would not do it, we can only do a little bit. I liken last night to somebody dying of thirst and you give them a thimbleful of water. That is what those who we were in conference with last night basically did to the farmers. They slapped them in the face and gave them a thimbleful of water when they are dying of thirst. It is a shame. 
It came down to a straight party-line vote. It is very unfortunate that it had to be on a party-line basis when this issue begs for nonpartisanship and bipartisanship. Yet, it has evolved into a partisan situation. That is a real shame. I think it is a shame that our colleagues voted against any meaningful help. As the Senator pointed out, we had about a $3 billion difference. In other words, for $3 billion, we could have really met the needs of farmers all over this country--not only the farmers in Iowa and North Dakota, but the farmers in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and all over the country. Farmers who are either suffering from the fall in prices, or because they have had a drought, or floods, or disease. All of these things have piled up this year to really put agriculture in dire straits. 
No, they don't have the money for that, as the Senator pointed out, but they do have money for an $80 billion tax cut. 
I am sure the Senator would agree with me. I met with farmers in Iowa not too long ago and I talked about this tax cut. I said, `Who do you think is going to get it? I will give you a hint: It isn't you.' They are not going to get it; it is going to go to upper-income people. We know that. But for $3 billion we could have really helped pull these farmers out. And we still can if we have the will. 
I ask the Senator from North Dakota in my closing question--and I thank him again for his strong support for the American farmer, the family farmer, and for always being front and center here on the floor and in our committee meetings, for fighting for those family farmers. Lord knows, we don't have too many people around here fighting for them anymore. But the strength and the passion and courage of the Senator from North Dakota has gone a long way toward at least helping us get this far, getting something through to help our farmers--even though it is not going to be enough to save them, unless we can have some more action on the floor. The Senator has indicated that when that bill comes back, we are going to have more action on this floor. We are not going to go away quietly. I join with the Senator from North Dakota in saying that. We are not going to go away quietly. 
We are going to be here until the last bell rings of this Congress to do everything we can to help those family farmers. 
I thank the Senator from North Dakota again for his eloquent remarks and for his steadfastness in standing up for those who really are the backbone of this country, those who have worked hard, produced our food and fiber and the products they have raised in our export channels have been the only thing that has kept our balance of payments and our balance of trade with other countries at least somewhat positive. It has only been agriculture. It hasn't been anything else, just agriculture. And yet to let them go down the drain because of monopoly practices I think is just a shame, and I think it is something we have to address. 
I thank the Senator from North Dakota for, again, leading the fight.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to establish a more independent budget process for the Inspector Generals of each federal Department. 
Under our current budget process, each federal Department Secretary has the power to determine the budget of its Inspector General or IG. While our Department Secretaries generally do a fine job of overseeing their respective Departments and agencies, I feel that it is a conflict of interest for the head of an executive agency to also determine the funding levels for an office whose main function is investigating that agency. In the interest of proper checks and balances, I would hope that we could establish true independence for the IGs budgets. 
The IGs are our government watchdogs. Yet, too often, their budgets have been cut back. The United States government is wrestling with streamlining its programs and revamping how it does business. But it has been the IG offices which have largely identified the waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government and allow this body to make significant budget cuts in an effective manner. We need stronger watchdogs, not weaker. 
The offices of Inspectors General has served this country well in making sure that the taxpayers' dollars are not misspent. This spring, for example, the Department of Defense's IG, Eleanor Hill, testified before the House Oversight Subcommittee. She described over $15 billion in fiscal year 1996 funds that were put to better use as a result of IG efforts. Hill pointed out that, `At the Department of Defense, since FY 1989, IG audit reports have identified almost $16 billion in agreed upon savings. During the same period, monetary recoveries through investigations by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of my office, have totaled over $4.5 billion. Historically, our criminal investigators alone have returned at least $15 in recoveries and fines for every dollar spent on their operations.' 
In her testimony, DOD Inspector General Eleanor Hill concludes with what she feels are the greatest concerns for the future of the Office of Inspector General. She points out examples of crimes on the Internet, the overload of paperwork and false claims. But the biggest problem, according to Ms. Hill, `has been the continuing difficulties we face in coping with programmed downsizing.' As we attempt to cut wasteful spending and streamline offices, it is the office of Inspectors General which must not be put on the chopping block. 
Unfortunately, the support for the IGs has been often reduced more than for other parts of the government. For example, the Department of Energy faced an 11% cut for FY 1996, but a 21% cut in its IG budget. It is my fear that as we continue to cut budgets, the IGs will be first on the chopping blocks at a time when we need them even more to identify wasteful and outdated programs. 
It should be obvious, Mr. President, that those who could be investigated by the Inspectors General should not be given the responsibility of developing and approving IG budgets. The Securities and Exchange Commission's budget is not decided by Wall Street firms; The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's budget is not decided by the nation's nuclear power companies. Congress must ensure that no department secretary can take vengeance upon an aggressive IG office. 
My bill aims to ensure an effective and independent federal Inspector General system and allow each IG, in consultation with its parent Department, to decide the budget of the IG's office. This bill would provide greater autonomy for the office and prevent strong criticism of a Department, or the singling out of wasteful programs, from affecting watchdog funding. 
We have seen repeatedly how a valuable resource like the Inspector General's office has been able to bring this body's attention, and the American public's attention, to some of the wasteful spending of the federal government. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. HARKIN. I yield whatever time I consume. 
Mr. President, this amendment that we have offered is cosponsored by Senators Dorgan, Conrad, Wellstone, Robert Kerrey, and Senator Bryan. 
Because of the actions of the Federal Open Market Committee, real interest rates are rising. In fact, real interest rates are at historically high levels, the highest in 9 years, because inflation has fallen while the Federal Reserve failed to lower the Federal funds rate. 
This chart points it out. The Federal funds rate continues to go up at about 3.9 percent. Fed Chairman Greenspan said in February of this year: 
Statistically, it is a fact that real interest rates are higher now than they have been on the average of the post-World War II period. 
I have said time and again that the high interest rate policy being imposed by the Federal Reserve is a stealth tax on hard-working American families, and I believe it is a contributing factor to the near collapse of several economies worldwide. 
Again, interest rates have a significant impact on virtually every family in America, every producer, business, and family farmer in this country. Lower rates have been needed for some time, but now quick action is truly crucial for our country's well-being. The economic signs not only in the U.S. economy but in economies worldwide demand swift and appropriate action. 
I note in the front page of the Washington Post this morning it says, `Signs Point to Interest Rate Cut,' and: 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan will testify before Congress today amid growing signs that he may propose cutting interest rates when Fed policymakers meet next Tuesday. 
And it goes on to say how many executives and economists have called for that. 
Now, the amendment that I have at the desk reads that we ask the Federal Open Market Committee to promptly reduce interest rates. Now, the Senator from New Mexico had suggested that perhaps we might want to alter that a little bit to just say that perhaps we should advise them or urge them to do something like that. 
I refer back to a congressional resolution passed by the Senate on December 18, 1982. It passed by 93-0. I believe the Senator from New Mexico may have been here at that time. I didn't check that, but I think he may have been here at that time. It passed 93-0. That resolution also called on the Fed to reduce interest rates. I will just read one sentence of it: 
It is the sense of the Congress that they should continue to take such actions as are necessary to achieve and maintain a level of interest rates low enough to generate significant economic growth, and thereby reduce the current intolerable level of unemployment. 
At that time, December 18, 1982, the Senate saw fit by a vote of 93-0 to tell the Federal Open Market Committee that they should do something. That is what we are saying here in this resolution. They should promptly reduce interest rates because every sign points to the need to do so. Again, we could say that they should consider doing it, but I am just saying in 1982 we didn't say they should consider taking such actions. The resolution said, `They should continue to take such actions.' 
So there was a direction from the Senate at that time to the Fed. To those who say we shouldn't interfere with the Fed, I say where in the Constitution of the United States is the Federal Reserve system given such a standing? It is nowhere to be found in the Constitution. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives the power to coin and regulate the power of money to Congress. We have, of course, delegated that power to the Federal Reserve System under the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, many times. Obviously, I don't believe Congress should coin money or regulate the value it. We couldn't do it. That is why we have the Federal Reserve. 
However, as policymakers, because the Federal Reserve is a creature of Congress, it exists only because of an amended law, passed by Congress. We have the right, and I believe the obligation, to tell the Federal Reserve what we feel, what we hear, what we see, what we think is happening in the economy. We are the policymakers and we should give them that guidance and direction when and if we believe that we should do so. 
Again, if there are those who don't believe that we should reduce interest rates, that we shouldn't tell the Federal Reserve that they should reduce interest rates, that I can understand. That is a clear policy difference. But to say that we shouldn't tell the Fed what to do flies in the face, I believe, of our responsibilities and our obligations as policymakers here in the U.S. Senate. 
Policy wise, I believe they should lower interest rates. So does the head of the National Association of Manufacturers, the president of General Motors, and a number of other economists both on the conservative side and on the liberal side. They are saying that we should lower interest rates. 
I think the purpose of this resolution and why I am offering it is to back up what I understand Chairman Greenspan is attempting to do. I understand there are still some members of the Federal Open Market Committee who don't believe we should lower interest rates. I think we should send them a very strong signal. We should back up what I understand Chairman Greenspan is now saying that they probably ought to do, and that is lower interest rates. That is the purpose of this amendment.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment does not set monetary policy. It is a nonbinding sense of the Congress. William Gaston from the Congressional Research Service writes in a CRS report that, `Congress has enacted nonbinding language to express its monetary policy preferences to the Fed.' 
The last time this Senate debated a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to ask the Fed to lower interest rates was December 
18, 1982. Again, I will read--it did not say it should seriously consider, it said, `It is declared that it is the sense of the Congress that they should continue to take such actions as are necessary.' That is what it said in 1982. It didn't say they should `seriously consider,' but they should `take such actions.' 
That is what this amendment says. It says they should reduce interest rates. The Business Roundtable said, `The President and Congress should encourage the Federal Reserve to lower U.S. interest rates. . .' not to seriously consider it.

Mr. HARKIN. This says, `The President and Congress should encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.' It didn't say we should have them consider it. That time has passed. I might have agreed with the Senator from New Mexico a year ago, that they should consider it. Now the time is critical. If the Federal Open Market Committee doesn't act next week, they don't meet again until November. That is why it is so crucial that we, as policymakers, send a strong signal, not that they should consider reducing interest rates, but they ought to do it. We ought to back up what we know is right, back up what the Business Roundtable and almost every economist is saying that we have to do. Is that interfering with the Fed? Not at all. But it is telling them what we, as policymakers, believe and feel they should do at their next meeting, and that is to promptly reduce interest rates. 
I thank the Senator from New Mexico.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, usually when votes are cast, I don't like to revisit them. People have their reasons; we vote and we move on around here. But I heard so much in the well from people voting on this last sense-of-the-Senate resolution that I felt I should take a little bit of time to perhaps clarify a couple of things and to make an additional point. 
First of all, this was a sense-of-the-Congress amendment. It was nonbinding. Someone said, `We shouldn't be legislating what the Federal Reserve should do.' With that I wholeheartedly agree. We were not legislating a law to tell the Federal Reserve what to do, No. 1. That is my first point. This was a nonbinding sense of the Congress--we adopt those all the time around here--basically to say, `Here is what I, a policymaker, think should be done.' 
Secondly, this is not without precedent. This body has in the past voted on sense-of-the Congress amendments and resolutions that have told the Fed what we believe they should do. 
Third, I heard it said that we should not be politicizing the Fed. With that I wholeheartedly agree. But article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof to the Congress of the United States. It did not give it to the Federal Reserve System. 
The Congress, in its wisdom, in the past set up the Federal Reserve System to do that. We delegated our powers to the Fed to do that. Over the intervening years, we have amended the Federal Reserve Act. It is not carved in stone. It has been amended and changed several times since 1913. But the Federal Reserve System remains a creature of Congress. It exists only by the laws passed by the Congress. It is not a separate branch of Government. 
It is not some kind of supreme being, some kind of item of sanctity that we can never touch. I believe it is not only our right but our responsibility as policymakers at certain times, if we feel a certain way, to be able to tell the Federal Reserve System what we believe they should do. 
So on this past vote I have no quarrel with anyone who believes the Federal Reserve should not lower interest rates. I may debate that point with them, because I believe they should lower interest rates. That is a good debating point. But if someone voted on this and said no, the Federal Reserve should not lower interest rates, that I believe is a valid position that someone might hold, of which I disagree.

Mr. HARKIN. Let me finish this, and I will. 
But to say we cannot vote to tell the Fed what to do because it would be politicizing it or we cannot interfere I believe somehow is an abdication of our responsibilities, not only our rights but our responsibilities as policymakers to tell a creature of the Congress what we believe they should do. We do not do it very often in terms of the Fed. In fact, I pointed out the last time we had a Sense of the Congress calling on the Fed to lower interest rates was in 1982. So this is not something we take lightly. 
But I believe at this point in time, with the world economy being what it is, with the tremendous drop in commodities and commodity prices here and around the world, with the specter of depression and deflation facing us--almost every economist, conservative, liberal, head of the Business Roundtable, head of General Motors, head of the National Association of Manufacturers, all say the Fed should lower interest rates. 
I offered this amendment, along with others, in good faith, to back them up to say, yes, you should lower interest rates. And that is what this was meant to do, to send that sense of the Congress that that is what we believe they should do. Obviously, we did not prevail. So I can only assume that most people do not believe they should lower interest rates. 
I would be delighted to yield to my friend from Nevada for a question.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Utah. 
Again, this raises another issue that was not in the sense-of-the-Congress amendment that I sent to the desk on which we just expressed ourselves. 
I wanted to get back to the point, again, that it is a creature of Congress. I am somewhat disturbed, not so much by the outcome of the vote. I have lost votes around this place before. That is not the point. But the issue is the kind of talk that I heard among Senators after voting on this that, (a) we shouldn't politicize the Fed; (b) we shouldn't tell the Fed what to do; (c) the Fed is a separate entity and we shouldn't have anything to do with them. 
I just don't understand where this comes from. I don't understand why this is the perception of so many people. I don't know why the Federal Reserve System has become so sacrosanct that we simply cannot deal with it. It is like the `Holy of Holies.' 
I find it strange that, as policymakers, we can't stand up and tell the Fed what we think they should do. That is not politicizing it. To politicize it would be for us to pass a law mandating that interest rates be at a certain level, or a law mandating that the Federal Reserve should vote this way or that. That is politicizing. That is what this Senator would even vote against. 
But for the Senate to say to the Federal Reserve, a creature of the Congress, we have looked at the landscape, we see what is happening in our economy, we see what is happening worldwide, we don't like what we see. We believe that the time has come to lower interest rates. We believe something should be done. 
Now, again, I see nothing wrong with this debate. I think that is part not only of our rights, but our responsibility. 
I want to take a couple more minutes to say why I believe so deeply and so strongly that we should be saying to the Fed that they should lower interest rates. Sometimes you would think this is a liberal proposition. I don't define it in terms of left, right, liberal, conservative. I really don't define it in that way. I define it in terms of whether or not we believe interest rates should be lower or whether we think they shouldn't be lower; whether we think the economy is going into a recession, or whether we think the economy may be verging on inflation. If you think the economy is experiencing an acceleration of inflation, you would not want to cut interest rates; if you think the economy is verging on recession, you would want to lower interest rates. 
That is where I believe we are. Don't take my word for it. I will point out what the Business Roundtable said on September 16, last week: 
The President and Congress should encourage the Federal Reserve to lower U.S. interest rates. In addition, the President, Congress and the Federal Reserve should work with our international trading partners to stimulate their domestic economies. 
. . .. should encourage the Federal Reserve to lower U.S. interest rates. 
It doesn't say we should ask the Fed to `consider.' It doesn't say that. It says they should `lower' the rates, not `consider.' 
There is talk that the Senator from New Mexico wants an amendment to say that we would just consider, that we should tell the Fed they should consider lowering interest rates. I don't believe that language is strong enough. Again, it is as if for some reason we almost have to ask the Fed for their permission to tell them what we think they should do.

Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question to my friend from Minnesota. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-harkin-ia-38-19980923</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Sure. I thank the Senator. That is really the point. I have a chart to show that the real Federal funds rate is at its highest level in nine years. What does that mean? What that means is that real rates of interest are at a very high point. For example, even Chairman Greenspan said earlier this year that real interest rates are at a historically high level, compared to all the years from World War II until now. 
What does that mean? Well, that means that the farmers in America whose commodity prices are going down all the time, our livestock producers and our farmers have to pay exorbitantly high interest rates--real interest rates--when they are already squeezed with low prices. It means that our business sector, small businesses, and others who are creating jobs, who need to borrow money for expansion or even for job training or retraining, find that they are squeezed because of high interest rates. So they don't do it. So what happens then is our economy starts to slow down. 
I will point out that in the first quarter of this year, our growth was 5.5 percent; it was 1.6 percent in the last quarter. Many economic signs point to a possible recession, possibly a downward spiral in prices. Then we see what is happening in foreign economies and in foreign currencies. Because of our high interest rates, we find that their economies are going down and they, in turn, can't buy any of our products because of the excessively strong dollar that we have. So when you add it all up, because of the insistence of the Fed to keep a tight money policy, high interest rate policy, they have moved us to the brink of recession. 
In further responding to the Senator's question, from 1994 to 1995 the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 100 percent, from three percent to six percent. They raised interest rates because they were beholden--most of them, or at least the voting majority--to an economic theory called NAIRU, Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. That is a fancy term. What some economists have believed in the past is if unemployment fell to a certain level, inflation would take off and it would spiral upward and accelerate--it would not just rise, it would accelerate, if unemployment got to a certain level. 
Well, a couple years ago, economists said they thought that rate was 6 percent. They thought that if unemployment went below 6 percent, we would be in deep trouble. Then unemployment went below 6 percent and the Fed said, `Oh, my gosh, we have to tighten monetary policy,' and they started raising interest rates. Inflation never went up. Then unemployment went down. And, they said, `Well, we changed our minds. The natural rate of unemployment is actually 5.5 percent.' Well, then unemployment went below 5.5 percent. Now we are at 4.5 percent unemployment, and still no inflation. Yet, the Federal Reserve has continued to keep a tight money, high interest rate policy in effect, because they were afraid; they felt that because of this economic theory, inflation was going to take off. 
What happened is, because of that high interest rate policy, our farmers are squeezed, our consumers are squeezed, homeowners have to pay more monthly interest on mortgages on their homes, small businesses pay more money when they borrow to expand, or they just don't do it. A larger business, whether it is General Motors or Ford, would have to pay higher interest rates. The economy starts to slow down. That is exactly what happened. 
I submit further to my friend from Minnesota that because of their policies over the last couple years, because they would not 
move, it has helped generate the kind of economic collapse we have seen in other parts of the world. The high interest rate policy at the Fed is a contributing factor to the continual decline of the Asian economy.

Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right. I wish the Fed would pay more attention to Bill Greider's writings. Monetary policy has to work for all of our people, not just a few. It has to be cognizant of what is happening to ordinary people in this country. 
As the Senator spoke about what is happening internationally, I was looking through the papers. The Wall Street Journal pointed this out in an editorial on August 31, calling for the Fed to lower interest rates. They said, `Since last year, currencies in emerging markets, from Thailand to Russia, have been collapsing like popped bubble wrap.' This is a significant threat to us and people in those countries. Our dollar is much too strong right now. Because of that, they can't get the kinds of foodstuffs and things they need for their own people.

</DOC>

<DOCNO>105-harkin-ia-44-19980923</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. It is bigger by a tremendous magnitude. 
We deal here in budgets in terms of billions of dollars. I know it sounds like a lot of money. But what the Fed does affects the entire $7 trillion economy. 
The Senator from Minnesota is absolutely right, what the Federal Reserve System does has a more profound effect on the daily lives of our citizens--how they live, how they are able to take care of their families, what kind of jobs they have, and what they have paid--than anything that we ever vote on around here in terms of budget matters. 
I thank the Senator for his inquiries and enlightenment on this issue. He has been a long-time fighter for the average working families and making sure that working people get a fair deal. I know the Senator from Minnesota understands that if you have lower interest rates, that helps working families. It helps families. 
The Senator from Minnesota also knows, as most of us know, that in the last couple of years, with this tight money policy, this high interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, some people have said, `Well, gee, whatever they have done has been good. Our economy is great. Whatever the Fed has done is good. Look at what is happening in our economy. Look what is happening in our economy. Unemployment is down.' 
That is true. But if unemployment is so low, I ask you, why is it that when I went to Sioux City last Friday and visited the food bank, or earlier on when I visited the food bank in Des Moines, I was told by the directors of those two food banks that their demand for commodity foods--that the USDA commodities plus the food they get contributed from businesses, churches, and schools--is skyrocketing higher than ever? 
I did some checking. It is not only in Iowa, but in almost every State, the demand for food at our food banks has gone up in the last year or so. Why? If everyone is working, unemployment is so low, and the Fed has done such a great job, it is because, as I have been told and as I have found out, many of these people are working--usually single parents, usually single mothers with one or more children. They go to work every day. They work every day. They make a paycheck. They qualify for food stamps. They get food stamps. And then the food stamps run out before the end of the month. The only place they have to go is to the food bank to get free food. 
Don't take my word for it. Ask your staffs. Go out and ask your food banks. In any State, go out and ask those food banks. Find out what is happening. You will find that it is true. The demand for food from those food banks has gone up and continues to go up, and they are concerned about what is going to happen this winter. 
What has that to do with the Federal Reserve System? I am just saying, if they have done such a good job in this economy, why are they falling below the safety net? Because the high interest rate policy has ignored what is happening to the working families of America. A lower interest rate policy, everyone agrees, might mean that wages might go up and that businesses might be able to pay more in wages. I don't see anything drastically wrong with that. I think it would be a good thing for this country if wages went up. It would give people a little bit more buying power. 
Again, what we are seeing happen in our country happened in the 1920s. Fewer and fewer people are making more and more money. More and more people are making less and less and having less of a stake in our economy. It is true. It is happening in the agriculture sector, too. 
Neil Harroly, the distinguished agricultural economist at Iowa State, said what we are seeing in agriculture is not like the 1980s, it is like the 1920s. I think that is also what we are seeing happening in our country, too. So that is why I make the strong case that we have an obligation. 
I see my friend from Florida is ready to speak. I am going to wrap up very shortly, but I just want to make a couple of points. 
The Federal Open Market Committee may or may not be in a mode to lower interest rates. I quote the September 18 issue of the Christian Science Monitor, which noted that some Fed policymakers `remain in a hawkish anti-inflation mode rather than worrying about the impact of deflation.' 
These include William Poole, president of the St. Louis Regional Fed; Fed Governor Edward Gramlich; and an analyst, Jerry Gordon, president of the Cleveland Fed. 
I don't say that. I am just quoting from the Christian Science Monitor.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President. 
As David Wisk, chief economist of Standard & Poor's DRI, has complained, `They have got to come around. I'm not sure what it will take.' 
Let me repeat that. As David Wisk, chief economist of Standard & Poor's DRI, said, `They'--the Federal Reserve--`have got to come around. I'm not sure what it will take.' 
I thought one of the things it might take is for the Senate of the United States to clearly express itself to the members of the Federal Open Market Committee to lower interest rates now. 
There are increasing signs of a possible recession. Thirty-year Treasury bond rates have sunk to record lows and are now below the short-term Federal funds rate. This is a drastic warning signal. 
Again, I would point to the chart here `30-year Bonds' now lower than the Federal funds rate. That should scare us all. That should point to what we have to do in terms of lowering our short-term interest rates. Wholesale prices slid a steep 0.4 percent in August. In fact, for the first 8 months of this year producer prices have fallen at a 1.4-percent annual rate, compared with a 1.2-percent rise in 1997. 
Again, I have talked about our farmers at great length and about what is happening to them and what is happening to our commodity prices. 
I would start to wrap up my comments again just by saying that if someone voted because they don't want to lower interest rates, that is fine. While I think they are wrong, I will be glad to debate that, if we could ever get a debate on this issue in the Senate; no one seems to want to debate that issue. 
Do we say somehow we can't express ourselves in telling the Federal Open Market Committee that they should lower interest rates--our language said promptly reduce interest rates--that somehow we can't say that because the Fed is independent, because the Fed is so sacrosanct that we can't touch it, that somehow we have to couch it in weak terms such as the Fed should only `consider' lowering interest rates? Why do we have to beg the Federal Open Market Committee to do something? Does the Congress of the United States work for the Federal Reserve System? Are they our bosses? Are they the ones who pull the strings and tell us what we can and cannot do? 
We seem very reluctant in even expressing our views, because somehow it would politicize the Fed. We were not politicizing the Fed; that would take legislation. This was a sense-of-the-Congress, a non-binding resolution. 
I hope that the members of the Federal Open Market Committee will promptly reduce interest rates six days from today. Unfortunately, as the Christian Science Monitor recently reported, there are members of the Fed Open Market Committee who still believe we should worry about an acceleration in inflation. I am just hopeful that Mr. Greenspan and others do not take this vote as a vote that they should not reduce interest rates. 
A number of Senators said to me, `Well, that's what they are going to do anyway.' Well, I am not so certain. I hope they will. They should have reduced interest rates two years ago when I took to the floor at that time and started calling on the Fed to do that because there were drastic signs in our economy, that there was little inflation in the economy, that there was no reason for them not to reduce interest rates at that time to help our farmers and our working families out there. I just hope it is not too late. I just hope that the Federal Reserve does not misinterpret this vote. 
One of the reasons that I objected to the Senator from New Mexico bringing up this other sense of the Senate that would just ask them to consider lowering interest rates is that I personally believe it is beneath our dignity and our responsibility and rights as Senators to go hat in hand to the Federal Reserve and sort of beg them to do something when we ought to be able to stand on our own two feet and tell them what we believe they should do. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, tomorrow I will be laying down a Sense of the Congress amendment calling on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates as a preemptive strike against a recession in 1999. This is a very crucial issue coming at this point in time. I am going to take some time to speak about it and lay out why it is necessary for us, I believe, to take this kind of action and to express ourselves. 
The amendment I will be offering on behalf of myself and Senators Dorgan, Conrad, Wellstone, Kerrey, and Bryan will urge the Federal Open Market Committee to promptly reduce short-term interest rates as a preemptive strike against a recession in 1999. One week from today, the Federal Open Market Committee will meet to vote on interest rate policy. That is why it is crucial that the Senate send a clear message to the Fed: `Lower interest rates now.' 
Mr. President, if we want to significantly decrease the number of bankruptcies in this country, one of the best ways to accomplish this important goal is to reduce the risk of people losing their jobs. 
With the chance of deflation and a recession rising, we need to lower interest rates. 
Over 2 years ago, against the conventional wisdom of the time, I took to the floor of the Senate to speak and to openly put a hold on Chairman Alan Greenspan's renomination to the Federal Reserve Board until we had a debate on U.S. monetary policy. 
One of the reasons I did this was to ensure that we had a significant debate on the Fed's focus only on inflation to the exclusion of other factors. I believed then, and I believe now, that it is wrong for the Fed to maintain high real interest rates without any significant signs of inflation threatening our country. 
I believed at the time, and I continue to believe, that we should lower interest rates, allow the economy to grow, and to provide a maximum level of employment. Specifically, I said at the time that I thought our economy could grow at least at a rate of 3.5 percent a year for a number of consecutive years, with an expansion of the labor force and improved productivity. I also argued that we could at the same time have an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent a year without triggering a significant level of inflation. 
That is what I said 2 years ago. At the time, many economists and economic writers took me to task on this, openly questioning my views. Many of these economists believed in a theory--an economic theory--which called NAIRU, which stands for the `nonaccelerating inflationary rate of unemployment.' I will get to that and what it means in just a moment. 
But a couple of years ago, advocates of NAIRU, believed that if the unemployment rate fell below a certain rate--at that time it was somewhere between 5.5 and 6 percent--if the unemployment rate went below that level, employers would have to significantly raise wages and salaries igniting a 1970s style of inflation. And these economic theorists believed that the Fed should raise interest rates as a preemptive strike against inflation. 
In other words, if unemployment ever fell to that level, regardless of anything else, these economic theorists under this theory believed that the Fed should raise interest rates right away to preempt any inflation from occurring. 
That is what the Fed has done in the past. They have raised interest rates to a very high level. 
But look where we are today. The unemployment rate currently is at 4.5 percent. It has been below 5 percent for nearly a year and a half, and it has been under 6 percent for 4 years. And there is no inflation. Our gross domestic product was 3.8 percent last year and 5.5 percent during the first quarter of this year. During this time, inflation hasn't gone up. In fact, it has gone down. 
The rate has decreased to its lowest level since the 1960s during the past 2 years. 
To Chairman Greenspan's credit, he has recently distanced himself from the view that there should be a preemptive increase in interest rates, simply because of NAIRU. He has, through his actions at the Fed, allowed our economy to grow and unemployment to fall without raising interest rates. 
So unemployment has fallen from 6, to 5.5, to 5, to 4.5 percent. Under NAIRU, this would have triggered automatic increases in interest rates, but under Mr. Greenspan they have not. And I applaud him for that. 
Unfortunately, many on the Federal Open Market Committee have continued to push for higher interest rates even as the signs of an economic slowdown in the United States continue. While they have not succeeded in raising interest rates, they represent a major obstacle against lowering interest rates, an action which is becoming increasingly needed. 
Real interest rates are at a historical high. Although the Federal Open Market Committee has not directly raised interest rates since March of 1997, real interest rates are rising. In fact, real interest rates are at historically high levels, the highest in 9 years, because inflation has continued to fall while the Federal Reserve has failed to lower the Federal funds rate. The chart that I have here points that out. 
This chart shows, for example, the real Federal funds rate. That is the market rate less the CPI percentage. As we can see, it has been, for a short period--from 1996 to 1997--going up, and last year and this year has gone up. Actually, this tick, it would be going up here again over the last few weeks. So we have about 4 percent real Federal funds rate right now. In fact, even Chairman Greenspan noted during his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on February 24 of this year:  
Statistically it is a fact that real interest rates are higher now than they have been on the average of the post-World War II period. 
That is a quote from Mr. Greenspan. It is a fact that real interest rates are higher now than they have been on the average of the post-World War II period. I ask why--why are real interest rates so high? There is no inflation; no signs of inflation. In fact, the economy is slowing down a little bit. We see some recessionary signs. Yet we still have these high interest rates. The high interest rate policy that is being imposed by the Federal Reserve, I have always said, is really a stealth tax on hard-working American families, and I believe it is a contributing factor to the near collapse of several economies worldwide. 
It is time for the FOMC, the Federal Open Market Committee, to provide a significant and immediate cut in interest rates as a preemptive strike against a recession in 1999. Interest rates have a significant impact on virtually every family in America, on every producer, business and family farmer in this country. I believe lower interest rates have been needed for a long time, but now quick action is truly crucial for our country's well-being. 
The economic signs, not only in the U.S. economy but in economies worldwide, demand swift and appropriate action to counteract the problems that lie ahead. I can only say that I believe we have waited too long. Just as inflation can spiral, and spiral out of control, so can deflation spiral out of control. I hope that because the Federal Reserve would not act a little sooner, that we have not reached a point where we are now in a deflationary spiral, and that even more drastic action may have to be taken. But I do believe that significant action has to be taken right now to lower these interest rates. 
Don't just take my word for it. Here is a quote from Mr. Jerry Jasinowski, the President of the National Association of Manufacturers, and Earnest Deavenport, the CEO of Eastman Chemical Company. On September 8th they said: 
The current volatility in world financial markets and its threat to global growth . . . could lead to recessions throughout the developing world and Eastern Europe, as well as a slowdown in the United States. 
Here is what they said on this chart, on September 8: 
We recommend a significant loosening of monetary policy. Specifically, the Federal funds and the discount rates should be reduced by 50 basis points as soon as possible.' 
That is what they said on September 8. 
Or we can listen to Mr. John Smith, President of General Motors. On September 15th he said, here it is on this chart here: 
The question is whether the Fed will wait until the recession is imported and then act, or act now. GM believes it should act now. 
That is the President of General Motors on September 15, just last week. 
Or, James Glassman at the American Enterprise Institute, he has written several op-eds in the Washington Post calling on the Fed to lower interest rates. Again he said recently: 
The most important step right now is for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. That would pump more money into the system, encouraging businesses to borrow and consumers to spend. It would also temporarily weaken the dollar, thus helping the currencies of countries in dire economic straits. 
I could go on all day quoting business leaders, economists, editorial writers and others calling on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. From the Business Roundtable to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to the Economic Policy Institute and progressive economist Jamie Galbraith at the University of Texas, from the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, to Robert Samuelson at the Washington Post, and Stephen Roach at the New York Times, the message to the Fed is clear: Lower interest rates now. 
The Fed's policy needs to be reversed and interest rates significantly lowered or our growing economy is likely to quickly sink, perhaps into a very serious recession. So, what we need is to lower interest rates as a preemptive strike against these ominous economic signs. 
If we do not do this soon, we will see our hopes for higher wages, more jobs, and the end of Federal deficits dashed on the rocks of recession and rising unemployment. We could be driven by deflation rather than fearing inflation. With deflation, people delay major purposes because they know it is going to be cheaper later on. The last time, of course, that we saw significant deflation was in the Great Depression of the 1930s, but it used to happen regularly in the last century. 
How bad can it get? From 1929 to 1933, wages fell by 25 percent; wholesale prices fell by 30 percent; farm commodities fell by 51 percent. And with the shrinking economy, unemployment increased from 5.3 percent to 36.3 percent. Prices were cheaper, but with no money coming in, most people could not benefit at all. 
Today, the signs of increasing global deflation are widespread. The problems in the U.S. economy are greatly exacerbated by the enormous difficulties in many Asian Pacific nations, Russia, Latin America and Mexico. 
As former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury C. Fred Bergsten wrote in the Washington Post on September 20th: 
The Asian economic crisis is much deeper, much more pervasive and likely to last much longer than anyone imagined. Economies that had grown 6 to 8 percent annually for two decades are declining by like or greater amounts, a swing of Depression-era magnitude with incalculable political and social consequences. The contagion has already spread far beyond Asia, engulfing Russia and much of Latin America, and could do so even more violently in the days ahead. We now face a truly global crisis, which has already hit the United States hard and will do so with increasing force. 
The fall in the Canadian and Australian dollars, two countries largely dependent on agriculture and mining is a demonstration of the worldwide impact of the deflationary trend in commodities. 
A far more severe threat is the long-term economic paralysis of the Japanese economy which has turned into a significant recession. Some predict that a bailout of the Japanese banks could cost as much as 20 percent of Japan's entire GDP. 
That is much larger than our savings and loan crises back in the 1980s. Some estimate that the bad loans of Japanese banks may be about $1 trillion. It is unfortunately clear that the Japanese government is not moving quickly enough to resolve the difficulties in their financial sector. The Japanese have already seen their wholesale prices decline in 5 of the last 6 years. To further illustrate this point, I would like to quote an article in September 14 Wall Street Journal which I found very troubling. 
It says:  
News that Japan has fallen into its longest economic contraction in 5 decades has led some economists and government officials to suggest that the country has nudged closer to a viscous spiral of falling prices, falling employment and falling output that would damage its economy even further.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the second largest economy, Japan's poor economic situation is going to have a very significant effect on our economy and the economies of most other countries. 
Again I quote Fred Bergsten, a very respected expert in international economics. He urges that `the United States and European Union should globalize the strategy of cutting their own interest rates. This would encourage capital reflows to the crisis countries, reduce their debt burdens and improve their competitive position by promoting a stronger yen. It would also ensure continued world growth and help prevent further stock market declines.' 
Mr. Bergsten went on to note the fact that the 30-year bond interest rate is below the Fed funds rate and urged a cut in this rate by a full percentage point. 
Chairman Greenspan recently said that the U.S. can't `remain an oasis of prosperity' in `a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress.' 
Again, this statement does appear to be a significant and positive shift in the views of the Chairman of the Fed. 
However, I am concerned that there are members of the Federal Open Market Committee who both refuse to consider the global economy when determining monetary policy and are still worried that low unemployment will automatically trigger inflation. 
The financial crisis in Asia, Latin America, Russia and many other areas of the world poses a serious threat to our economy and, to date, the United States has not established the appropriate monetary policy to minimize it. The FOMC, through its control of the federal funds rate, has the ability to take decisive action against the economic problems that face us. 
Many economists note that devalued currencies in several countries will not only reduce the rate of inflation but also sharply increase our trade deficit, eliminating many jobs and slowing growth in the process. Worldwide commodity prices are at their lowest level in decades. 
With regard to our record trade deficit, on September 18, the Christian Science Monitor reports that `So far this year, the trade deficit in goods and services is running at a record annual rate of $185 billion, 68 percent higher than last year's record deficit of $110 billion. America's deficit with Pacific Rim countries hit $87.8 billion in the first seven months--42 percent above the imbalance for the period in 1997.' 
The September 7 issue of Insight Magazine, says that `Santa Claus is coming to America, only his goods are making the early trip by sea rather than sleigh--in huge freighters filled to capacity.' 
What will this mean for the U.S. economy? Most importantly, it means a significant loss of jobs, perhaps as much as 1.1 million. In fact, Wilbur Ross, the senior managing editor of the Rothschild Investment Group, believes that `the loss of American jobs due to decreased domestic production for export will outweigh any short term benefits of lower prices.' 
Experts on balance-of-trade issues say nearly every major industry will be affected: automotive, steel, electronics, appliances, machinery, textiles and apparel. 
Mr. President, lower interest rates would allow people in other countries to buy out goods, and, in turn, reduce the risk of Americans losing their jobs. 
Lower interest rates are also needed to help our farmers. Worldwide commodity prices are at their lowest level in decades. 
The price of farm commodities are connected to this problem, and we know what is happening to farm commodities in our country. I was just recently in the Midwest, and I can tell you that corn, beans, wheat and all the attendant crops are at their lowest prices in years. They are falling dramatically. Livestock prices are also going down. We are seeing average hog prices this year at their lowest level since 1974 and, again, no indication that they are going to go up. 
This is an idea of what is happening to corn prices. We can see how they are dropping in the Midwest. I have shown these charts before in discussing the need for some legislation on agriculture. 
Basically, what this chart shows, and all the other charts indicate, is corn, soybeans, wheat, cattle hogs--all the commodities we have in the farm sector--are drastically dropping, and dropping very rapidly. 
Wayne Angell, a former Federal Reserve Governor appointed by President Reagan, and one of the last experts in farm economy to sit on the Federal Reserve Board, I might add, said on September 9, `The Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to stem declines in the prices of key commodities.' 
Angell goes on to say that, `If commodity prices continue to fall unchecked, the U.S. economy risks a fall in the prices of hard assets, such as real estate, with potentially severe risks to the economy.' 
He said that on September 10. 
He is right, we are already seeing this. We are seeing this happen in the Midwest. Already we are seeing a softening of land prices, and perhaps it could lead to a downward spiral. I and many others in this body are working on solutions to fix the problems in the ag sector, like increasing loan rates, providing storage payments to farmers, helping those who have suffered disasters, helping to do something about the Federal Crop Insurance Program. One of the best things the Federal Reserve can do for farmers is lower interest rates. 
There are direct effects. For example, a 1-percent reduction in interest rates means the average farmer in Iowa will save $1,400 in interest payments on their land each year. In addition to reductions in land payments, lower interest rates means farmers will be able to receive a much-needed break in the prices they pay for new machinery, fertilizer and seeds. It means that farmers' incomes will increase and the negative effect on the rural economy will be somewhat reduced. 
Again, for example, a 1-percent reduction in interest rates means a typical 950-acre grain farm in Iowa will see an increase of about $2,500 in income a year. 
But the indirect effects of lower interest rates, as I mentioned, are even more important. We need the engine of the U.S. economy working at full speed to help the world economy to recover. Lowering interest rates will help restore worldwide markets for our agricultural goods. As I have said many times in the past, lower interest rates amount to a badly needed tax break for hard-working families. 
Mr. President, the U.S. economy is the only large, healthy economic engine in the world, and if our economy does slow (and our growth increased just 1.6 percent in the last quarter compared to 5.5 percent in the first quarter), it will be exceedingly difficult for the worldwide economy to recover. The chance of a long, deep, worldwide economic recession is, unfortunately, very possible. 
There are already increasing signs of a possible recession in the U.S. economy. For example, 30-year Treasury bond rates have sunk to record lows and are now below the short-term Federal funds rate. This is indeed a yellow warning light that the U.S. economy could be headed for a significant decline. Again, this chart shows that. The 30-year Treasury bond rates are now lower than the short-term Federal funds rate. That sends a very powerful signal that we could be headed for a very, very steep decline. 
Wholesale prices slid a steep 0.4 percent just in August alone. For the first 8 months of the year, producer prices have fallen at a 1.4 percent annual rate, compared with a 1.2 percent rise for all of 1997. 
Nobel laureate Milt Friedman, with whom I do not very often agree on economics, called this a `significant decline.' And former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder, says:  
If you ask about the prospect of deflation and you restrict your attention to goods, the answer is yes, and in fact we've had some. 
So, Mr. President, we are already seeing troubling deflationary signs in our own economy. Action must be taken now. 
The fall in the U.S. stock market, another flashing warning signal, will clearly have its own impact on what is referred to as the `wealth effect.' To describe the troubling nature of this situation, I would like to quote an article from the September 14 issue of Time magazine. The article pointed out that: 
A slumping stock market can certainly add to the drag on a slowing economy, through the so-called wealth effect. In a rising market, economists estimate that for every dollar of increased wealth, consumers spend an additional 4 cents. And, they often stop spending that money when their stock gains erode. If $2 trillion has been lost from investors' pockets over the past couple of months, then at 4 cents on the dollar we could expect an $80 billion drop in annual consumer spending, or about 1% of the total U.S. economy. While that alone is not enough to stop the economy from growing . . . it could combine with the global currency crisis to tip the U.S. into recession later this year or in early 1999. 
The article in Time goes on to say that: 
. . . a persistent stock market decline can also hurt the economy by making companies more cautious about expansion and hiring. That usually means layoffs or plant closings, which ripple through our economy as laid-off people cut spending.

Mr. HARKIN. One argument against lowering interest rates is that our unemployment levels are already low. Some say that our current rate of unemployment at 4.5 percent is too low, companies cannot find workers and will be forced to pay more, hurting their profits, hurting the economy. 
Businesses have surprised many economists by creating multiple ways to improve efficiency. Of course, more can and should be done. I believe there is room for additional job growth. Companies have also been effective at finding new employees who were not actively looking for work and were, therefore, not counted as unemployed. 
We need economic growth to continue in order to improve wages, to bring still more people into the labor force, to give those working part time the chance to work full time, and to provide opportunity for those on welfare, and for those who have entered the workforce at the bottom rung, to start moving up the ladder. 
With only those looking for work counted as unemployed, there are still millions of others not counted as unemployed who could be brought into the workforce. As difficult as it may be to find workers now, this will be viewed as a small problem compared to a serious economic downturn, a recession, and deflation. 
Again, if inflation should start to accelerate we can always apply the brakes and whatever inflation may have occurred can be reduced. But to forever limit our growth to a preset limit blocks Americans from the opportunity of reaching their full potential. 
If we do move to deflation, if we go into a serious recession at this point, without America's strength, the world's economy could sink to Depression-era levels. 
For the sake of our farmers and our small business owners, for hard-working Americans, and the rest of our economy, and for countries around the world, I sincerely hope that Chairman Greenspan and the Federal Open Market Committee do not misjudge the current economic indicators in the U.S. and worldwide economies. 
While I am pleased that Chairman Greenspan recently hinted at a possible rate cut, I am afraid the Federal Open Market Committee may have already misjudged the ominous economic signs that are out there. I only hope it is not too late. That is why, Mr. President, the Senate must send a clear signal to the Federal Reserve: Lower interest rates now. 
The Fed must show that it has as much concern for the jobs of American workers as it has for the interests of U.S. investors throughout the world. An immediate cut in interest rates will give our economy the boost it needs to maintain its strength during the next year as the fragile nature of many economies throughout the world recovers. 
So, Mr. President, that is what we need--for this Senate to send a clear signal that we have looked at the economy, we have listened to our constituents, we have been out in our States; we see it, we feel it, we know it. Things are declining --I can tell you that--in the farm sector and in rural America. We know what is happening worldwide. Now is the time for the Fed to act for a significant cut in interest rates. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I just want to respond a little bit to my colleague from Iowa by again pointing out to Senators that while we do respect the independence of the Fed, as we say, some argue that it is not even appropriate to debate monetary policy or to send signals to the Fed. 
I say to my colleague from Iowa, as William Jackson at the Congressional Research Service writes in the report to Congress, 
Constitutional authority to regulate the value of money, and by implication, to determine monetary policy, rests with Congress, article I, section 8 of the Constitution. 
This authority has been largely delegated to the Federal Reserve by the Federal Reserve Act, as amended. Nonetheless, the Fed, as a creature of law, may have its policies dictated as well as its structure changed by Congress. Since the 1930s, Congress has generally declined from doing either. But in the past 25 years, Congress has occasionally legislated more Fed accountability, with an aim towards influencing policy. And Congress has periodically enacted nonbinding language to express its monetary policy preferences to the Fed, with the implication that more structural changes could be forthcoming in the absence of policy response by Fed officials. 
Again, I think it is not only our right but our duty as Senators to debate monetary policy and to give our thoughts and guidance and direction to the Fed. 
The Federal Reserve, I keep reminding people, is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution of the United States. It is not a separate branch of government. It is not something that is under executive powers enumerated in the Constitution. The Constitution gave Congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof. Of course, we don't want to do that. I would hate to see us do that. So we delegate it. We set up the Federal Reserve with the Federal Reserve Act. We amended it many times to do that. And it has worked well. 
But it still means that as policymakers we have a right and, I think, an obligation to send guidance and direction to the Fed about what is happening in the economy and what they ought to do. The last time the Senate debated a sense of the Congress calling on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates was on December 19, 1982. It passed by a vote of 93 to nothing here in the Senate. Ninety-three to nothing the Senate passed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution asking the Fed to lower interest rates. 
Again, given all of the recent support for interest rate cuts in the business community by economists, editorial boards, and political leaders on both sides of the aisle, I see no reason why the Senate should not vote unanimously, again, urging the Fed to lower interest rates to stem what I and others--not only myself but a lot of others, from conservative to more liberal economists all over America--are saying: there are ominous signs of a possible recession in the U.S. economy. 
As I said, even the Chairman of the Fed himself, Chairman Greenspan, has moved in this direction recently. He said encouraging things about the need to perhaps cut interest rates. But I am fearful that the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee hasn't gotten the word yet. 
I think we need to send them the word that what we see as policymakers in our daily lives, what we see in our States, what we see in terms of the issues that we deal with in the Senate, that we see an economy that is going down from a 5.5 percent growth rate last quarter down to 1.6 percent next quarter. We see rapidly falling commodity prices, especially in the farm sector. We see wages beginning to stagnate. We see the 30-year Treasury bonds now lower than the Federal funds rate. There are some very ominous signs out there. 
This amendment is designed to simply exercise not only our right but, I believe, our obligation as Senators to debate this situation. 
Of course, if Senators don't agree that is what is happening--that indeed there may be a recession out there, that there are some signs of falling commodity prices, for example, and of worldwide recession--I guess people can debate that. Obviously, if Senators feel the other way, they obviously should not vote for a sense-of-the-Congress amendment like this. But I hope that Senators who feel that they shouldn't vote against it because Congress has no right telling the Fed what to do--I would just say look at the history. 
I will have more to say tomorrow about the many times Congress has passed some legislation, or sense-of-the-Senate, or sense-of-the-Congress resolution giving guidance and direction to the Fed. I hope that we will exercise not only our right but I believe our obligation to do so. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, let me commend my friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy, for his long-time commitment and leadership on this issue, among many others, but especially on this issue. So many people are now working in America and earning at least a raise from the minimum wage of what we had a few years ago of $5.15 because of the hard work and effort and leadership of Senator Kennedy. 
As Senator Kennedy knows, this is an issue of basic fairness about whether those Americans who work hard, who have helped our Nation grow to a period of very significant economic prosperity, should, indeed, receive some of the benefits of this prosperity. 
I was in Iowa on Friday. I visited the Tri-State Food Bank in Sioux City, IA. Now, the unemployment rate in Sioux City and the surrounding areas is about 2 percent--literally almost no unemployment. The economy is growing; people are working. It is some of the best times people in that area have ever had from what they tell me and from what all the indicators are. Yet, the director of the Tri-State Food Bank Mr. Ron Swanson informed me that they are getting more demand for food from the food bank than they have ever had before. Now they are concerned about the winter and whether or not they will have the food necessary. I said, with all these people working, why is it that people are coming to the food bank? 
Earlier, I visited the food bank in Des Moines and Karen Ford told me the same thing. That in this time of economic prosperity and growth and low unemployment, the demand for the commodities and the food from the food banks is higher than ever. 
As I was told in Sioux City on Friday, you have a lot of people who have come off of welfare in the so-called Welfare-to-Work Program. They are making minimum wage, they are feeding their families, clothing their kids, sending their kids to school, paying rent, they are getting food stamps. But their food stamps are running out before the end of the month so they have to go to the food bank to get USDA commodities of rice, USDA canned pears and canned peaches, USDA flour, plus the donations that churches, schools and the businesses in that area donate to the food bank. 
Now, these are not people that are shirking. These are not people that are just out on the streets. These are people that go to work every day trying to provide for their families. Yet they have to go to the food bank before the end of the month because the food stamps run out. These are people making the minimum wage--$5.15 an hour. 
It is not right in this country when in this time of economic prosperity when millionaires are created every day and we have billionaires like we have never seen before, that people who work and go to work every day can't even get enough food to last until the end of the month. 
That is what this is about. That is what this whole debate and this vote is about. For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would vote against raising the minimum wage just the modest amount that Senator Kennedy is proposing. 
I had my staff calculate up for me what the minimum wage would be if it had increased at the same rate that CEO salaries, chief executive office salaries, had gone up on average since 1960. If the minimum wage had increased at the same rate as CEO average salaries since 1960, the minimum wage today--are you ready for this--would be $41 an hour. Now, that tells you about the spread. That tells you what is happening in our society. Fewer and fewer people making more and more money, getting all the wealth, more and more people shoved to the bottom who make the minimum wage, who get food stamps, and then have to go to the food bank to get food to last them until the end of the month. It is not right. It is not right in this country that those conditions have to exist. 
They tell us, well, if you raise the minimum wage there will be unemployment, people will be out of work. How many times do we have to hear this nonsense? We know it is not true. We have the facts, we have the data. It is absolutely not true. For example, in Iowa about 5 years ago, Iowa raised their minimum wage more than the national minimum wage. What we heard at that time from the Republicans in Iowa was, oh my gosh, it will cost us all these jobs, people will leave Iowa. They will go to other States where there is a lower minimum wage. 
In 1989, Iowa raised their minimum wage. By 1996, the Iowa minimum wage was forty cents more than the Federal minimum wage. Guess what happened? Nobody left. People worked. Jobs didn't leave. Businesses didn't leave. In fact, we had one of the greatest periods of job growth and business growth in the State of Iowa when we had a higher minimum wage than the Federal minimum wage. 
Now the Federal minimum wage has caught up to Iowa. I think that points out the fallacy of the argument that if you raise the minimum wage, businesses are going to go out of business and they will leave. We proved in Iowa that is not so because we had a higher minimum wage than the Federal. 
This is the time for us to stand up and be counted for what is fair and right in our society. I thank Senator Kennedy.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, recently we have seen growing concerns around the country about the environmental problems associated with livestock, dairy and poultry production. Continued reports of manure spills, evidence of water pollution from manure runoff, and ongoing complaints about odor and air pollution are creating increasing pressure on the livestock and poultry industry. 
Last year, I introduced the Animal Agriculture Reform Act, the first legislation of its kind to call for national environmental standards for animal feeding operations. Just this week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced what they call a Draft Unified National Strategy for Animal Feeding Operations. That is a big title, but what it boils down to is a comprehensive, national plan for tackling the environmental problems of the livestock and poultry industry. 
The Administration's Strategy looks a lot like my bill, so I think it is a good start. The Strategy calls for mandatory nutrient management plans for larger operations and restrictions on manure application to protect the environment--those provisions are at the heart of my bill and also are the focus of the EPA/USDA Strategy. 
However, the Administration's plan is only a strategy and it must be implemented. We will still see manure spills, runoff and threatened waterways around the country until we have better management and better controls at animal feeding operations. 
One of the keys to getting this job done, and to helping producers comply with EPA regulations, is finding solutions rather than imposing sanctions. That is why today I am introducing a bill that would provide a 25 percent tax credit to livestock producers to purchase equipment for new and innovative ways to process and use manure. 
The aim of my bill is to help producers help themselves when it comes to manure management, particularly in circumstances where too much manure is generated to be safely applied to land. 
The tax credit would cover equipment that allows farmers to carefully apply only as much manure as their crops need, and equipment that processes manure for safer handling, better nutrient value, or alternative uses like energy generation. This is the kind of equipment that producers need to comply more easily with nutrient management plans, move manure more economically to areas where crop land is available, or adopt alternative uses for manure. 
The bottom line as I see it is that livestock, dairy and poultry producers in this country are going to face limits on manure application. These limits are going to have a serious effect on some operations, and particularly in certain regions of the country. 
Of course, there are all kinds of operations that make up our livestock, dairy and poultry industry, and each producer needs an environmental solution that makes sense for that individual operation. 
Some producers have enough land to apply all of their manure. For these producers, up to date facilities and careful management should be sufficient. For other producers, simple composting or efficient solid liquid separation may be the solution, so that solids can be transported more economically for off-site land application. In still other situations, particularly for very large operations or in regions with intensive production, we may need to adopt more advanced technology. 
I believe that the bill I am introducing today is just a first step along the way to making the adoption of better technologies, whether low-tech composting or high-tech processing, more affordable for any size producer. 
I want to thank the National Pork Producers Council for its support of this tax credit initiative. The National Pork Producers have been far in front of the crowd in engaging policy makers at the national level and in working with pork producers to address environmental problems. I look forward to continuing to work with them on these issues. 
Let me be clear that I want the livestock industry to thrive in both Iowa and across the United States. But for our industry to flourish, we need to get our environmental house in order. I do believe that we can have both a healthy livestock industry and a sound environment, and I hope that the Congress will act quickly to enact this tax credit to help producers get the tools they need to reach this goal.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with my colleague, Senator Snowe, the `Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1998.' 
The Early Hearing Loss Act would help States establish programs to detect and diagnose hearing loss in every newborn child and to promote appropriate treatment and intervention for newborns with hearing loss. The Act also would fund research by the National Institutes of Health to determine the best detection, diagnostic, treatment and intervention techniques and technologies. 
Every year, about 12,000 children in the United States are born with a hearing impairment. Most of them will not be diagnosed as hearing imparied until after their second birthday. The consequences of not detecting early hearing impairment are significant, but easily avoidable. 
Late detection means that crucial years of stimulating the brain's hearing centers are lost. It may delay speech and language development. Delayed language development can retard a child's educational progress, minimize his or her socialization skills, and as a result, destroy his or her self-esteem and confidence. On top of all that, many children are diagnosed incorrectly as having behavioral or cognitive problems, simply because of their undetected hearing loss. 
In 1988, the Commission on Education of the Deaf reported to Congress that early detection, diagnosis, and treatment were essential to improving the status of education for people who are deaf in the United States. This Act is our opportunity to finally implement that common-sense recommendation. 
Mr. President, this Act would help states develop programs that many of them already are working on; it would not impose a single federal mandate. Eight states already have mandatory testing programs; nine others have legislation pending to establish such programs. Other states have achieved universal newborn testing voluntarily. These programs can work; they deserve federal help. 
One of the highlights of my Congressional career, indeed, of my life, has been working on policies and laws to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to succeed in our society. This is especially meaningful to me, because my brother Frank became deaf as a child. 
I watched Frank grow up, and I saw how few options and support services were available for people who were deaf. I remember the frustrations and challenges Frank faced, and I told myself early on that I would do all I could to break down the barriers in our society that prevented people who were deaf from reaching their potential. By supporting early screening, diagnosis, and treatment programs, this Act would go a long way toward accomplishing that goal. 
I would like to thank Senator Snowe for her hard work and support of this Act, and I hope our colleagues will join us in this worthy effort.

Mr. HARKIN. I respond to the Senator from Minnesota to say I agree with him absolutely, there is a convulsion going on in agriculture today. We are spiraling into a deepening crisis in agriculture all over America, especially in the Midwest. Yes, this issue is of vital importance to farm families and people in rural areas all over America. I do believe we have to take some time to lay out the case and to lay out the facts of what is happening in agriculture today. 
My colleague from Minnesota, I know, will do that today. My colleague from North Dakota, and others, I am sure, will want to come on the floor. The Senator from Minnesota is right, it is a Monday. People were told there would be a first vote today at 5:30. So I assume a lot of Senators are now returning to Washington, such as the case with the minority leader, Senator Daschle. 
I hope, since we are taking some time this afternoon--let's be honest about it, there is not much happening on the floor of the Senate today. I don't see anybody lined up with amendments. So we are taking this time to talk about and discuss the parameters of the problem in agriculture and to lay down our amendment, of course. But I hope that we will at least have some time beyond 5 or 5:30 this evening, maybe even tomorrow, to have some further discussion on the crisis in agriculture. 
The Senator from Minnesota I think is absolutely right. I am sure there are a lot of Senators who would like to say something about this and to maybe add their thoughts, their views, their perceptions, their support. Or perhaps there are those who don't want to support doing anything at all but to just let it go, and they have a right to speak here, too, and they should be heard also. 
I am hopeful that, as the Senator from Minnesota has pointed out, the floor manager of the bill and the majority leader of the Senate will at least afford us some valuable opportunity for other Senators to come in and speak on this bill after their return to the Senate Chamber.

Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the Senator, this is a matter of accountability. Senators should have the right to speak, but they should also have the right to cast their vote one way or the other, up or down, on the amendment. 
So I am hopeful that there would not be a tabling motion, that in fact we would be able to vote up or down on the package of amendments that I will soon be offering on behalf of Senator Daschle and the Senator from Minnesota, the Senator from North Dakota, and several others. But they should have the right to vote on that up or down. I think our constituents, as the Senator pointed out, they have the right. We have the obligation. They have the right to demand that we vote up or down on whether we are going to take some meaningful steps to alleviate the situation in agriculture.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will soon be sending an amendment forward, but I thought I would speak on it before I do. Then I will yield to my colleague from North Dakota, who I know wants to speak, and my colleague from Minnesota. But I would like to take just a few minutes again to talk about the grave economic situation in rural America. 
I just remind my colleagues in the Senate, that the Senate voted unanimously in July on my resolution describing the terrible conditions in agriculture and calling for immediate action by Congress and the administration. That passed the Senate unanimously. Unfortunately, a little bit later, when the Senate had a chance to pass a measure to provide some assistance, we did not manage to assemble the necessary votes. That was in late July before we left for the August recess. I am, however, encouraged by some information I have become aware of that attitudes toward what we proposed in July may have changed. So I am hopeful that today we will be able to pass this critically important legislation to provide emergency farm income assistance to farm families. I see no reason why we cannot pass it in the bipartisan tradition that has customarily been the hallmark of agricultural legislation. 
If there was any doubt about the seriousness of the situation and the need for taking action in July, there can be no doubt today that the situation has worsened and that the urgency of the need for a response has increased. 
Mr. President, I used these charts last week. Unfortunately, they are still valid this week. But I just want to point out that since we first debated this in July, on July 17, when there seemed to be some sense on the Senate floor that we were not really in a crisis situation in agriculture, that since July 17, we have had a 21-percent decline in the corn price--we used central Illinois as an indicator--and the prices keep on dropping. 
As a matter of fact, I point out that just late last week the Department of Agriculture revised their crop estimates for corn, and we are going to have even more corn than we thought we were going to have. So we see that about every time a new estimate comes out, we get closer and closer to 10 billion bushels of corn; and that drives the market price down. The same thing happened with the soybean price. We had an equivalent 21-percent decline in the prices. Again, they are still down there. 
Since July 16, when we passed here the version of our agricultural appropriations bill: Dodge City, KS, wheat down 20 percent; north central Iowa corn down 26 percent; southern Iowa/Minnesota market hogs down 11.6 percent. In fact, in hogs we are looking at the lowest prices for hogs since 1974--almost 25 years. Billings, MT, feed barley down 20 percent. Kansas City hard red winter wheat down 13 percent. As I understand it, it is still going down. 
We can see what has happened since we passed the farm bill. You see what happened. We had a couple years here of increasing prices, exports were going out, customers overseas, the Asian economy was booming. So we passed the 1996 so-called Freedom to Farm bill, but then everything just started going to pot. 
Look at what our prices have done since then. We are on a constant decline and a sharp decline in commodity prices since that period of time, all in corn and in soybeans and in wheat. All three of them, ever since the 1996 farm bill, keeps coming down. That little red line indicates just what happened in the last several weeks. 
So if there ever was any doubt in anyone's mind of the crisis in July, there can be no doubt any longer. And prices, unfortunately, are certain to fall even more at harvest. We are facing the reality of a very serious economic hardship, all around the Nation. 
And let me just underscore this: This is not the fault of farmers. We have a world situation where large supplies of commodities have combined with weakened demand to drive these commodity prices lower. In just the past 2 years, the farm-level prices for corn, wheat and soybeans have declined an average of over 50 percent in 2 years; and cattle prices, 20 percent below their level earlier in the decade. As I said, hog prices are at their lowest level since 1974. 
On top of that, many regions--North Dakota, parts of Minnesota, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana--several regions, we have had bad weather and/or crop disease that have devastated 
farmers. Thirty-two of 50 States suffered declines in personal farm income between 1996 and now. 
USDA price estimates are that the lower corn and soybean prices will cause a loss in farm income of $1.4 billion in Iowa alone this year. Such a loss would threaten up to 26,000 jobs in my State. Nationally, USDA now predicts a precipitous drop in farm income of $11 billion this year. That loss of farm income could result in a loss of over 207,000 jobs. Farm debt is at the highest level since the mid-1980s in the depths of the farm crisis at that time. 
So, Mr. President, use whatever yardstick of measurement you want. By any measurement, we are spiraling into a deepening crisis in agriculture that must be stopped--and stopped now--before it gets any worse. 
So today what we are proposing is a package that has four main elements. No. 1, we propose to remove the caps on loan rates that were put into effect in the 1996 farm bill and to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to extend the loans from 9 months to 15 months. 
The way that loan rate would work is that you would take the average price over the last 5 years, drop out the high and the low, take the average, and 85 percent of that would be the loan rate. 
No. 2, we propose to ensure that enough money is available for indemnity compensation to farmers who have suffered losses from weather and disease. 
No. 3, we propose to provide the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to make storage payments on wheat and feed grains in order to encourage producers to place surplus commodities under loan when the Secretary determines that such action is appropriate to respond to problems in the transportation and marketing systems caused by large supplies. 
No. 4, we are reiterating our commitment to livestock price reporting and to the labeling of imported beef and lamb. Parts of this were passed before, but we do not know if that bill is ever going to see the light of day. So we are offering it again on the Interior appropriations. For example, on the livestock reporting and the labeling of imported beef and lamb, those two were passed before. Indemnity compensation was passed before, but at much too low a level. We now know that the losses are much higher than what we anticipated in July. 
We believe we have crafted a responsible and modest package to respond to the deepening crisis in rural America. We are not proposing any radical change to the 1996 farm bill. We are not changing any fundamental principles of the 1996 farm bill, which was to give farmers new planning flexibility and freedom. We are not touching that aspect of the 1996 bill. 
We are simply modifying something that is already in the bill. Loan rates are part of the 1996 legislation. It is just at that time the wisdom of the Congress--I voted oppositely--was to put caps on the loan rates and to freeze them at the 1996 level. All we would simply do is modify that and lift the caps for the loan rates--use the existing law but just take the caps off, but use the existing law--which would allow the Secretary to extend the loan periods and to make storage payments. 
Again, we are not introducing new features. We are simply taking the caps off of these loan rates. 
Our amendment focuses on the level of the loan that these farmers can take out on commodities after harvest, using their crops as collateral. The loan allows the farmer to pay bills, retain the crop while waiting for improved marketing opportunities. 
We always heard about Freedom to Farm that allows families the flexibility to plant, but what the farmer this year doesn't have is the flexibility to market. Because of the need to pay bills, the farmer most often this fall will have to dump the grain on the market at the lowest possible price. 
What extending the loan rates and raising the caps means--the farmer can take that loan out, and if the Secretary determines that they should make storage payments, they get storage payments also and the farmer can take the grant--the loan rate that he has--pay the bills, and then he can market his grain, market his grain when he feels is the right time, not just when he is forced to dump it on the market this fall. 
We all hope, of course, that next year grain prices might recover, the Asian economy might get better, and prices might come up. If so, I want the farmer to reap the benefits of that, and not just the large grain companies. 
The formula, as I said, has been around for a long time. I mentioned the formula; I don't need to go through that again. I will give a couple of examples. The 1996 farm bill set as a cap on the loan rate $1.89 a bushel; if the cap were removed, the loan rate would be about $2.17 for the 1998 corn crop--modest, very modest, but it would really help. In the case of wheat, the loan rate capped at $2.58 a bushel; removing the cap put it at $3.16 a bushel--still much too low for a real market price for wheat but, again, a modest increase that would help our wheat farmers. 
In addition, as I said, our amendment would allow the Secretary to extend the loan for an additional 6 months--from 9 to 15 months--again, to give the farmers some more marketing flexibility. 
Let me say a word about giving the Secretary the ability to make storage payments. The purpose of the storage payments is to facilitate orderly marketing, to alleviate burdens on commodity transportation and marketing systems. As we have seen in recent months, large supplies of commodities place a huge stress on the transportation system and on the entire commodity marketing and merchandising system. If farmers place some of this surplus grain into storage rather than dumping it into the market at harvest time, there will be some relief from the pressures on the grain transportation and marketing system. 
Again, keep in mind that we are making this discretionary with the Secretary. He can look at the situation as it develops. If it looks like we will have a lot of grain sitting on the railroad sidings with a backup in cars and we won't be able to get our grain out to market and the prices keep going down, he could then extend some storage payments to farmers. 
Again, we are not changing any of the planting flexibility of the 1996 bill or anything like that. 
Now, I will just close on this note and say there seems to be some misconception that our amendment involves `Government intrusion' into the business of farmers--that we are going to put the Government back in farming. Nothing could be more mistaken. In fact, we are enhancing the ability of farmers to market their commodities when it is most advantageous for them to do so. 
I know the old refrain about keeping the Government out of agriculture, giving the farmers more freedom. That is what we are doing. We are giving them more freedom in our amendment, more freedom to be able to market their crops. 
Again, this is a modest approach, one that shouldn't cause any real discomfort among those who so strongly adhere to the 1996 farm bill and who believe that we shouldn't make any changes in it. I happen to be one of those who did not vote for the 1996 farm bill. I thought it was a good farm bill for when the export demand is high; when there is a lot of money overseas, it is fine; but when those markets disappear, as they always do cyclically, the farmer is left holding the bag. There is no safety net for farmers. 
President Clinton said at the time he signed the farm bill that he was doing so but he recognized that the safety net was taken away and we would have to come back and modify it at some future time. Well, now is the time to take the loan rate caps off and to send a strong message to farmers that we, indeed, recognize the disaster that is taking place out there. 
I spent the weekend in my State of Iowa. I had a meeting with a farm advisory committee. There are some people on the committee who are bankers, farmers, commodities dealers, and they stated, to a person, if something is not done this fall, it will be too late next spring. It will be too late to save a lot of farmers. It will be too late to do something about the spiraling down and the economic effects that this will have on all of our businesses in rural America come next year if we don't do something right now. 
I see a lot of my colleagues on the floor who would like to speak, so I send my amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Daschle, myself, Senator Johnson, Senator Kerrey, Senator Conrad, Senator Baucus, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Wellstone, and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his contribution not only to this debate but his contribution to overall agriculture legislation which he has worked on for so many years, first as a Member of the House and now the Senate. I know of his deep commitment to family farmers and to doing whatever we can this fall to stop the crisis in agriculture. I know it is hitting the State of South Dakota every bit as hard as it is hitting Iowa and other States in the Midwest. So I listened carefully to what the Senator from South Dakota had to say, and he is right on the mark. 
Madam President, we cannot really afford to dally around any longer. We have to take action, and we have to take action now, or it is going to cost us a lot more later on.

Mr. HARKIN. Secondly, Madam President, I learned this morning of a poll that had been taken, and the poll has just been released. I believe it was released at 2:30 this afternoon, so the paper is still hot, just off the press. It is quite a startling poll when you look at the results. I am going to talk about that. The poll was prepared by Rockwood Research, a subsidiary of Farm Journal, Inc. It was prepared for the Nebraska Wheat Growers Association, the American Corn Growers Association, and the Nebraska Farmers Union. 
I just want to say what the method was here. The method was that representative data was drawn from 1,000 wheat and corn growers throughout the United States. They have here a table of how many were contacted in each State. For example, in the State of Illinois, 55 corn growers and 33 wheat growers, for a total of 88, were contacted; in Idaho, 1 corn grower, 12 wheat growers, a total of 13; in Iowa, 72 corn growers, no wheat growers; in Kansas, 9 corn growers, 72 wheat growers, et cetera. All over the United States, from every State, from Alabama to Wyoming, farmers were contacted on this poll--500 corn growers and 500 wheat growers, calls made randomly. I will not go through all the questions, but I would like to highlight just a couple. 
Question No. 7: `Congress should modify the current farm program?' Yes or no. Seventy-six point nine percent said yes, 17.7 percent said no. 
Question No. 8: `Congress should lift loan caps and raise loan rates 59 cents per bushel on wheat and 32 cents on corn.' That is what is in the package of amendments in the Chamber right now. And 72.5 said yes, 19.4 percent said no. 
Overwhelming, 3 to 1--actually over 3 to 1--said that we have to raise the loan rates, we have to modify the farm program, and we ought to lift the caps. 
There are a couple of other findings in this poll, one here that I found very illuminating. Question No. 13: `A farm program should retain planting flexibility and include a farmer-owned and farmer-controlled grain reserve?' Eighty-five point nine percent, yes; 9.9 percent, no. Think about it. Planting flexibility with a farmer-owned and farmer-controlled grain reserve--almost 86 percent of the farmers polled said yes. There is no question about that. 
Well, that is what is in the package of amendments before us. We have planting flexibility, we provide standby authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to provide for storage payments to farmers, and then lifting the caps from the loan rates would give the farmer marketing flexibility, that ability to keep his own grain and market it as he wants to over the next several months. Eighty-six percent of those polled said yes, they were in favor of that. 
Madam President, I am going to put a copy of this poll on every Senator's desk, and I hope that each Senator will read this poll very carefully before a vote is taken on our package of amendments. I understand there is going to be a motion to table. I am just hopeful that every Senator will take a look at these poll results and see what the farmers are saying. This is not my poll. It is not a skewed poll. The poll was done by a reputable polling firm. One thousand farmers polled, random sampling. It is not even close--it is not even close--about whether farmers want to raise the loan rates or not. It is overwhelmingly positive to get the loan rates raised and to provide for a farmer-owned reserve so that farmers can market their own grain. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the results of this poll in the Record.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I heard some talk around here that some on the other side of the aisle are talking about coming up with a new program called lost market compensation payments, or something like that. So, as I understand it, it would just be a set rate of payments. They are going to come up with money and give it out to farmers like another AMTA payment. 
So what is the difference between that and taking the caps off the loan rates? A big difference. Keep in mind, if we have a direct payment, if you just give the money out to farmers this fall, and if the prices go up next year--which we all hope they do--the Government is out that money. If we have an increased loan rate and farmers can take that loan and pay their bills, and if the prices go up next year over 15 months--because that is what we put in the legislation, a 15-month loan--if, over the next 15 months, the prices go up, farmers can sell their grain, pay the loan back to the Government with interest, and, therefore, the Government would not necessarily be out all that money. The income protection is there, but if prices rise the Government will not bear as much cost. 
As I understand it the idea is to come up with this lost market compensation payment--it certainly sounds fancy to me--to pay out some amount of money regardless of what prices may do over the course of the marketing year. The loan rate approach is responsive to changes in market prices and the need for farm income protection. Again, keep in mind, if the money just goes out in direct AMTA-type payments and the price goes up next year, the Government is out that money. You do not get that money back. 
Second, if you make that direct payment to farmers, a lot of that direct payment will not go to farmers. Like the AMTA payment, it will go to landowners, it will go to landlords, and it may go to a number of people who will not even be farming next year. I heard that concern a lot in Iowa. In July we passed a bill to allow up-front payment of AMTA payments, we brought up next year's payment to this fall. There are going to be a number of cases where people who took that early AMTA payment are not around to be farming next year, and the person who is farming the land next year will get nothing. Lifting the caps from the marketing loan rates goes to benefit the farmer. It goes to that producer out there who really needs the income protection this fall and over the next 12 to 15 months. 
The next point to keep in mind, and the difference between raising the loan rates and the new AMTA-type payments, is that with increasing the loan rate, even though it is a marketing loan, we believe it will provide some price stability. It will help farmers conduct more orderly marketing of commodities and help to lessen the erosion of prices because farmers will not be under such pressure to sell. A direct payment out will not have this effect. And it will mean that farmers this fall without an adequate loan rate will have less of an opportunity to avoid just having to dump their grain on the market for whatever they get. So a marketing loan at a better level, particularly along with some storage payments, can head off a lot of problems. Without them we are likely to have more grain sitting on the siding, grain dumped on the ground and more of it rotting out there because we do not have the railcars to move it all at once. 
So any way you cut it, any way you want to look at it, lifting the loan rate caps makes sense. From the standpoint of how much we are asking the taxpayers to bear the burden, who is going to receive the help--whether it is farmers or landlords--and whether we are going to do something to stop the downward trend of prices, any way you look at it, removing the caps on loan rates and providing standby authority for storage payments is in our best interest. 
Finally, there are those who might say if you raise the loan rates, you are going to cut us out of foreign markets. What nonsense. Keep in mind that these are marketing loans we are addressing today. They do not price the U.S. out of markets. And, in any event, I have often wondered what good does it do if a farmer has to sell a bushel of grain for 10 cents a bushel because that is the only way to export the grain? By that reasoning we will drive all our farmers out of business. Taking the cap off of loan rates will help farmers stay in business to produce the grain we are going to need to be a reliable and adequate supplier for the world market, and it will help our farmers and not just those who may happen to own land. 
Madam President, we are, right now, on the verge of losing thousands and thousands more farmers, mainly young farmers, a lot of them who have a heavy debt load who are paying it off, trying to get a foothold in agriculture. They are smart. They are aggressive. They are good managers. But they are being driven out of agriculture by forces beyond their control. Now our efforts to improve the farm bill to help them seems blocked by an ideological devotion to every aspect of the present farm bill. I don't mind. I know people have ideologies and they believe certain things and they enact them into law. That is fine. It happens all the time. But at some point, practicality has to rule. However good the so-called Freedom to Farm was for the last couple of years because we had good export markets, it is not working now to address this crisis. If it is not working, change it. Are we so rigid, are we so cast in stone that because we passed a bill a couple of years ago we can't do anything about that? 
Yes, we can. The farm bill is not the Ten Commandments. Improving it doesn't require a constitutional amendment. It just requires 51 votes; that is all, just 51 votes. As I said earlier, when you look at those poll results, when you see more than a three-to-one ratio of farmers saying we ought to raise the loan rates, then you know that we ought to be doing it to help them survive this crisis. 
Madam President, over the weekend, farmers, bankers and others with real knowledge of the farm economic situation told me that by next February, March, and April, we will likely have many farmers in this country going to the banks to get their loans for planting and being told by the bankers who look at their balance sheets, `I am sorry, you simply do not qualify.' 
I also point out that we have a lot of farmers with Government-backed loans who are making it now; they are farming. But what is going to happen next spring if they can't make it and they can't get the money to put in another crop? What is going to happen to all the Government-backed loans that we have out to farmers? 
Again, we have to act, and we have to act soon. We cannot wait until next February, March, or April. It will be too late. The one thing I heard loudly and clearly this weekend in my State of Iowa was that if Congress doesn't do something before we adjourn, we might as well not do anything at all next year. That came through loudly and clearly. 
Another message that came through loudly and clearly is that we don't need another direct payment going out in a lump sum because the benefit of those payments flows so heavily to landowners, and the farmer got precious little. 
I had a number of farmers tell me this weekend that some of those advanced payments that we gave, or are sending out this fall, a number of those people getting those payments won't even be farming next year--won't even be farming. So we are giving them a farm payment that would have gone next year to farmers, and they are not even farming, but they are going to get the payment this fall. That doesn't sound like a very wise policy to me. 
The wisest thing for us to do is what has proven to be effective and what farmers know is effective and the poll results show: Lift the caps on marketing loan rates, extend the period to 15 months, provide the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to make storage payments and increase the amount of indemnity payments we are going to make. The amount we passed in July is not sufficient. Do those things, and then we can really help farm families to survive, we can save our economy, and remain competitive in world markets. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is going to save a lot of farmers and do it in a cost-effective manner and a manner that is sound financially. It looks as though we are going to come down on one or two courses here. We either are going to raise the caps on loans and provide a loan rate increase to farmers, or we are going to have some kind of direct payment to farmers. I hear rumbling around that there is going to be a big, massive multibillion-dollar check to go out to farmers this year. 
I said earlier there is a poll released today of 1,000 farmers--Mr. President, may we have order? I can't even hear myself think.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President. A poll came out today of 1,000 farmers taken nationwide by a polling firm. It was done for the Nebraska Wheat Growers, American Corn Growers and the Nebraska Farmers Union--1,000 farmers. 
Two questions I will point out: One, Congress should modify the current farm program. Yes, 76.9 percent; no, 17 percent. 
Congress should lift loan caps and raise loan rates 59 cents per bushel on wheat and 32 cents on corn. Yes, 72.5 percent; no, 19.4 percent. 
Over 3 to 1. Farmers recognize this is the best way to proceed rather than getting a direct payment. Keep in mind, if we raise the loan rates, it gives the farmer a marketing tool. The farmer can get the loan and hold on to the crop. If prices go up next year, the farmer can sell that crop and then pay the loan back to the Government with interest. 
If, however, we are just going to get a bunch of money and send it out to farmers in a payment, there is no chance that any of that money is ever going to come back to the Government. Keep in mind, these loans have interest charges, and if farmers pay those loans back, they pay them back with interest. 
Secondly, if we make a payment to farmers this fall, as I hear some people want to do, just one big lump sum, just a check that goes out, a lot of those people getting that money will not be in farming next year, and it won't go to the producers.

Mr. HARKIN. If the loan rates go up, the loan rates increase, it goes to producers; it gives them a marketing tool whereby they can take the grain and market when they want and not just dump it all out there this fall. That is why we have to remove the loan caps that are in the farm bill of 1996. I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation for myself and Senator Johnson providing farmers with the opinion of receiving a refund from taxes paid in the past 10 years for their current operating losses. Congressman John Tanner of Tennessee is introducing an identical measure in the House. 
Farmers are suffering huge losses through no fault of their own. No other business has less control of the price they can receive for what thy produce. Farmers cannot control the world's weather or the World economy. But, those factors determine the price of corn, soybeans and wheat. The Freedom to Farm bill passed in 1997 sharply reduced the farmer's safety net. And, now, farm prices are crashing to levels not seen in decades, to levels never seen before if we adjust for inflation. Many farmers are going to have a very difficult time being able to acquire the funds needed to plant their crops in the coming year or maintain their annual operations. Many farmers could lose the farms that have been in their families for generations. And, the economic difficulty is far broader. It is already having a terrible ripple effect on the economies of rural areas. Layoffs are starting to occur at agricultural equipment manufacturers and in stores in small towns. But, we are just at the beginning stages of what could become a very severe downtown in rural America. 
A number of Senators and I are proposing a series of modifications in agricultural programs to help alleviate the problem. But, I believe the Congress should also pass a provision broadening existing law allowing farmers to recover taxes paid in the past to cover their net operating losses. 
Under existing law, businesses including farmers can be reimbursed for their business losses by receiving a rebate for taxes paid in the prior 2 years, 3 years in cases where there was a natural disaster. Now we are facing a large economic disaster that can really sink rural America. 
There are widely supported proposals to allow farmers to invest some of their profits for up to 5 years without being taxed till the money is used in poor years, effectively a type of income averaging. That is fine. But, what is more desperately needed at this time is more immediate assistance. 
I propose that family farmers be allowed the option to get a rebate from the taxes that they paid over the past 10 years covering up to $200,000 in operating losses rather than the two years allowed under current law. Many farmers cannot receive a rebate for their operating losses because they were not able to make any taxable profits in the last few years. The benefit would only go to farmers whose families are actively engaged in farming and whose business activity is mostly farming. The amount of the rebate would be dependent on the amount of the loss and the tax rate paid by the farmer for the paid taxes that are being restored. 
The provision would cover losses occurring in 1998 or 1999. If the measure passed this year, farmers would be able to calculate their loss early next year and quickly receive a rebate from the IRS for the taxes paid in earlier years. 
This proposal provides a significant amount of relief when it is needed early next year. It will help many farmers acquire some of the funds they need to plant. 
Current law already allows a few taxpayers in certain circumstances to go back and recover taxes that they paid for 10 years. I believe that it should be broadened to cover farmers in this difficult time. In fact, there is a precedent in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act in which Amtrak was allowed to use net operating losses of their predecessor railroads from over 25 years in the past. 
I urge that when the Congress considers a tax bill, this provision be considered and passed.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I am sorry I could not have been here earlier to speak against this onerous piece of legislation. The so-called `truth' in employment act? It ought to be called the `fear' in employment act. Of all the requirements that a person has to go through to get employment, the last thing you ought to worry about is your personal beliefs or what you think. 
How is an employer going to find this out? Are we now going to start administering `truth tests' to people who seek employment? Are we going to give them an injection of sodium pentothal so they have to tell the truth? Are we going to put them under hypnosis to open their minds? 
This is probably one of the most far-reaching, invasive pieces of legislation that goes at the very heart of the Bill of Rights. The freedom of thought--to make sure that people can't force you, either in a court or anywhere else, to testify against your will, testify against yourself, or to force you to tell what you think is fundamental to our liberty. Yet, this bill amends this principle. This legislation would implement a unprecedented chilling effect on employment practices in this country. 
I was listening to the Senator, my friend from Arkansas, talk about this. Employers already have the ability to fire workers who neglect their job duties. In fact, under the Hess Mechanical case, they will get attorney's fees for anybody who neglects their job duties and are dismissed, if they file a countersuit in court, for example. 
So the more I look at this bill, I have to admit that this is really what I would call--and I listened to the Senator from Massachusetts earlier, listing all of the assaults that have been made on workers' rights since the Republicans have taken charge around here. This bill is just another bill on the Republican donors' wish list. That is all this is; it is nothing more than that. 
But beyond that, it is a terribly invasive piece of legislation. Employers already have more power to tip the scales. If we really want to level the scales between employers and employees, we ought to do away with the Striker Replacement Act. We ought to make it so they can't replace striking workers. That would even and balance the scales. But this piece of legislation here, which says an employer can delve into the thoughts of a person--my gosh, how far are we going to go in this country? 
Lastly, when it uses the words `for the purpose of furthering another employment or agency status,' what does that mean? Does that include, for example, women who come to work and organize to start a day care center? How about racial minorities who may want to organize or petition for a day off to observe Martin Luther King's birthday? That presumably would be covered under agency status. There is no definition of `agency status.' I understand what employment status is, but agency status is a broad net that would capture everything--potentially usurping our fundamental freedoms to organize and participate in important causes. 
The Senator from Massachusetts has laid out quite eloquently the reasons why this legislation ought to be stopped in its tracks and why we ought to stick up for not just the working people in this country, but for the Bill of Rights and the right of people to think freely and to act freely in accordance with the law. 
There was a Supreme Court case 2 years ago, the Town and Country case, with a unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court ruled that an employees affiliation with a labor union or other group cannot affect their employment eligibility. That is what they are trying to overturn here, the Town and Country case. It says that it doesn't make any difference what you think, as long as you are doing your job. If you want to do something outside of the job that is lawful and legal, employers cannot require you to disavow yourself of your right to participate in that activity, whether it be organizing a union or petitioning for workplace child-care centers. I think that is an excellent decision, a unanimous decision. We don't get that many anymore. Yet, this legislation seeks to overturn that Supreme Court decision.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have been listening to my friend from Arkansas. I read the language of his bill. The words are, `for the purpose of furthering another employment or agency status.' It doesn't say for the purpose of destroying the company. 
Yet that is what he is talking about. 
What is wrong with the purpose, for example, of helping to form a union? There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong for women, for example, wanting to organize to have a day care center, or minorities wanting to organize to have a day off. That is an agency. The words don't say for the purpose of destroying a company. That is the Senator's own thought process. Furthermore, the Senator from Arkansas's argument is faulty in that he claims this `salting' activity is carried out to specifically cripple economic viability of a business. However, I ask, what person would destroy the very business, the very thing, their job and living is dependent upon? So it seems the Senator's argument is counter productive.

I am reading section 4 of the bill. It says: 
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring an employer to employ any person who is not a bona fide employee applicant, in that such person seeks or has sought employment with the employer with the primary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status. 
It doesn't say for the primary purpose of destroying the company. That is not it at all.

Mr. HARKIN. No. Obviously, if someone came in with the purpose of working for me and doing a good job for constituents that I represent in the State of Iowa and is willing to do the job, is dedicated to that job but also wanted, for example, to organize an employee's group for day care, or for minorities rights, or whatever, absolutely I would hire that person. I would do it in a minute. But that example begs the question, how can employer determine a prospective employee's thoughts, intent, or motives? Subsequently, arbitrarily deny employment to someone because they suspect they had ulterior motives. This is bad legislation that deserves to be defeated. We should be concerned with ensuring fairness and equity for the workers rather than further tilting the scales in favor of unscrupulous employers.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, farmers continue to suffer huge losses through absolutely no fault of their own. No other business has less control of the price they can receive for what they produce, the cost of the inputs. Farmers cannot control the weather. They cannot control the world economy. They cannot control what is happening in Asia. But those factors do determine the price of corn, soybeans, wheat, and other commodities. The Freedom to Farm bill passed in 1996 sharply reduced the farmer's safety net to take care of those contingencies over which the farmer has no control. 
Now farm prices are crashing to levels not seen in decades. Many farmers are going to have a difficult time acquiring funds needed to pay their bills this year and to get the necessary money to get the fields prepared and to get the seed and the fertilizer to get the crops in the ground for next year. 
Many farmers could lose their farms that have been in their families for generations. I recently talked with an older farmer who said, `That's my life's savings. I made it through the eighties. I'm a good manager. I weathered that terrible storm in the eighties. And now this may wipe me out after a lifetime of work.' 
I am sure the Senator from Alabama knows. He has a lot of farmers in his State. There is the old adage that farmers live poor and die rich. They have all that money in that land. That is their retirement system. They work hard all of their lives. They do not live high on the hog. Then it comes time to retire. That is their equity. And now that is being severely eroded, not to mention the young farmers who have gotten started, carrying a debtload who will be really forced out of agriculture, never to return. 
Well, it is already having a terrible ripple effect, not only on farms but in small towns and communities all over America. Layoffs are starting to occur at agricultural equipment manufacturing companies and in stores. I think we are just beginning to see the stages of what could become a very severe downturn in rural America. 
Last week, a number of Senators and I proposed a series of modifications in ag programs to help alleviate the problem. But I take the floor this morning to say that I believe Congress should also pass a provision broadening existing tax law that will allow farmers to recover taxes paid in the past to cover their net operating losses right now. 
Mr. President, under existing law, businesses, including farmers, can be reimbursed for their business losses by receiving a rebate for taxes paid in the prior 2 years--or 3 years in cases in which there is a natural disaster. Well, we are facing a large economic disaster that can really sink us in rural America. 
What I am proposing--and I will be shortly introducing a bill to do so--I propose that family farmers be allowed the option to get a rebate from the taxes that they paid over the past 10 years, covering up to $200,000 in operating losses rather than the 2 years that is allowed under current law. 
Many farmers cannot receive a rebate for their operating losses because they were not able to make any taxable profits in the last couple of years. By being able to go back 10 years, we will allow these farmers to be able to get a rebate next year and then limit it to $200,000 so it would be available to all family farms, up to a limit of $200,000 in net operating losses. 
The benefit would only go to farmers whose families are actively engaged in farming and whose business activity is mostly farming. The amount of the rebate would be dependent on the amount of the loss and the tax rate paid by farmers for the paid taxes that are being restored. 
The provision I am proposing would cover losses occurring in both 1998 or 1999. 
If passed this year, farmers would be able to calculate their losses early next year and receive a rebate from the IRS for the taxes paid in earlier years very soon thereafter. This proposal would provide a significant amount of relief when it is needed early next year. It would help many farmers acquire the funds they need, as I said, to get the fields prepared and get the feed and fertilizer and bills paid so they can continue on next year. 
I might add that there is some precedent for this. There was a case in 1997 where Amtrak was allowed to use net operating losses of their predecessor railroads going back over 20 years in the past. So there is precedent for this. If we can do it for Amtrak, I think certainly we ought to be able to do it for our family farmers. I am hopeful at some point this fall either under a tax bill, if we are going to have one, or under some other vehicle, that we can at least put this provision in. 
I know my colleague from Iowa has another provision that would allow farmers to invest some of their profits for up to 5 years without being taxed until the money is used in poorer years, which is a great provision, one I also hope gets through. 
Right now, the farmers are facing the fact that they don't have any money. I think maybe the two coupled together will get them some funds. If they went ahead and invested and used a provision of my colleague from Iowa, we might have a situation to help get some of the farmers through the next couple of years. 
I just wanted to bring that to the attention of Senators. I hope to be introducing that very shortly. Again, I don't mean to belabor it, but we are seeing really bad times out there. I used these charts last week. I will use them again in case other Senators may be watching that didn't watch last week. Since July 16, wheat, corn, and soybeans are all down--I used central Illinois only as a measuring point--21 percent decline in the past 6 weeks in corn, 21 percent decline in soybeans in the last 6 weeks, and a 13 percent decline in the past 6 weeks in hard red winter wheat in Kansas City. We see no signs this will be alleviated any time soon. It looks like we will have a record crop of soybeans this year, a record crop, and probably the second or third largest corn crop we have ever had. So this will be hanging over the marketplace. We need to do everything we can. 
Again, I hope that we will have some provisions very soon that will remove the caps on the loan rates and even provide emergency provisions for the Secretary to be able to pay storage payments to farmers, to store some of that grain so that they don't have to dump it this fall. They can keep it until next year. Maybe the Asian economy will come back; maybe there won't be very good weather next year, whatever; maybe the prices will come back next year. Let the farmer have the freedom to market that grain at some point down the line rather than just dumping it on the market this year. 
There are other provisions that we will be talking about, but I think those are the major ones that will help get us through a very, very difficult year in agriculture and all over the world. 
I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know a lot of us were out in our States during the August recess. I was too. I had a series of meetings around the State with farm families and people in small towns and communities and rural areas. Quite frankly, what I found was more than just disturbing. What I found was that there is a looming crisis in agriculture and in our farm economy. 
For some time I and a number of my colleagues have been trying to call attention in this body to the very serious situation in the farm economy. The livelihood and the life savings of hundreds of thousands of farm families are in jeopardy. The economic underpinnings of many rural communities are also at stake. In mid-July, the entire Senate went on record noting the existence of the serious farm economic problems and calling for immediate action. But later on, just before we broke for the August recess, this Senate rejected an amendment that Senator Daschle and I offered to restore farming protection that was taken out in the 1996 farm bill. 
All we wanted to do in a very modest attempt was to take off the caps that were put on the loan rates in the 1996 farm bill. We did not in any way want to attempt at that point to change the farm bill. We just simply wanted to remove the caps. The loan rates were still there. They were just capped at the 1996 level. All we wanted to do was remove those. 
As I listened to the debate on that amendment, it seemed clear to me that many of my colleagues doubted the seriousness of the problems in the farm economy. I heard statements that if we just let the market work, if exports would just get back on track, the situation would turn around, or so the argument went. 
So, I went out to my State to have some meetings in August to sort of take the temperature and gauge just how serious the situation was. In the intervening time since we left here, the situation has become, I am sad to say, far worse. The bottom literally has dropped out of commodity prices. I point out that the falling commodity prices cover both livestock and crops. Often, at least in my State, if the commodity price of a crop was low, the livestock prices might be up a little bit, and the farmer would at least have something to sell to make some money. Now all of the major commodities--corn, soybeans, pork, and beef--are all deeply in the red. 
So at this point I don't see how there can be any doubt that we have an economic disaster in the farm sector. 
I have some charts that will show just what happened over the last 6 weeks since the Senate considered this amendment that Senator Daschle and I offered on July 17. 
Here are central Illinois, corn prices. Here is where they were when we debated the amendment. Here is where they are now--a 21 percent decline in 6 weeks in the corn prices. 
Here is central Illinois, soybean prices--again, a 21 percent decline in the past 6 weeks. 
Here is Kansas City, hard red winter wheat prices--down 13 percent in the past 6 weeks, and headed south. There is nothing to indicate that it is going to come up. 
Since July 16, the day the Senate passed its version of the agriculture appropriations bill, the following market prices declined: 
Dodge City, KS, wheat--down 20 percent; 
North central Iowa corn--down 26.1 percent; 
North central Iowa soybeans--down 20.7 percent; 
South Iowa and Minnesota hogs--down 11.5 percent; 
Billings, MT, feed barley--down 20 percent. 
That is just since the middle of July. 
Here are the charts that I used in July to show what was happening to commodity prices, going clear back to 1990. It sort of drifts along, and we had a big spike in here from 1994 up to 1996. Then, after the 1996 farm bill was passed, the prices have been coming down and coming down. This little red figure shows just what happened since we were here in July. 
I dare say if we do nothing, if we sit here and twiddle our thumbs and do nothing, that line will continue to go down during the fall months. 
That was corn. 
Here is the farm-level soybean price. Again, since the farm bill passed, the price has been coming down; now in the last 6 weeks, its down even more. 
Here is the wheat price. Again, it spiked up here about 1996, has been generally coming down the last 6 weeks--a precipitous drop in the price of wheat. 
Again, as I said, Mr. President, I don't think there can be doubt any longer that we have an economic disaster in the farm sector. 
In my State, corn prices have fallen to the levels of the farm crisis years of the 1980s, and they still remain under downward pressures. As I say, there is nothing indicating that it is going to pull these back up. The prices have fallen over 25 percent since mid-July and are about $1 a bushel below the cost of production. 
USDA's most recent estimation indicates that 1998 net farm income will be 20 percent lower than it was in 1996--about $42.5 billion. And it was about $53.3 billion in 1996. 
I could go on and on citing more discouraging figures. But it is obvious that the numbers tell the story. It is simply no longer possible to deny the severity of the problems in the farm economy. Those problems are already spilling over into rural economies and into our small towns and communities. 
If the situation continues, it will affect our entire national economy. 
Let me just, again, underscore the consequences if we do not act. If we do not act, we are going to lose thousands of farm families that we cannot afford to lose. Many of us here remember the 1980s farm crisis. I can just tell you that my State of Iowa can't bear to go through that again. Our Nation can't bear to go through that again. 
Farmers are, indeed, resourceful people. Farmers and farm families can handle a lot of adversity and survive in business and maintain their families on the farm. But when commodity prices fall the way they have recently, farmers are at the mercy of the market. If we do not have some actions to ameliorate the effects of these low commodity prices, we are going to see a lot of farm families forced out of business. They will be gone forever and often gone from their community entirely. By and large, they will not be able to return when the farm economy turns around. Farming is too capital intensive for that kind of in and out and in again type of approach. 
Basically, we are talking here a lot about younger farm families who have money borrowed and who do not have a lot of equity built up, who are the most vulnerable to severe downturns in the farm economy like we are now seeing. They are energetic, they are perhaps some of the most educated farmers we have ever had in America, but they often do not have the financial resources to hang on through the kind of long, serious economic downturn that we have now. These younger farmers are the ones we can least afford to lose; they are the future of agriculture and the future of our rural communities. As they are forced out of agriculture, food production becomes concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, and this is not a healthy trend for rural communities, consumers or our Nation as a whole. 
I just point out that in Russia, the former Soviet Union, they are breaking up these old, huge farms because they did not work. I don't think we want to go down that path of having larger and larger land holdings in this country. 
Now, I just focused my remarks on younger farmers and young farm families. I mentioned that, Mr. President, at one of my farm meetings in Iowa, and there were a number of older farmers there who jumped all over me and said, well, you are missing us. I said, yes, but I want to talk about the younger farmers and how they don't have a lot of equity. One of the older farmers shook his finger at me and said that is just my point. I have built up my equity in my farm. That is my retirement. I haven't made a lot of money. 
I am reminded of the old adage: Farmers live poor and die rich. They have a lot of land, they have a lot of equity built up, but they have never made a lot of money. He said that is my retirement, and I see it going away before my very eyes because of these low commodity prices, because of what is happening out there, because they are having to borrow now, because they are digging into their equity base just to stay afloat. 
So it is not just the younger farmers. I think it spreads across the whole spectrum. 
I also read in the newspaper a comment made by a certain politician, who will remain unnamed, who said basically if farmers are having trouble now, it is because they were simply not managing their farms correctly; they were bad managers. That is my own words, `bad managers.' 
Well, he mentioned this, and this was, of course, the topic of conversation at one of my farm meetings, and several of the farmers there pointed to the fact that they had survived the 1980s. And as they pointed out, any farmer that got through the 1980s is not a bad manager. If they could manage their debt loads and the low prices and the shakeout that we had in agriculture in the 1980s, they are pretty good managers. But now they can't handle this. Farm debt is now at the highest level it has been since 1985, and that was the beginning of the washout of a lot of farmers in the mid and late 1980s. 
We can all look to the causes, what causes all this. Well, I don't know that they are all that complicated. We have had good crop production conditions. We are going to have a bumper crop of soybeans this year, the largest production of soybeans this year. We are going to have a big crop of soybeans in my State, too. Corn may not have a record year, but may be the second largest record year. So we have a lot of supplies and a lot of farm commodities in the world market. 
At the same time, the demand has gotten weak for a number of reasons, not the least of which has been the economic downturn in Asia. I saw some figures--I don't have the charts for them. I will bring them up in the next couple of days--which showed our exports to Asia not off all that much in terms of quantity but in terms of price. What we are getting for what we are selling is way, way down. And so we have a very weak foreign market there. They don't have any money in Asia, and so a lot of our sales have eroded. 
Now, another aspect is the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the currencies of these other countries that compete with us to sell ag exports. The weakness of those currencies allows those other countries to gain a competitive advantage over us. Now, there isn't a farmer in my State that has any ability to control that. If these other currencies are weak and they can undercut us in selling their commodities to other countries, there is not a darned thing that one or ten or a thousand farmers in my State can do about it. But it is a fact and that is what is happening. So they have gained competitive advantage over us. 
In addition, farmers in several areas of the U.S. have suffered severe losses because of weather and crop disease problems. So while we have a bumper crop, we have places such as North Dakota and Texas where they have had tremendous drought problems and weather problems and they don't have a crop at all or they have crop disease problems. 
So you put all this together, and with total freedom to plant and then farmers have planted--in fact, I have heard more than one comment in my State about how much of the conserved land that we had in the past is now being planted, and that farmers are planting them more intensely. And again, if you understand ag economics, you understand that if you have a fixed base, fixed amount of land, you are going to try to get the most production out of that land, even if the prices fall. 
That is why I don't think there are a lot of people--I know a lot of people understand it. I know the Presiding Officer understands ag economics. But a lot of them think that a farmer is like General Motors, that if prices fall you can cut back production to meet the supply and demand situation. The farmer can't do that. One farmer is not General Motors. That one farmer has no control over the total supply and the total demand. 
Secondly, it is counterintuitive. You would think if prices would fall, for example, in corn, a corn farmer would say, well, if the prices are down, I am not going to plant corn; I will plant something else. We heard a lot of this during the debate on the farm bill. Well, quite frankly, what happens, if the price drops, the farmer looks at his fixed base and says, gee, you know, the marginal cost of planting an extra acre or 2 or 5 or 10 acres of corn is almost nothing, and maybe I can plant more intensively and I can get more out of that fixed unit that I have. And therefore, even if the prices drop, I will have more production out of that unit and that will cover the lower prices. Therefore, low prices don't lead to decreased production of crops. It, in fact, can lead to increased production of a crop. 
That is what we are seeing right now--simple, basic farm economics. And so you put all these forces together, and what we have is the disaster we are having right now. But again, keep in mind these are forces beyond the control of a farmer. The farmer is at the mercy of weather, at the mercy of world commodity surpluses, at the mercy of economic problems, and they are at the mercy of other foreign currencies and their values, all of which are things that conspire together to ruin our markets. 
It is because of these forces that are beyond the control of farmers that we in our country have traditionally had in place a system of farm income protection. Certainly, we want to let the market work, but we also recognize that when the market turns around, or when disaster strikes, or when things intervene to skew the market, that it should not wipe out farm families who have done everything within their power to produce and to meet the demands of the market. These farmers should not be forced out without any protection against events beyond their control. 
Again, a lot of people say, Why should we treat farmers differently than any other business? The reason we have always had these policies in place is because farming is not like any other business. As Neil Harl, the distinguished professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University, has said repeatedly, farmers are not like General Motors. Farmers are uniquely vulnerable to forces over which they have no control. 
The 1996 farm bill greatly pared back protections against forces over which farmers have no control. The 1996 farm bill said to farmers: Produce all you can and export all you can. That is fine until foreign markets turn sour. That is fine until other countries' currencies are able to beat our own and they can get a competitive advantage over us because of the competitive value of their currencies. That is fine until other governments intervene, in terms of their support and their control of their own agricultural commodities. When foreign markets turn sour because of these events, like we are now seeing, the 1996 farm bill basically leaves American farmers to bear the brunt of these powerful world economic forces that are totally beyond their control. 
Basically, the 1996 farm bill put farmers on a high wire and then took away the safety net. Again, I will keep reminding my colleagues that under previous farm policies farmers got a lot more help in contending with those world economic forces beyond their control. There were deficiency payments that compensated for low prices. There was the Farmer Owned Reserve which paid farmers to pull grain off of the market in times of surpluses. There were not artificially low caps on commodity loan rates. There were paid land diversions and acreage limitations to keep production in line with demand. So there were all kinds of policies in place to help farmers weather these powerful economic forces over which they have no control. But the 1996 farm bill took that all away. 
Now, again, we have to ask ourselves, are we so ideologically rigidly attached to the 1996 farm bill that our hands are so tied that we cannot respond to these low farm prices and to the disaster that is facing us in rural America? Ideology is fine, but let's be practical about it. Let's use some common sense here. I do not mind if people have an ideology they want to pursue. That is fine. I think there is a lot of ideology in the 1996 farm bill. Those who had that ideology won the votes, won the bill and got it through. But, as President Clinton said when he signed the bill into law, that it is seriously flawed because there is not an adequate safety net there to help farmers through these kind of times that we will see in the future. 
I think what we need is to set our ideology aside and come together here to recognize that we have a disastrous farm economy out there right now. I might also say to my colleagues and friends who want to see the 1996 farm bill continue, that if we do not take some modest steps now to make some minor fixes in the 1996 farm bill, then there will be mounting pressure to make drastic changes in farm policy. In other words, if we do not get ahead of the curve, then we may have to take very dramatic steps, and those steps could go back to something even previous to the 1996 farm bill. 
So all I am saying is that there is no reason to keep the loan rates capped. We ought to take the caps off of loan rates. I also believe that we need to put into place, at least over the next couple or 3 years, just for this year, a form of a Farmer Owned Reserve where, as we have in the past, we actually paid farmers some up-front money to store their grain and then the farmer can decide when to market that grain. I call it giving the farmers more freedom to market. Right now, farmers have freedom to plant, under the 1996 farm bill. But, because of the 1996 farm bill, they are forced to market their grain at the lowest possible prices. That is inherently unfair. Let's give the farmer some more freedom to market, and that means giving the farmer the ability to store the grain, either on the farm or in local elevators or the warehouse, and then be able to market that grain over the next couple or 3 years, when, we hope, prices will recover. 
If we do fund the International Monetary Fund and they can straighten out the Asian economy, it is likely that the Asian economy can rebound in the next 12 to 15 months. That would put upward pressure on our grain prices. The problem is the farmers won't have the grain then. But if we had some system where the farmer could store that, as he could in the past under the Farmer Owned Reserve, then the farmer could market that grain at the higher prices in the future. 
I think those two items, taking off the loan rate caps and giving the farmers the ability to store their grain and to market it when they want to rather than dumping it on the market this fall, are the two things that we could do to save the 1996 farm bill. They are modest steps. They don't take away planting flexibility. They don't take away all of the abilities that we gave the farmers. It does not reinstitute any kind of set-asides or Government mandates on what a farmer has to plant or where they have to plant. All that would stay in place. Those were the good features of the 1996 farm bill. 
But, what we need to do in order to save those, I believe, is to take a couple of these modest steps. If we do not do that, we are going to see a lot of grain dumped on the market this fall. We are going to see these prices go down even further, and we will have a full-blown depression in rural America. It is almost there right now. It is almost there. We are on the brink of it in rural America. Many farmers basically see this as their last year if we do not do something. 
So, again, I take this time on the floor to point out to my colleagues that we have to address this. I do not believe it is a partisan matter. I think bipartisan support is growing all over this country. I have seen letters, documents from different places around the country that indicate that we ought to do something. North Dakota Governor Edward T. Schafer and Republican legislators supported what the North Dakota Farmers' Union and the North Dakota farmers both embraced in an agreement last week. One of them was a 1-year lifting of the loan rate caps. So here we have, I think, some bipartisan support for doing this. I do not think it is a partisan effort. 
Again, we have to be practical. We cannot be held prisoner by an ideology or blind devotion to every last provision of a farm bill passed over 2 years ago, 2 years ago when we saw some of the highest prices we have ever seen for crops. That is when the farm bill was passed. Now we are in the basement. 
So let's work for a practical solution that will help our farm families and rural communities this fall. Let's take the caps off of loan rates. Let's have at least a 1-year provision for a Farmer Owned Reserve to give the farmer the opportunity to market when prices are high. We must act soon. It is our responsibility. I think it would be a dereliction of our duty to leave here in October without passing legislation to address the deepening farm income crisis in our Nation. I hope and expect sometime within the next several days, perhaps next week, Senator Daschle and I and others, hopefully in a bipartisan manner, will again be offering an amendment to lift the loan rate caps, to get the loan rates up, the marketing loan basis for these farmers this fall. 
I am hopeful that our colleagues will really take a serious look at this, because we are facing a farm crisis in America unlike any we have seen in a long, long time, and we have to act and we have to act now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to share some of my reasons for voting in favor of the Specter-Biden amendment that restored the Comprehensive Test Ban `prepcom' funding. I strongly supported the Specter-Biden amendment to restore the $28 million for the U.S. share of an international network to monitor nuclear weapons testing. 
The international monitoring network will support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that bans all nuclear weapons explosive tests. This treaty will help our nation's nuclear non-proliferation goals by helping to stem the development of new nuclear weapons. The treaty, which awaits ratification in the U.S. Senate, has the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, former JCS Chairman General Colin Powell, and the vast majority of the American public. 
Not only would the nuclear testing monitoring network help the U.S. as we move toward a nuclear weapons ban, it would also prove useful to our national security even without a global testing ban. As I have stated repeatedly on the floor, I am a strong supporter of a nuclear weapons test ban or C-T-B-T. However, even my colleagues that have not decided to support the treaty should support the international monitoring system on its own merits. Why shouldn't we enhance our nation's and our allies ability to detect nuclear weapons tests? The network would establish monitoring stations in places like the former Soviet Union, China, South Asia and Africa, greatly enhancing our capability to detect nuclear tests. 
The CTBT's monitoring system is not fully operational. Nevertheless, even in its current and incomplete form, the system provided timely data on events at the respective nuclear test sites. Through the CTBT Prepcom, we will add monitoring stations in Pakistan, China, Kazakhstan, Diego Garcia, and elsewhere. 
We saw the benefits of international monitoring in the seismic event in the Kara Sea off of Russia. Six international monitoring stations detected this event on August 16, 1996 in the Kara Sea near the Russian test site. The data from these stations allowed our intelligence community to conclude that the event was not nuclear, not associated with Novaya Zemlya activities, but rather, was an earthquake 130 kilometers southeast of the Novaya Zemlya test site. 
In another recent example, the seismic stations in the CTBT Prepcom almost immediately detected the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, enabling the U.S. to identify the location and yield of the tests with high accuracy. This is clearly a success for the emerging CTBT detection system. 
Some may ask why the U.S. should fund an international system? Why can't we just go it alone. A key answer is money. The U.S. paying for only 25% of the cost is better than footing the bill for the whole system. For example, the Air Force originally planned on paying for the entire cost of monitoring stations in Kazakhstan and South Korea. Instead, we will only pay for 25% of the costs of these stations. 
In summary, I think there are many good reasons to support a nuclear weapons test ban. However, even if one has not yet decided to support the treaty, the funding of an international monitoring system is reasonable on its own and I am gratified to see that the majority of my Senate colleagues voted in favor of the Specter-Biden amendment.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support the Assistive Technology Act of 1998. This Act will enable States and the Federal Government to build on their work under the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988, or Tech Act, which sunsets this year, and to establish new directions in assistive technology policy for the 21st Century. 
In 1988, I was proud to be the chief Senate sponsor of the Tech Act, and was very fortunate to work with then-Representative Jeffords, who was the chief House sponsor. In developing this new Act, I have been fortunate to work with Senator Jeffords again, and also with Senator Bond, whose commitment and leadership have been invaluable. 
The issue of assistive technology is deeply important to me. My brother Frank is deaf. Assistive technology is part of our relationship. Frank and I talk all the time, using a TDD; we watch television together using a closed-caption decoder. My nephew Kelly was injured in the Navy and is a quadriplegic. But he lives independently, in large part because of assistive technology. For example, Kelly is able to drive his van by using a wheelchair lift and hand controls. 
But assistive technology doesn't just work for people with disabilities. We hear all the time that defense research often has everyday applications. The same is true of assistive technology research. I saw a television commercial recently, advertising voice-activated software for business executives. Well, that technology was originally development for people whose disability kept them from using a keyboard. And if you've ever watched the closed-captioned news in a noisy restaurant or so you didn't wake up your husband or wife, you've used assistive technology. The more assistive technology we develop, the more all of us will benefit from it. 
Under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, States will be able to continue the consumer-responsive programs of technology-related assistance for people with disabilities they have developed over the past ten years. 
The Act will help States establish and strengthen systems to inform people with disabilities what their assistive technology options are, so they can take advantage of them. It will enable States to help schools and employers accommodate assistive technology users, so they can live independently, and get an education and a job. And the Act will create a one-stop Internet site where consumers, family members, assistive technology professionals, and anyone else who's interested can access all the information there is about assistive technology. 
The Act also recognizes that the Federal government must work more efficiently, and with the private sector, if we are going to make assistive technology more accessible. It requires federal agencies and offices that conduct assistive technology research to work more 
closely together, to take advantage of each other's abilities and information and to better utilize federal resources. It enables the Federal government to increase its research, and to make grants to outside researchers, for assistive technology and universal design. It offers help to small businesses to research, develop, and bring assistive technology to the market. And the Act enables the Federal government to work with the information technology industry, to increase the industry's voluntary participation in efforts to make information technology more accessible to people with disabilities. 
Finally, the Act will help States establish, or expand, loan programs for people with disabilities or their representatives to access to meet their assistive technology needs. 
I have often said that disability is a natural part of the human experience, that in no way diminishes the right of individuals to live independently, enjoy self-determination, pursue meaningful careers and enjoy full inclusion in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of American society. Assistive technology enables people with disabilities to exercise that right. 
There have been amazing changes in technology since we wrote the Tech Act, ten years ago. Technology can do more for more people than ever before--and that trend is going to continue. But that also means the consequences are greater than ever if we don't make assistive technology, information technology, and our society generally, more accessible, because the more technology can do, the further people with disabilities will fall behind if they can't use it. 
Mr. President, this Act enjoys broad support in the disability community and the assistive technology community, and is endorsed by the National Governors Association. I hope my colleagues will join Senators Jeffords, Bond, and me, and our other cosponsors, in supporting this worthwhile Act.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend, Senator Conrad, in paying tribute to a friend of mine--for over 25 years now, a fellow public servant, a fellow Iowan. It was perhaps one of the saddest phone calls I ever received in my life when I was notified Saturday morning that Kent Hall had died Friday night. He was a young man in the prime of his life. It just was a terrible shock. 
There are no words to convey to his family and his many friends the shock and the disbelief and the sadness that I feel about this great loss. 
Kent Hall, as I said, was a friend of mine for 25 years. Kent first came to work on my first congressional campaign in 1972. Both of us had been in the military. He had served in Italy. We both felt it was vitally important that we bring the Vietnam war to a swift conclusion. Too many of our friends had lost their lives in Vietnam. We saw the futility of it. So much of our campaign in 1972 was directed at the war. That s why Kent was one of my principal campaign workers that year. 
He was a student at Iowa State University then. We did not win that election, but I did fairly well. We stayed at it, and I ran again in 1974. By then, Kent was in graduate school at Iowa State and then became a full-time campaign worker on my 1974 campaign, and we won that election. 
He was just a tremendously hard worker. He was very good at getting people involved, especially a lot of the students at Iowa State. Kent even got some of the local high school students involved in the campaign. He inspired them, he got them involved, and he really represented the best of what it means to be in politics. There was never anything underhanded or dirty about Kent. He was just out there knocking on doors, getting the information out, and registering voters. Kent was very, very good at that. He was one of my best campaign workers. 
After that election, Kent joined my staff in Ames, IA, where Iowa University is located. He and I also shared the fact that we both came from very small towns. He came from Lamont, IA, in Buchanan County. I always kidded him that he was from a big town. His town, I think, had about 500 people and one stop light. My town of Cumming had about 150. 
After I was elected in 1974, I remember talking with Kent about the fact that we were from small towns and no politician had ever visited our towns. A Congressman or a Senator was somebody who might go to Des Moines or Cedar Rapids but never came to small towns. We hit upon this idea of taking our office out to the small towns. I believe that Kent Hall was the first person to do that in Iowa. 
As a congressional representative, he would go out and have open office hours in towns of 100 people, 150 people, 200 people. He would go to the post office, or if there wasn't a post office, the American Legion club, maybe a church basement, and have office hours in all these small towns around the district so that people who couldn't drive all the way to the district office would come and see him. It was a great outreach program. He initiated that, he started that in Iowa. 
Kent also did my community development work, rural housing, rural water programs. He initiated some good programs for people living in small towns and communities at that time. Again, it was because Kent felt very strongly that Government--whatever else Government's functions are constitutionally--ought to be helping make life better for people who live in rural areas and small towns who do not have the access to the resources of those who may live in our bigger cities. He was always greatly interested in extending Government out to people who live in rural areas. 
After his great work in Ames, Kent then came to Washington and received his doctorate degree in economics at George Washington University. He was a great economic thinker. During the 1980s, Kent was on the House Small Business Committee staff, and I had since come to the Senate in 1985. During some of the tough debates--the 1985 farm bill debate, the 1990 farm bill, and in between we had a credit bill we had to work on--I can always remember asking for Kent Hall's advice on a farm bill and especially on farm economics and agricultural economics. He really had an understanding of the economics of rural America and agriculture and small businesses and small towns that I found absolutely invaluable. 
After that, then, of course, he joined the staff of Senator Conrad of North Dakota. I listened to Senator Conrad speak very eloquently about his association with Kent Hall. 
Several years ago, Kent began dating a woman in my office from Algona, in northern Iowa, by the name of Michelle Reilly. They got married in 1993 and had two small kids--Austin, who is now about 2, and Caite, who is 4. So his death leaves two small kids. 
I want it to be known that Kent Hall was a wonderful human being, a personal friend, someone I admired and someone I regularly consulted on a lot of different matters--mainly agriculture and agricultural economics. Through it all, Kent remained a fine man. 
A lot of times people live and then they are gone and you wonder what it all meant, especially when someone dies as young and as abruptly as Kent. 
I am reminded of what John Kennedy once said when he was President. He was asked how he would like to be remembered after his passing on, whenever that would be. He responded with something I have never forgotten. He said `the highest'--I may not have the words correct, but basically he said: 
The highest honor that can be given to a person is just to be remembered as a good and decent human being. 
If we use that as the highest tribute we can give to any person, that they are remembered as a good and decent human being, then that tribute certainly belongs to Kent Hall. 
He meant a great deal to his country. He meant a great deal to all of his friends, a great deal to Michelle, his wife, and to his two children. He meant a great deal to this Congress and this Senate. But above all this--above it all --we will always remember Kent Hall as a good and decent human being. 
To Michelle, Caiti and Austin, to his parents Kenneth and Evelyn, to his brothers and sister back in Iowa, to all his many friends, my wife and I and our family extend our deepest sympathies. And we will always remember Kent Hall for the kind and decent human being that he always was. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. HARKIN. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, cosponsored by Senators Daschle, Hatch, Grassley, D'Amato, Wellstone, Mikulski, Craig, and Moseley-Braun to improve and expand rigorous scientific review of alternative and complementary therapies. This bill will elevate the NIH's Office of Alternative Medicine to Center status. It would be renamed the `National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.' 
Mr. President, the American public supports this bill. Increasingly, Americans are turning to complementary and alternative medicine. According to a recent study by Harvard University researchers, fully one third of Americans regularly use complementary and alternative medicine. This same study found that in 1990, American consumers spent more than $14 billion on these practices. In that year there were 425 million visits to complementary and alternative practitioners--more than those to conventional primary care practitioners! 
These practices, which range from acupuncture, to chiropractic care, to naturopathic, herbal and homeopathic remedies, are not simply complementary and alternative, but are integral to how millions of Americans manage their health and treat their illnesses. Yet there is little scientific research being done to investigate and validate these therapies. 
We must reexamine our spending priorities. Approximately 90 million Americans suffer from chronic illnesses which cost society roughly $659 billion in health care expenditures, lost productivity and premature death. According to the Centers for Disease Control, we spend $28.6 billion Medicare dollars on diabetes alone--a disease which can be treated effectively with low-cost alternative therapies. A Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) revealed that the current health care delivery system is not meeting the needs of the chronically ill in the United States. The study also concluded that such trends reveal skyrocketing costs, increasing numbers of people in need and a dysfunctional system of care. Alternative medical therapies could offer a cost-saving alternative to this trend. 
We are in an era when we must take a closer look at ways to provide cost-effective, preventive health care, and as we do so, Congress must act to strengthen the mission of the Office of Alternative Medicine in finding safe and effective treatments and preventive methods for chronic conditions. Patients throughout our nation are suffering because there is a lack of available information on alternative medicine. 
In 1992, after finding that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was largely ignoring this increasingly important area, at my urging Congress passed legislation creating the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) within NIH. At that time, Congress charged OAM with assuring objective, rigorous scientific review of alternative therapies. They were to investigate and validate therapies so that consumers would be better informed as to what treatments work and what treatments don't. 
It is now clear that without greater authority to initiate research projects and assure unbiased and rigorous peer review, alternative therapies will not be adequately reviewed. The main problem is that the Office has no authority to directly provide research funding to any medical professional seeking to study the safety and effectiveness of alternative treatments. And unlike all other major organizations within NIH, the OAM has no autonomy to oversee its mission and goals. Because the Office must work through other Institutes to carry out research projects, promising projects are blocked and considerable time and resources are wasted. 
The bill we are introducing would increase the status and authority of the Office of Alternative Medicine by creating in its place a National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH. The principal change in authority is granting the Center the ability to directly fund research proposals and other projects. This will not only assure that alternative therapies receive the review they need and deserve, it will improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic steps required by the current set up. 
Our bill also addresses another shortcoming of the NIH's current handling of alternative medicine research. The hallmark of rigorous scientific review at NIH is the peer review process. However, when it comes to alternative and complementary therapies, there is no true peer review. There are no complementary or alternative medicine specialists on NIH peer review panels. That means, for example, that when a research proposal comes in on chiropractic care, it often is reviewed by peer review panels that include no chiropractors. Rather, these proposals may be reviewed by scientists who have little or no experience in or knowledge about chiropractic care. 
This has three negative results. First, these projects are not being reviewed by individuals with expertise in the fields contemplated by the research. This reduces the scientific quality of the review process. Second, because those reviewing these proposals have no expertise in this area, they may be less likely to support their approval. And, third, because those seeking NIH support of alternative medicine research know that their proposals will not receive true peer review, they may hesitate to apply, thereby reducing the number and quality of research proposals. Our proposal corrects this problem by requiring that projects are reviewed by scientists with expertise in the particular area of complementary and alternative medicine proposed to be studied. 
The federal government and state-of-the-art science must begin to catch up with the public's increasing demand for information and answers regarding alternative and complementary health care. The time is now. I urge you and my colleagues to support this important bill that will improve the quality of health care for Americans.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to address an unfilfilled obligation we have to our nation's veterans. The problem is a substantial backlog of requests by veterans for replacement military medals. 
I first became aware of this issue a few years ago after dozens of Iowa veteans began contacting my State offices requesting assistance in obtaining medals and other military decorations they earned while serving the country. These veterans had tried in vain--usually for months, sometimes for years--to navigate the vast Pentagon bureaucracy to receive their military decorations. The wait for medals routinely exceeded more than a year, even after interventin by my staff. I believe this is unacceptable. Our nation must continue its commitment to recognize the sacrifices made by our veterans in a timely manner. Addressing this simple concern will fulfill an important and solemn promise to those who served to preserve democracy both here and abroad. 
Let me briefly share the story of Mr. Dale Homes, a Korean Way veteran. Mr. Holmes fired a mortar on the front lines of the Korean War. Stacy Groff, the daughter of Mr. Holmes, tried unsuccessfully for three years through the normal Department of Defense channels to get the medals her father deserved. Ms. Groff turned to me after her letter writing produced no results. My office began an inquiry in January of 1997 and we were not able to resolve the issue favorably until September 1997. 
Ms. Groff made a statement about the delays her father experienced that sum up my sentiments perfectly: `I don't think it's fair . . . My dad deserves--everybody deserves--better treatment than that.' Ms. Groff could not be more correct. Our veterans deserve better than that from the country they served so courageously. 
Another example that came through my district offices is Mr. James Lunde, a Vietnam-era veteran. His brother in law contacted my Des Moines office in January of this year for help in obtaining a Purple Heart and other medals Mr. Lunde earned. These medals have been held up since 1975. Unfortunately, there is still no determination as to when Mr. Lunde's medals will be sent. 
The numbers are disheartening and can sound almost unbelievable. For example, a small Army Reserve staff at the St. Louis Office faces a backlog of tens of thousands of requests for medals. So why the lengthy delays? Why, at one personnel center, is there a backlog of 40,000 requests? 
The primary reason DOD officials cite for these unconscionable delays is personnel and other resource shortages resulting from budget cuts and hiring freezes. For example, the Navy Liaison Office has gone from 5 or more personnel to 3 within the last 3 years. Prior to this, the turnaround time was 4-5 months. Budget shortages have delayed the agencies ability to replace employees who have left, and in cases where they can be replaced, the `learning curve' in training new employees leads to further delays. 
Yesterday, during the debate over the Defense Appropriations bill, I offered an amendment to eliminate the backlog of unfulfilled military medal requests. The amendment was accepted by unanimous consent. 
My amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to allocate resources necessary to eliminate the backlog of requests for military medals. Specifically, the Secretary of Defense shall make available to the Army Reserve Personnel Command, the Bureau of Naval Personnel, the Air Force Personnel Center, the National Archives and Records Administration, and any other relevant office or command, the resources necessary to solve the problem. These resources could be in the form of increased personnel, equipment or whatever these offices need for this problem. In addition, this reallocation of resources is only to be made in a way that `does not detract from the performance of other personnel service and personnel support activities within the DOD.' 
Our veterans are not asking for much. Their brave actions in time of war deserve our highest respect, recognition, and admiration. My amendment will help expedite the recognition they so richly deserve. Our veterans deserve nothing less.

Mr. HARKIN. I offered an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill important to Persian Gulf War veterans. My amendment increases Department of Defense spending on research to determine the causes and possible treatments of those suffering from Gulf War illness by $10 million. It is my understanding that the amendment has been accepted. This is similar to the amendment I offered and was also accepted as part of the Defense Authorization bill. 
While the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991, the physical and psychological ordeal for many of the nearly 700,000 troops who served our country in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield has not ended. It's been seven years since our troops were winning the war in the Gulf. Unfortunately, they continue to suffer due to their deployment. 
Many of our troops returned from the Persian Gulf suffering from a variety of symptoms that have been difficult to trace to a single source or substance. Our veterans have experienced a combination of symptoms in varying degrees of seriousness, including: fatigue, skin rash, muscle and joint pain, headache, loss of memory, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal and respiratory problems. Unfortunately, the initial response from the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans affairs was to express skepticism about veterans' claims of illness and disability. This strained the government's credibility with veterans and their loved ones who dealt with the very real affects of their service in the Gulf. 
I vividly remember a series of roundtable discussions I held with veterans across Iowa after being contacted by several families of Gulf War veterans stricken with undiagnosed illnesses. And these folks weren't just sick. They were tired. They were tired of getting the runaround from the government they defended. They were tired of people who refused to listen . . . or told them it was in their head . . . or that it had nothing to do with their service in the Gulf. 
Their stories put a human face on the results of a study I requested through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results add to the increasing volume of evidence that what these veterans were experiencing was indeed very real. More than one in three Gulf War veterans reported one or more significant medical problems. Fifteen percent reported two or more significant medical conditions. These Iowa veterans also reported significantly greater problems with quality of life issues than others on active duty at the time but not deployed in the Gulf. For example, Persian Gulf veterans had lower scores on measures of vitality, physical and mental health, ability to work, and increased levels of emotional problems and bodily pain. 
In addition, over 80 percent of the Gulf War veterans in the CDC study reported having been exposed to at least one potentially hazardous material during their Persian Gulf Deployment. A recent General Accounting Office report provided an alarming laundry list of such hazards including: `compounds used to decontaminate equipment and protect it against chemical agents, fuel used as a sand suppressant in and around encampments, fuel used to burn human waste, fuel in shower water, leaded vehicle exhaust used to dry sleeping bags, depleted uranium, parasites, pesticides, multiple vaccines used to protect against chemical warfare agents, and smoke from oil-well fires.' 
To this rather exhaustive list, we can also add exposure to nerve gas. The DOD and CIA have admitted that as many as 100,000 or more . . . that's 1 in 7 troops deployed in the Gulf . . . may have been exposed to chemical agents released into the atmosphere when U.S. troops destroyed an Iraqi weapons bunker. A Presidential Advisory Committee also found credible evidence of exposure to chemical agents in a second incident when troops crossed Iraqi front lines on the first day of the ground war. Chemical weapons specialists in these units said they detected poison gas. Unfortunately, these detections were initially neither acknowledged nor pursued by the Pentagon. 
That being said, the Pentagon and others have been more forthcoming recently with relevant information, documents, and research. But more needs to be done. I am pleased that the President, acting based on legislation I cosponsored, extended the time veterans will have to file claims with the government for illnesses related to their service in the Gulf. Previously, they had to show their illness surfaced within two years of their service. Now, they have until the end of 2001. This is a great victory for our veterans. Gulf War illnesses do not surface on a time line convenient to the rules of bureaucrats. This extension will help us meet our responsibility to take care of these soldiers. But, more still needs to be done. 
There is still substantial mystery and confusion surrounding the symptoms and health problems experienced by Gulf War veterans. While many veterans have been diagnosed with a recognizable disease, I am concerned about those who have no explanation, no label, no treatment for their suffering. More needs to be done to help these Americans. 
For example, the Presidential Advisory Committee has suggested research in three new areas to help close the gaps in what we know about Gulf War illnesses. They suggest research on the long-term health effects of low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents, the combined effects of medical injections meant to combat chemical warfare with other Gulf War risk factors, and on the body's physical response to stress. It is also imperative to ensure that longitudinal studies and mortality studies are funded since some health effects, such as cancer, may not appear for several years after the end of the Gulf War. 
Although there may be no single Gulf-War related disease so to speak, it is widely acknowledged that the multiple illnesses and symptoms experienced by Gulf War veterans are connected to their service during the war. Therefore, we must not forget on our solemn obligation to those who willingly served their country and put their lives in harm's way. 
To that end, I offer this amendment to increase research into the illnesses experienced by Persian Gulf veterans by $10 million. The funds would support much more research, including the evaluation and treatment of a host of neuro-immunological disorders, as well as possible connections to Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyaglia. 
Our veterans are not asking for much. They want answers. They want the truth. Our veterans answered our nation's call in war, and now we must answer theirs. Should our priorities include our Gulf War veterans? I believe the choice is self evident and absolutely clear.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, during the deliberations over the fiscal year 1999 Defense Authorization bill, I offered an amendment to increase spending for our nation's veterans medical needs. The amendment, offered on June 25th and numbered as 2982 would have allowed the transfer of $329 million from the defense budget to support the VA medical budget. The amendment would have transferred funds so as to avoid harming the readiness of the Armed Forces and the quality of life of military personnel and their families. 
The amendment's description was incomplete as to the listing of cosponsors and I would like to correct the record at this time. Along with Senator Wellstone of Minnesota, Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, also a longtime champion of veterans, should have been included as a cosponsor. 
Although the amendment did not receive the support of a majority of my colleagues, I appreciate the cosponsorship by Senator Bingaman and Senator Wellstone. I also appreciate the support of the 35 other Senators who voted in favor of increasing VA medical funding.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk that basically would equalize the treatment that the Budget Committee gave to the defense side of the ledger, would equalize that with the nondefense side of the ledger. 
Now, let me try to explain it as best I can. A couple of years ago in a situation involving Social Security here on the Senate floor, the Parliamentarian of the Senate ruled in a way that gave the chairman of the Budget Committee the authority to decide whether or not scoring would be done under the CBO estimates and rules or under OMB. 
This year, using that authority, the chairman of the Budget Committee sent a letter dated April 27, 1998, to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens. This letter, among other things, basically said--and I will quote from the letter: 
Staff have also identified $2.0 billion in potential policy outlays scorekeeping adjustments. If the Administration's own policy initiatives are legislated for the DWCF, I will exercise my authority to score the legislation recognizing the administration's outlay estimates. 
What that means, in `bureaucratese,' is that the chairman of the Budget Committee decided to use his authority to use the administration's policy initiatives--read that to be OMB--to adjust the outlay figures for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 
What did that add up to? We looked at it and those adjustments added up to $2.2 billion--$2.2 billion under OMB. Then the Budget Committee identified another $737 million in asset sales to come up with $2.9 billion additional for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 
But I am looking at the $2.2 billion. Forget about the other. The $2.2 billion came about because the chairman of the Budget Committee decided to use the administration's own policy initiatives and use the administration's outlay estimates from OMB. Mr. President, what that means is that the Budget Committee chairman has the authority because of a ruling by the Parliamentarian of this body that he can decide whether to use OMB or CBO estimates for outlay purposes.

Mr. HARKIN. Now, why am I taking the time here late at night to talk about this? Because we are about to go out on a break. We are going to go out for the month of August. In the first week of September when we come back, the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, the largest of the nondefense appropriations subcommittees--and that is my colleague and my friend, Senator Specter from Pennsylvania--will be calling us together to mark up the nondefense portion of the appropriations bill. 
Right now, the allocation that was given to our subcommittee with respect to outlays is almost $300 million below a freeze from last year--$300 million below a freeze from last year. 
The House, using those figures, marked up a bill, and the only way they marked it up was by completely eliminating all of the funding for the summer jobs program and all of the funding for the heating assistance for the elderly and poor--the LIHEAP program. They just eliminated all of that, and then they came in with the allocations that they had. 
What my amendment basically says is that the chairman of the Budget Committee ought to apply the same rationale, the same decision, on using OMB estimates for nondefense as he did for defense. We need the outlays that this amendment will give us to fund programs important to Members on both sides of the aisle. This is not a Democrat amendment. 
Now, we have heard many calls on the other side of the aisle to get more funding for IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. We have had more calls from the other side of the aisle to fund more programs for the National Institutes of Health. We have heard calls on this side of the aisle for more funding for Head Start, for low-income heating energy assistance programs for the elderly and the working poor. This cuts across both sides of this aisle. Those are just a few of the programs that will be drastically cut if we don't have the figures that could be given to us by the chairman of the Budget Committee. 
Now, I will point out one thing. Recently, the Senators here voted on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It passed 99-0--I don't know who was missing, but it passed 99-0-- 
a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that would raise NIH funding by $2 billion next year. That increase alone would require over $600 million in outlays. And I just said that our allocation puts us $300 million below a freeze.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank my chairman for his kind words. We have worked collaboratively. I could not ask for a better chairman than Senator Specter. We have worked closely together. We have talked privately about this and, quite frankly, I believe we are going to be able to work this out. That is why I will, at the appropriate time, withdraw my amendment, because I do believe we are going to be able to work this out with the chairman of the Budget Committee and with the chairman of the Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee. I believe we will be able to work this out in a manner that will be, I hope, conducive to getting the money that we need immediately--just the basic requirements that we want for the National Institutes of Health, that we want for LIHEAP, and a lot of the other programs that so many Members support here. I wanted to raise this issue because I think it is vitally important that we use the same set of scoring for both defense and nondefense. 
So, Mr. President, with the assurances of my chairman that we will be able to get this thing worked out, I just wanted to refer to one thing on the chart. With the reallocation, with the amount of money we would get from the rescoring, we would have $770 million. That would get us the money that we need for NIH. That would get us the money that we need for LIHEAP and for the other programs--Head Start and others--that we need, which Senators support here. 
Mr. President, again, I raise this issue because it is vitally important. I don't know how many other Senators want to speak on this issue. But I would be willing to yield the floor at this time for any other Senators who might want to speak on the issue.

Mr. HARKIN. I would ask the proponents, I would ask the majority leader then, is this the unanimous consent that would reopen the 1996 farm bill? Because the farm bill stipulates that a farmer could get half of the payment if he wanted to in December or January and could get the other half the next September. 
That was in the farm bill. As I understand it, this then changes what the farm bill provides. Is that correct?

Mr. HARKIN. Further reserving the right to object then, this then would undo some of the provisions that were in the 1996 farm bill, because it changes the dates and circumstances under which the farmer could get the AMTA payment, as it is called. 
I understand that some people want to do that and they want to reopen the farm bill. That is fine. But I would remind my colleagues that a couple of weeks ago we offered an amendment to take the caps off the commodity loan rates. For a typical Iowa farmer with 500 acres of corn that amendment would have put about $20,000 of additional income in the farmer's pocket this fall. Not only does this bill involve significantly less money for that farmer, but it only advances money that he is already going to get anyway. As far as increasing income to the farmer, this bill doesn't do a darned thing. 
What we need to do is to get the indemnity payments through that Senator Daschle is talking about, $500 million. There are a lot of farmers out there who are hurting very badly. I have to tell you, there is a crisis in agriculture today. Farmers have been devastated by bad weather, by crop disease in the Upper Midwest, and especially in the Dakotas. 
We can pass the $500 million for indemnity payments tonight. Why don't we pass that measure by unanimous consent right now to get that $500 million in indemnity payments out to farmers immediately? Why can't we do that? 
I ask the majority leader, why can't we pass that?

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry and Ms. Moseley-Braun I introduce the Children's Act for Responsible Employment or the CARE Act that will modernize our antiquated domestic child labor laws. Congressman Richard Gephardt and Congressman Tom Lantos are introducing companion legislation in the House. 
It is hard to imagine that we are on the verge of entering the 21st century and we still have young children working under hazardous conditions in the United States. Unfortunately, outdated U.S. child labor laws that have not been revamped since the 1930's allow this practice to continue. 
I have been working on the eradication of child labor overseas since 1992. At that time, I introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act, which prohibits the importation of products made by abusive and exploitative child labor. Since then, we have made some important progress, but in order to end child labor overseas the U.S. must lead by example and address child labor in our own backyard. 
Now, when I talk about child labor, I'm not talking about a part time job or a teenager who helps out on the family farm after school. There is nothing wrong with that. What I am talking about is the nearly 300,000 children illegally employed in the U.S. I would like to insert for the record at this time the testimony of Sergio Reyes, who was expected to testify at a hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Employment and Training I requested on June 11 of this year. Mr. Reyes was unable to attend that hearing but his written testimony tells a story that is becoming all to familiar in the United States. 
According to a recent study by economist Douglas L. Krause of Rutgers University, there are nearly 60,000 children under age 14 working in the U.S. Of those children, one will die every five days in a work related accident according to the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Nowhere is this more true than children who work in agriculture. 
In general, children receive fewer protections in agriculture than other industries. The minimum age for hazardous work in agriculture is 16, it is 18 for all other occupations. In a GAO preliminary report released in March 1998, the researchers noted that `children working in agriculture are legally permitted to work at younger ages, in more hazardous occupations, and for longer periods of time than their peers in other industries.' For example, a 13 year old child can not work as a clerk in an air conditioned office building, but can pick strawberries in a field in the middle of summer. That same report noted that over 155,000 children are working in agriculture. However, because that number is based on census data, the Farm Worker Union places the number at nearly 800,000 children working in agriculture. 
In December 1997, the Associated Press (AP) did a five part series on child labor in the United States documenting 4 year olds picking chili peppers in New Mexico and 10 year olds harvesting cucumbers in Ohio. In one tragic example reported by the AP, 14 year-old Alexis Jaimes was crushed to death when a 5000 lb. hammer fell on him while working on a construction site in Texas. I was outraged. 
At the June hearing of the Senate Employment and Training Subcommittee, two things became clear with regard to U.S. domestic child labor. First, agricultural child laborers are dropping out of school at an alarming rate. Over of 45 percent of farm worker youth will never complete high school. Second, the laws that we do have regarding child labor are inadequate to protect a modern workforce. Our present civil and criminal penalties are simply insufficient to deter compliance with the law and need to be strengthened and more vigorously enforced. 
My legislation, which is supported by the Administration and children's advocates groups across the country, such as the Child Labor Coalition and the Solidarity Center, will help rectify this alarming situation. It will; raise the current age of 16 to 18 in order to engage in hazardous agricultural work, close the loopholes in federal child labor laws which allow a three year old to work in the fields, and increase the civil and criminal penalties for child labor violations to a minimum of $500, up from $100 and a maximum of $15,000, up from $10,000. 
In closing. Let me say that we must end child labor--the last vestige of slavery in the world. It is time to give all children the chance at a real childhood and give them the skills necessary to compete in tomorrow's work place. There is no excuse for the number of children being maimed or killed in work related accidents when labor saving technologies have been developed in recent years. So, on today's farms, it makes even less sense than ever to put kids in dangerous situations operating hazardous machinery. 
Mr. President, I hope that we will be able to vote on this legislation in the near future so that we can prepare our children for the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend and colleague from Minnesota. Senator Thompson and I were prepared to engage in some colloquies and debates and things on this amendment. I was surprised. I thought it had been called up. I apologize to my friend from Minnesota. We were scheduled to start this debate on the issue of child labor. 
Mr. President, the Thompson amendment, which is the pending amendment, seeks to strike from the bill a provision that was incorporated at the committee level--subcommittee level and committee level--by unanimous consent. I don't know of any votes that were held on it. It seemed to be adopted overwhelmingly. No one raised any questions about it in full committee or anything like that. 
The provision deals with setting some parameters on procurement policy for the Federal Government, to the maximum extent possible to preclude the Federal Government from purchasing items made by forced or indentured child labor. 
I hardly know where to begin to respond to some of the issues raised by my friend from Tennessee, but let me attempt to start here. First of all, right now it is true that there are certain laws that we have that cover child labor in this country. But that gets to the point where if something happens, then you can take someone to court and you can fine them and debar them and all that. There is a long process and procedure for that. 
What this provision that was put in the committee bill seeks to do is to set up a structure to try to avoid or to preclude this from happening in the first place. So that those who sell to the Federal Government would be on notice that, first of all, there is a list of items that would be promulgated--published by the Department of Labor in consultation with the Department of State and Department of the Treasury--a list of items which would be very small in number because there are not that many items, a list of items that have historically and traditionally been made with the use of forced or indentured child labor; that if you are a seller to the Federal Government and if you are procuring or selling those kinds of items--like hand-knitted carpets, for example, or certain leather items, some apparel, rattan furniture, things like that--where the Department of Labor over the last 4 years in studying this issue has issued about four volumes on the use of forced and indentured child labor and the products that are made and that type of thing. These are very extensive studies that are made by the Department of Labor. What this provision in the bill does is it sets up a list. They put out a list. Then, if you are selling to the Federal Government, you check a little box that you attest--`attestation' they call it--you attest that the item that you are selling to the Federal Government was not made using forced or indentured child labor. That is basically it. 
The list is necessary for two reasons. First, it would narrow the scope to only suspect industries, thus preventing a sort of widespread kind of provision or a burdensome requirement on industries where the use of forced or indentured child labor does not occur. For example, I heard some mention made of Boeing aircraft. Boeing aircraft does not make things made by forced or indentured child labor. There has never been a scintilla of evidence to show that, so none of their products would be on the list. So we narrow the scope right away to just a few suspect industries. 
Second, the list is necessary because procurement officers need guidelines to enforce the intent of the legislation. Again, this list would be compiled based on the four child labor studies already released by the Department of Labor. Furthermore, the only companies that would be affected by this are ones that sell an item that appears on the list. 
If you don't sell an item that appears on the list, you will not be affected by this. You would not have to attest; you would not have to check the box and attest that the item was not made by forced or indentured child labor if you are not even on the list. Boeing and all those wouldn't even be on the list, so they would not have to check the box. That is the first thing. We keep it narrow, and that is why we have the list. 
Mention was made by the Senator from Tennessee about the Fair Labor Standards Act, that we already have this law. I say to the Senator from Tennessee that this law doesn't cover U.S. embassies abroad purchasing goods. For example, we could have an embassy, say in Pakistan, India, or whatever country, buying glassware or buying hand-knitted carpets or buying rattan furniture--I mentioned that--but they are not covered by this at all. I would like to have them covered by it. That is the intent of the provision that is in the committee bill. They are not covered by it. They would be covered by this. U.S. law, the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to the United States, but not to other countries. That is why this provision is necessary. 
These are not new requirements, as I have said before and in private conversation with the Senator from Tennessee. There are similar requirements for companies that sell to the Armed Forces. I will get into that in a second. Even though it has to do with different types of contracts, they are similar. I think there is a difference without a distinction, but they are similar, and I will get into that in a second. 
They said it would be duplicative. It is not really duplicative. Forced and indentured child labor is already illegal in interstate commerce, that is true, but what I am seeking to do, for debarment purposes, and what this amendment will do is have them attest up front that they are not using child labor. There are no provisions, as I understand, in law for that at this time. 
Next, there was a question raised about the constitutionality of the provision. It requires a contractor to agree to allow official access to the records of the employees and premises. As I said, we already have such a provision, and as I said, we discussed that in private. 
FAR, title 10 of Armed Forces, 10 U.S.C. section 2313 says:  
Agency authority. Section 2313, examination of records of contractor.

Mr. HARKIN. Again, you might ask, well, why should they have to look for this? Why should procurement officers have to be concerned about this? Under 48 CFR 9.406-2, `Causes for Debarment,' there is a whole list of things that they should look for that they made. The `Made in America' inscription that I have mentioned, violations of the Drug-Free Workplace Act--there is a whole list of things about which they have to be concerned. 
The fact is, they do not have to be concerned about child labor right now. It is not even a concern of theirs. So we find ourselves in a peculiar position that procurement laws for the Federal Government say that you have to meet certain standards--a drug-free workplace; you have to have a `Made in America' inscription if it is made in America; you have to have country of origin--but you do not have to be worried about child labor. I find that rather odd. 
What this all really arises out of is that in the 1930 Tariff Act, a provision was added that barred the entry into this country of any item made with forced or indentured labor. That has been part of our law since 1930. 
Well, forced or indentured labor--what does that mean? It has been interpreted to mean prison labor. There are other forms of forced or indentured labor. A year ago I wrote a letter to the Department of the Treasury asking for a clarification of this: Did forced or indentured labor cover forced or indentured child labor? The letter they wrote back was sort of: `Well, yes, we think it does because we say `forced or indentured labor.' We didn't specify it has to be adult labor, but it has never really been clarified. So we have sought to clarify that. 
Again, procurement officers have to take into account they have to be aware of whether or not something is made by prison labor. Can the Federal Government buy items made by prison labor? The answer is no, absolutely not. Can the Federal Government today buy items made by forced or indentured child labor? The answer is yes. We do it all the time overseas. We buy carpets, we buy furniture, we buy glassware, we buy leather. We buy a lot of items made by forced or indentured child labor. And that is what this provision seeks to get to. 
The Fair Labor Standards Act does not reach that far, does not reach overseas, does not reach to these items. Our procurement policies do not reach to our embassies abroad, for example. They are part of the Federal Government. They are part of the executive branch. They do buy items. But right now they are blind as to whether something is made by forced or indentured child labor. That is why this provision is in the bill. 
Lastly, Mr. President, I just point out that the administration is in support of this section, 642, of the Treasury-General Government appropriations bill. I have a letter here from Secretary Alexis Herman saying that this provision, a prohibition against the Federal Government's purchase of Federal products made by forced or indentured child labor `would establish a system to ensure that contractors take steps to avoid providing products to the Government that have been mined, produced, or manufactured using forced or indentured child labor. 
The Administration agrees that we should tap the purchasing power of the U.S. government in our efforts to eliminate egregious forms of child labor. In addition, the President's FY 1999 Budget includes an $89 million increase to address both international and domestic child labor abuses. We believe [this] amendment, coupled with our FY 1999 initiatives, will help reduce the prevalence of these forms of child labor. 
The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the presentation of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program. 
Again, I think that the provision stands foursquare on constitutional grounds. I do not believe there is any constitutional problem with it. I do not believe it runs far afield of provisions that we already have in present procurement law. It simply identifies one aspect, that is, like the `Made in America' or the `drug-free workplace' or `prison labor.' It identifies another one, and that is `forced or indentured child labor' as one of those items that we want to put up front and to have those who seek to sell items to the Federal Government attest that they are not using forced or indentured child labor in the provision of those goods. 
Again, this will be based upon the list. There will be a list, yes, publication of a list of prohibited items. 
The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Treasury and the Secretary of State, shall publish in the Federal Register every other year a list of items that such officials have identified that might have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. 
So we work from that list. And that list has to be published. 
The head of an executive agency shall include in each solicitation of offers for a contract for the procurement of an item included on a list published under subsection (b) [the list I just mentioned] the following clauses: 
Again, the clauses stating that the contractor has not indeed used forced or indentured child labor in the production of any of the items that are on that list. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this provision is not unconstitutional and does not interfere with the Constitution, and it does not interfere with the exercise of any fourth amendment right a Government contractor might have. 
The provision makes it possible for the Federal Government to ensure that it does not purchase items produced with forced or indentured child labor. Without ready Government access to records, workers and worker places, meaningful enforcement would be impossible. 
Now this principle applies in a whole range of worker protection laws. Now there is no need for a statutory probable cause requirement or a statutory procedure for challenging a search by a Government agency. A contractor who believes that a Federal agency had no probable cause to inspect his business would be free to refuse entry to the agency. It is a constitutional right. The agency would then be required to seek a warrant from a court, and if necessary, to ask the court to enforce the warrant. In this way, the court would ensure that the fourth amendment was followed. 
Lastly, this is how the process works under comparable statutes, like the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Applying the fourth amendment, the Supreme Court has held that OSHA must show probable cause or the legal equivalent if an employer refuses OSHA entry. There is no statutory probable cause requirement and no statutory procedure for challenging a search. Government agencies can be expected to develop reasonable and neutral criteria for seeking access. They would do so in order to comply with the fourth amendment which the courts will apply. 
OSHA, for example, has adopted such criteria, although the Occupational Safety Health Act does not prescribe this, and they have been upheld by the courts. Only Government agencies with a legitimate need for access would be entitled to access. The access provision in section 642 makes clear that the contractors' obligation is to provide access only to the head of an agency, a Federal officer, and only for the purpose of determining whether forced indentured child labor was used. 
So there is no reason to believe this provision would be invoked by an official acting without authority. But, if it happened, the contractor could not be sanctioned for refusing to cooperate, for example. 
The fourth amendment may not apply in these certain cases in any case until a contractor's consent to providing access is required to provide access. The accession provision is intended to be incorporated in a Government contract. The contract provision would be required only for companies who wish to supply the Federal Government with an item from a list of items that may have been introduced by forced or indentured child labor. 
I keep coming back to that. The Senator raises the specter that you will have the Government people all of a sudden going into Boeing and places like that. That won't happen, first of all, because they won't have anything on the list. So they won't have that. There will not be items that have been identified produced by forced or indentured child labor. Companies which choose to supply such items and which accept the terms of the contract have agreed to provide access. 
As I said, there is no constitutional problem with this provision whatsoever. 
Now, again, Mr. President, what we do have a problem with, and what this amendment really gets to, and for which there is no provision in law, is, when an arm of the Federal Government, such as the executive branch, acting through embassies overseas, procures items and those items are identified as having been produced by forced or indentured child labor, there is nothing that we can do about that--unless we adopt this provision, of course. And this is a good and reasonable place for this provision to be, in this appropriations bill, since we are providing appropriations for the running of the Government. So this is an appropriate place for the amendment. 
I think there is some urgency to this also. The urgency is that we are gaining more and more information around the world about the use of forced or indentured child labor. The United States has, quite appropriately--and I am happy to see it--taken a forward position on trying to do away with forced and indentured child labor. I mentioned the letter from the Secretary of Labor indicating that the President had already asked for, I think, $89 million in the budget to address child labor abuses both here and abroad. We participate heavily in IPEC, the International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor, which has been increased this year from $30 million, up from $3 million. 
So the U.S. Government has--and also through our work on the International Labor Organization, UNICEF, and others, we have been taking a very strong position against forced indentured child labor, as we should. But if one arm of our Government overseas is openly procuring items made by forced and indentured child labor, what kind of a signal does that send? So that is what this provision in the bill seeks to end, and would end, if this provision remains in. 
Now, the things that the Senator from Tennessee is talking about we already incorporate in our amendment. There is a debarment procedure provision in the bill. That is already there. That debarment procedure is already there. What the Senator's amendment does is, it takes away those preliminary steps of publishing a list and then say to a procurement officer, look out for these items, and if you are buying one of these items, have that company attest on the form that they are not using forced and indentured child labor. If they do, then they are agreeing that you can, as we have under FAR--that the head of an agency is authorized to inspect the records of that company. 
As I said earlier, the Senator from Tennessee, I think, raised one point that I think was very legitimate, and that was in the original amendment. It says, on page 99, the words `any official of the United States.' Quite frankly, that is too broad. As we look at the FAR and at title X for the Department of Defense, it uses the words `the head of an agency.' So I have a perfecting amendment that I am going to offer that would strike out `any official of the United States' and insert in lieu thereof `the head of the executive agency or the inspector general of the executive agency.'

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what this perfecting amendment does, very simply, is it takes the suggestion of the Senator from Tennessee and strikes out `any official of the United States' and inserts in lieu thereof `the head of the executive agency or the inspector general of the executive agency.' 
Secondly, it strikes the word `might' from page 99, because in the original language it said that they shall publish in the Federal Register every other year a list of items that `might have been mined. . ..' We strike that out. That is a great suggestion, to say that they have to publish a list of items that such officials have identified that `have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor.' 
So this perfecting amendment tightens up my original amendment in two ways. It provides that only the head of an agency or the inspector general of that agency may be the one to do the inspection or authorize the inspection. Secondly, it says that the published list can only be of items that have been identified as having been mined, manufactured, or produced by forced or indentured child labor. 
The rest of the provision remains the same as it is in the bill, but this tightens up those two provisions. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is a plague sweeping across our Nation. It is ruining an untold number of lives, claiming countless numbers of our children. It is in our streets as well as our classrooms. Drugs have become more abundant. But there is a new drug, one that is far more addictive and readily available than heroin, cocaine, or any other illegal narcotic. Methamphetamine is becoming the leading addictive drug in this Nation. From the suburbs, to city streets, to the corn rows of Iowa, meth is destroying thousands of lives every year. The majority of those lives, unfortunately, are our children. 
Methamphetamine is commonly referred to as Iowa's drug of choice in my State. It is reaching epidemic proportions as it sweeps from the west coast, ravages through the Midwest, and is now beginning to reach the east coast. The trail of destruction of human lives as a result of methamphetamine addiction stretches across America. 
To illustrate the violence that meth elicits in people, methamphetamine is cited as a contributing factor in 80 percent of domestic violence cases in my State, and a leading factor in a majority of violent crimes. I recently introduced the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act which I think will get support and get through the Senate. But I offer this amendment today as an opportunity to take immediate action to help our Nation's law enforcement in their war on methamphetamine. 
This amendment makes a simple and modest request, taking $8 million in certain offsets and puts those dollars where they can do real good to combat the growing problem of methamphetamine. 
These funds will be added to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program to be used for increased enforcement and prosecution of meth dealers, additional undercover agents, and to help pay for the tremendous cost of confiscation and cleanup of clandestine meth labs. 
The number of meth arrests, court cases, and confiscation of labs continues to escalate. The number of clandestine meth labs confiscated and destroyed in 1998 is on pace to triple the number that was confiscated in 1997--so triple this year over last year. The cost of cleaning up each lab ranges from $5,000 to $90,000. This cost is being absorbed by communities who are not prepared or experienced to deal with the dangers of methamphetamine. 
These clandestine meth labs create an enormous amount of hazardous waste. For every 1 pound of methamphetamine produced, there are 5 to 6 pounds of hazardous waste as a by-product. This waste is highly toxic and seeps into the ground where eventually it ends up in our drinking water supply. 
The dangers posed to law enforcement officers are also greatly increased by these meth labs. Many peddlers of meth have now what they call `kitchen' labs. Meth pushers are now simply using mobile homes or even pickup trucks to produce their drugs. Combining many volatile chemicals in an uncontrolled environment, meth labs are time bombs to police officers and communities everywhere. 
I believe we have a window of opportunity as a nation to take a stand right now to defeat this scourge. This amendment will not solve all of these problems, but it will give law enforcement the support that they vitally need in their efforts to defeat this dangerous drug. 
Mr. President, family after family is being devastated across the Midwest. In my State, I have seen methamphetamine skyrocket in its use--the importation in the State and the development of these methamphetamine labs in the State of Iowa. Communities are trying to fight this, but they do not have the resources. Children are being lost and getting hooked to this deadly drug every day. So the time now is to do whatever we can to try to halt the growth of these meth labs, to give our high-intensity drug traffic areas the tools that they need to stop this drug, to help our communities, and most importantly to help our law enforcement officials.

I know your chairman is having the same experience out in his State, too, as we are in Iowa. I understand that you and the chairman, and Senator Kohl, are working on putting all this together. Obviously, it would be my intention to withdraw the amendment if this whole thing gets worked out. I am sure that we will get it worked out.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Roberts and several other Members in introducing this legislation designed to establish national rules regarding standards, labeling and notification requirements for foods. 
The legislation recognizes the reality that we have a truly national system of food production, processing and distribution. Perhaps the most apparent reason for a national system of rules relating to regulation of foods involves the economic costs associated with complying with varying state requirements. The burden of satisfying a number of different, and perhaps conflicting, requirements throughout the country can be significant. 
Another aspect of the matter, though, involves the benefits to consumers. Certainly, when it comes to labeling and notification, I believe that consumers are entitled to have plenty of information that will help them make sound purchasing decisions for their families. I believe there can come a point, however, when a multitude of varying labeling and notification requirements can confuse consumers and be counterproductive with respect to helping them make sound choices. 
Accordingly, this bill would establish a framework for uniform national rules relating to food labeling, standards and notification requirements while recognizing the interest of the states in regulatory activities involving food. Under the bill, states would continue to have full authority in the area of food sanitation requirements. States could also petition for new national standards or exemption from established national standards and could take emergency action inconsistent with the national standards in the case of imminent hazards. States would continue to have full authority to establish and enforce standards relating to matters on which a national standard had not been set. In addition, the bill specifically identifies a number of types of labeling requirements as to which the states would continue to have full authority. 
The bill being introduced today is a sound starting point for further discussion and study, and for hearings that I hope can be scheduled soon. I am sure that during this process issues and considerations will arise that will need to be addressed in the legislation. I look forward to working with the Senator from Kansas and other colleagues toward producing a final bill that will achieve broad support and be enacted.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, methamphetamine is fast becoming the leading illegal addictive drug in this nation. From quiet suburbs, to city streets, to the corn rows of Iowa, meth is destroying thousands of lives every year. A majority of those lives, unfortunately, are our children's. 
Methamphetamine is now commonly referred to as Iowa's illegal drug of choice. This drug is reaching epidemic proportions as it sweeps from the west coast, ravages through the Midwest, and is now beginning to reach the east. The trail of destruction of human life as a result of methamphetamine addiction is running across America from coast to coast. To illustrate the violence it elicits in people, methamphetamine is cited as a contributing factor in 80 percent of domestic violence cases in Iowa and a leading factor in a majority of violent crimes. 
In 1996, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the Methamphetamine Control Act which has done some good. However, in talking to local law enforcement and concerned citizens across Iowa, it is obvious that the methamphetamine problem has exploded beyond anything we envisioned in 1996. 
The number of meth arrests, court cases, and confiscation of labs continues to escalate. In the Midwest alone, the number of clandestine meth labs confiscated and destroyed for 1998 is on pace to triple the number confiscated and destroyed in 1997. The cost of clean-up for each lab ranges from $5,000 to $90,000. This cost is being absorbed by communities who are not prepared, or experienced with the dangers of drug trafficking. 
Additionally, these clandestine meth labs create an enormous amount of hazardous waste. For every 1 pound of methamphetamine produced, there are 5 to 6 pounds of hazardous waste as a by-product. This waste is highly toxic and often seeps into the ground where eventually it ends up in our drinking water supply. 
The dangers posed to law enforcement officers also are greatly increased by these labs. Many peddlers of meth are now what they call `kitchen' labs. Meth pushers are now simply using mobile homes or even pick-up trucks to produce their drugs. Combining many volatile chemicals in an uncontrolled environment, meth labs are time bombs to police officers and communities everywhere. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1998. My legislation takes a comprehensive, common sense approach in battling this growing epidemic. It calls for an increase in resources to law enforcement working through the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program and establishes swift and certain penalties for those producing and peddling meth. 
Also, my legislation expands school and community-based prevention efforts at the local level--targeting those areas that need it the most. Finally, this proposal calls on the National Institute on Drug Abuse to find exactly what makes methamphetamine so very addictive--especially to our young people--and the best methods for beating the addiction. 
Mr. President, I believe that we have a window of opportunity as a nation to take a stand right now to defeat this scourge. Everyday, meth infiltrates our city streets and suburbs, leading more and more people down a path of personal destruction. Families are being devastated and communities are fighting an uphill battle against this powerful drug. The time is now to make a stand to protect our communities and schools by passing this legislation.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand that the intent of Section 254(h) of the Communications Act of 1934, commonly referred to as the Schools, Libraries and Rural Health Care Providers program or the `E-Rate' program, is to provide schools, libraries and health rural care providers with access to advanced telecommunications services. I believe that the Iowa Communications Network (ICN), a state run and owned communications network, as well as similarly situated entities, should be able to fully participate in the E-rate program. If the ICN is denied that opportunity by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Iowa schools will be unfairly and improperly placed at a disadvantage. 
The FCC has said that an entity must be a common carrier to be a telecommunications carrier, as that term is used in Section 254(h) of the Communications Act of 1934, and to receive payments from the universal service fund for providing telecommunications service to schools, libraries and rural health care providers. The Universal Service Administrative Company is treating the ICN as a carrier for purposes of paying into the universal service fund, and ICN is, in fact, paying into the fund. The Iowa Utilities board, the local expert on this issue, has stated that the ICN functions as a common carrier under Iowa law, since the ICN serves all of its customers on equal terms and conditions. In light of these facts, does the center believe the ICN and other systems like it should be fully eligible to receive the benefits of the fund, including those available to telecommunications carriers?

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few comments on a bill that Senator Mikulski and I introduced just yesterday. The bill number is S. 2340. It is called the Patient Access to Acupuncture Services Act of 1998. It will provide limited coverage for acupuncture under Medicare and under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. It is an important bill that reflects an appropriate and needed response to both progress in science and to the demand for complementary and alternative treatments for pain and illness. 
I acknowledge Senator Mikulski's strong support for the bill and for cosponsoring the bill. She has been a strong supporter of effective alternative therapies and has long realized and appreciated the importance and significance of such therapies to our health care system. 
Mr. President, approximately 90 million Americans suffer from chronic illnesses, which, each year, cost society roughly $659 billion in health care expenditures, lost productivity and premature death. Despite the high costs of this care, studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveal that the health care delivery system is not meeting the needs of the chronically ill in the United States. 
Many of these Americans are looking desperately for effective, less costly alternatives therapies to relieve the debilitating pain they suffer. In 1990 alone, Americans spent nearly $14 billion out-of-pocket on alternative therapies. Harvard University researchers have found that fully one-third of Americans regularly use complementary and alternative medicine, making an estimated 425 million visits to complementary and alternative practitioners of these therapies--surpassing those made to conventional primary care practitioners! 
And with good reason. Last November, a consensus conference of the National Institutes of Health approved the use of acupuncture in standard U.S. medical care. It was the first time that the NIH had endorsed as effective a major alternative therapy, and it was just the type of medical breakthrough that I had hoped for and envisioned when I worked to establish the Office of Alternative Medicine at NIH. 
The NIH experts cited data showing that acupuncture can effectively relieve certain conditions, such as nausea, vomiting and pain, and shows promise in treating chronic conditions such as lower back pain, substance addictions, osteoarthritis and asthma. 
In 1993, the FDA reported that Americans spent $500 million for up to 12 million acupuncture visits. In 1996, after reviewing the science, the FDA removed acupuncture needles from the category of `experimental medical devices' and now regulates them just as it does other devices, such as surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes. Acupuncture is effectively used by practitioners around the world. The World Health Organization has approved its use to treat a variety of medical conditions, including pulmonary problems and rehabilitation from neurological damage. 
It has been reported that more than 1 million Americans currently receive acupuncture each year. Access to qualified acupuncture professionals for appropriate conditions should be ensured. Including this important therapy under Medicare and FEHBP coverage will promote a progressive health system that integrates treatment from both acupuncturists and physicians. 
and in many cases we see more and more where physicians are acupuncturists. 
It will expand patient care options. I also believe it will reduce health care costs because of the relatively low cost of acupuncture compared to conventional pain management therapies. 
Research is still needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of other alternative therapies. This research is vitally important, but we must act now to help the millions of Americans who can benefit from the knowledge we have already gained. 
The 21st century is just around the corner. Less than 50 years ago, treatments that are now considered conventional--organ transplants, nitroglycerin for heart patients, immunology, and x-ray and laser technology--were decried as quackery by the medical establishment. Everyday we face new biological and emotional challenges for which modern Western medicine has no remedy. Now science is revealing the effectiveness of many complementary and alternative treatments, including acupuncture, 
which I might point out is not a new treatment but, indeed, has been practiced in China for the last 2,000 to 3,000 years, and, increasingly, more Americans are choosing these alternative therapies to manage their health and to treat the illness. 
Let us listen to the science, and heed the urgent need for progress. Mr. President, the nation's leading scientists have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for a wide range of pain and illness. It makes common sense that Medicare and FEHBP cover this legitimate course of therapy. 
I invite other Senators as cosponsors. Hopefully, we can get the bill passed during this session. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

It will expand patient care options. I also believe it will reduce health care costs because of the relatively low cost of acupuncture compared to conventional pain management therapies. 
Research is still needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of other alternative therapies. This research is vitally important, but we must act now to help the millions Americans who can benefit from the knowledge we have already gained. 
The 21st century is just around the corner. Less than 50 years ago, treatments that are now considered conventional--organ transplants, nitroglycerin for heart patients, immunology, and x-ray and laser technology--were decried as quackery by the medical establishment. Everyday we face new biological and emotional challenges for which modern Western medicine has no remedy. Now science is revealing the effectiveness of many complementary and alternative treatments, including acupuncture, and increasingly more Americans are choosing them to manage their health and treat their illness. 
Let us listen to the science, and heed the urgent need for progress. Mr. President, the nation's leading scientists have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for a wide range of pain and illness. It makes common sense that Medicare and FEHBP cover this legitimate course of therapy. 
Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be entered into the Record.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing with my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, an important piece of legislation that will help to protect and preserve Medicare. The bill is entitled the Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act of 1998. 
For nearly ten years now, I have worked to combat fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicare program. As Chairman and now Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight of the administration of Medicare, I've held hearing after hearing and released report after report documenting the extent of this problem. While virtually no one was paying attention to our effort for many years, we've succeeded in bringing greater attention and focus to this problem in the past several years. 
Part of our effort has been to try to quantify the scope of the problem. Several years ago, the General Accounting Office reported that up to 10 percent of Medicare funds could be lost to fraud, waste and abuse each year. 
Many questioned that estimate as too large. They said the problem existed, but it wasn't nearly as big as 10 percent. Then, as you know, last year the Inspector General conducted the first-ever detailed audit of Medicare payments. That Chief Financial Officer Act audit found that fully 14 percent of Medicare payments in 1996, or $23 billion, had been made improperly. 
That's a $23 billion `waste tax' on the American people. And the purpose of today's summit to figure out the best way to cut that tax. So, how do you cut this tax? I know there are no `magic-wand' solutions--this is a complex problem with many components. But basically, you need four things: well thought out laws, adequate resources, effective implementation and the help of seniors and health providers. We've made progress on each of these fronts over the last couple of years, but much more remains to be done. 
First, the reforms embodied in the Health Insurance Portability Act and the Balanced Budget Act must be effectively implemented. Effective implementation of these new reforms are vital and must be given high priority. And, Medicare, the Inspector General and the Justice Department must continue to aggressively use new authority to crack down on Medicare fraud. 
The Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act I am introducing today will take a number of important steps to stop the ravaging of Medicare. 
This Bill for example, would direct HCFA to double and better target audits and reviews to detect and discourage mispayments. Currently only a tiny fraction of Medicare claims are reviewed before being paid and less than 2 percent of providers receive a comprehensive audit annually. We must have the ability to separate needed care from bill padding and abuse. 
It would also require Medicare to aggressively use it's newly improved `inherent reasonableness' authority. It is vitally important that Medicare carriers be held accountable for their performance in protecting the program from abuse. Preventing abuse and other inappropriate payments should be the most important performance criteria these entities are measured by. 
Our bill would also expand the Medicare Senior Waste Patrol Nationwide. Seniors are our front line of defense against Medicare fraud, waste and abuse. However, too often, seniors don't have the information they need to detect and report suspected mistakes and fraud. By moving the Waste Patrol nationwide, implementing important BBA provisions and assuring seniors have access to itemized bills we will strike an important blow to Medicare waste. 
The bill would also give Medicare the authority to be a more prudent purchaser. As passed by the Senate, the Balanced Budget Act gave Medicare the authority to quickly reduce Part B payment rates (except those made for physician services) it finds to be grossly excessive when compared to rates paid by other government programs and the private sector. In conference, the provision was limited to reductions of no more than 15 percent. This bill would restore the original Senate language. In addition, to assure that Medicare gets the price it deserves given its status as by far the largest purchaser of medical supplies and equipment, Medicare would pay no more than any other government program for these items. Finally, overpayments for prescription drugs and biologicals would be eliminated by lowering Medicare's rate to the lowest of either the actual acquisition cost or 95% of the wholesale cost. 
The Medicare Waste Tax reduction Act of 1998 would also ensure that Medicare does not pay for claims owed by other plans. Too often, Medicare pays claims that are owed by private insurers because it has know way of knowing a beneficiary is working and has private insurance that should pay first. This provision would reduce Medicare losses by requiring insurers to report any Medicare beneficiaries they insure. Also, Medicare would be given the authority to recover double the amount owed by insurers who purposely let Medicare pay claims they should have paid. 
Additionally, coordination between Medicare and private insurers would be strengthened. Often, those ripping off Medicare are also defrauding private health plans. Yet, too little information on fraud cases is shared between Medicare and private plans. In order to encourage better coordination, health plans and their employees could not be held liable for sharing information with Medicare regarding health care fraud as long as the information is not false, or the person providing the information had no reason to believe the information was false. 
Another critical component of any successful comprehensive plan to cut the Medicare waste tax is to focus on prevention. Most of our efforts now look at finding and correcting the problem after they occur. While this is important and we need to do even more of it, we all know that prevention is much more cost effective. The old adage `A stitch in time saves nine' was never more true. A major component of an enhanced prevention effort would be the provision of increased assistance and education for providers to comply with Medicare rules. 
A good deal of the mis-payments made by Medicare are the result not of fraud or abuse, but of simple misunderstanding of Medicare billing rules by providers. Therefore, this bill provides $10 million a year to fund a major expansion of assistance and education for providers on program integrity requirements. This bill would also ensure the reduction of paperwork and administrative hassle that could prove daunting to providers. Health professionals have to spend too much time completing paperwork and dealing with administrative hassles associated with Medicare and private health plans. In order to reduce this hassle and provide more time for patient care, the Institute of Medicine would be charged with developing a comprehensive plan by no later than June 1, 1999. Their recommendations are to include the streamlining of variations between Medicare and other payers. 
Mr. President, while we have made changes to medicare in attempts to extend its solvency thru the next decade, we urgently need to take other steps to protect and preserve the program for the long-term. We should enact the reforms in this bill to weed out waste, fraud and abuse as a first priority in this effort. I urge all my colleagues to review this proposal and hope that they will join me in working to pass it yet this year.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment that I just offered would restore $66 million for the President's Food Safety Initiative, the funding of which I believe should be a national priority. I understand the constraints faced here on this subcommittee on spending. But food safety is an increasing problem in this country. As the President has pointed out, I think we ought to make food safety a priority. If there is one thing we all do, it is that we all eat. And there are few things more important than knowing that the food you are going to eat isn't going to make you sick. 
So this amendment really is to ensure that the health and safety of American consumers is protected, and protected even better than it has been in the past. 
Again, Mr. President, I don't know the reason why this is happening. But more and more frequently we are getting outbreaks of pathogens and foodborne illnesses in this country. 
Just last month, in June of 1998, there were 12 outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in this country. Here is the chart that depicts that. I know there are more dots here than 12. But there are 12 different outbreaks. Some outbreaks occurred in more than one State. So we had 12 different outbreaks. It affected consumers in 41 States and caused more than 7,000 illnesses. 
That is in the month of June of this year. That is one month. That is just the tip of the iceberg. It is estimated that there are millions of cases and over 9,000 deaths per year in this country from foodborne illnesses, including a lot of kids who need dialysis, or kidney transplants, after eating food contaminated with what now has become a well known pathogen, E. coli 0157H7. We all know that kids get it. They get deathly ill from it. Many die. Those who do not go on kidney dialysis have kidney transplants. 
Here is the interesting thing. This pathogen, E. coli 0157H7, we all read about. And you can talk to persons on the street and they know about E. coli 0157H7. It didn't even exist 20 years ago. So we are seeing new mutations. Twenty years ago, E. coli 0157H7 didn't even exist, and today thousands of people are getting sick and dying from it throughout the United States.

Mr. HARKIN. I want to make it clear for the Record that the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has been the leader in going after this aspect of the taxpayer funding of tobacco at USDA for years. So I just thank the Senator for letting me capitalize on that and use this money that he has tried so valiantly over the years to stop--to use that for this offset for the Food Safety Initiative. 
I appreciate the Senator's support and his willingness to let us use the offset that he has been trying to kill for years, because it really is unfair for the taxpayers of this country to spend $60 million every year in support of USDA activities that go to help grow more tobacco in this country. If they want to do it, let the tobacco companies fund it themselves. I thank the Senator for his years on this effort in this regard.

Mr. HARKIN. I want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his kind words. But more than that, I want to thank him for his efforts through the years to make sure we had a Food and Drug Administration that was on the side of consumers in this country, a strong Food and Drug Administration that made sure that we could have confidence when we went to the drugstore or to the grocery store to get our food, drugs and medicine, that they would indeed be safe. I want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership in that area and thank him for his kind and generous support of this amendment. 
Everything he said is right on mark. It is not just the consumers, I say to my friend from Massachusetts. I earlier had some comments from people representing the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Broiler Council, the National Food Processors Association, all of whom basically said we need better surveillance, we need better risk assessment, we need better education out there. That is what this amendment does. It is the processors, the wholesalers--everyone recognizes that this is a new phenomenon, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, something new we have not experienced in the past. Everyone recognizes the need to get on top of this.

Mr. HARKIN. You are right about E. coli. I counted up in June of this year, this last month, and we had six E. coli outbreaks of food poisoning in this country, of a strain of E. coli that didn't exist 20 years ago. It wasn't there. And now it is here. It is not only making people sick, but killing kids. 
There are new pathogens that become more virulent. The surveillance systems we have in place and the risk assessment and the other inspection systems we have--the FDA, as the Senator knows, only on average inspects our food processing plants once every 10 years.

Mr. HARKIN. I wonder how many consumers know that only 2 percent of all the produce they eat that comes from outside this country is ever inspected--2 percent. The rest of it, who knows what is on that stuff when it comes to this country. The consumers don't know this. And as the Senator said, it will go up in the future. We will get more and more of that produce from other countries. That is why this is really needed. 
I thank the Senator for his support and his comments on this. 
Mr. President, there is an editorial that appeared in today's Los Angeles Times that I was just made aware, calling on us to do something about food safety. Obviously, they probably didn't know about my amendment. But they did say. 
. . . the U.S. Senate can take a big step to combat food contamination by restoring all or most of the $101-million initiative the Clinton administration has proposed to improve food safety. The money would go to hire new safety inspectors, upgrade technologies, and bring coherence to disjointed oversight. 
So far, The Senate has allocated only a piddling $2.6 million for the initiative at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nothing at all at the Food and Drug Administration. 
The editorial went on to say that we needed more funding. I will quote the last paragraph of the editorial: 
Food safety is an unassailable cause. There are some things that only government can do, and guaranteeing the wholesomeness of our food supply is one of them.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one other thing. I listened to the comments made by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, when he very poignantly told the story of the young child who died in Illinois. I just point out again that these outbreaks are growing with rapidity and showing up in the oddest of places. For example, last month, dozens of children got sick--again, with this E. coli 0157H7--in Atlanta after swimming in a public pool. 
Many of these children spent time on dialysis for kidney failure. This was just last month. Now, the infection they got was the same strain of E. coli that came from a local ground beef recall in an outbreak in Atlanta 2 weeks earlier. So 2 weeks earlier, there was an outbreak of E. coli from a ground beef recall, and now it shows up in a swimming pool 2 weeks later. Children in five States were infected from this ultimately foodborne illness. So it started out as a foodborne illness and then it got into a swimming pool. Dozens of kids got sick and some spent time on kidney dialysis. 
So that is how virulent some of these strains have become. Not only do they show up in the food, they are so virulent that not even the chlorine in the swimming pool could kill it. 
Again, Mr. President, I think this amendment deserves widespread support. I point out again that the President asked for $101 million to fully fund his food initiative. I wish we could do it. We should do it. But because of the problem with offsets and points of order and getting 60 votes, we had to look around to find legitimate offsets that we could use. As I said, we found offsets for $66 million. So this brings the funding up to $66 million. It is not up the full $101 million, but it brings it to $68 million. Those offsets, of course, were the money that we got from taking away the Federal Government's subsidizing of tobacco, $15 million from the CCC computer account, and $13 million from the ARS buildings and facilities account. 
I want to make a couple of things very clear before I close my comments. I have heard some talk around that there is some new enforcement authority here. I want to make it clear that there is no new enforcement authority in my amendment. 
Secondly, there are no new user fees for the meat industry--not one bit of user fees for the meat industry in this amendment. 
In the bill now, there is $2.6 million for this Food Safety Initiative. The House only put in $15 million. The President asked for $101 million. The amount that this amendment would increase it to would be $66 million. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. As my colleague, the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee may know, I have been advised that the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) authorized a new streamlined pre-market notification system for food packaging materials. The current regulatory process involves significant delays, resulting in lost sales and decisions not to bring new products to market that would improve food safety and protect the public health. 
The new notification system will substantially reduce the length of the FDA review process and allow the introduction of advanced packaging materials. The Agency will still, however, receive all of the information needed to establish the safety of packaging materials and will continue to be able to keep unsafe materials off the market. 
I also have been advised that FDAMA requires that certain funding criteria be met for the program to take effect as scheduled on April 1, 1999. 
The Act calls for funding of the pre-market notification program at a level of $1.5 million in FY 1999. I note that the counterpart legislation passed by the House Appropriations Committee currently provides for the sum of $500,000. It is my hope that the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee will further address this issue in conference in order for the FDA to implement this important reform as intended by Congress.

Mr. HARKIN. I certainly appreciate the efforts of the distinguished Chairman to fund WIC adequately within the limitations of the bill. However, analysis supporting the Administration's budget request indicates that the amount provided will not be sufficient to maintain WIC participation at the level it is expected to reach at the end of this fiscal year. Because of the success of WIC. I believe it is important to do whatever we can to ensure that WIC participation does not fall for lack of funding. My amendment provides a portion--but much less than all--of the additional appropriation the Administration believes is necessary to avoid a reduction in WIC participation during fiscal 1999.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I hope we don't have to take too long on this. I know Senator Reed wants to speak. I don't know that too many others want to speak on this amendment. It is a very important amendment. It is simple and straightforward. It simply says that the laws we have that make it illegal to sell tobacco products to kids should be adequately enforced. To do that, the amendment I have just sent to the desk provides full funding for the ongoing anti teen smoking program at the FDA, which is funded through the Agriculture Appropriations bill. It pays for this with an assessment fee on tobacco companies that equals about $25 per teen smoker. The amendment does nothing more or less than that. 
It in no way is intended to be a substitute for action on comprehensive tobacco reform. I am hopeful we will still have it. It does not speak for the issue of FDA authority over tobacco products. It does not impact on tobacco company advertising. And it does not impact on tobacco farmers. It simply provides the money necessary to continue an ongoing program, a program that is already in effect, but to do it in a way that is effective. 
This amendment is virtually identical to the amendment that Senators Chafee, Reed, I, and others, offered last September, which passed this body by a vote of 70 to 28 last September. 
The bill before us provides $34 million for the FDA antiteen smoking initiative. That was the money that we put in there last September. That was the 70 to 28 vote that added the $34 million. But $134 million is needed to assure that the effort is fully effective. This was the amount requested by the President, and it is basically the same as was requested in the Commerce Committee tobacco bill. 
So, again, the amount that is in this amendment is what was requested by the President, and it is about the same as was requested in the Commerce Committee bill that was voted out of the Commerce Committee. Our amendment basically increases the amount in the bill for this purpose from $34 million to $134 million for next year. 
As I said, it is fully offset by establishing an assessment fee on tobacco companies based on their share of the tobacco market. Because of budget scoring rules, it is necessary to collect this assessment totaling about $150 million to provide for an additional $100 million needed. 
For example, if the total tobacco market in the United States this year is $100 billion, and let's say, for example, Philip Morris has 60 percent of that share, they would pay 60 percent of the $150 million, or $90 million. So the assessment on the tobacco companies is based upon their percentage of the total tobacco market in the United States. As I mentioned, this roughly equates to about $25 per teen smoker. 
Mr. President, the amendment, again, returns us to the most fundamental question of our long and ongoing debate on tobacco. The fundamental question is whether we are serious about helping America's kids avoid the deadly addiction of tobacco use, and whether we are prepared to continue and adequately fund an existing program designed to deter illegal sales to children. 
As I mentioned last year, this body overwhelmingly affirmed increased funding of the FDA use of the antitobacco initiative with a strong bipartisan vote, as I said earlier, of 70 to 28. That was a vote on the Chafee-Reed-Harkin amendment on September 3 of 1997. 
For Senators' elucidation, this is basically the same amendment. It just takes it from $34 million to $134 million. In other words, it fully funds the program so it can be effective. Plainly and simply, this amendment is about America's kids and protecting them from the disease, suffering, and death caused by smoking and nicotine addiction. 
With a death toll of more than 400,000 each year, smoking kills more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, motor vehicles, fires, homicides, illicit drugs, and suicide all combined. Mr. President, this is a chart that most graphically illustrates why tobacco is the No. 1 killer in America today. As I said, you can add up all of this--alcohol deaths, accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs, fires--and they don't equal 
the 418,690 deaths caused by tobacco last year. 
It is an epidemic. It is an epidemic that begins with underage smoking. We know from the documents that have been released to the various court cases in the States involving the tobacco companies now that they have targeted young people. We know from their documents that 90 percent of adult smokers began at or before the age of 18. We know that for years the tobacco companies have targeted young people to smoke--not older people. They target young people because they know if they can get these young people hooked by the time they are 18, they have got them hooked. 
Again, all I ask is look at the advertising the tobacco companies use. It is always young people. It is Joe Camel. It is young people. It is young people on the beach. They are having a lot of fun. And it is designed to get young people. It is not designed for old fogies like me. It is designed for the young people. All you have to do is look at the ads the tobacco companies put out there, and you will know they are trying to get young people hooked. 
Today, like every other day, 3,000 young Americans will begin smoking--3,000; 1,000 of them will die every single day. That is more than three jumbo jets full of our children crashing every day. At current smoking rates, 1 million American kids under 18 who are alive today will die from slow suffocation due to a smoking-related disease. They will die hooked up to machines and craving nicotine. And teenage smoking rates are still climbing. 
There is a chart that shows the rate among high school seniors. It is at a 17-year high. It has been shooting up ever since the early 1990s. We are now at a 17-year high for youth smoking. The addiction is very real. Almost half of all the kids who experiment with as few as three cigarettes go on to become regular smokers. 
More than half of the kids who smoke daily said that they smoked their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking in the morning. I found that hard to believe. But then I am not a smoker. But I drove from my house one morning. My daughter goes to a local public school out in Virginia. About 7 o'clock in the morning I drove her to school. She had a lot of stuff she had to take. I put her in the car and drove her down to school. You drive down there, and you see all of these kids walking down the streets and on the street corners before they go into school at between 7 and 7:15 in the morning smoking cigarettes. I could hardly believe it at that early hour. 
Then I see that more than half of them smoke their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking in the morning. All you have to do is go to any local school about halfway down the street before the school and watch the kids walking to school and you will see that this is true. 
More than 90 percent of kids who smoke or use spit tobacco experience at least one symptom of nicotine withdrawal when they try to quit. When they say you have a choice to smoke or not, once these kids are hooked, I tell you, they don't have much of a choice. 
Compared to the comprehensive tobacco legislation that we need, this amendment makes just a small investment in the future of our children. But even this small investment will pay off in longer lives and better health for millions of Americans. Since each dollar spent to implement FDA regulations has been shown to result in at least $48 worth of health and social benefits, it is a sound investment that we can make. 
Let me review briefly what this amendment will fund at FDA. Right now FDA, as I said, has about $34 million in this fiscal year 1998. That is because of the amendment that was adopted here last September by an overwhelming vote of 70 to 28. They are using these funds to fund contracts with 45 States and local jurisdictions to carry out the enforcement of minimum age restrictions for tobacco purchases and to require photo ID checks. 
The FDA initiative also includes funding to provide information to retailers and the public to help retailers comply with the rules and not sell tobacco to kids. 
This excerpt that I have from an FDA brochure indicates some of the educational information that the FDA is using to show why it is necessary to have a photo ID check. Which one is 16? Is it Melissa or is it Amy? 
If they walked into a store, would the clerk know which one was under 18? Well, to eliminate the guesswork, FDA requires retailers to card anyone who is under 27. 
Melissa here is 16 and Amy is 25. So, again, you really do not know, and that is why we need a good information campaign to make sure that retailers know what they are up against in requiring these ID checks. 
This year, FDA's current tobacco enforcement budget will fund 200,000 compliance checks. So the money that we voted here last fall, Mr. President, will fund about 200,000 compliance checks nationwide. That may sound like a lot, but it only covers one-fifth, one out of five or 20 percent, of the Nation's tobacco retailers. So four out of five aren't even covered. 
The Secretary of Health and Human Services has estimated that three-fourths of the approximately 1 million tobacco outlets in this country sell tobacco to children--three out of four. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that minors illegally purchase 256 million packs of cigarettes each year resulting in almost $500 million in sales. Just think of that. Over $500 million a year flow into the tobacco companies from the illegal sale of tobacco. Let me repeat that: $500 million flow into the tobacco companies every year just from the illegal sales of tobacco to young people. 
What are we asking for in this amendment? We are asking for $134 million. And they are making $500 million just off of the illegal sales to minors. 
The Surgeon General has concluded that children are able to buy a pack of cigarettes or a tin of spit tobacco 67 percent of the time without once ever being asked for proof of age. The amendment we have sent to the desk will more than double the number of annual compliance checks that can be conducted and increase to 60 percent the coverage of tobacco outlets nationwide. Right now, it is only 20 percent. At least this amendment gets it up to 60 percent of the retail outlets that will be covered nationwide. 
This year, the FDA is able to fund very limited outreach efforts to educate retailers, parents and the public about access and advertising restrictions. With the $34 million that we provided last fall, FDA is conducting radio, billboard and newspaper outreach campaigns, but only one city per State for 4 weeks out of every year is covered. So the $34 million we put in last year, just think about it, goes to only one city per State for 4 weeks out of every year. Now, contrast that to what the tobacco companies spend to push their product. Over $13 million every day, over half a million dollars per hour; that is what the tobacco industry is spending every minute around the clock on tobacco advertising and promotion, a whopping $5 billion--that is with a B--$5 billion a year that they spend. What we are asking for is $134 million just to get information out to conduct ID checks, to cover just a few more cities and a few more States. 
This amendment we have sent to the desk will allow FDA to conduct national education and outreach efforts at a level more commensurate with the problem. 
Increased funding at the level we have in our amendment would double the media exposure and double the number of markets used to communicate important information about restrictions on access to tobacco and tobacco advertising to retailers and to the general public. Comprehensive merchant education programs combined with community education and strong enforcement programs have been shown to successfully reduce illegal underage sales by 24 percent. 
So you can think of this amendment in another way. How would you like to cut down on illegal underage sales of tobacco by 24 percent next year? Well, we all say we do. We all say we want to cut back on teenage smoking. Here is a proven way, an ongoing program. We are starting no new program. We are not starting any new bureaucracy, no new laws. All we are taking is an existing program and funding it a little more adequately. And we could reduce the illegal underage sales by 24 percent. So it is not a new bureaucratic program. 
At least $75 million of the money will go out to State and local jurisdictions for enforcement. At least $35 million will be used to educate retailers and the public about the rules so that retailers can comply. The point of rules is not to punish anyone. It is to prevent tobacco from being sold to kids. 
I just might add that this photo ID check and the minimum age rules were fully upheld by the Federal District Court in Greensboro, NC. 
So to recap, this amendment simply provides funding, full funding for the ongoing FDA antiteen smoking program. The bulk of the $100 million goes to States and localities to enforce the rules, and it pays for the increase through an assessment on tobacco companies based on their total market share. So, in other words, the largest tobacco companies; that is, large based on their market share, pay more of the $150 million. The smaller companies, of course, would pay less. 
As I said, a very similar amendment was supported by 70 Senators last September. So if we are prepared to stand with America's kids and their parents to take even the most basic step of effectively enforcing the rules against illegal sales of tobacco, this is the way to do it. By stopping these illegal sales, we can help our children avoid an addiction that will destroy their health and take their lives. This amendment will do that. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
I see my cosponsor and colleague from Rhode Island is in the Chamber. I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. I will get into a discussion with the Senator on this because this amendment--it kind of all wraps up because the Senator from Kentucky also said this shouldn't be on an ag appropriations bill. He also said we should not have a new program. This is not a new program, it is an ongoing program. It is funded under agricultural appropriations because we fund the FDA. That is exactly where we fund the FDA. 
This amendment doesn't start anything new. It takes an existing program at the FDA and expends the money. That is what an appropriations bill does. We are not legislating on an appropriations bill. There is no legislation here, I say to my friend from Kentucky. We are only increasing the money.

Mr. HARKIN. I respond again to the Senator from Kentucky that there are other assessments and user fees in this bill. So why should the tobacco companies be exempt from an assessment? There are, I point out, a number of other assessments on industry in this ag appropriations bill. So this is nothing new and startling. 
Again, we are not reopening the tobacco debate. This amendment was offered last summer, last September, and was voted on, and it carried by a vote of 70 to 28. 
That amendment raised $34 million. What is different between that amendment and this amendment is, this amendment raises an additional $100 million. I know what the Senator is going to say about the 150. I want to explain that.

Mr. HARKIN. The reason it is is because if we put an assessment, I say to the Senator from Kentucky--if we put an assessment on the tobacco companies to pay into this, that assessment they can deduct from their taxes. They deduct it from their taxes. And so in order to score it to get the $100 million that we need to fully fund the FDA youth ID check, we have to assess the $150 million because they get to write that off on their taxes. To get to $150 million, we have to do the $100 million assessment.

This is not a new program, it is ongoing. We are not opening any debates. We had an amendment last fall for $34 million. This adds $100 million more on it. We had to for the scoring. They get $150 million and they can deduct it from their taxes. The reason it is on ag appropriations is that it should be here because it has to do with FDA; it is funding and it is money. That is what an appropriations bill is all about. We are not legislating on an appropriations bill. 
Again, 70 Senators last September voted for this amendment. Seventy Senators on both sides of the aisle voted for $34 million. This bumps it up to $100 million to fully fund the youth ID check nationwide.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand some point of order is going to be raised, I assume by the Budget chairman, I suppose, on this; and then we will have a vote to override the Budget Act. But don't get caught up in all of that. That is 
not what it is about. What it is about is whether this Senate wants to effectively fund an ongoing program to enforce the rules that keep kids from illegally buying cigarettes. That is all it is. 
We voted on this last September. Seventy Senators voted for it--$34 million. We are bumping it up to $100 million, that is right. Where are we getting it from? The tobacco companies. Yes, it is an assessment. But they do not have to pass it on. They do not have to have it as a tax or whatever. But they have to pay it based upon their market share. 
So don't get all caught up in whether this is going to be a tax on tobacco companies or this budget point of order. That is nonsense. This is a vote on whether or not we will fund the FDA's program to effectively cut down on teenage smoking in this country. That is all it is. And it pays for it by getting an assessment from the tobacco companies based upon their market share. 
Tobacco companies would have to put in $150 million, of which they get a tax deduction, so we get the $100 million to fund it. That is a drop in the bucket to what the tobacco companies make every year. Surely--surely--this Senate can go on record as sticking up for the kids and making sure we have the money to adequately enforce the FDA rule so our kids do not become addicted to cigarettes. That is all this issue is--no more, no less; plain and simple. Which side are you going to be on when we cast this vote on a so-called budget point of order?

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have been listening, of course, to the last couple of days of debate. I sympathize with the majority leader and minority leader on the issue of moving ahead with the legislation. I think we should. There are some very important issues here on agriculture. We have a crisis looming for our farmers, ranchers, and our rural economies all over America. 
Maybe it has not hit with full force and effect yet, as it has in North Dakota, and maybe a couple of other places, but we are on the cusp of it in Iowa. I had an Iowa farmer call me yesterday. The corn price in northwest Iowa is down to $1.89 a bushel, and it is dropping every day. It doesn't look like it is going to get any better. There is nothing out there, nothing out there that is going to do anything between now and harvesttime. 
I was checking the figures a little bit, with what we had in the 1980s. We had corn priced in the 1980s--about 1985, it was down to $1.50 a bushel, and after that we had a whole wave of foreclosures and farm bankruptcies. Those of us who have been around remember that in the 1980s. The corn price in Iowa is getting down to that same level again, when you consider the increase in the cost of inputs and everything like that. So we are back where we were, right before the wave of foreclosures and bankruptcies in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988. 
You would think we would learn from history not to repeat that, not to wait too long before we respond to this crisis. But that looks like what we are going to do here. We are just going to jaw it around and talk about it and not do anything. 
I had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution a couple of days ago that basically said there is a crisis out there. There are problems out there. There is a sense of the Senate that the President and the Congress should immediately respond to this farm crisis out there. Mr. President, 99 Senators voted for it. 
Yesterday, we really had a chance to do something about it by lifting the caps on the loan rates, at least for 1 year, and giving farmers more flexibility in being able to market their crops, and giving them 15 months rather than 9 months to pay it back in a marketing loan procedure--which would not leave grain hanging over the market. I heard that debate around here. Obviously, people don't understand marketing loans if they say that. So we had a good debate on that. And we lost, 56 to 43. Not one Member of the Republican side voted for it--not one. Not a single one. Yet the day before they said there was a crisis there and we have to do something about it. 
Now we have another sense-of-the-Senate resolution by my colleague from Iowa. It has a lot of good language in there. There are a lot of good things we ought to do. Funding IMF, I am all for that; China; capital gains and estate tax reforms, I am all for that. That is good. Oh, yes, the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act, which allows farmers to have IRAs. That is fine, too. But before you can have an IRA, you have to have some money. They don't have any money. 
So, while my colleague's sense-of-the-Senate resolution sounds very nice, it doesn't do anything. So, once again, I guess the Senate is going to be the greatest deliberative body in the world. We will deliberate it but we won't do anything. So that is basically what we have here in this resolution. 
I must say that I have one serious reservation about this amendment the Senator from Iowa offers. It says: 
Congress should pass and the President should sign S. 1269, which would reauthorize fast-track trading authority for the President; . . . 
There may be a fast-track bill that I could support, but I cannot support that one. While I might vote for this amendment, I want to be clear on the Record that I do not support S. 1269. I had an amendment to that bill that I thought had a good chance of being adopted if we ever got it on the floor. We never did. But I could never vote for S. 1269 as it is drafted. 
Some of the other things in here are pretty good. I would say probably about 70 percent of this amendment is pretty good, and 30 percent is not too good. You have to weigh those around here. 
We can all vote for it. It might make you feel good, but it doesn't do anything. This resolution doesn't do a thing to get the price up for our farmers. Why don't we just have sense-of-the Senate resolutions around here forever, then we won't have to do anything, but it will make you feel good. If you want to feel good, you can go ahead and vote for the Grassley amendment, but I don't think it is going to do one single thing to get the price up for our farmers that is going to help them get through this next year, not one single thing. I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. I listened, of course with great interest and intent, to the comments by the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee, my good friend from Indiana. I am privileged to serve as his ranking member on the Agriculture Committee. 
I think, first of all I will just respond to that and also to the statement made by the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee about, `My gosh, we passed the farm bill in 1996. Here we are, do we want to rewrite it?'--and all that kind of stuff--`We should not open it again right now. It's the third year we are in it.' 
The 1996 farm bill is not the Ten Commandments. It was not written in stone for all time. We have a crisis impending on us in agriculture. The bottom is falling out. Prices are going down every day. Are we so stuck in our ways here, are we so wedded to some ideology imprinted in the 1996 farm bill, that we cannot respond? 
`Oh, I am sorry. We see you are losing your farms. We see the prices going down. But, I am sorry, we passed a bill here 3 years ago and we cannot touch it.' 
Again, we are not really opening up the farm bill. We are simply making one minor change. Loan rates were capped in the 1996 farm bill--capped, frozen; they are still there. We are not introducing something new into agricultural legislation. It is simply that a decision was made to cap them. 
That is OK. That was OK for the last couple of years, because grain prices have been relatively high. But now when the bottom is falling out of the market for a variety of reasons, now is the time when farmers need a little bit of assistance. What kind of assistance? They need flexibility. 
We hear a lot about that word, `flexibility.' In the 1996 farm bill, it did give farmers flexibility in planting decisions. That was a good part of the 1996 farm bill, a concept that was supported by everyone. But how about flexibility for the farmer to be able to decide how to market their crops? That is what we are trying to do by raising the caps on the loan rates--to give the farmer the ability to harvest the crop, get a loan on that crop to pay the bills, and then be able to market that crop when the farmer feels it is most advantageous over the next 15 months. That is called flexibility, Mr. President, flexibility--to give the farmer some flexibility in marketing. 
What I am hearing from the other side now is, `No, we don't want to give that farmer flexibility. We want to give the farmer flexibility in what to plant. But when it comes time to market, he is at the whims of the marketplace, of weather, of other countries and what they do, over which we have no control.' That farmer is at the whims of the disastrous Asian economy. We cannot even give that farmer a little bit of support to give him the flexibility to market over 15 months? What nonsense. What utter, absolute nonsense. 
Thousands of farm families are facing severe economic hardships. They are in danger of losing their livelihood, their life savings. Just yesterday, the Senate went on record with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying there is a great economic crisis in agriculture and calling for immediate action by Congress: 99 to nothing. Nice words on paper. But now, here is the first vote to implement that sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we passed yesterday. 
We are for the first time trying to raise the caps on the loan rates to give the farmer the flexibility to market, and now we can't even give them that much. We can't even do this modest step. What did that sense-of-the-Senate resolution mean? 
Mr. President, I offered that sense-of-the-Senate resolution along with Senator Daschle. It passed 99 to 0. I am wondering, if we can't even do this modest little step to help our farmers out, maybe we ought to recall that amendment. Maybe we ought to have another vote on it and this time vote it down. Why give all this flowery support that we are going to help agriculture? There is a problem out there and on the first vote, `I am sorry, the farm bill is written in stone; we can't touch it.' 
What we are proposing is a quite modest and reasonable response to try to prevent the farm situation from becoming any worse and to help turn it around. Quite frankly, I am a little embarrassed at the modesty of our proposal, but we thought in order to minimize any opposition, we would keep it limited. We are not proposing any radical changes in farm policy. We are not opening the floodgates of the Treasury. We have been very careful in that respect. 
I must confess, if we cannot manage to adopt even this modest amendment today, it will speak volumes about the willingness of this body to respond to the dire situation in rural America that we just recognized yesterday in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
I underscore that the rural economic crisis is not the fault of America's farmers. We have a world situation where large supplies of commodities have combined with weakened demand, with a terribly depressed Southeast Asian economy that has driven commodity prices lower. In the last 2 years, farm level prices for corn, wheat and soybeans have declined 39 percent. Cattle prices are 20 percent below the level earlier this decade. Hog prices for the first half of 1998, are the lowest seen in 20 years. On top of that, numerous regions have experienced bad weather and crop diseases that have devastated our farmers. 
As of yesterday, a farmer would receive a price of $2.50 a bushel for wheat at a country elevator in Dodge City, KS. At that price, the average Kansas farmer with about 350 acres of wheat in the ground right now will suffer a loss of more than $40,000 over his cost of production. And we are telling that farmer we can't do anything to help him? 
With the average corn market price announced by USDA on July 10, the typical Iowa corn farmer will be losing more than 35 cents of every bushel of corn he markets, even considering the modest Government payment that he is going to receive under the 1996 farm bill. 
Mr. President, 32 of 50 States have suffered declines in farm income in 1996 and 1997. Here it is, 32 of 50 States: North Dakota, 98 percent; Iowa, down 16 percent; New York, 44; Pennsylvania, 32 percent; Kentucky, down 29 percent; Tennessee, loss of 28 percent; Missouri, down 72 percent. That is what is happening. That is the loss in farm income, according to Dept. of Commerce figures. As I noted yesterday, Standard & Poor's Index for Wall Street has gone up 36 percent in the last year. Look what has happened in agriculture. And yet we can't do anything? Not even this modest, little increase in loan rates? 
If the price estimates released July 10 by USDA hold up, lower corn and soybean prices will cause an additional loss of farm income in my State of Iowa alone of over $1 billion this year. That translates into 19,000 jobs in my State affected directly or indirectly by agriculture. 
On a national basis, this year's crisis will strike a severe blow. USDA estimates suggest that 1998 farm income will fall below $50 billion, 13 percent lower than it was in 1996. With the season average corn and rice projections being lowered 6 percent in July, that number is going to fall even more. The $5.2 billion decline in farm income could translate into a loss of nearly 100,000 jobs in the agricultural sector and ag-related businesses. 
Mr. President, 1998 total farm debt is estimated to amount to $172 billion, the highest level since 1985. For those of you who don't remember 1985, let me refresh your memory. That was the height of the farm crisis. From 1985 to about 1988, hundreds of thousands of farmers lost their farms in the United States. It devastated rural America. It took us, well, almost the next 10 years to climb out of it. Now that we are getting out of it, farmers are hit once more. 
We are going to have a huge farm debt again this year. We are going to have another wave of farm foreclosures and farm losses. Families are losing the equity they have built up in their farms. Those who survived the 1980s and thought they had it made because they weathered the worst financial crisis in agriculture since the 1930s are on the edge and they are getting pushed off. 
Farm families and communities are facing an emergency, and we in the Senate must act, as we have traditionally done when emergencies strike. 
It is important that all Senators understand what our amendment does. It focuses on the level of the loan that a farmer can take out on farm commodities after harvest using the crop as collateral. This loan allows the farmer to pay the bills, as I said, and retain the crop for up to 15 months so they can market it in a flexible manner. It let's the farmer make the decision of when to sell rather than being forced to sell because the bills are due. You can think about this amendment as the `flexibility to market' amendment. 
The formula has been around for a long time. As I said, there is nothing new about this. It is in the farm bill: 85 percent of the 5-year average, throwing out the high and the low years. That is the basic formula, 85 percent. 
The distinguished Senator from Indiana went on at great length talking about how we don't want this loan rate set so that it will influence farmers to make their planting decisions, because if the loan rate is too high, then the farmer plants for the loan, not for the market. 
I have three observations on that. First of all, this amendment only covers the 1999 Fiscal year. We re talking about crops that are already planted, for the most part. So how can a one-year amendment have any substantial influence on farmers' decisions about what to plant next year? I think perhaps people who have been speaking against the amendment don't understand that. It is only for one fiscal year. 
Even assuming somehow psychologically it did because the farmer might say, `Well, I got that loan this year and if things remain bad next year, maybe they will do the same thing next year, so, therefore, I will make my planting decisions based upon that possibility' 
that is ridiculous in the extreme. Why? Because, first of all, this loan rate is only 85 percent of the last year 5-year average, throwing out the high and low years--85 percent. For corn right now, the farm bill cap is $1.89 a bushel. Our modest amendment would remove that rate, raise it to $2.19 for this crop year. Wheat right now is capped at $2.58 a bushel. Removing the cap would put the rate at about $3.22 a bushel. Both of those are way below the cost of production. 
If you are a farmer, and you are making planting decisions based upon the loan rate, then what my friend from Indiana is saying is that the farmer is going to plant more corn to get a loan rate that is lower than his cost of production. It reminds me of the old joke, the old saw we always hear around my State about farmers. Someone asked the corn farmer how he expected prices to be? He said, `Well, I hope to at least break even because I need the money.' 
According to the Senator from Indiana, raising the loan rate to $2.19 would somehow encourage a corn farmer to plant corn. Nonsense. That is way below the cost of production and no farmer would ever do that. They are going to plant based upon what they think they can get in the market next year. 
So those are two things. First of all, our raising the caps only apply to this upcoming fiscal year; secondly, there is no way that this modest raising of loan rates will in any way influence any farmer to plant for the loan. In no way would that do that. 
And third, I must again remind our Senators and others that in agriculture--I do not know why we never learn the lesson of ag economics--a farmer has a fixed amount of land, he has fixed machinery, he has a lot of fixed input and equity costs. If prices drop, there are those who say, `Well, see, that will send a message to the farmer. If the prices go down, they will plant less of that crop next year.' That is not so. Because when you have your fixed base and your fixed amount of land and your machinery, if prices go down, your first impulse is to get more production out of that unit of land. Maybe you will check on fertilizer prices. Maybe you will put on a little more fertilizer. Maybe you will put the rows a little closer together. Maybe you will do some other things. Maybe you will plant a little more on some land you did not want to plant on because you already have the machinery out there. 
The marginal cost of production for an additional acre of corn, if you are already planting 500 or 1,000 acres of corn, that marginal cost of planting that extra 20 acres or 50 acres is minimal. Yet, if you can raise your production, well then, that will take care of the lower prices. But that feeds on itself. 
I predicted 2 years ago, when the 1996 farm bill passed, that that is exactly what would happen: We would see increasing production. Hopefully, the price would stay up. But if other countries' economies went to pot--and we saw a couple years ago that it looked like that might happen--well, then, prices would drop. And how would farmers respond? They would plant more and produce more. And that is exactly what has happened--exactly what has happened. 
We probably have a record production of soybeans this year, near record production of both wheat and corn. But somehow people just think that agriculture is just like making widgets. And it is not. It is a lot different. 
This amendment is very modest--very modest. We are not proposing to change the 1996 farm bill in any way. As I said, this provision is in the 1996 farm bill. It is just capped. We are just raising the caps. We are not interfering with planting flexibility, for farmers to make their own decisions. In fact, we are enhancing the flexibility of farmers to market their commodities when it is advantageous for them to do so. 
Then, I know we keep hearing the old refrain about keeping Government out of agriculture.

Mr. HARKIN. So we hear the old refrain, get the Government out of agriculture; give the farmers more freedom. That is what this amendment does. If that is what you like, this amendment gives the farmers more freedom. I just ask my colleagues, what kind of freedom do they have in mind when they talk about giving farmers freedom? The freedom to be forced out of business by events beyond their control? 
As I said yesterday, I read a comment in the newspaper by one of my colleagues here who said they wanted to give farmers more ability to manage their destiny. I said, I do not understand that. How can my corn farmer in Iowa manage El Nino? How can my soybean farmer in Iowa manage the disastrous Southeast Asian economy? How can our wheat farmers manage the subsidies that other governments give their wheat farmers to compete unfairly with us? How can those wheat farmers manage the disastrous scab disease that we have had in some of our northern Great Plains States? These are all events that are beyond their control. 
Is this the kind of freedom that my colleagues have in mind for farmers? To be forced out by events beyond their control? The freedom to be forced to sell their crops at a loss because they cannot afford to hold onto them or get a decent loan to be able to market it when prices improve a little; is that the kind of freedom we have in mind? Is the freedom that my colleagues have in mind the freedom to struggle at poverty-level income while growing the food for our Nation? Is it the freedom for farmers to take less and less and less of the consumer dollar? Is that the kind of freedom they have in mind? 
Well, we have heard a lot of arguments on this amendment. It has been claimed that farmers receive more money under the 1996 farm bill than they would have under the continuation of the 1990 farm bill. That is true for the last 2 years when commodity prices were high. You have to understand, in the 1996 farm bill we gave farmers all the planting flexibility, but there was this payment called the Agriculture Market Transition Act payment, AMTA payments, without any payment limitations. No matter what farm income was like, you got a paycheck. I always thought that was kind of ridiculous. 
I had a farmer come up to me once in Iowa last year, after the previous year's crop, and he said, `Gee, I had one of the best years I have ever had. I had a great year, and I got a paycheck from the Government. What are you people thinking about?' See, I always thought that Government safety nets ought to be there when prices were low. If a farmer can make their money from the marketplace, that is the way it ought to be. But when there are events beyond their control, like bad weather and bad markets and interference by foreign governments, that is when the Government has to come in with a safety net. 
The last couple of years farmers got Government payments. But for this year--when prices are in the tank--for wheat farmers they will have less income protection than they would have had under the 1990 farm bill. According to current USDA price estimates, per-bushel payments to wheat farmers would have been 40 percent higher under the 1990 farm bill than they are scheduled to be under the 1996 farm bill this year. That difference would amount to nearly $22,000 for a farmer with 1,000 acres of wheat. 
One might infer that these farmers got these Government payments, and they could have taken these payments and sort of invested them and put them in the bank, so to speak, to get them through this year. Sounds nice. But is that really what happened? Hardly. 
First of all, a lot of farmers were paying off buildup debt, No. 1. They used the payments for that. No. 2, what happened was, a lot of farmers who rent found that their landlords increased the rent. Why? Because the landlords knew the farmer was going to get this Government paycheck, knew exactly what he was going to get. So the landlords raised the price of rent. Consequently, a lot of farmers did not even see the Government payment that came out in the form of that cash payment under the 1996 farm bill. A lot of farmers did not even get that money. But I will tell you who did get the money. The big farmers. The larger the farmer you are, the bigger the check you got over the last couple of years. 
And the larger the farmer you are, the better able you are to go through periods of stress. 
So it was all kind of screwed up. The bigger farmers got the most money over the last 2 years when prices were high. Now, when prices are low, our smaller farmers can't get enough help. The bigger farmers are able to get through it because they have more equity. 
Now we are going to say we can't even modestly raise the loan rates? I don't know, but I would think wheat farmers out there who are suffering would say they could use the ability to market their wheat over the next 15 months rather than have to sell this fall. Right now, the wheat loan is $2.58 a bushel. We are just asking to raise it to $3.22 a bushel. That is not a lot of money, but it might be a little bit of help. 
As I said, I think we checked the wheat in Dodge City, KS, yesterday--$2.50 and going down. The first of July, it was $2.64. Now it is down to $2.50 and going down every week. So our wheat farmers and our corn farmers need some help. 
I talked about farmers getting less and less of the share. This chart shows the farm share of the retail beef dollar, going down all the time. So for every dollar, when you buy that steak or you buy that hamburger, the farmer is getting less and less from the dollar you spend for it. Here is the pork dollar. Every time you buy a pork loin roast or one of our delicious Iowa chops--if I can put in a plug for that--our pork farmers are getting less and less of that dollar you spend for pork. 
Here is the wheat prices--farm-level wheat price. Here is when the Freedom to Farm bill was enacted. Here are the wheat prices, going down, over the last couple of years. Same thing for corn. Here we are coming up to Freedom to Farm; down it comes. So corn prices are going down, also. 
There is a crisis out there. We are not talking about increasing consumer food costs or livestock feed costs, nor are we going to price the United States out of world markets. If the price of the commodity is below the loan rate, the farmer can sell at that lower price and repay the loan at the going market price. So the marketing loan does not prop up the U.S. price among world market prices. Hence, there is no adverse impact upon U.S. competitiveness because of this amendment. 
Taking the cap off will help our farmers stay in business. The fact is, it may be the only thing that will keep them in business for another year. 
Again, we have heard all these arguments, but for the life of me, I can't understand--I can't understand--why we on one day can say there is a crisis in agriculture, Congress has to respond, and 99 Senators vote for that; the next day, we want just a modest increase in the loan rates to help, and we can't do that? I hope that is not so. I hope we do this today. 
Lastly, I heard the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee talking about getting fast-track legislation through, as if somehow that is going to help prices this year. Even if fast track were to pass this year, it would take several years to conclude agricultural talks. I point out, the last Uruguay Round of multilateral talks took 7 years. Keep in mind, even if we got fast track through, that is not going to mean a darn thing for 3, 5, 6, 7 years. That will not help this year--not going to help a bit. 
Second, the crisis is now, not 7 years from now. It is right now. Sometimes we have short memories around here. We talk about, yes, we will do all this stuff; we are going to get our trade going again.

Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 2 additional minutes. 
In addition, my colleague from Indiana worries about the potential implications for stocks from this amendment. World grain reserves right now, as a percentage of consumption, are at historically low levels. I believe the American people would be appalled to learn that our Government holds virtually no food in reserve to help us out if we ever have a widespread crop failure. 
The chairman suggests that if the Government holds this grain, it stays over the market and depresses prices. Not if you have a government reserve withheld from the market--absolutely not true. But this concept of having a modest reserve is not a new idea. Someone said it began with the Roosevelt administration. This is a Roosevelt New Deal idea, to have a grain reserve, and, as such, we had to do away with it because it was a New Deal idea and we don't need all that stuff around anymore. 
The concept of a grain reserve is as old as the Book of Genesis. Surely my colleagues remember the story of Joseph interpreting the dream of the pharaoh, that there would be 7 good years followed by 7 lean years and that food should be stored during the 7 good years to feed the people when the bad years came. 
It was true at the time of Genesis and it is true today that we need some food set aside in this country and around the world to meet exigencies. For the life of me, I can't understand why people want to ignore history. We ignore it at our own peril. Ignore it, and we will lose more and more farmers, and we will see a day come when there will be panic because we will have those lean years and we won't have any food to help feed our hungry people. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I thank our leader, Senator Daschle, for really taking the bit here and moving ahead aggressively to answer a real concern and a real need that we have in rural America. Well, I would go beyond that--a crisis in rural America. Senator Daschle has always been the leader in recognizing and understanding what is happening in our farm economy. This time is no exception, so I thank Senator Daschle personally for his leadership in this effort. 
I thank the managers of the bill, both Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers, for working with us on the language. I understand that we have the language worked out in an agreed form on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I am happy that we can come to a good resolution on that, and I guess that is what we will be voting on here at 5:15. I hope it gets an overwhelming vote because it will send a strong signal, I think, to rural America that we do, indeed, recognize there is a crisis, a crisis of immense proportions, as it does say the total farm debt for 1998 is expected to reach $172 billion, the highest level since 1985. 
And so the sense of the Senate is just that. We recognize there is the problem. Now, the amendment that Senator Daschle has just laid down then takes that recognition of the problem and begins to do something about it. By taking the caps off the loan rate and by extending for 6 months the period of the loan, it will at least give our farmers a little bit more, a little bit more in what they can get for their crop this fall, and then give them the ability to market it in a more orderly fashion over the next 15 months. 
I have to say at the outset that this amendment is a modest amendment, I mean a very modest amendment. I know that many farmers and others in rural America will look at this and say, gee, this is not nearly enough. This doesn't come anywhere near the cost of production; it doesn't come anywhere near what I need. Well, I recognize that. It should be more. I think I heard Senator Daschle say that, too. But we have to face the reality of the situation. 
I am just hopeful that this very modest amendment to raise the loan rate and put it back where it was under the 1990 farm bill will get overwhelming support. If we cannot even do this, if we cannot even give our farming sector this much support in an emergency situation, well, then I guess what we are going to do is say, well, we recognize there is a problem out there, but we are not going to do anything about it. We are just going to leave you farmers out there to take the brunt of El Nino and take the brunt of floods and take the brunt of low prices and take the brunt of the Southeast Asian economic collapse and this Government, this representative Government of yours cannot do anything about it. 
I hope we do not say that. I hope we say two things: I hope we say, yes, there is a crisis out there. And then I hope we follow it up by saying, yes, we are going to do something about it. We are going to lift the caps on the loan rate and at least give a few pennies--a few, a little bit--to farmers to hopefully get them through the crisis they are facing this fall. And again, Mr. President, it is a crisis. It is a problem of having the safety net there. 
I am hopeful we can repair that safety net with just a few modest proposals we have. 
I understand the vote is set at 5:15. Is that the idea?

Mr. HARKIN. That is the pending matter before the Senate. 
Mr. President, I note the presence of my colleagues from the Midwest and the Northern Plains States who are here on the floor. I think we have to really lay out for the American people what is happening in rural America today. 
We can close our eyes to it. We can try to ignore what is going on, but the fact is, there is a crisis of immense proportions happening all over rural America. 
In our sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we pointed out that net farm income for 1998 is projected to fall to $45.5 billion. That is down 13 percent from 1996. Now, with farm income going down 13 percent--I asked my staff to check and see what Wall Street did last year. The S&P 500 index went up 36 percent last year; farm receipts down 13 percent. 
Farm debt for this year is expected to be $172 billion, the highest level since 1985. So what we say in our sense-of-the-Senate resolution is: 
. . . emergency action by the President and Congress is necessary to respond to the economic hardships facing agricultural producers and their communities. 
Very simple. Very straightforward. It is an emergency situation and requires emergency action. 
Mr. President, this chart really says it all, what happened to farm income between 1996 and 1997. Let us see, 32 States had a drop in net farm income--32 out of 50. Now, some of them, you might see, had a big increase. Oklahoma was up 94 percent and Kansas 28 percent and Wyoming 73 percent. That was simply because of the devastating drought they had in 1996, and their wheat crop recovered in 1997, and it looks better. But the prices there--and I will get to that in a moment--are still catastrophic for the wheat farmers all up and down the wheat belt. 
But look at the other States: Minnesota, down 38 percent; North Dakota, down 98 percent, a 98-percent drop in farm income in the last year; New York State, 44 percent; Pennsylvania a 32-percent decrease in farm income. 
Wall Street is doing great. Standard & Poor's is up--what did I say?--36 percent. Yet the ag economy in New York State went down 44 percent. That is the story across America. That is why we have a crisis. 
Look at prices here, and you will find something, Mr. President, very interesting about these charts I am about to show. Here is the farm level corn price. We were coming up here in the early 1990s, and we had a steady increase, a little drop, but kept coming up. Right here is the Freedom to Farm bill, 
and, bang, down it goes. That is corn. Is that an anomaly? Let's look at wheat prices. We were bouncing around, but we had steady progression up all the time. We enacted Freedom to Farm, and down it comes. Wheat prices have been coming down ever since Freedom to Farm was passed. So that is corn and that is wheat. 
Farm-level soybeans. Soybeans were coming up gradually, getting better, and we get here to Freedom to Farm, and down it comes. All of those crops, ever since Freedom to Farm, down they come. 
Here is the other interesting thing. We can look at the corn and the wheat and the soybean prices. But let's look at the farm share of what is happening to how much farmers are getting from their products that are sold in grocery stores. 
Right now, the farm share of the pork dollar is at the lowest point it has been in over 2 decades--in over 20 years. Iowa hog farmers, and hog farmers around America, are getting the lowest share of the retail dollar. So if prices have been declining, as I pointed out here for soybeans and for corn and for wheat, how come we haven't seen the price dropping at the grocery stores? Not a bit. Prices continue to go up, and yet the share of that dollar for our farmers keeps going down. That one is pork. 
Let's take a look at beef. Here is the retail share of beef, which has been coming down all the time. It keeps coming down. Maybe it is not quite as bad as pork, but it is still pretty bad. So farmers get less and less. 
Now, I noted that in the Washington Post this morning there was a story about our plans to do something to help the farm crisis in America. It said here, `While Democrats in both chambers want to help farmers by revamping domestic farm supports, Republicans say aid will come from more aggressive pursuit of exports.' 
Interesting. We are going to solve it all by exporting more. Well, let's look at two charts here. I heard a lot of talk about getting rid of sanctions. We are all for getting rid of sanctions. Here is a chart that shows how much agriculture is being affected in terms of sanctions and how much it is being affected by the fact that IMF is not being replenished, so they can continue to straighten out the economies in Asia. Trade sanctions reduce U.S. exports by about 1 percent of the total. That is the USDA estimate. Here is IMF-affected trade coming in at about $35 billion because of the lack of funding for IMF. Who is holding up the funding for IMF? The leadership in the House and the leadership in the Senate. 
We will hear a lot of talk about sanctions. But if you really want to get at what is affecting our farm exports, it is the lack of funding and replenishment for IMF. But, Mr. President, is it really exports that are going to solve our problem? Here is U.S. exports on this chart going clear back to 1960--what we see here, hitting 1970 and in the 1970s and then the 1980s. We had a dip in 1985 because of the farm crisis, and then up and up and up. Look at the increase in U.S. agricultural exports. It is down a little bit now from its peak a couple years ago, down 7 percent. But it is still a huge increase over what we have had in the past. That is not the total answer to our problems. 
Yes, we need to replenish IMF; yes, we need to continue our strong support for exports. But that won't solve the problem. The problem is that we have pulled the safety net out from underneath the farmers in this country when we passed Freedom to Farm a couple of years ago--the so-called `Freedom to Farm.' I called it at that time the `freedom to go broke' bill, talking about our family farmers. 
Now, some say, well, what we have to do is, we have to get EEP in there and we have to do more to get our exports going overseas. But the fact is, that would put more money in the pockets of the grain traders and importing companies and not the farmers we all represent. Some commodity groups want to spend several hundred million dollars on the Export Enhancement Program and other export programs. But who is it going to help? That money will go right into the pockets of the exporters, the big grain companies, and the 
importing countries. It is not going to go to the farmers. 
I call that the sparrow feeding the horse kind of analogy. If you want to feed the horse, you feed the sparrow. Then the sparrow drops something on the ground; that fertilizes the grass; the grass grows, and the horse eats it. That is a crazy system. If you want to get money to farmers, then what we have to do is, we have to put in some supports and put that safety net back in there. 
A 1994 General Accounting Office study found that direct payments to producers increased net income of farmers much more effectively than an equivalent level of indirect support through subsidies granted under the export subsidy program. 
GAO. Direct payment of producers gets their net income up more effectively than putting that money into EEP. 
Again, a lot of farmers were told that we had to pass this so-called Freedom to Farm because it gave them flexibility. We were all for flexibility. We had that before under the Carter administration. We had the whole farm base at that time. We all wanted to give farmers more flexibility for the whole farm and let them make the decisions. But we wanted to keep a safety net there. 
This so-called Freedom to Farm is fine when prices are high, fine when you have the big payments going out to farmers in the initial 1 or 2 years. But when disasters come, as they will in agriculture, as they have since biblical times, when the prices go down, then what happens is, our family farmers are squeezed out. 
It almost seems like the so-called Freedom to Farm bill really was designed with only the largest producers in mind. Why do I say that? Because when you get a downturn, when you have low prices, the big, well-financed producers can weather it. They can get through 1 or 2 or 3 years of low prices. But for that smaller family farmer out there, they can't do it. That is why you are now going to see farm bankruptcies again, as high as they were during the 1980s.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend, because we hear a lot about that: `Wouldn't it be better to have a few large farmers out there rather than all these family farmers?' There are a lot of ways to answer that question. 
First, a strong, healthy rural America is better in terms of the impact of unemployment in our cities, where people from farms are forced off, they come into the cities. It causes more urban congestion and all of the expenses that causes for people who live in our larger cities. You can look at it that way. 
Secondly, you can look at it from the standpoint of a stable, safe food supply. Why do I say that? Because it has been my experience that a family farmer who lives on that land, owns that land, and the children are raised there, and they go to the local schools, and they have a stake in their community--they are some of the best stewards we have for our land. So if you want to take care of the land for future generations and you want to protect the soil and the water, it is better to have a family farm system of agriculture than these big corporate conglomerates that maybe just hire someone or rent it out. 
It is like in housing. If you want people to take care of their houses, make them homeowners. That is why I have always been in favor of housing subsidies and getting more housing for low-income people. They will take care of it. They have a stake in it. They have equity in it. That is true with our family farmers, too. As long as they own the land and work it and have their families there, they have a stake in it. 
Lastly, just from the standpoint of price, if you have more farmers out there producing more beef, pork, poultry, corn, wheat, and beans, you are going to have a more competitive situation out there. As we all know, competition gives you the best price. 
I never could understand people who believe in a free enterprise system and who believe in this concept of competition and giving us the best products at the lowest possible price, then supporting policies that do just the opposite in agriculture and squeeze them out by setting up a few large, vertically integrated entities that have everything from the production of the grain, to the feeding of the livestock, to the slaughtering of the livestock, to the packaging, right to the time it gets to your counter. I can't understand people who think that somehow these kinds of monopolistic prices are going to be the best deal for our consumers. They just aren't. We know it, and we can prove it.

Mr. HARKIN. I am going to ask that same question of our colleague from North Dakota, because I believe he can answer it better. 
I just wanted to point out that last year the average North Dakota wheat farmer suffered a loss of $23,000. My figures show, at least right now, that the income of the North Dakota farmer--I could be corrected by my colleague from North Dakota--this year their income will be, for a family of four, below the poverty level. Their income actually will be below what we have designated as the poverty level in this country. 
So I guess the question of the Senator from Minnesota was, What has brought this about? Was that the question? Why has North Dakota, now, I think for 2 consecutive years of low wheat and barley prices--what has brought this about? I ask the same question of my colleague from North Dakota.

Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from South Dakota has put his finger on it. I visited the old Soviet Union on a couple of occasions before it disintegrated, went out and visited some of these big farms, some of the most inefficient, awful operations you have ever seen, and then I visited later just when they were breaking up the large farms. What I heard time and time again was that was probably one of the biggest mistakes they ever made in the Soviet Union--collectivizing the farms. And now in Russia, what they have decided--and I have met on more than one occasion with a couple of their agriculture ministers--is the best thing to do is return the land to the people, give them private ownership of that land and to disburse it as much as possible. 
What they have found, lo and behold, is they are getting better products and better production for their people. Right on target. And yet we seem to be going in the other direction. We seem to be doing what the Soviet Union did. Now, it is not State collectivization, but it is monopoly practices. That is the same kind of vertical integration.

Mr. HARKIN. The Senator knows about what I am about to say because I know he has been through this, and that is what I think a lot of consumers and what a lot of people have to understand about farming in America and about our family farms. Farmers are price takers. In other words, a farmer has a lot of fixed costs over which that farmer has no control--land, seed, fertilizer, chemicals. The farmer who goes down to get his seed can't say, well, my prices went down last year. I will buy that, but I can give you 10 percent less. The farmer has zero bargaining power. He pays the freight. Whatever it is, that is what he has to pay. So the only way for that farmer to make anything is through the price that the farmer receives, price plus his production. Now, if the price is so low, no matter what he produces, he can't produce himself out of the hole. 
That is another little anomaly that I have thought about in all my years here and working in agriculture on the agriculture committees. People say, well, if prices drop--see if this doesn't ring true with my friend from South Dakota. A lot of ideologues say, well, if prices drop, farmers will take that signal and they will plant less. But we know what happens when a farmer has a fixed unit of land and he has his fixed machinery and prices drop. They say, how can I get more production out of that unit of land to cover the lower prices? And so what happens is you get a drop in the prices. Farmers plant more because they have a fixed 
amount of land. They want to squeeze more production out of it. 
That has happened time after time after time in American agriculture. Yet some people do not seem to understand that. 
So they have to have the price plus production or they are going to go broke, and that is what is happening today. I believe it was attributed to former President Kennedy--I can't be certain about this. But I think former President John Kennedy once said that a farmer is the only man in America who buys at retail, sells at wholesale and pays the freight both ways. 
That is very true today. That is why we are having this crisis in America. 
Now, again, I am all for farm flexibility and giving farmers the maximum flexibility. But we have to have a safety net in there because it is as true today as it was in biblical times. I guess we just never seem to learn it. I have here a letter that was sent to a number of us from Mr. Dwayne Andreas, chairman of the board of Archer Daniels Midland Company. I found this to be a fascinating letter. 
Now, obviously, Andreas heads a large agribusiness that takes the raw food shipments and processes them and makes them into articles that we see sold all over the world. I am sure we have seen his ads on Sunday `Meet The Press,' ADM, which is the supermarket to the world. We have all seen that and they do a good job. So here is an individual, the head of a large company that buys the raw products, processes them, turns them into something that is sold in supermarkets in places around the world. Interesting. He sends a letter dated June 18. He said: 
I feel the urge to say something about present farm policy. I could write pages about why support prices are necessary to protect farmers from the excesses of speculators. 
It was a bad idea to remove all the support prices from under farm commodities and if left alone it will lead to disaster. The side effect of a drop in farm income affects all U.S. businesses and can be devastating. Only those of us with long-term memory seem to be aware of that. The country shouldn't have to learn it all over again. Although, of course, it is legendary that people in my line of business can benefit from free falling farm prices by buying bargains, I feel that stabilized agriculture is extremely important for America and for the world. 
I hope you will work to restore some form of price support to protect farmers from disaster. Subsequent events prove it has to be corrected, not just for the benefit of farmers, but to stabilize the economy of our Nation. People seem to ignore the fact that no genuine free market is left in this world. Governments everywhere manage farm prices and the U.S. will have to follow suit or face disaster. 
I find that interesting, coming from the head of perhaps one of the largest manufacturers of agricultural products. As he said, it is legendary that it would be in his best interest to have low farm prices. But I think what we have seen from Andreas is the statement of a statesman and someone who understands what it means for our entire economy and for our Government and, indeed, for hungry people around the world to make sure that our farmers have a decent price. So I applaud Andreas for making that statement and taking the position he has taken, which probably is in direct conflict with his economic best interests. 
Why I remembered that letter is he said those of us with memory long enough. And I have said it time and time again. It started in biblical times with Pharaoh's dream, and he asked Joseph to interpret the dream. And Joseph said what it means is during good times you store up the grain so you have it during bad times, 7 years of plenty and 7 years of famine. Through the ages, governments everywhere have learned and relearned that lesson. And yet for some reason, under the Freedom to Farm, so-called Freedom to Farm bill that we passed here a couple of years ago we said that is all over. Evidently, farmers are going to have high prices from now on. Well, they have short memories, and they probably haven't been reading the Bible either because if they had they would know that this has plagued us for thousands of years.

Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right on the mark again. I said a couple of years ago, when that so-called Freedom to Farm bill passed, it was a triumph of ideology over experience--the experience of thousands of years; the experience we have had in our own country since the 1930s. Yet there was this ideology that said, no, we have to get the Government out of everything; no price supports. 
But I submit to my friend from South Dakota that the so-called Freedom to Farm bill probably is working just as it was intended. During high-price years, like we had when the Freedom to Farm passed, it offers large-scale farmers the ability to take advantage of opportunities that they might see in the marketplace. Now, does it help the smaller farmers a little bit? Sure, but only because those payments were high in the first years. As the Senator pointed out, those initial payments are coming down, so the large-scale farmer, better able to weather 1 or 2 or 3 years of low prices, is left to sail on through. The smaller farmer is left to go broke, and that is what Freedom to Farm was intended to do. I swear, the idea was to get fewer farmers out there, to structure it differently. 
I am going to yield the floor momentarily, but I have to tell my friend a story that happened to me back in David Stockman's time. We always remember David Stockman first as the head of OMB under President Reagan. 
I remember having a meeting with him at that time, talking about farm bills, and they were after agriculture. I used to have debates with David Stockman on the floor of the House on agriculture. He was always for this so-called getting the Government out of agriculture and everything. I remember, he sat at a table one time, and he said to me at the time, I think I was a Congressman then, he said, `Congressman Harkin, you know as well as I do, if you have two farmers out there and they both have such-and-such land, they both have two tractors, they both have two combines, they both have two barns, they both have two this and that,' he said, `you know as well as I do, one farmer could do it all.' 
I said, `Really? One farmer can do it all? Is that right? How so? How can one farmer?' 
`Well, one farmer can buy out the other farmer and get all that machinery and get bigger equipment and hire someone to work for him and get it all done.' 
I said, `How is that one farmer going to buy out the other farmer? If you have those two farms, what is going to cause one of the farms to go under?' 
`Well, recurring low prices.' 
We talked. I will give him one benefit, he was honest about it. He said, `With these recurring low prices, the little farmer will have to get out. The bigger farmer will buy him up.' And his point was it would be more efficient to do it that way, more efficient. 
I said, `How do you measure efficiency? How do you measure efficiency? Do you measure it in terms of the local businesses that now will go under in the local community because that farmer 
has gone out of business? Do you measure it in the local education system, where now kids have to go 30, 40 miles a day to go to school, and they have a hard time getting teachers to teach in these rural areas? Do you measure efficiency in terms of the lost production? If you had two tractors before and you only have one now, what does that mean in Detroit and places like that where people are working in manufacturing?' 
So I always challenged him to define efficiency, not just by looking at the individual farm itself, but looking at the community at large; what was more efficient? I had always believed, and I do today believe that the most efficient, in terms of our Nation, in terms of our country, in terms of our consumers--the most efficient form of agriculture is one that is diverse, dispersed, and one that encompasses many family farmers owning their land and working their own land. I have maintained that for the last 25 years and I maintain it today. I think a lot of the problems we are having today have to do with the crisis we had in the 1980s that kicked a lot of farmers off their land, and we are having the same crisis today up in the northern plains area. 
As I said, those who want to stick with that so-called Freedom to Farm--I suppose maybe they have the votes. I don't know. But we are going to have some amendments on this floor today and tomorrow, as long as we have to take, on this ag appropriations bill, to get some changes made to put that safety net back under our family farmers and to provide them with the support they need during these tough times. We can do nothing less, not just for them, but for our country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments in favor of the bill and its swift passage. I just want to point out again what the bill accomplishes. What this legislation will do is to establish that the automatic sanctions under the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 will not include a prohibition against credit, credit guarantees or other financial assistance provided by the Department of Agriculture to support the purchase of food or other ag commodities. Again, this bill does not deal with the underlying purposes and operation of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. It only deals with the question of whether the automatic sanctions will include USDA credit guarantees or other financial assistance for the purchase of food and ag commodities. 
My views in this regard are similar to what Hubert Humphrey, a former Member of this body, once said when he wanted to extend more food sales to the then-Soviet Union--which, of course, was our enemy in the cold war--and someone was taking him to task for that. Senator Humphrey replied that he was in favor of selling them anything that they couldn't fire back. 
That is essentially my perspective, too. We ought to be willing to sell food with credit guarantees not only for our own purposes here in this country but because a lot of people whose economic circumstances are marginal in other countries need this food for their basic subsistence. 
Finally, it is important that the Senate not have the misimpression that this legislation is going to solve what is shaping up to be a very serious crisis in rural America and on our farms. We need to pass this legislation. It will help, but it should not delude us into thinking that now this is going to cure our low wheat prices or corn prices or solve the farm income problem. 
With respect to U.S. ag exports, I would point out the net impact of U.S. trade sanctions in six markets--Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, and Sudan--amounts to only 1 percent of the total U.S. ag exports. Those six countries purchased only about 2 percent--I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.

Mr. HARKIN. Those six countries purchased only about 2 percent of the total world ag imports in 1996. When India and Pakistan were added, the result was only 3.2 percent of the total world ag trade subject to U.S. sanctions. That is simply not enough to have caused the tremendous drop we have recently seen in wheat and other commodity prices. So, yes, we need to pass this bill, but we need to come back in this body and do something to help solve the low ag prices that are hurting our farmers all over America. This bill alone won't do it.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment I just sent to the desk really can be called the Tax Reduction for College Students Amendment, because that is exactly what it is. 
So all Senators who are interested in cutting taxes, I say listen up because this is your amendment because that is what this amendment does. It cuts taxes, and it cuts taxes for college students. Let me explain. 
First of all, I would like to say the legislation we are considering today, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, is a strong bill. There are many positive features of this legislation. 
I want to commend Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Coats, and Dodd for putting together a strong bipartisan bill. However, I believe that this amendment I am offering will do more to strengthen it even further. 
So the amendment is simple. It cuts the tax which has become known as origination and insurance fees. But a tax by any other name is still a tax. That is what it is. This amendment cuts this tax, this student tax, by 25 percent. 
In other words, it cuts it from 4 percent to 3 percent for students with Federally subsidized guaranteed and direct student loans. It is paid for by eliminating or reducing excessive government subsidies paid to the student loan middlemen--the guaranty agencies. 
My amendment eliminates the 1-percent insurance fee paid by students on the subsidized Federal family education loans, and reduces the origination fee on subsidized direct loans by one point. The net result is that all students with subsidized loans will have these taxes cut to 3 percent. In real terms it means up to an additional $171.25 while a student is in school. 
Sam Barr, from the University of Northern Iowa, wrote,  
I have been in the financial aid profession since 1985. . . . Over the years, I have had the opportunity to meet with and counsel hundreds of students regarding loans. Many of these students have expressed concern regarding the fact that they received less money than they borrowed, and were very upset that they had to pay back the fees--with interest [even though they didn't get anything.] 
Currently students pay the following taxes on their loans. Students with direct loans pay a 4-percent origination fee. Students with guaranteed loans pay a 3-percent origination fee, and a 1-percent insurance fee. In some cases, guaranty agencies currently waive a part or all of the insurance tax for some students with guaranteed loans. 
For example, the Iowa agency waived half of the fee for students with guaranteed loans. California and Pennsylvania waived the entire 1-percent insurance fee. 
So I have to ask, Mr. President, if some agencies are currently waiving the insurance fee on a selective basis, we really must question whether this revenue is really needed by the agencies. 
Second, this benefit should be available to students on an equitable basis in all States and in both loan programs. Unfortunately, Federal law does not provide a similar break for students with direct loans. As a result, in my State of Iowa, more than half of the students that attend direct loan schools cannot receive this cut. In other words, Iowa waves half of the fee. So that brings it down to 3 1/2 percent. That is for guaranteed loans, but half of the students in Iowa go into the Direct Loan Program. They have to pay the full 4 percent. That is simply not fair. 
So my amendment provides an equitable distribution of the tax cut by providing relief for all students with subsidized guaranteed and direct loans instead of just a select few. It creates a level playing field between the two programs by cutting the combined student loan tax by 25 percent. The amendment will also ensure that all agencies will operate in the most efficient manner possible. 
Mr. President, this insurance fee has been a part of the Guaranteed Student Loan Program since its inception. However, over the years additional subsidies were added to support the guaranty agencies. As a result, these agencies have accumulated huge reserves, currently in excess of $2.4 billion. So what we are doing is recalling about half of that money. But agencies will continue to hold over $1 billion in reserves needed to reimburse lenders for defaulted student loans. 
In addition, the excessive subsidies have enabled agencies to pay lavish salaries in the past. At one point, a CEO of U.S.A. Group, the Nation's largest guaranty agency, was paid over $1 million in salary and benefits. 
To be sure, the Department of Education has cracked down on this practice and has established a compensation ceiling to prevent agencies from using Federal funds to pay exorbitant salaries. However, it is clear that generous subsidies enabled this to occur. The Senate bill has revamped the guaranty agency subsidies. 
Even with my amendment, these agencies will continue to be paid handsomely for their work and will receive in excess of $4.5 billion over the next 5 years. 
So if you have heard from some of your guaranty agencies that the Harkin amendment is going to break them and cause them to go bankrupt, this chart will prove otherwise. Over the next 5 years, if you add up their fees, collections, investment income, and prevention fees, it adds up to almost $4.6 billion that they are going to get over the next 5 years. 
Without my amendment, they are going to get probably about double that, about $8 billion over the next 5 years. So this is quite sufficient to take care of any problems that they might have--$4.58 billion. 
Mr. President, I am fully aware of the opposition to this amendment. The guaranty agencies are obviously opposed to it. Critics have called it a thinly veiled attempt to destabilize the Guaranteed Loan Program to force schools to enter a Direct Loan Program. But how could that be true? For example, in Iowa, as I said, in my home State, the State has waived half the fee. Students under the Guaranteed Loan Program pay 3 1/2 percent. Under the Direct Loan Program, they pay 4 percent. These kinds of anomalies occur in a lot of States. All I am saying is make them both the same; make them both 3 percent. 
That is what my amendment does. As I have stated in committee repeatedly in the past, I have supported the two loan programs. The competition of the Direct Loan Program has led to dramatic improvements in the Guaranteed Loan Program, and I think the result has been very positive for our students when we have both of these programs. But they are uneven and they are unfair. 
Now, opponents also allege my amendment would cause individual agencies to become insolvent, thereby jeopardizing the payment of default claims by lenders. Absolute nonsense. In 1992, in the aftermath of the failure of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, the law was changed to make it clear that default claims would be paid by the Federal Government in the event of the insolvency of an agency--period. 
Well, Mr. President, over the past 17 years, since the inception, in 1981, of this program, the lender subsidy has declined dramatically, from about $1.9 billion in fiscal year 1982 to less than $300 million last year. Unfortunately, students have not seen a commensurate reduction in the student loan tax. In fact, students are actually paying more. Revenues from the program, the origination fees, have more than doubled. In 1982, when it started, revenues were $292 million; last year, they were $629 million. So students are paying more. 
The President's fiscal year 1999 budget proposed phasing out the fee for the neediest students over the next few years. I wish we could do that this year. However, I recognize that elimination of the tax probably does not seem possible at this time. So this amendment takes the first step with a 25-percent cut in the tax for the neediest students. 
Last year, we provided a significant boost to the Pell grant. We raised the maximum grant by $300 million to $3,000 per student. This effort received strong bipartisan support. My amendment will have a similar impact for students. It puts more money in their pockets to pay their educational expenses. This chart shows that. 
What this amendment does is it basically says that over a 4-year period the reduction in the tax will mean a savings of about $171.25 per student. Now, to those of you who don't think that is much money, that buys a lot of textbooks for a student going to college. It buys a lot of textbooks. 
These students, the neediest of students need every penny they can get to pay tuition and buy their books in school. Again, they are frustrated when they go in and borrow the money and they pay the fee, and they get less money than what they borrowed. And then when they pay it back, they even have to pay interest on the money they never got. Very unfair.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Kennedy for those comments in support of this amendment. 
The Senator is absolutely right. This came in at a time when there was extremely high interest rates, used as an insurance policy. And then for some reason it just continued on and on and on and on. Again, as I pointed out, we have reduced some of the subsidies over the intervening years, but for some reason this student tax continued on. 
There is absolutely no reason for it today, and, as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out and as this chart clearly shows, even with my amendment, over the next 5 years they are going to get $4.6 billion that they really don't even need. But they have it. Do they need twice that much? Do they need $8 billion? I don't think so. 
So let's give our students a little bit of a tax break. Everybody is always talking about giving people tax cuts around here. Here is one you can vote for. Here is one that has an immediate impact right now. That means these students going to college this fall will have an extra amount of money to buy that textbook or to pay their tuition costs. For some people, $171 may not sound like a lot of money. But for a low-income student, families working hard trying to get their kids into college and through college, that is a lot of money. And it is money that is not needed by these guaranty agencies. It is just not needed. They get plenty of money, $4.5 billion. So I hope the Senate will support this very modest amendment. It is not cutting the whole thing. It is just cutting it by 25 percent. I think our students deserve that tax cut. 
I am a product of student loans when I went to college. Neither one of my parents went to college. They didn't have any money, so I had to borrow money to go to college. But in those days we had the National Defense Education Act which came in under the Eisenhower administration. We borrowed the money. We never had to pay any interest on it all the time we were in school, never had to pay any interest on it when we were in the military. Finally, when I got through law school, I had to start paying back the loans and the interest started accruing on it. 
I always thought what was good for our generation ought to be good for the present generation. I don't know why it shouldn't be that way. This is one step we can take to tell at least the neediest students today that they deserve to have a tax break and they deserve to have a little bit more money to buy their textbooks. So I urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. HARKIN. I submit to my friend from Arkansas that one of the greatest myths about the guaranteed loan program is that the agencies are the real guarantors of the loans. I listened to the Senator and I listened to the Senator from Vermont also talk about putting the agencies in jeopardy by reducing the amount of money to pay for defaulted loans--at least that is what I heard--that my amendment might put them in jeopardy. 
I think, contrary to popular belief, the Federal Government 
is the guarantor, and this changed in 1992. So I think there is a holdover from the previous era. In 1992--and I will just read to the Senator from the law itself: `Consequence of guaranty agency insolvency. In the event that the Secretary has determined that a guaranty agency is unable to meet its insurance obligations under this part, the holder of loans insured by the guaranty agency may submit insurance claims directly to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall pay to the holder the full insurance obligation of the guaranty agency.'

Mr. HARKIN. Again, Madam President, I just want to point out, again, I do happen to have these figures available. For the State of Arkansas right now, the reserve fund is $7.9 million--$7.9 million that Arkansas has in its reserve fund. Even under my amendment, the yearly revenue for the next 5 years will be $3.8 million a year. So for the next 5 years, that will be another almost $20 million coming into Arkansas, and Arkansas has, as I said, a $7.9 million reserve fund right now.

Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Arkansas, once again, without going further, I don't know why that went down $1.1 million. A lot of times these agencies dip into reserve funds to pay salaries and benefits and things like that. I don't know why they dipped in the reserve funds. 
I just say that even $6.8 million for the State of Arkansas, with $3.8 million per year, is more than enough for the reserve fund. And, secondly, I say that in the worst case scenario that the Federal Government still is the guarantor. And, lastly, I just point out that unless one is totally pessimistic about the economy over the next 2 or 3 or 4 years, saying that everything is just going to go down the tubes, that we are going to have plenty of money in this reserve fund, even with this amendment.

Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, I just say to my friend from Arkansas, who now has assumed the chair, that there was some mention made that this amendment was a direct threat to the Guaranteed Loan Program and a way of tilting it toward the Direct Loan Program. And, again, I say that nothing could be further from the facts here, because my amendment takes a cut of 25 percent in both the Guaranteed Loan Program and in the Direct Loan Program. It puts them both at 3 percent. So it makes the playing field absolutely level. It does not give one a benefit over the other. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will wrap up my comments on the amendment I offered. Again, Mr. President, I listened to the Senator, my good friend from Indiana, talk about schools choosing to stay out of the Direct Loan Program. Well, I point out that in the first 2 years there was a tremendous increase in schools joining the Direct Loan Program. But then in 1995 Congress began to make all of these threats about ending or killing the Direct Loan Program. So what has happened is that schools are apprehensive about whether or not they want to keep the Direct Loan Program, and that put a dampening effect on the tremendous growth we had in the first couple of years. 
Secondly, I can't help but be somewhat amused by all this talk about the private sector--the private sector involved in these students loans. We want this private sector to keep going --this private sector. Let me point out, Mr. President, that the `private sector' involved in this Guaranteed Loan Program gets a subsidy from the taxpayers of this country to the tune of $7.5 billion a year. That is right--this private sector enterprise gets a subsidy from the Federal Government every year of $7.5 billion. Private sector? Hardly. Subsidized sector? Yes. 
So all of this talk about this private sector out there in the Guaranteed Loan Program is nonsense. Now, if you want to make it private sector, let's not give them any subsidies. Let's knock out the $600 million to lenders for the special allowance payment. Let's knock off the $3 billion to cover defaults. Let's knock off the $2.5 million for interest subsidy for students. Knock off all that stuff--the $7.5 billion a year in subsidies that we put out for the guaranty loan agencies. If you want to talk about competition, that is fine; I don't mind having competition. In fact, it might be pretty good. But let's keep it balanced. 
The point is that this amendment that I have offered for the students cuts their taxes by 25 percent on both the Guaranteed Loan Program and on the Direct Loan Program. It cuts it by 25 percent on both. It keeps them both even in that regard. So if you want to keep competition, I say vote for my amendment. You get a tax cut for the students, which allows them to buy textbooks, and it keeps the Direct Loan Program and the subsidized, private sector Guaranteed Loan Program in balance. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. I just want to ask the Senator again on this chart--this is outrageous--there is the return on equity for commercial banks. For a number of years it averaged about 11, 12 percent. Now it is up over 14 percent. That is a return on equity for banks. Is the Senator saying that this bill that we are passing will guarantee them a 16-percent return on guaranteed student loans?

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Not only do they get the 16-percent guarantee, they get a $7.5 billion subsidy from the taxpayers of this country. So I think the Senator is absolutely right. If they want to be private sector, let's put it out for bid. Some years ago, as the Senator remembers, we put the WIC Program out, the Women's Infants and Children's feeding program out for competitive bidding, good old free enterprise competitive bidding, and we have saved billions of dollars for the taxpayers of this country and improved the program. I think the Senator is right on target on this. If there is so much money floating around here, let's put it out for bid. Let's put it out for good old free enterprise, competitive bidding.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my amendment cuts the tax on subsidized student loans by 25 percent--from 4 percent to 3 percent. So it puts more actual money into the pockets of students so they can buy textbooks. It also continues to pay guaranty agencies over the next 5 years. 
If you hear an argument that somehow this is going to put our guaranty agencies at risk and jeopardize the banks, I point out that even under my amendment by cutting this tax by 25 percent on students, the guaranty agencies will get almost $4.6 billion over the next 5 years, more than enough to handle any contingency. 
So this basically is a tax cut for students. It is supported by a long list of colleges and student organizations. I think it is the least we can do for our students--to give them a tax break, also.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our former colleague, Senator John Culver of Iowa, brought to my attention an article, which recently appeared in the Cedar Rapids Gazette, about Bill Fitch. Mr. Fitch was an outstanding athlete when he attended Cedar Rapids' Wilson High School and, also, during his college years at Coe College in Cedar Rapids. Later on, Mr. Fitch coached at Coe College, Creighton University (where he coached Bob Gibson, the famous baseball pitcher), and North Dakota (where he coached Phil Jackson, now coach of the Chicago Bulls). He won the 1981 NBA title as the Boston Celtics' coach with Larry Bird. He coached in the NBA for 25 years and was the only person to coach 2,000 regular-season games and his 944 wins ranked second only to NBA coach Lenny Wilkens. I am grateful to Mike Hlas of the Cedar Rapids Gazette for writing this column about one of Iowa's great athletes, and I am thankful to my friend, Senator John Culver, for bringing it to my attention.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me this time. More than that, I thank Senator Bumpers for his relentless pursuit, over the years, of shedding more and more light on this issue of the space station. I say at the outset that a vote for the Bumpers amendment is a vote for space exploration. A vote against Bumpers is a vote for the status quo. It is a vote for the myopic approach to space exploration and it is a vote for wasteful spending for science that can be done better and cheaper. 
I am foursquare with Senator Bumpers on his approach on the space station. It is a boondoggle and a waste of money. Maybe Senator Bumpers and I are not foursquare on the issue of space exploration itself. That may be for another time and another debate. But on this issue, Senator Bumpers is absolutely right. 
I have been a longtime supporter of aviation, aviation research, aviation technology, pushing the boundaries of aviation technology through science and technology and also for space. For 10 years, I served in the House on the House Science and Technology Committee. I was proud to chair the Aviation and Materials Subcommittee of that committee. I was proud to work to try to get more and more funds for space exploration. But I watched, during those 10 years in the House on the Science and Technology Committee, I watched in dismay as NASA shifted, gradually but determinatively, shifted from a civilian space agency to an arm of the military. That can be seen through the way that the space agency shifted in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It became more and more an arm of the Air Force. It became more and more an arm of our military establishment. 
I can remember the debates we had on that in the Science and Technology Committee back in the mid-1970s. I kind of understood that. We were in a cold war with the Soviet Union. Space was being used more and more for military purposes--spy satellites, that kind of thing. But another interesting thing happened. We began to develop a thing called the space shuttle, which I believe was driven more by the desire of Air Force pilots to fly than anything else. I think it was driven more by the desire to be more than just a monkey sitting on a seat. 
I remember when the first shuttle took off. I was there for the launch, and I remember we had the first shuttle astronauts back in the committee room for a hearing. I remember Neil Armstrong was there. One Congressmen stated how proud he was to see them land with dignity as they came back, rather than plopping in the ocean as they used to in the space capsules. I thought at the time, what a tremendous expenditure of money just so that we could land that thing on a runway rather than plopping it in the ocean. 
Let's remember, the first man to set foot on the Moon was not a military person, it was a civilian, a civilian test pilot by the name of Neil Armstrong, and that was not happenstance. It was not an accident that happened that way, because we believed and our Government believed at that time that space should be a civilian exploration enterprise. Then we watched as two things happened; as NASA became more and more militarized and as we retreated from Moon exploration to near-Earth orbits. 
Then we were sold the space shuttle. Oh, it was going to be a great flying machine. It was going to reduce the cost of launching material into near-Earth orbit by a factor of 10. I remember being told that. I was on the Science and Technology Committee. It was going to reduce launch cost by a factor of 10. We were going to have these reusable rockets and all that kind of stuff. We are still waiting. We are still waiting for that factor of 10 reduction. It has never happened. 
I am convinced today, perhaps more than I was at that time, that the shuttle should never have been built. I am convinced that, had we not gone ahead with the space shuttle but had commenced and continued our space exploration with the Saturn, that 
we could have had a fully operational Moon base at this time with all that would mean for the world and for our country and, yes, for science and technology. 
Now, that brings me to the present time. If we build this space station for $98 billion and counting, it will effectively suck all of the dollars out of space exploration. That is why I said, in an oddly curious way, a vote for the Bumpers amendment is a vote for space exploration. A vote against him--forget about it. You are not going to do anything in space, because this is going to suck all the money out of it. Suck money out for what, scientific experiments? 
I listened to the speech given on the floor by my good friend, Senator Glenn from Ohio, on all of the wonderful science that is going to be done and the experimentation. We estimate the cost per man-hour for those scientific experiments to be about $155,000 per man-hour. NIH can do it for less than $300 an hour. The Senator from Ohio says, `Just think how much this is going to energize young people to go into science and into medical research.' If you want to encourage young people to go into medical research in this country, take that kind of money and put it into NIH. You will hire thousands of times more researchers doing that than you will spending $155,000 per man-hour for scientific research on this space station. Put the money into NIH. 
I think it is time to cut our losses. Do you know what this reminds me of, I say to Senator Bumpers, this debate we are having on the space station and listening to Senator Gramm from Texas? It reminds me of the debates we had on something called the Clinch River breeder reactor. How many years we debated that; how much good it was going to do for our country and the science and the research. Billions of dollars we poured down the rat hole on that one. We finally terminated it. We came to our senses and terminated it. How many billions of dollars, though, did we waste? 
And then, most recently, something called the Superconducting Super Collider that was going to be built in Texas. Oh, my gosh, to listen to the debates that went on around this floor about that--why, if we ended that one, all science was going to come to a halt. Why, building the Superconducting Super Collider was going to unlock and unravel the mysteries of the universe for us. Nonsense. Stuff and nonsense, that is what it was. 
We came to our senses and we killed it--rightfully so, because the Superconducting Super Collider would have had the same effect on physical sciences as the space station is going to have on medical science. It is going to suck all the money right out of it, because once you build the space station, then you have to justify it. How do you justify it? Through medical research at $155,000 per man-hour. Where is the money going to come from for NIH? Where is the money going to come from for the research that has to be done here? It will not be left around. This will do to medical research just what the Superconducting Super Collider would have done to physical science research. And that is why so many physicists and scientists were opposed to the Superconducting Super Collider. They were right. That is why so many scientists are opposed to the space station. They are right. It is time to cut our losses. 
I remember--I was not here then, but I know my history--back in the 1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission, the head of it, Lewis Strauss, testified before a Senate committee and said that atomic energy would be so cheap in making electricity we wouldn't even have to meter it. We are still waiting. But look at the billions of dollars that we have spent on nuclear power. I am not saying it hasn't done some good, that we don't get power from it. My gosh, we are still fighting the battles of what we are going to do with the waste. 
Of course, we know now it is more expensive than anything else. If we build this space station, forget about it, there will be no money left.

Mr. HARKIN. The microgravity kind of research that has been talked about can be done on the shuttle. We don't need a space station to do that. Or it can be done other ways. 
In 1994, Mr. President, I read an article that was in Discover magazine and became entranced with it. Just today, I had a long talk on the phone with Ed Belbruno, a former NASA mathematician. He has devised a new way of space exploration. I won't go into it. I don't have the time. I think it is fascinating, however. 
Because of his theories, we could use 40 percent less energy to go to the Moon and beyond--40 percent less--and it has already been proven. He did it once already in the early nineties. The Japanese space agency is looking at it more, and so are the Europeans. I am sure my friend from Ohio will recognize it by using what we call the `weak stability boundary theory.' 
I won't go into all the theories of it, but physically it is fascinating about how we can use the gravity of the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth to launch vehicles from here to the Moon or to Mars or beyond and use 40 percent less energy. 
What that means is today we have the ability to return to the Moon and beyond using a lot less than we did before. Think of the excitement in that. Think of what we can do with exploration if we actually build a Moon base. Think of what that will mean in terms of scientific research and technological advancements. Think of what that will mean to us if we want to explore the universe, not from the space station, that is not going to help it one single bit, but now we have the theory and it has been proven; it has already been done once. 
Mr. President, this weekend I was in Iceland. It occurred to me that in about the year 900, around the year 1000, Leif Ericson sailed to the New World, from Norway to Iceland to Greenland to Newfoundland, almost all the way down to what we now consider to be New York City. And they did it for years. Almost 500 years later, Christopher Columbus decided to go a different route, and it took him forever. 
But you see, the Vikings had it right. They could sail the North Sea on the new great circle route, come to the New World, turn around, and catch the Gulf Stream and zip back. They had it figured out. You can't hardly blame Columbus. They didn't have it figured out. They didn't know. They sailed the southern ocean, down through the doldrums, and it took them a long time. They never quite figured it out. The Vikings did. You can't really blame Christopher Columbus. They didn't have that knowledge. 
You can't blame us. We now know that there are cheaper and better routes for space exploration than building a space station. We know that there are better and cheaper ways of doing microgravity research than on a space station. We know there are better and cheaper ways of doing medical research than spending $155,000 per man-hour on the space station. 
If we rush ahead with this space station, we have no one to blame but ourselves. I ask my colleagues to think back to the promises of the fifties when we were going to meet our energy needs so cheaply with nuclear power. Think about the Clinch River breeder reactor and how many votes were cast for that and all the promises it was going to give us. Think about the Superconducting Super Collider and what that was going to do for us. And then think about the scientists who opposed the Clinch River breeder reactor. Think about the scientists who opposed the Superconducting Super Collider. And now think about the scientists who oppose this space station. 
Senator Bumpers had it right. I saw a quote that he sent around in a `Dear Colleague' letter where the scientists were saying, basically, why would you want to spend so much money on something--here it is, Discover magazine. Here we are back to my favorite magazine:  
Is it possible to imagine a technological undertaking so enormous that could garner less respect from the scientific community? 
Discover magazine, May 1997. 
They know why. If we build this space station, it is going to suck so much money out of here, there won't be anything left. Oh, I suppose, as Senator Bumpers said, it will lose. I hope not. I hope it wins. I hope we come to our senses. 
I do believe this: The space station is not going to be built. It will never be completed. We may put up a module. We will do some shuttle flights. The Russians will never come through with their, what, 50 flights or 60 flights? Forget about it, the Russians are not going to do it. They don't have the money. So who is going to pick up that slack? Our taxpayers? We can take that $98 billion and start multiplying it out. 
That is why I say today, this will be like Clinch River; it will be like the Superconducting Super Collider. We built some trenches down there. We spent a couple billion dollars on it. We spent a couple billion on the Clinch River breeder reactor also, and we finally came to our senses and said it was a boondoggle. That is what will happen with the space station. It is not going to be built, but what we can do is take this money and do something a lot cheaper and a lot better than building the space station.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, under last year's VA/HUD appropriations act, the Congress created a program called `mark-to-market' to reduce overmarket section 8 contract rents on FHA-insured multifamily properties. Section 514(g)(2)(A) of the mark-to-market program would authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to allow for exception rents over the 120 percent of fair market rent (FMR) limit for up to five percent of the restructured units in a year. There is some confusion, however, if this five percent waiver is a national limit or a geographical limit. I am concerned that certain areas, such as the upper Midwest, the need for waivers may exceed five percent because of the proportion of elderly facilities and the way FMRs compare to the relative costs of operating those facilities in certain areas as well as the random circumstances that may occur in certain geographical areas in a given year. 
I would like to ask the Chairmen of the HUD authorizing and appropriations subcommittees for their clarification on the congressional intent of this issue.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President for getting order in the Chamber. 
This amendment I offered basically transfers $329 million from the Department of Defense to the Veterans Affairs' medical account. The veterans' needs are very clear. We have a declining population, they say, of veterans, so why do they need that much money? That may be true for World War II vets. But now we have the Vietnam vets coming on board. Plus, our vets are living longer and are sicker than the general population. Plus, we have the problems with medical inflation. 
Yesterday, during the debate, mention was made that the veterans account got more than a 12-percent increase from last year. I checked that out. That was based on a Washington Post article regarding the VA-HUD appropriations. But when I looked at the total budget account for Veterans Affairs, from 1997 to 1998, there was less than a 1-percent increase in Veterans Affairs. That is for the total veterans budget. There was even less than that in the medical account budget for our veterans. 
What my amendment seeks to do is to put some money into the veterans' benefits in the medical account. This chart shows that out of our discretionary dollar, we spend about 50 1/2 cents of each dollar for military, but for veterans' benefits, about 3 1/2 cents. 
My amendment will take the alarmingly large amount of one-eighth of 1 penny--one-eighth of 1 penny--of the entire Defense Department budget to put where it is needed to help care for our sick and elderly veterans. That $329 million will simply keep the current level of services. It will not expand it. 
Lastly, this amendment will authorize the Secretary to transfer the money. It doesn't mandate. Two years ago, the comptroller general of the Department of Defense said they could not account for over $13 billion in DOD spending. They couldn't even find it. Then we had recent testimony this year from the IG's office regarding accounting principles. This will authorize the Secretary to transfer the money. Where will the Secretary get the money? You never know. Maybe they will get better accounting principles, maybe they will find some of these billions of dollars for which they haven't been able to account. 
Right now the Secretary cannot take that money and put it into veterans. This amendment will allow him to do so. It doesn't mandate it, but it allows it. 
Lastly, I note with some interest an article that appeared in this morning's Washington Post. It points out that the House yesterday voted to buy $431 million worth of airplanes that the Pentagon didn't even request. They didn't even request the C-130s. What the Pentagon did want is a squadron of F-18s, our carrier-based aircraft, because the F-14s are getting old. Over 32 have crashed since 1991. Yet, we are going to buy $431 million worth of C-130s. 
If anyone is saying that DOD doesn't have the $329 million to take care of our veterans, I say nonsense. Of course, we do. I will make the point once again that taking care of veterans' medical needs is part and parcel of our ongoing military budget, and it ought to be viewed in that manner. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

The veterans have fulfilled the duty they had to serve our country. Now it is up to us to fulfill our duties, our obligation, and our solemn promise: Provide for our veterans. 
Regardless of how you cut this issue, the health care of our veterans is a matter of our national security. What does it say to young people today entering the service who may serve in the Persian Gulf, or who knows where, to defend our national interest if they see how we treat the veterans of our past wars? 
This amendment will simply keep the current level of services in the medical account section of our veterans budget. We should do no less than that.

Mr. HARKIN. I rise to offer an amendment important to Persian Gulf War veterans. My amendment increases Department of Defense spending on research to determine the causes and possible treatments of those suffering from Gulf War illnesses by $10 million. It is my understanding that the amendment has been accepted by the bill managers on both sides. 
While the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991, the physical and psychological ordeal for many of the nearly 700,000 troops who served our country in Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield has not ended. It's been seven years since our troops were winning the war in the Gulf. Unfortunately, they continue to suffer due to their deployment. 
Many of our troops returned from the Persian Gulf suffering from a variety of symptoms that have been difficult to trace to a single source or substance. Our veterans have experienced a combination of symptoms in varying degrees of seriousness, including: fatigue, skin rash, muscle and joint pain, headache, loss of memory, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal and respiratory problems. Unfortunately, the initial response from the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs was to express skepticism about veterans' and their loved ones who dealt with the very real affects of their service in the Gulf. 
I vividly remember a series of roundtable discussions I held with veterans across Iowa after being contacted by several families of Gulf War veterans stricken with undiagnosed illnesses. And these folks weren't just sick. They were tired. They were tired of getting the runaround from the government they defended. There were tired of people who refused to listen. . . or told them it was in their head . . . or that it had nothing to do with their service in the Gulf. 
Their stories put a human face on the results of a study I requested through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results add to the increasing volume of evidence that what these veterans were experiencing was indeed very real. More than one in three Gulf War veterans reported one or more significant medical problems. Fifteen percent reported two or more significant medical conditions. These Iowa veterans also reported significantly greater problems with quality of life issues than others on active duty at the time but not deployed in the Gulf. For example, Persian Gulf veterans had lower scores on measures of vitality, physical and mental health, ability to work, and increased levels of emotional problems and bodily pain. 
In addition, over 80 percent of the Gulf War veterans in the CDC study reported having been exposed to at least one potentially hazardous material during their Persian Gulf Deployment. A recent General Accounting Office report provided an alarming laundry list of such hazards including: `compounds used to decontaminate equipment and protect it against chemical agents, fuel used as a sand suppressant in and around encampments, fuel used to burn human waste, fuel in shower water, leaded vehicle exhaust used to dry sleeping bags, depleted uranium, parasites, pesticides, multiple vaccines used to protect against chemical warfare agents, and smoke from oil-well fires.' 
To this rather exhaustive list, we can also add exposure to nerve gas. The DOD and CIA have admitted that as many as 100,000 or more . . . that's 1 in 7 troops deployed in the Gulf . . . may have been exposed to chemical agents released into the atmosphere when U.S. troops destroyed an Iraqi weapons bunker. A Presidential Advisory Committee also found credible evidence of exposure to chemical agents in a second incident when troops crossed Iraqi front lines on the first day of the ground war. Chemical weapons specialists in these units said they detected poison gas. Unfortunately, these detections were initially neither acknowledged nor pursued by the Pentagon. 
That being said, the Pentagon and others have been more forthcoming recently with relevant information, documents, and research. But more needs to be done. I am pleased that the President, acting based on legislation, I cosponsored, extended the time veterans will have to file claims with the government for illnesses related to their service in the Gulf. Previously, they had to show their illness surfaced within two years of their service. Now, they have until the end of 2001. This is a great victory for our veterans. Gulf War illnesses do not surface on a time line convenient to the rules of bureaucrats. This extension will help us meet our responsibility to take care of these soldiers. But, more still needs to be done. 
There is still substantial mystery and confusion surrounding the symptoms and health problems experienced by Gulf War veterans. While many veterans have been diagnosed with a recognizable disease, I am concerned about those who have no explanation, no label, no treatment for their suffering. More needs to be done to help these Americans. 
For example, the Presidential Advisory Committee has suggested research in three new areas to help close the gaps in what we know about Gulf War illnesses. They suggest research on the long-term health effects of low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents, the combined effects of medical injections meant to combat chemical warfare with other Gulf War risk factors, and on the body's physical response to stress. It is also imperative to ensure that longitudinal studies and mortality studies are funded since some health effects, such as cancer, may not appear for several years after the end of the Gulf War. 
Although there may be no single Gulf-War related disease so to speak, it is widely acknowledged that the multiple illnesses and symptoms experienced by Gulf War veterans are connected to their service during the war. Therefore, we must not forget on our solemn obligation to those who willingly served their country and put their lives in harm's away. 
To that end, I offer this amendment to increase research into the illnesses experienced by Persian Gulf veterans by $10 million. In the committee version of the bill, $19 million is included. Therefore, my amendment would increase that amount to $29 million, providing many more opportunities for the Pentagon to study that many more possible causes and cures. The funds would support much more research, including the evaluation and treatment of a host of nuero-immunological disorders, as well as possible connections to Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyaglia. 
Our veterans are not asking for much. They want answers. They wan the truth. Our veterans answered our nations's call in war, and now we must answer theirs. My amendment to increase funding for research into Gulf War illnesses is one step in helping find these answers. Should our priorities include our Gulf War veterans? I believe the choice is self evident and absolutely clear.

Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I didn't quite hear all that, but there has always been sort of a comity in the Senate where we alternate from side to side on amendments. It seems to me the last couple of amendments have been on the other side. It would seem to be only logical that the next amendment be on this side.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of colleagues, I do not intend to take anywhere near a half hour on this on my side, and hopefully will yield back a lot of time so we can get out of here at an early hour. 
This amendment, pure and simple, is to take some money from the Department of Defense and put it into the medical account of the Department of Veterans Affairs. This amendment would transfer $329 million specifically from the Department of Defense budget to the medical accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Let me be clear that what this amendment will do will not increase the amount of money, really, going to veterans' medical accounts. It will just keep it level in accordance with medical inflation. 
Budgets are about priorities. Tight restrictions on discretionary spending over the past several years, and spending caps created last year to balance the budget, have forced some tough choices to be made. But I ask my colleagues, what greater priority can there be than to take care of those who have defended the very right of our country to exist? Our veterans have fulfilled the duty they had to serve their country. Now it is up to this Congress to fulfill our duty, our obligation, our solemn promise to provide for our veterans. 
The needs of our veterans are clear. The aging veteran population, rising personnel costs and medical inflation, means that each dollar provided for veterans' health care benefits cannot be stretched as far as it used to be. The 5-year budget plan assumed no increases for the discretionary spending of Veterans Affairs. Let me say that again. The 5-year budget plan assumed no increases for VA discretionary spending; in other words, no taking into account the cost of inflation, and especially medical inflation. The well-being of our veterans must not be subject to second-class status. Veterans' funding deserves to be considered as more than just an afterthought.

Mr. HARKIN. I might just quote here from the Vietnam Veterans of America: 
VVA has long held the principle belief that the health care and benefits needs of veterans are an ongoing cost of our Nation's defense. 
I think that is the problem around here. We have a defense budget, then we have a veterans' affairs budget--as if somehow they are separate and distinct and have no connection with one another. I think this sentence really says it clearly: 
. . .the benefits needs of veterans are an ongoing cost of our nation's defense. 
We cannot separate the two. 
Your amendment will carry forward with assurance of the Nation's commitment to veterans' military service-related health care needs. 
The letter from the Vietnam Veterans of America, Incorporated, goes on and says: 
Some of your colleagues have argued that attrition of the veterans population through deaths of World War II veterans is an indication that VA needs less money to operate. However, this narrow perspective fails to take into account the rising costs of medical care, and more importantly, the current demographics of the veterans population. VA health care users are older and sicker than the overall American public. Vietnam veterans now represent the largest group within the veterans population. Many of the Vietnam veterans and a growing population of Persian Gulf war veterans have complex problems relating to herbicide, chemical and other environmental exposures. 
VVA strongly believes that Congress must commit an adequate annual appropriations to VA medical care programs. Your amendment is a very positive recognition of the current circumstances and needs of America's veterans. Thank you for your initiative to attempt redistributing some DOD funds towards VA medical care. 
Sincerely, Kelly Willard West, Director of Government Relations. 
The same thing basically follows through on the Blinded Veterans Association and the Paralyzed Veterans Association of America. The Blinded Veterans Association says: 
The VA health care system has already been pared to the bone, and we doubt there are any more efficiencies that can be realized to offset inadequate resources. 
Fewer dollars means fewer veterans will be served, pure and simple, and that is the truth. Fewer dollars means fewer veterans will be served. 
Let me just, right now, refer to this chart for those who think that may be taking $329 million out of a $271 billion defense budget--think about that, $271 billion, and all we are asking for is $329 million, just to get veterans' health care benefits up to meet inflationary needs. If you look at this chart, it shows you how much we are spending on military of our discretionary budget. If you look at our discretionary spending, military consumes half of it. Half of all that we spend in this Congress goes to military spending--half, 50 cents out of every dollar. Out of the other 50 cents, we take agriculture and energy and Social Security, economic development, transportation, science and space, housing, foreign affairs, foreign aid, health, justice, education. We hear all this debate that we are spending too much on education--6 cents out of every dollar; 6 cents for education, 50 cents for military spending. 
We are not talking about all these, we are talking about veterans' benefits. Out of this $1 that we spend here every year, how much goes for veterans' benefits? 3 1/2 pennies--3 1/2 pennies, to meet the medical needs of those who risked life and limb to preserve and protect and defend the Constitution of 
the United States. 
I think that we can do a little bit better than 3 1/2 pennies. I think the amendment we are offering brings that to just a little under 4 pennies, if I am not mistaken. Is that too much to ask? It is not too much to ask when we are taking 50 cents out for defense. I think the Vietnam Veterans of America had it right. We should not separate veterans' benefits out of defense. It is part of the ongoing costs of the defense of this country, and we should not separate the two out. 
I believe we are meeting our commitments globally. I take a back seat to no one in saying that we are the world's most powerful nation, that we have a lot of commitments globally, that we have to meet those commitments. We are meeting those commitments and we will continue to meet them. And taking $329 million out of the defense budget is not going to harm that one little bit. But what will harm us, if we do not meet this commitment, is that many of our veterans, our Vietnam veterans, now today many of our Korean war veterans and even some of our World War II veterans, they are getting older--they are living longer, just as the demographics of our country are--they are living longer; they are sicker. There are leftover problems that they have that maybe were not indicated when they were in the military, such as herbicide and chemical poisoning and things like that, that now later on they are suffering from. 
What happens if we do not meet their medical needs? Aside from the personal suffering and the personal hardship that they and their families have to undergo, what happens is that younger people in their families and their friends look upon them and they say, `Wait a minute. Here is someone who went to the Persian Gulf. Here is a veteran who fought in Vietnam. Maybe here is someone who was in Korea, and yet they are not being cared for? A lot of the funding has to come out of their own pockets to meet their medical needs?' 
I would imagine a lot of younger people would say: Why would I ever want to go in the military? If we promised to meet their health care needs and later on we don't live up to that obligation, what does that say to our younger people who we want to enlist and become active duty members of our armed services? 
I think our lack of spending adequate resources to keep up with at least inflation in veterans' health care benefits has a deleterious effect on the security of our Nation. I see this amendment as not just something helping the veterans and meeting the obligation that we have to our present-day veterans, but I see this amendment as really meeting the future security needs of our country by saying to those who come along next, who may be asked to go to some other place in the world to defend this country, to defend our vital national interest, it says to them, `When you are in that position, we're going to meet your obligations, too.' 
I just feel very strongly that this is something that we have to do as a society. I am not trying to goldplate anything. I am not trying to boost veterans' medical benefits' spending way pie high in the sky. I am simply saying at least we ought to keep up with inflation. We do that here. We kept up with inflation in energy and agriculture, national affairs, justice, education--we keep up basically with inflation. Why shouldn't we do this for our veterans, also? 
As the Independent Budget Project of the veterans' groups have pointed out, tens of thousands of Americans who now stand in harm's way in Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, and other troubled spots around the world will be the veterans of tomorrow. It is worth noting that the veterans suffering from the complicated gulf war illnesses may end up being a greater financial strain on the system in the future. What are we going to say to them? Tough luck? 
In other words, Mr. President, the demand for VA health care will not diminish in the foreseeable future. Just because there are fewer people doesn't mean we can spend fewer dollars. They are living longer, they are getting older, and they are sicker, and a lot of the illnesses they contracted haven't shown up. We can't just wish it away. 
All we are asking is to provide the resources to meet the demand that is there. That is what this amendment does. I urge its adoption as the fair and equitable and the right thing for our country to do for the veterans who fought in World War II, Korea, the Persian Gulf, Vietnam and, yes, in Bosnia, too, and for those younger people who are going to be the veterans of tomorrow, we have to meet this obligation. 
I will point out, I offered this amendment last year, and I didn't have all of the figures down--we do this year--keeping up with inflation. This amendment received 41 votes last year on a bipartisan basis. It is less money this year. We are actually asking for less money this year just to keep up with inflation. I am hopeful Senators on both sides can see fit to meet the obligation to our veterans. 
I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.  
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. HARKIN. There are priorities to be met and, quite frankly, in this $271 billion defense budget, it is my feeling--and I looked at it, I am on Defense Appropriations, I have looked at it and I, quite frankly, believe that the Secretary could find $329 million out of that. I don't think it would do any damage to our readiness, our capabilities overseas or anything else. 
Quite frankly, I have some comments I was going to talk about--but I decided not to because the hour is late--in terms of what some of the IG offices found in terms of waste and inefficiencies in procurement, in warehousing and things within the Department of Defense. With a little bit more oversight and control on those, I think they can yield great dividends and can be used on this.

Mr. HARKIN. It is my understanding, I say to my very good friend--I want to make this clear at the outset that I have the highest regard and respect for the Senator from Virginia and his devotion to this country and his devotion to the readiness of our military and also his devotion to our veterans. I would not want anyone to misconstrue that I am saying the Senator from Michigan or the Senator from Virginia have shortchanged it. 
I understand the obligations that you are under in terms of meeting our military commitments. I understand that. This amendment is meant only in good faith to try to meet, I think, another commitment that we have. And in some ways I hope to shed some light, hopefully, on one aspect of military spending that could be used for our veterans' affairs. 
I say to the Senator that 2 years ago the comptroller general of the Pentagon concluded that the DOD could not account for over $13 billion in spending--just disappeared--$13 billion. Nobody knows where it went. Well, I have more examples of that. But if it is just $1 billion, only one-thirteenth of that, then $329 million is not that much, when you take into account that kind of waste. 
Quite frankly, I must tell you that I think Secretary Cohen is doing a great job over there. And they are getting a better handle on this all the time. But there is still a long way to go. I think within the next year they could find some of that money and put that in veterans' benefits. 
Now, lastly, I say to the Senator, I would say that the question had to do with, are we not meeting the obligations? And I am saying, when you take into account medical inflation, which is higher than CPI, no, we are not meeting them.

Mr. HARKIN. I understand the responsibility that the Senator has. I understand that responsibility. And I appreciate that. But, again, as the Senator knows, others of us feel that we also have other obligations to try to change some things here and to change some of these budget priorities. 
In my opening comments, I said that our budget priorities are not allowing for this. I am trying to correct it. So I agree with the Senator. I do not like the way the budget priorities shortchange our veterans' medical benefits. But, again, I also say to my friend, I really believe in what the Vietnam Veterans of America said in their letter, that veterans' medical benefits ought to be considered an ongoing cost of military spending. They are not today. 
I have always thought that was odd. I have always thought that was an odd approach we had on that. And they ought to be considered as part and parcel of our military budget. That is why I have offered this amendment, to transfer a small amount of money out of the total--small compared to the total--at least to keep up with medical inflation.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution on behalf of myself, Senator Brownback and Senator Torricelli, which addresses a critical issue in South Asia. It calls for a peaceful and just settlement of the dispute over Kashmir. 
For the better part of half a century, Pakistan and India have had a territorial dispute involving the Jammu and Kashmir region--commonly referred to simply as Kashmir. Three times in the past 50 years, these two nations have fought against one another, two of these wars were over Kashmir. International security experts have long considered South Asia generally, and Kashmir specifically, a `nuclear flash point.' These longstanding tensions between Pakistan and India have only worsened with their testing of nuclear weapons last month. It is more important than ever to take a serious look at Pakistan-India relations. 
A peaceful resolution to the Kashmir dispute is not only in the interest of the peoples of South Asia, it is also in the interest of the United States. Our nation has had a long and important history with both countries. I think the United states is very aware of the dangers to our own national security, as well as the peace and security of the whole world, if the Kashmir dispute continues without resolution. 
Further, a peaceful resolution to this conflict would foster economic and social development of the Kashmir region, as well as the rest of South Asia. It would also curb many of the human rights abuses which continue despite the efforts by many international groups. 
As a world leader, we must take the initiative to help negotiate a peaceful and just end to the dispute in the Kashmir region that follows the wishes of those affected. And both the United States and the United Nations can play an important role in finding a resolution to the dispute over Kashmir, and in improving relations between Pakistan and India. While the Administration and the international community have taken several steps to address these problems, more action is required. 
This Senate resolution states that resolving the Kashmir dispute should be a top US priority, as well as that of the world community. Furthermore, this resolution asks our Ambassador to the United Nations to call a meeting of the Security Council with representatives from both India and Pakistan for the purpose of discussing security in South Asia. It also advises the Administration to raise the issue of Kashmir with the Security Council and promote the possibility of a UN sponsored mediator for the conflict. Finally, this resolution requests that the President ask the Indian government to allow UN human rights officials to visit the Kashmir region. 
I believe the resolution outlines some important next steps for the U.S. to help facilitate a reasonable and just solution to the Kashmir dispute and normalization of relations between India and Pakistan. It is time for the United States Government and the world to act in a productive manner that will help attain stability in South Asia. We cannot turn a blind eye to this long-standing conflict any longer and must seek a peaceful end to this dispute which not only benefits the countries involved, but will ultimately benefit the world. 
I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I hear all kinds of rumblings that the Republican side of the aisle, at some time today, is going to try to kill or will effectively kill the tobacco bill. I want to take a few minutes to talk about that and try to recap, if I can, why we are here and why we have spent so much time on the tobacco bill. 
Three thousand kids every day take up smoking; 1,000 of them will die prematurely. Teenage use of tobacco products is at a 17-year high. And 42.7 percent of high school kids are now using some form of tobacco products. Ninety-one percent of 3-year-olds in this country recognize Joe Camel, and recognize him in a friendly manner. And thanks to the court cases that we have had in several States, we now have the industry documents that reveal years and years and years of lying and deception by the tobacco companies. 
That is why we are here. That is why we have a tobacco bill--to put an end to teen smoking, to put an end to the lies and deceptions of the tobacco companies, to save kids' lives. 
The Republican leader was on the floor here a week and a half or so ago. I happened to be on the floor at the same time. And Senator Lott of Mississippi, why, he said, we have to remember what the end game is. Well, I got to the floor shortly after, and I said, yes, we do have to remember what the end game is. The end game is to put an end to what I just talked about and to reduce teen smoking. That is the end game. That is why we are here--to cut down on teen smoking. 
But Senators on the other side of the aisle here today, and in the past 4 weeks, have had another agenda. They have had tax cuts, drug money, and limits on attorneys' fees, et cetera, et cetera, and on and on. 
Let us look at the Record. On Friday, June 5, the majority leader, Senator Lott, said, and I quote, `If we don't add something on marriage penalty, tax relief, and on drugs, there won't be a bill. There will not be a bill.' In other words, the majority leader is saying, if we do not load a lot of stuff onto this bill--marriage penalty, tax relief, drugs--there will not be a bill. That is what he said on June 5. 
On June 7, on one of the talk shows, CNN's Sunday Night `Late Edition' interview with Wolf Blitzer, here is Senator Lott again, 2 days afterward: 
Instead of focusing on trying to get something constructive done, what we have now is game playing and rhetoric. What we need is leadership. 
Mr. Blitzer said, `When will there be a vote'--talking about the McCain bill. 
Senator Lott, 2 days before on June 5--Senator Lott had said, `. . . there won't be a bill until we add the marriage penalty, tax relief and drugs.' 
Now, two days later, Mr. Lott says: 
Well, at this point, it is dead in the water and there may never be a vote on the McCain bill. The problem is greed has set in. It is the usual addiction in Washington to taxes and spend. This has gone way beyond trying to do something about teenage smoking. This is now about money grubbing. This is about taxing people and spending on a myriad of programs. . ..We have lost our focus. 
What kind of brave new world are we living in around here? On June 5, the majority leader says there won't be a bill unless we load it up. Two days later, he says we have loaded the bill up, we can't have a bill because we have lost our focus, because it ought to be about teen smoking. 
Game playing. You want game playing? That is where the game playing is coming from. It is coming from the leadership in the Senate. That is where the game playing is coming from. 
I will say it loud and clear right here. The leadership has never wanted this bill, and they want to kill it. What we want--and I don't just mean Democrats, I mean a lot of Republicans, too, we want to put an end to teen smoking, and we want this bill. But, unfortunately, the Republican leadership and some on that side are going to try to make good on their threats to kill the bill. 
I understand the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, was on the floor a few minutes ago sort of crowing about killing the bill. Well, I hope those reports are wrong. I hope we have the bipartisan support to pass the bill. 
But it seems to me at this point in time the choice is very clear: You are either for tobacco company profits or you are for our kids. You are either for cutting down on the lies and deceptions of the tobacco companies, or you are for saving our kids' lives and keeping them from smoking. That is what it has come down to. Don't let anybody kid you. 
Now I heard the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, a while ago--I happened to be listening--talking about all the taxes, all the taxes the people are going to have to spend if we raise the price of cigarettes. I got to thinking about that. Guess what. Not one person in this country has to pay those taxes. What an interesting set of taxes--taxes you don't have to pay. If you don't smoke, you don't pay the taxes--simple as that. It doesn't tax everybody. You have the freedom to choose. If you want to pay the taxes, smoke; if you don't want to pay the taxes, don't smoke. Yet to listen to the other side talk about it, why, you would think that everyone in this country was going to have to pay taxes. Absolutely not true. Only if you want to smoke. Then you ought to be more than happy to help pay for those who get sick and to help do something about keeping teenagers from smoking. 
I don't think I yet have met one adult who has smoked a long time--10, 15, 20 years--I haven't met one yet who has said, `I would recommend a young person take up smoking.' I haven't met one yet. Every single one of them says, `Don't do what I did. Don't get in the habit. Don't become an addict like I am.' 
That is what this bill is about--keeping kids from becoming addicts, addicts every bit as bad as if they took up cocaine or heroin--nicotine addiction. And it is the gateway drug to the others. You want to cut down on marijuana? Cut down on teen smoking of cigarettes. You want to cut down on teen use of smoking crack? Cut down on their smoking cigarettes first. You want to 
cut down on kids who get into the drug culture? Go after cigarettes first. It is a gateway drug. It is a drug, make no mistake about it, and a highly addictive drug. And it just so happens to be legal. 
But we know from industry documents today that they have known for years that nicotine is addictive. They have known for years that it is carcinogenic. They have known for years about the medical costs of addiction to tobacco. Yet through all their advertising, they have lied about it. All this fancy advertising of Joe Camel and that rugged Marlboro Man on that horse and all these young people--do you ever see a tobacco ad that has a lot of old people hacking and smoking and spitting in it? No. All the tobacco ads have nice young people, and they are healthy, and they are vibrant. They look like they are having a great time, and if it weren't for tobacco, they probably wouldn't be having a great time. That is the kind of deception used by the tobacco companies. That is what we are trying to put an end to. 
Taxes? No one has to pay these taxes. I see the Senator from Kentucky is on the floor. No one has to pay these taxes, not one single person, if they choose not to smoke. But if they do, then, yes, we want you to pay more for cigarettes, because we want to use that money to stop kids from smoking, which is what you want, too. 
Every adult I have known who is addicted to nicotine says kids shouldn't take it up. But these tobacco companies will continue to hook kids because they know that is their replacement smoker. They know that 90 percent of adult smokers who are hooked on nicotine start smoking before the age of 18. If they don't start smoking by that time, chances are they will never take it up and become addicted. That is why we are here. That is the end game--to keep our kids from smoking. 
Killing this bill is a death sentence for millions of kids. Killing this bill would be a historic cave-in to the special interests of this country. It would be a historic cave-in to the $40 million in deceptive ads that the tobacco companies have put out across this land over the last month. It would be a historic cave-in to an industry that has deceived and lied to the American people for the last half century. 
Make no mistake about it, tobacco executives and all of their PAC directors who have all of that money to start giving out to campaigns, they are watching. They are watching, and they are rubbing their hands together, and they are saying, `Oh, boy, they are going to kill that tobacco bill.' And they are going to know who their friends are. They are going to know who their friends are--the ones who killed this bill. And I am sure they will be helpful to their friends. 
Well, I hope we can send a message to our kids that these well-funded special interests, no matter what they have done and how much money they have spent, that they can't win today, that they can't win in this body, that this body still represents the rank and file of American people and not just those with a lot of money and a lot of power. 
If the Republican leadership and those on that side kill this bill today, we will be back, time and time and time again. We will be back. We will be back with amendment after amendment after amendment on bills that come up to this floor. We will not back down. We have come too far to rein in the tobacco companies, we have come too far to stop our kids from smoking, to back off now. 
If the Republican leadership and the Republicans succeed in killing this bill today, it might be the end of the debate on the tobacco bill, but it will not be the end of tobacco debate on the Senate floor and it will not be the end of amendments and bills that we will bring up to try to get to the end game to keep our teenagers from smoking. 
If the Republican leadership succeeds in killing this bill, I predict that there will be a major public backlash--a major public backlash. Why do I say that? A little bit of history. 
Last year, about this time--actually toward the end of July--Senator Chafee, a Republican, and I, a Democrat, offered an amendment on the floor of the Senate to provide the necessary money to the FDA to enforce the ID checks in stores and outlets, wherever cigarettes were sold across the country. We offered the amendment and we had a vote. We lost. That was in July. Well, I used a parliamentary maneuver to ensure that we could have one more vote on it when we came back after the August recess of last year. So I filed my parliamentary appeal on that. We broke here in August and we went home. 
We came back in September, and the first vote we had when we came back in September was the same vote of Senator Chafee and Senator Harkin on providing the money to the FDA for the ID checks--the same vote that had lost in July. Guess what. This time it carried overwhelmingly. I submit that a large part of that was because a lot of people went home in August and a lot of the groups--I am talking about all of the public health groups, such as the American Heart Association, The Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, and a host of others--got to people and said, wait a minute, we want to enforce these ID checks. We don't want young people buying cigarettes and tobacco products. There was a public backlash. I predict the same thing will happen if this bill is killed today. 
Despite over $40 million in ads that have dominated the airwaves over the last month by the tobacco companies--despite all that--the public still supports this bill by over 2 to 1. This was a survey taken June 12 through June 15 by Market Facts TeleNation, an independent polling firm, of 924 adults. Margin of error, plus or minus, is 3.2 percent. 
The question was:  
As you may know, the Congress is currently considering the McCain tobacco bill, which creates a national tobacco policy to reduce tobacco use among kids. Based on what you know about the bill, do you favor or oppose Congress passing the McCain bill? 
Those who favored, 62 percent; opposed, 31 percent. 
That was June 12 to June 15. This is the 17th, so that was earlier this week. That is after $40 million was spent by the tobacco companies to persuade the public that what we are doing is raising these huge taxes and spending all of their money on a variety of nonsense programs. I am sure we have all seen the ads. How can you miss them? Turn on the TV and there is another ad. And still, through it all, the American people are seeing through it. They have caught on to the tobacco companies. They know they have been lying to them for 50 years. Ask any older adult today--I am talking about somebody in their sixties, seventies, or eighties--who has been addicted to nicotine. Ask them if they believe the tobacco companies told them the truth 30 or 40 years ago when they took up tobacco. They know the tobacco companies lied to them through their slick advertising, ads that show doctors smoking and nurses smoking, and all kinds of things, saying that Camels were better for your throat than other cigarettes. Still, the American people, 2 to 1, want this bill. 
That is why I predict that if this bill is killed, there is going to be a tremendous public backlash. The public is going to know who killed this bill: the Republican leadership in the U.S. Senate. Make no mistake about it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I agree with the previous speaker. There have been a lot of things not making sense. On Friday, June 5, the majority leader said, `If we don't add something on the marriage penalty, tax relief, and on drugs, there will not be a bill.' Two days later, he said, `This has gone way beyond trying to do something about teenage smoking. Greed has set in. This is about money grubbing; it's about taxing people and spending on a myriad of programs. We have lost our focus.' 
That was the same person--in 2 days, two different things. Yes, there has been a lot of confusion around here on this bill. I think it is very clear. If this bill goes down today, Joe Camel wins, and our kids lose--3,000 a day will lose, and Joe Camel wins.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, most Americans are very familiar with Head Start. This popular preschool program was created in 1965 to provide health, nutrition and educational assistance to low-income four and five year old children. Head Start enjoys strong bipartisan support and is widely recognized as a success. 
In response to the growing body of research about the critical development which occurs during the first three years of a child's life, Head Start has been expanded in recent years to also serve infants and toddlers. The Early Head Start Program provides comprehensive child development and family support services to families with infants and toddlers from birth through age three and currently receives 5% of Head Start funding. An estimated 39,000 children currently receive services nationwide. In Iowa, 533 children are served by Early Head Start. 
However, these children and families represent only a fraction of those that need and could benefit from these activities. As a result, today I am introducing legislation that would increase the set-aside to 10% in 2002--to double the number of participants. 
There were many exciting developments last year with respect to the education of young children. Science confirmed what many of us have believed for years--that the first three years of a child's life are the most important. We discovered that young children have unlimited potential to learn many things during this critical time. We learned how important it is for parents to read to their young children, talk with them and stimulate learning through play. We also learned that children who do not have enriched learning experiences during these important years can be stunted for life. 
Last year, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations subcommittee, of which I am the ranking Democrat, held a hearing focused on the importance of early intervention activities. We heard compelling testimony on the benefits of providing support for early education and development activities. The President and First Lady also convened historic conferences to discuss early childhood education and child care and a public campaign was launched to spread the word to parents. 
Throughout the year, the message was always the same--we must make investments in early intervention programs a national priority. This is the right thing to do for the young children of our nation, but it is also the most cost-effective thing for us to do. Every dollar invested in quality pre-school programs saves $7 in future costs for special education, welfare or corrections. 
In 1991, the Committee for Economic Development called on the nation to rethink how we view education. This group of business leaders urged federal policy makers to view education as a process that begins at birth, with preparations beginning before birth. I strongly support this objective and have always been a strong advocate in early intervention activities such as Head Start, the WIC nutrition program and early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities. 
We must dedicate ourselves to making the CED vision a reality and build a strong foundation for education in this country. That begins with ensuring that all children get off to a good, strong start and enter school ready to learn. 
Last year, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations subcommittee made investments in early intervention a priority at my request. The FY 1998 appropriations bill invested an additional $64 million in Early Head Start, an increase of 75%, and provided an 11% increase in the early intervention program for infants and toddlers with disabilities. 
The legislation I am introducing today takes another step toward building this foundation by doubling the set-aside for the Early Head Start Program for children ages 0-3 by the year 2002. This action will continue to improve access to education and development services for our youngest children to provide a good start in life. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, at the request of the Clinton Administration, the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Amendments of 1998. I am grateful to be joined in the introduction of this bill by Senator Leahy, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Research, Nutrition, and General Legislation, and by Senator Johnson. In my years serving on the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and now as its Ranking Member, I have always placed a very high value on the child nutrition programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). These programs have been critical in helping to meet the nutritional needs of millions of our nation's children. 
This bill is the first child nutrition reauthorization bill sent to Congress by an Administration in two decades. It is a very commendable effort, with many positive features, that we will be relying upon substantially as we fashion a child nutrition bill in the coming weeks in the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and ultimately in conference. In addition to reauthorizing those programs that are expiring, the bill makes a number of improvements throughout the child nutrition programs. It is designed to be cost-neutral over the next five years, to simplify and streamline program operations, to reduce impediments to participation by eligible individuals, to reach certain children needing additional nutritional assistance, to strengthen program integrity and to enhance the nutrition provided by the programs. 
Earlier this year, I joined Chairman Lugar, Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy in introducing a measure, S. 1581, that would simply reauthorize the child nutrition programs for the next five years. That bill was recognized as a starting point for a careful review of the child nutrition programs leading to the development of a sound, well-crafted and bipartisan reauthorization bill. I believe there is broad support for improving and modifying these programs to meet changing needs and demands within the overall spending limitations that we are committed to working within. 
One of the more important features of the bill is new authority for nutrition assistance in after-school programs through the Child and Adult Care Food Program for at risk youths between the ages of 12 and 18. We know too well that the hours just after school are full of opportunities for teenagers to get into trouble, whether it involves crime, drug use or teen pregnancy. The availability of nutrition assistance can help to support organized after-school activities that are healthy and constructive alternatives to what might otherwise occur in those risky after-school hours. 
There are also provisions in the bill designed to improve the nutrition provided by the programs, including an emphasis on establishing adequate time for kids to eat school lunches in an atmosphere conducive to good nutrition and an authorization of Nutrition Education and Training grants based on $0.50 a child each year with a minimum of $75,000 per state. 
There are also provisions in the bill to improve access to the Summer Food Service Program by increasing the number of sites and the number of children that can be served by non-profit sponsors. Statistics continue to show that far fewer low income children are served in the Summer Food Service Program than during the school year in the National School Lunch Program, especially in rural areas. The provisions in this bill are designed to help address this gap. 
The bill also reauthorizes the WIC Program. Under Secretary Shirley Watkins was absolutely correct when she said at a recent Agriculture Committee Hearing that, `WIC works.' No other Federal-state program has the proven cost-effectiveness of WIC, which has been shown in study after study. This bill is designed to build upon the success of the current WIC program with improvements in program management and integrity. 
While I support a very high proportion of the provisions of this bill, I do not necessarily support every detail of it. I will also mention some of the areas in which I hope the final bill will take more substantial steps than are included in this bill. In my view, more should be done to increase participation in the School Breakfast Program, especially among low-income children, and in the Summer Food Service Program. I would also prefer further strengthening of after-school and child care nutrition assistance. And additional steps should be taken to improve integrity and accountability in the WIC program while continuing the progress toward full participation. 
I look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues, the Administration and the entire child nutrition community, to design a final bill having broad bipartisan support. 
I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in full in the Record.

Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield for a question? I compliment the Senator on his outstanding statement and thank him for all of his diligence and hard work on the whole issue of cutting down on teen smoking. I know the Senator from Florida has made that one of his key principles, which is in this bill. Really, the essence of this bill is to cut down on teen smoking. I appreciate all of the work he has done, and with Senator Chafee and with me on this. 
I know Senator Chafee will be speaking next. We hope to engage in some colloquy here on the Senate floor to talk about some of the issues that have come up that are extraneous--important issues, but extraneous to the bill. 
I just want to basically ask the Senator from Florida--before I know Senator Chafee will make his opening statement--about that aspect, about the other issues that seem to be coming up on this bill and whether or not we could address those later on and just keep the focus on the main issue here.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened with interest and great attention to the words spoken by the majority leader. He used the phrase, `Let's keep in mind the end game.' I go back to what my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, and Senator Chafee just spoke about before the two leaders took the floor. What is the `end game'? It is right here. This is the end game. The number of high school students smoking is going up at a precipitous rate, higher than ever. The end game of this bill is to cut down on teenage smoking. That is the end game. 
The majority leader says if there is no marriage penalty tax in there and no illegal drug money, then there is going to be no bill. I hope I still have some rational reasoning power. I have to ask, Why? Why is that? The majority leader didn't expound on why that would be. You mean to say that we are holding these teenagers being addicted every day--3,000 teenagers every day being addicted to tobacco--hostage to the marriage penalty tax provision or illegal drug money? Holding them hostage? Yet, the majority leader says there will be no bill unless we have this. I don't understand that. The committee-reported bill didn't have them in it. The committee-reported bill that was reported out by a huge vote under the leadership of Senator McCain didn't have that in it. 
And the majority leader went on to say--I don't understand where he is getting his figures--that we are going to have money for research, we will have money for cutting down teenage smoking. I don't know where he is going to get the money. Look, I am using the same chart that Senator Chafee used just a minute ago. Here is the original McCain bill: $65 billion over 5 years for public health, NIH, health research, States, and agriculture. Add it up--$65 billion. If we keep the States at $26 billion, we keep agriculture, we add in illegal drugs, the Coverdell amendment, the marriage penalty, and veterans, we are up to $65 billion, and we have no money for NIH and no money for public health, period. 
Does the majority leader mean to say that he is going to bring another bill on the floor to magically find some money floating around someplace for NIH research and for public health for cutting down on teen smoking? I am sorry. The facts are simple. 
If you put in the $15 billion on the illegal drugs, the $15 billion on the marriage penalty, the veterans' $3 billion, agriculture $18 billion, you can forget about public health and NIH. There is no money left, unless, of course, the majority leader is going to come back on the floor with a provision to raise the price of tobacco to even more than $1.10 a pack. Maybe the majority leader would like to raise the price of cigarettes to $1.50 a pack or $2 a pack. That might get you the money. But with the $1.10 a pack you have in there now, you are not going to have the money, period. 
So I just do not understand what the majority leader can possibly be talking about and where he could possibly be finding all of this money that he is going to have. 
The majority leader said he was offended. Enough happens around here to offend each and every one of us every single day of the year, I suppose. But I have learned after 13 years here--14, I guess--that you can't be too offended too much by what goes on around here. 
I guess you have to look at the reality of the situation, and the reality is very simple. There are those in this body who do not want a tobacco bill, period. They do not want the tobacco companies to have to shell out this money. They don't want to have a bill that will provide for an increase in the price of cigarettes per pack. That is legitimate. That is their viewpoint. They are welcome to it. They can defend it all they want. Maybe they have good reasons they can defend it. But that is the reality of the situation. 
For example, the Senator from Texas, I believe, propounded the amendment on the marriage penalty tax, doing away with that. I believe--I think I am correct--that he even said if this amendment was adopted he would still vote against the bill. 
So what kind of games are being played around here? I don't take offense at that; I just simply point it out for the reality of the situation. The reality is that we have a battle going on on this Senate floor, a big battle, and it is a battle between those who want to stop 3,000 kids a day from starting to smoke, 1,000 who will die from it, and those who say business as usual; the tobacco companies, that is OK; let them go ahead; it is a legal product. 
We don't have to do anything to them. And if we just add all these amendments on, it is going to fall of its own weight. 
That is the game being played around here. It's a game that is played all the time. That is just sort of the way the Senate operates. What I guess we have to do is continually point out what is in fact being done. 
Now, let's talk about at least illegal drugs. We all want to stop illegal drugs. I have been here 13 years, 14 now. It seems like every year we have a bill to do something about illegal drugs: We are going to beef up the Border Patrol; we are going to raise the penalties; we are going to have mandatory sentencing. Year after year after year we go after illegal drugs because it makes nice headlines and we know that 100 percent of the American people are against it so it is kind of an easy thing. It makes you feel good. You can hit at illegal drugs. It gets popular support. It gets in the newspapers. That's all well and good. 
But, Mr. President, what are we talking about? When you are talking about death and illness to the youth of America, illegal drugs doesn't hold a candle to tobacco. And here are the figures. I welcome anyone to dispute the findings by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If someone would like to take the Senate floor and dispute this, please let me see the data you have. But the data we have from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, `Tobacco kills more Americans than alcohol, car accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs and fires combined' every year. Here is tobacco over here: 418,000 deaths in 1 year. Here is illegal drugs, 9,463. What's important? Year after year we come here going after illegal drugs, and we let the biggest killer and destruction of youth in America go by--tobacco. Let it go by every year. And we are about to do the same right here by loading on all these amendments. 
Now, the marriage penalty needs addressing. I think I would agree with others who have said it before, yes, it needs to be addressed. Yes, it is an unfair tax. But we are going to have a tax bill later this year. It is not going to take effect until next year anyway. Address it at that time. 
Illegal drugs, we can address that at another time. Keep our eye on what the majority leader said, `the end game.' Is the end game of this bill to go after homicides or illegal drugs? No. It is go after tobacco. That is the end game. And the end game is to make sure that we have the money to fight it. 
That is what this is all about. It is not just about getting tobacco companies to put a lot of money into the Federal Government. If that is all that was happening, I would be opposed to it. What it is about is saying to the tobacco companies you have for years through your advertising, through covering up the health risks, you have for years hooked a whole generation of Americans on tobacco. You know that it is carcinogenic. You know that nicotine is addictive. You know that it causes emphysema and cancer and heart disease. And yet through your slick advertising year after year you hook more young Americans. 
We know what the tobacco companies have known for years, that smoking begins early, that by age 18, 89 percent of all adult smokers have started smoking. We know that. Tobacco companies know that. Oh, they have said for years, no, no, we advertise for brand selection, to get people off of one brand and onto another. Hogwash. They know that if they can hook 
someone when they are young, they have them later on. 
As I have said many times, Joe Camel never appealed to me. Joe Camel does not appeal to someone my age. Neither do all these slick advertisements of young people on the beach and having a lot of fun and they are all looking healthy and they are out there. They don't appeal to older people. The Marlboro gear that you can get with your coupons, that doesn't appeal to older people. They are after young people. How many older people do you see wearing the Joe Camel beach togs. You don't see that. How many older people do you see wearing Marlboro gear. You see teenagers wearing it but not older people. 
The tobacco companies systematically for years have been targeting young people because they knew if they got them hooked young, they got them later on. 
What we are saying today is no, tobacco companies, don't dump a lot of money into the Federal Government so we can take care of the marriage penalty, illegal drugs, this and that. We are saying, we are telling you that you are going to have to pay money in so that we can put the money out for public health, to help take care of those people you hooked years ago, to bring money in so we can put it into NIH on research, so we can put money into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on research on how to cut down on smoking, how to keep kids from smoking, have smoking cessation programs and prevention programs in all of our schools. 
That is what we are after right here. NIH Health Research. End game: NIH health research, smoking cessation programs, smoking prevention and education in our schools, counter advertising, which we know is very effective and which the tobacco companies probably dread more than anything else, antismuggling, and youth access restrictions. 
This is the comprehensive bill that we are talking about. You add in the add-ons that are now before us and all of this is gone. Every single one of these is gone because you don't have the money for them unless again can someone please get on the floor and tell me where are we going to find the money if in fact we adopt all of these extraneous provisions. 
So that is what the end game is about. It is saying to the tobacco companies it is time for you to cough up, cough up enough money to take care of those you have addicted through your advertising and that you did not warn about the health aspects even though you knew what the health aspects were going to be. It is time for you to cough up enough money for research in heart disease and lung cancer and emphysema and all the illnesses that tobacco plagues us with. It is time for you to cough up enough money so we can go out to our schools and we can have prevention programs and education programs for our kids. It is time for you, tobacco companies, to cough up enough money so we can have counter advertising, not the slick ads that tell you how good smoking is but ads that really tell you how death and illness will occur if you do in fact take up smoking. 
That is what this money is all about. It is not about the marriage penalty or illegal drugs or anything else. It is about taking care of the youth of America who have been hooked on tobacco. For the life of me, I don't understand why it is the majority leader can say that if these add-ons are not adopted, the tobacco bill is dead. I would like to see a vote out on the Senate floor. I think we ought to vote on the amendment by the Senator from Texas on the marriage penalty. Let's vote it up or down. Let's vote on all these amendments. Let's just vote on them. And then let's have a final vote on this bill and see where we come down. Let's cut out the games. Let's cut out all this game playing. 
I bet the tobacco industry CEO's today, Mr. President, are slapping each other on the back and they are laughing all the way to the bank, gleefully watching us hack away at the programs designed to prevent young people from smoking and to help those smokers quit who have already taken it up. 
They must be really happy watching us go through all of this when they know that tobacco is the biggest killer of youth. 
This is the end game right here. This is the end game. I have used this chart before on the floor. Two young, attractive women coming in to buy cigarettes. Which one is 16? You don't know. You don't know which one is 16. Melissa and Amy--it turns out Melissa is 16 and Amy is 25. 
We want to keep Melissa from taking up tobacco, and if Amy has taken it up, we want her to quit. That is what the end game here is all about. It is not about marriage penalty or anything else. To those who say it is, to those who say, as the majority leader said, that if we don't have these extraneous measures on here the bill is going to die, I say, come out and explain to the American people why it is we had a bill reported from the Commerce Committee under the leadership of Senator McCain that came out with one dissenting vote, out of committee, and we cannot have a vote on that bill here on the Senate floor; why it is we are going to have all these extraneous measures, and they have to be adopted, according to the majority leader, or the bill will not pass? These were not in the committee bill, and it passed out of committee with only one dissenting vote. 
So, I don't know what the majority leader is talking about, unless what the majority leader is talking about is that he really wants this bill killed, that he wants no tobacco bill, that he wants to load it down with a number of amendments that will surely mean the end of any tobacco legislation this year. 
I hope that is not the case. As I said, I do not know what the majority leader had in mind. All he said was if these amendments are not adopted, the bill is dead. I don't know what he means by that. Hopefully, in the coming days, he will explain himself further in that regard. 
Mr. President, our charge is clear and simple here. Our charge is only one--cut teen smoking. We know what does it. The Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, spoke about it. It has to be a comprehensive bill encompassing a rapid and significant increase in the price of tobacco; and, second, smoking cessation and education programs, research, and counteradvertising. If you do all of those, you will cut teen smoking. You can save those lives. You will save a lot of illness in America. That is what we have to be about. 
Senator Chafee and Senator Graham and I have worked very hard on this legislation in a bipartisan manner going back several months. I think we can still, hopefully, have a good bipartisan bill come out. The committee bill was bipartisan. I am sorry to see that we have gotten now into this partisan wrangling over the marriage penalty, or motions, cloture motions and things like that. I think our leader, Senator Daschle, had it right. We ought to have one set of rules and we ought to abide by those rules. Whatever those rules are for one bill, we ought to attach them to the other bill. 
I think the best course of action for us here is to vote on these amendments, move on, and vote on final passage. Let's exercise the Senate's will. We have been on the bill long enough. Hopefully, we can finish it next week. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on June 30, 1998, Alfred Healy, M.D., professor emeritus of pediatrics and special education at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, Iowa will conclude a distinguished 41-year career of clinical service, teaching, research, and administration of innovative programs supporting individuals with developmental disabilities. His career at the University of Iowa includes 21 years of directing three entities: the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Pediatrics, the University Hospital School of the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, and the Iowa University Affiliated Program. He also provided leadership to numerous national and international programs promoting the independence, productivity, and community inclusion of people with disabilities. 
Dr. Healy gained firsthand knowledge of physical disabilities as a young teenager, during his recovery from two prolonged episodes of rheumatic fever that later severely restricted his participation in sports and other physical activities. Seeking other ways to participate in athletics, he earned his bachelor's degree in physical education in 1956 from the University of Notre Dame while concurrently serving as Assistant Athletic Trainer for all Notre Dame athletic teams.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was listening to the debate on the House floor. They are debating the agricultural bill which has the food stamp provision and the crop insurance in it. There is an amendment pending over there that would strip out the food stamps. 
The reason I want to take this time on the floor is because I heard some comments made on the House floor that they could pass that by the conference report, strip out the food stamps, send it over to the Senate, and we would pass it today and they could send it down to the President. 
I want Members to know right now we had a vote here, 92-8, on that bill to keep the food stamps for immigrants, to keep the crop insurance and the agriculture research altogether. In fact, there was a 77-23 vote on a Gramm of Texas motion to recommit--77-23. 
Let me make another statement, Mr. President. If that action takes place in the House, I can see no way that ISTEA could ever be passed here this afternoon before we go home on break.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are engaged in a historic debate and action on a plant that brought death and disease to millions of people in this country for 300 years. The outcome of our work will determine whether this nation moves to a sensible tobacco policy that will prevent the premature death of millions of our children or continues on the path of death and disease. 
This is truly a historic, once in a lifetime opportunity to save lives and protect children. When else have we had legislation before us that truly could save millions of American lives? It is an opportunity I've been working towards since 1977 when I first introduced legislation to end taxpayer subsidies to tobacco advertising. 
The need for bold action couldn't be clearer. Today, as in any other day, 3,000 children in America will take up a deadly habit that will cut 1,000 of their lives unnecessarily short. That's more than 3 jumbo jets full of children crashing every day. And the problem is getting worse. Smoking among high school seniors is at a 17-year high. 
It is not reflected in this chart, but the CDC just reported that the percentage of high school students who smoke has increased from 27.5 percent in 1991 to 36.4 percent in 1997. They further found that a shocking 42.7 percent of students--and these are kids generally between 14 and 17--used cigarettes, smokeless tobacco or cigars in the past 30 days. We also know that the vast majority--fully 90 percent--of adult and lifelong smokers begin at or before their 18th birthday. 
We can change all that. We know the key ingredients to reducing teen smoking. We know that a comprehensive set of reforms is needed. We need solid authority and resources for the FDA to oversee tobacco products. We need an aggressive education and counter advertising effort. We need community-based prevention. We need to expand our research. We need to have strong financial incentives for tobacco companies to take every action to cut teen smoking. And, most importantly, we need to price cigarettes out of the range of children. 
Every major public health expert agrees that the single most important component of a comprehensive strategy to cut child smoking is a sudden and significant price increase. This is the centerpiece of S. 1889, the KIDS Act, I introduced with Senator John Chafee and Senator Bob Graham. Our bipartisan legislation provides for a $1.50 increase in the per pack price of cigarettes--$1.00 the first year and another 50 cents the next. 
As Dr. C. Everett Koop and Dr. David Kessler said, this proposal is `tough medicine for a tough problem.' 
Our approach, according to the CDC and other experts, would cut smoking by children in half, over the next three years. That's the sharpest and fastest reduction achieved by any bill proposed to date. 
The bill before us, as reported out of the Commerce Committee, has a number of commendable features. In many ways it is very similar to the Harkin-Chafee-Graham KIDS Act. It has strong FDA provisions, strong public health provisions and its look-back and liability provisions have been substantially improved. We are very pleased that much of our work is reflected in the bill and we commend Senator McCain for his good efforts. 
However, on the crucial question of price, the bill is inadequate. The bill would increase the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over 5 years. To have the greatest impact on teen smoking the price should be increased by at least $1.50 a pack over a very short period of time. 
I will be doing everything, working with my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, to correct this fundamental shortcoming of the pending measure. 
While I'll have a lot more to say about many aspects of this legislation, I want to focus the remainder of my remarks today on this critical issue of price. I do this not only because it is the most important feature of the legislation, but because it has been the focus of an onslaught of misleading television, radio and print ads as well as statements and mailings by the tobacco industry in my state of Iowa and around the nation. 
The tobacco companies have been making a number of false arguments about the impact of increasing the price to cut down on teen smoking. Most disturbing have been their statements that teens don't respond to price increases--that increasing the price won't have an effect on the rates of underage smoking. 
These accusations are not only run counter to the finding of every major public health organization and countless economists and studies, they contradict the industry's own internal documents and analyses that they tried to hide from the American people for so long. 
Many studies published in respected journals have clearly documented the impact of price increases on teen smoking. The most recent estimates from the CDC is that for every 10 percent increase in the real price of cigarettes, the prevalence of teen smoking is cut by 7%. 
In its report this year, Taking Action to Reduce Tobacco Use, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that `the single most direct and reliable method for reducing consumption is to increase the price of tobacco products. . . .' 
In 1994, the Surgeon General's report Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People concluded that increases in the real price of cigarettes significantly reduces cigarette smoking and that young people are at least as price sensitive as adults. 
And we have to look no further than our neighbors to the north--Canada--to find a real world example of the impact of price increases on teen smoking. As this table shows (attached) when real prices in Canada increased from $2.09 to $5.42, the number of 15-19 year olds smoking fell from 42 percent to 16 percent--a drop of 62 percent. However, when tobacco taxes were reduced, youth smoking began increasing after 15 years of decline. 
As I said earlier, in addition to the abundant evidence on youth smoking and price, the tobacco industry themselves have admitted this in a number of their internal documents. For example, a 1981 Philip Morris document said, `In any event, and for whatever reason, it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers. . . .' 
A 1987 Philip Morris document further details their knowledge and concern about the relationship to price and hooking kids as the next generation of smokers. The document says:  
You may recall from the article I sent you that Jeffrey Harris at MIT calculated, on the basis of Lewit and Coate data, that the 1982-83 round of price increases caused two million adults to quit smoking and prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. Those teenagers are now 18-21 year olds . . ., 420,000 of the non-starters would have been PM smokers. Thus, if Harris is right, we were hit disproportionately hard. We don't need to have that happen again.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of Members of Congress and the country a young constituent of mine. 
Some of you may have read about Timothy Cordes in Monday's Washington Post. For those of you who didn't, Tim--who is from Eldridge, Iowa--just received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from Notre Dame, with a 3.99 grade point average. Tim was the valedictorian of his class and will begin medical school at the University of Wisconsin this summer. These would be outstanding accomplishments for any young person. They are especially remarkable in this case, because Tim is blind--only the second blind person ever admitted to a U.S. medical school. 
Tim has a genetic condition that gradually diminished his vision until he was blind when he was 14. Doctors diagnosed him with the disease when he was two. They talked about how blindness would limit Tim's life. But his parents wouldn't accept that for their son. His mother said that after talking with the doctors, `I went home and just ignored everything they said.' Thank goodness for that! 
I have spent much of my time in the Senate working toward a society in which all Americans, those with disabilities and those without, have the same opportunities to succeed.That's what all people with disabilities want--an equal opportunity to succeed. Some will succeed and some won't, but it will be because of their abilities, not their disabilities. Tim personifies the fact that when society accommodates people with disabilities to allow them to reach their full potential, we all benefit. 
At Notre Dame, Tim overcame his blindness by asking fellow students to describe the molecular structures they were studying and by using his computer to re-create the images in three-dimensional forms on a special monitor he could touch. In addition to his academic achievements, Tim earned a black belt in tae kwon do and jujitsu, went to football games and debated with this friends whether the old or new `Star Trek' is better. 
Tim's biochemistry professor called him a remarkable young man and the most brilliant student he's ever had. One of Tim's roommates said that he was `simply amazing to be around.' 
Tim doesn't mind being an inspiration to others, but he doesn't think of himself that way. In his words, `[i]t was just hard work.' Well, that's for sure! 
For my part, I am honored to represent Tim and his parents and to be able to take this time to congratulate him and his parents for all their great work. Congratulations!

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to take just a little bit of time this morning to again alert Senators and others about troubling new developments in South Asia after India thumbed its nose at the world community and exploded five underground nuclear weapons. Conditions seem to be spiraling out of control in the nation of India. We now see that a key Indian official, according to the news this morning, a key Indian official is warning Pakistan and making very threatening, provocative statements, about the area that we know as Jammu-Kashmir. Indian Home Minister Advani--there is a picture of him here clenching his fist, saying they were, basically, not going to have a peaceful resolution at all of the situation in Kashmir. I am quoting from the article: 
While India's previous government had a policy of not making hostile statements about Pakistan, the BJP [that is the party that is now in power in India] as recently as two years ago advocated `reclaiming' Pakistan's portion of Kashmir. 
It is interesting that: 
In the course [it says here] of broadening its platforms for this year's parliamentary elections--and cobbling together a coalition government of 14 disparate parties--such references to Kashmir were dropped. But Advani [the Home Minister] was pointed in his reference today to the disputed state, although he couched it more in terms of Pakistan's stance toward Kashmir than India's. 
But now Advani said, and I quote from the article: 
[Nuclear weapons tests] has brought about a qualitatively new stage in Indo-Pakistan relations and signifies--even while adhering to the principle of no first strike--[that] India is resolved to deal firmly with Pakistan's hostile activities in Kashmir. 
Wait a minute, Mr. President. He is talking about Pakistan's hostile activities in Kashmir? It is India that has around 300,000 troops in Kashmir. It is India that is spending about a large portion of its military budget every year in Kashmir. It is by Indian troops that human rights groups have said that in the last several years, perhaps in the last 10 years, upwards of 13,000 people have been killed in Kashmir--not by Pakistani troops, but by Indian troops. 
What this Home Minister Advani is doing is trying to cover what India has done in Kashmir by blaming it on Pakistan. 
Quite frankly, Kashmir is the East Timor of South Asia, to those of us who have followed the problems of East Timor, a tiny little island nation on the eastern tip of Indonesia. It was a Portuguese colony for several hundred years. When the Portuguese left, the Indonesians came in to claim East Timor, but they have no rightful claim to it; it is a separate island nation. 
Since that time, East Timorese have been put to death by the Indonesians, slaughtered, people driven out of their homes, driven out of their jobs. What has happened in East Timor is a blight on Indonesia, and the world community has spoken out forcefully against what Indonesia has done in East Timor. But the world community is standing silently by while the same kind of slaughter and repression is occurring in the tiny state of Kashmir. 
If you go back to when India and Pakistan were partitioned off, this tiny area up in northwest India on the border of Pakistan and India, the United Nations recognized in the late 1940s that this issue needed to be resolved, and urged for it to be resolved through a plebiscite, to have a vote of the people in this area: Did they want to stay with Pakistan, or did they want to go with India? 
But India refuses outside mediation, even from the UN. I had always hoped, as many have hoped, that we would have some kind of a peaceful resolution of Kashmir. But now India is shaking its fist at Pakistan and speaking provocatively of reclaiming certain areas of Kashmir that have already been recognized as being at least an adjunct to, adhering to Pakistan, an area called Azad Kashmir. 
Mr. President, I don't think we can idly stand by and let India continue these kinds of provocative measures. The world community must speak with one voice in condemning the actions by India with strong sanctions. I will have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I hope we can bring up sometime this week in conjunction with others, dealing with the Indian explosion of nuclear weapons and dealing with the Pressler amendment that Senator Brownback and I will be offering sometime this week, I hope. 
I have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling upon the United States to take the lead in getting other nations together to act as an intermediary in the dispute on Kashmir. Better that we act now, better that we try to seek peaceful resolutions of Kashmir before this whole thing blows up, before the BJP of India is able to take it to a higher level, a more provocative level that would involve the use of arms. 
I hope we can get the support of other Senators in asking the United States to act as a mediator to this very dangerous situation that now exists in Kashmir and South Asia. 
I thank the President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. I have spoken with the author of the pending amendment, and I am very supportive of Senator Hutchinson's amendment. This is a friendly amendment, which he accepts. My amendment does not in any way change the intent of the Hutchinson amendment nor does it add any more money. 
Basically, this amendment reflects the intent of Congress to include forced and indentured child labor in the interpretation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. 
The Congress spoke with one voice when it instructed the U.S. Customs Service to block from entry into the United States any imports made by forced or indentured child labor, as they are inherently for imports made with forced and indentured labor. 
This clarification of congressional intent was part of the fiscal year 1998 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill which the President has signed into law. So, again, this amendment does not change anything really of the Hutchinson amendment. It simply adds forced and indentured child labor as part of the amendment. 
As I said, it preserves the congressional intent passed last year. The U.S. Customs Service will still be able to aggressively pursue items made with convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor, and prevent them from reaching our shores. They should rightly do so. That is why I am supportive of the Hutchinson amendment. 
Again, the reason this is necessary is a little over a year ago--actually about 2 years ago now--I contacted the Treasury Department to ask if section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 covered forced and indentured child labor. 
I got a letter back saying, well, they did not know. They needed clarification. Last year, under the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, we provided that clarification that it indeed covered forced and indentured child labor. And that is what my amendment does here; it just adds those words back in there. 
And, again, it should be added because in many cases these children are like slaves. They are sold, maybe sometimes for an outstanding debt that is owed to a family. They are traded like cattle. Typically what happens is, a child is sold into a factory or plant as a payment for an outstanding debt. The middle man, a loan shark, transfers the child to a work setting far away from his home. And these kids literally work as virtual slaves 
doing anything from making rugs to soccer balls to serving as prostitutes, to breaking bricks or mining granite or making glassware. Many times these kids are never released from their bondage until they get too old to do the work. They are punished severely; a lot of times they work 12 to 15 hours a day. 
Mr. President, last year I visited a place out of New Delhi called the Muki Ashram, or `liberation retreat' established in 1991 by Kailash Satiyarti, president of the South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude, located right outside of New Delhi, a place where bonded child laborers are freed from the shackles of slavery. They are brought there, they are rehabilitated, they are able to go to school, learn a trade and regain their sense of self-worth. I was deeply moved by this establishment. 
I saw somewhere between 50 and 100 kids who were there, many as young as 8 years of age, many of whom had been beaten. I saw kids that had marks still on their face and their arms where they had been burned with red-hot pokers and things like that. These kids were now being taught in a school, provided nutrition. As I said, they get their sense of self-worth back.

I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Hutchinson amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take a little time again today to talk about the perilous situation that we find in south Asia at this point in time. Once again, in complete disregard of world opinion, in complete disregard of peace in the region, in complete disregard of the concerns of its neighbors and its allies and friends, yesterday the nation of India once again detonated two more nuclear devices. That makes five in 2 days. 
What I hear around here, Mr. President, people are saying, what have they done? Have they lost their senses? Have they lost all concept of reality? Have they gone berserk? Are they completely nutty now? Those are the kinds of things I hear around the Chamber and around the Capitol--people 
talking about India, and what has happened to them. I do not believe that all Indians have gone berserk or that all Indians are crazy, but certainly something has happened with their Government to flaunt what they have done, to go ahead and not only set off three in 1 day, but two the next day, and also near the border of Pakistan. For the life of me, I cannot understand what they can possibly be thinking of. 
So, I am pleased that the President has announced that he will, in accordance with the law, invoke the full range of sanctions that are required under the Nuclear Policy Prevention Act of 1994. These are tough, and we want to make sure that the administration follows through on them. We have to end all foreign assistance and loans to the Nation of India. We must terminate all military aid and weapons transfers. We must oppose international foreign aid and financial assistance to the Nation through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I understand many of our allies have decided to join in placing these sanctions on India. The law requires it, and we must place the full measure of the law on India in this regard. 
Mr. President, I visited the south Asia region twice in the last year and a half. I understand the complexity of their internal politics and their international relations. But I must say this, that whatever problems there may have been before have been multiplied a thousandfold by what India just did. 
Again, I hope the nations in that region will exercise caution and restraint in light of this. Right now, India has become the pariah of the world community of nations, and rightfully so, for what it has done. It should remain a pariah for a considerable amount of time, until it reverses its course, until it sits down with its neighbors to reach peaceful solutions in that area, until India is willing to sit down with its neighbor, Pakistan, and solve once and for all the issue of Kashmir; until India is ready to sit down with its neighbor, Pakistan, and secure their borders; until India is willing to disavow putting their nuclear arsenals within their military. Until that time, until these things are done, India will and should remain a pariah among the world community of nations. 
Earlier today, our Secretary of Defense appeared before our Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. We discussed these developments in south Asia and what they mean. Will there be a nuclear arms race now in the region? Will Pakistan follow suit and detonate a nuclear weapons test in response to India? What about China? What is China going to do now? How about Iran? Don't forget, they have a border also. What is Iran going to do now that India has taken this step? So what are all these nations going to do? 
Secretary Cohen this morning, in open testimony, indicated that we may see a chain reaction of events. I think that is an apt term, considering the physics of nuclear fission. Just as a nuclear explosion is an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction, so we may see uncontrolled events now happen in that region. But, just like a nuclear chain reaction, there are things you can do to slow it down and stop it. Just as in a nuclear powerplant, to slow down the chain reaction, they stick in the graphite rods to slow down the reaction, so we need to insert some graphite rods into the events that just happened in south Asia. 
What I mean by that is that I believe that certain steps must be taken to slow down these events. First of all, as I mentioned, we must apply the full force and effect of law on the sanctions to India. Second, I believe we must meet with 
Pakistan at the earliest possible time to discuss our mutual security needs in that area of the world; to discuss them with Pakistan, who has been a friend and an ally going clear back to the establishment of Pakistan as a nation. When people wondered what direction Pakistan would go, would they go to the Soviet Union or would they tilt toward the United States, Pakistan declared at that time they would go with the United States, they would follow the path of democracy and freedom and not with the Soviet Union. 
Time and time and time again, Pakistan has come to our aid, our assistance, whether it was overflights over the Soviet Union for purposes of intelligence gathering, helping us in that terrible war in Afghanistan. There are still over a million refugees in the country of Pakistan from that war that helped topple the Soviet Union. Every step of the way, Pakistan has been our friend and our ally. So I think we need to meet with them at the earliest possible time to discuss our mutual security interests in that area. 
Next, I hope President Clinton will, at the earliest possible time, indicate that he will not be visiting India this year. I know there has been a trip planned for the President to visit Pakistan and India this fall. I call upon the President to indicate now that, because of these events, it would not be right and proper for him to visit India but that it would be right and proper for him to visit Pakistan and perhaps other nations in that area such as Bangladesh. So, I call upon him to call off that visit to India to send another strong signal. 
And, third, in order to put these graphite rods back into this chain reaction and to slow it down, I believe we need to press ahead with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or the CTBT, that would outlaw all nuclear weapons tests globally. So far, 149 nations have signed the treaty. In fact, we thought we were going to get it all done in August of 1996, except one nation walked out and refused to sign it--India. And now we know why. Is it too late for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty? I don't believe so. In fact, I believe what has happened in India more than anything indicates that we have to act now in the U.S. Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
We have not taken it up yet, and we should. We have signed it. It is now sitting before the Senate. We ought to take it up because the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will help put those graphite rods back in that chain reaction, slowing down uncontrolled events in south Asia. 
The CTBT will not by itself eliminate the possibility of proliferation, but it will make it extremely difficult for nuclear nations, such as India, to develop sophisticated weapons that could be delivered by ballistic missiles. 
Again, we have India, and they set off their underground explosions. But, as we know, that is not the end of the line in terms of developing the kind of weapons that can be delivered by ballistic missiles. If we don't sign and if we don't urge other nations and India to sign the CTBT, this will not be the end of India's nuclear testing, believe me. They are now going to have to refine their warheads. They are going to have to have further testing so that they have the kind of warheads they can deliver with missiles and perhaps aircraft. We have to stop that from happening, and that is why we need the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
It would have been better if we had this in effect beforehand to stop what happened in India, but we didn't have it. We can't turn the clock back. We can't put the genie back in the bottle, but what we can do is we can push ahead now. 
Here is how I see it, Mr. President. We have to put the full force and effect of the law on India with all these sanctions, cut off all aid, military assistance and cut off all World Bank loans and IMF. In fact, I think we ought to withdraw our ambassador, which the President has done, and not send him back. Then I believe the U.S. Senate should ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and insist that India do so immediately, before we ever lift any sanctions. In that way, India may have a bomb, but they may not have something that they could deliver on the head of a missile. 
That is why I believe it is so important that we bring up the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and ratify it in the Senate and stop this madness, stop these uncontrolled events that may take place in south Asia unless we act right now. 
In fact, I must say, I know the occupant of the chair has spoken on this issue. I know he had a hearing on it today. Quite frankly, I am somewhat shocked that more Senators are not out here talking about what has happened in India in the last couple of days. I believe this is the biggest single danger to world peace that we have faced perhaps in the last 20 to 30 years, because uncontrolled events can start taking place. 
On the one hand, I believe we must come down with the full force and effect of the law on India. I believe the President should call off his trip there this fall. I believe we need to meet with our friends in Pakistan to discuss our mutual security needs in that area. On the other hand, we need to ratify a comprehensive test ban treaty and then say to India, `If you want to rejoin the community of nations, sign, join, no more testing.' Then we get other nations to sign it, and we will have a comprehensive test ban treaty and will stop the uncontrolled events that may be unfolding in south Asia. 
It is a perilous time. India cannot be excused from what it did. Hopefully, the community of nations can put the proper pressure on India to come to its senses and join the rest of the world community in saying, `No; that they will never ever test nuclear weapons ever again.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was trying to listen to the remarks of the Senator from Texas. It is hard to know where to begin to correct the mistakes that he made in his statements because there were so many. 
First of all, I say to the Senator from Texas that this was not a $500 million bill when it started. As a matter of fact, when it passed the Senate, it was a $1.3 billion bill and, in fact, it passed unanimously, so the Senator from Texas obviously voted for it. 
Secondly, I also point out that crop insurance has always been a mandatory program--always. In 1996, a small portion of it was made discretionary, but the basis of crop insurance has always been mandatory. So this is not some change in that program. 
Thirdly, I tell the Senator from Texas that food stamps has always been a part of this bill. It was a part of this bill when it passed our committee, and it was a part of the bill when it passed the Senate. Food stamps was used as an offset to pay for the research portion of the bill. So it was a part of the bill as an offset. The administration said if we are going to use it as an offset, we had to replace some of the nutrition programs, which I will get to. 
I also point out that the Senate-passed bill had nutrition provisions in it. It was not just a research bill, as the Senator from Texas has said. It had a provision in there to expand some child nutrition programs with an expanded breakfast grant program. That was taken out in conference, but it was in the Senate-passed bill. 
Lastly, I point out that in terms of the mandatory programs the Senator is talking about, the Fund for Rural America was part of the bill as passed in October, for which the Senator voted. It was in the bill at $300 million. Now it is only $100 million. So if the Senator from Texas supported it at $300 million, he shouldn't be too upset that it is now at $100 million. I wanted to make those corrections in the Record. 
I made my opening statement yesterday on the bill itself in terms of the important research and crop insurance provisions that are in it. Again, I commend my chairman, Senator Lugar, for all of his hard work in getting the whole research program revamped and restructured to meet the needs of the next century. Senator Lugar has been a leader in this effort. I was pleased to join him, and, again, I thank Senator Lugar for his close cooperation and for working together to get a really good research bill passed. 
I also commend Senator Lugar for his leadership in getting the necessary wherewithal to extend our Crop Insurance Program for the next 5 years. I daresay, without his strong leadership, we would not have the provisions that our farmers could rely on for their crop insurance this year. 
Again, if, in fact, this motion to recommit is successful, that is the end of this bill. Make no mistake about it, this is not just some motion to recommit to change a little bit. This is a motion to recommit to kill this bill. If this goes back to conference, I don't know that the votes are there to take out the food stamp provisions. Even if they are, it will never pass the House of Representatives, and certainly the Senator from Texas knows that. This is a careful compromise, a careful balance that was worked out in this bill. 
Let me get to the issue of the food stamps themselves. The Senator says it is like putting a big neon sign out there, `Come to America.' 
Well, let us take a look at that. 
What are we doing in this bill? What we are saying is that for refugees and asylees from religious persecution and political persecution, who cannot exist in their homelands because they are going to be tortured or killed, we say to them that if you come to America under a quota--we have a quota every year; not every refugee gets into this country; we have a quota--but if you get in under that quota, right now as a refugee you are eligible for food stamps and Medicaid and SSI. You are eligible for food stamps for the first 5 years, but you are not after that. And so what it says is that you can come in, you can get Medicaid, you can get SSI for up to 7 years, but you cannot get food stamps after 5 years. As a refugee, it takes 4 years and 9 months to be able to apply for citizenship. We know that, because of the backlog at INS, it takes at least 2 more years, maybe 3 years to get full citizenship. 
Let me also point out something else. These food stamps are not automatic. It does not mean because you are a refugee and you are here that you get food stamps. No. You still have to meet the requirements, the work requirements and the income requirements, to be able to qualify for food stamps like anyone else. So we are not talking about automatic food stamps. 
The 5-year period, the Senator is correct, was set in the welfare reform bill. But it did provide an exception for refugees and persons granted asylum. They would be able to receive food stamps for 5 years. 
In the Balanced Budget Act that we passed last year, we extended that for the elderly, the disabled, and the children of legal immigrants who were here in 1996. And then we looked at what we did. We looked at the 5-year period and said, this is unrealistic because a refugee who is here, as I said, has to be here 4 years and 9 months--and it takes 3, sometimes 4 more years to become a citizen. And it is impossible for a refugee to complete the citizenship process in less than 7 years. 
As I said, the Balanced Budget Act last year provided that in the case of Medicaid and SSI, refugees and asylees would be eligible to receive benefits for up to 7 years if they qualify. Not automatic. There is no neon sign. It says, if you qualify. 
There was bipartisan agreement on this point. Food stamps were not included because that bill came out of the Finance Committee, and food stamps is not under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. They are under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. And that is why we had to fix it here. 
Let me read from a letter from the Council of Jewish Federations that came to our office just today asking that we oppose Senator Gramm's motion. Let me just read one paragraph. It says:  
The welfare law provided a 5 year exemption from the bar on food stamps for refugees and asylees because Congress acknowledged that these individuals typically come to the U.S. with few, if any, resources. They have no sponsors to rely on and may have difficulty working because of disabilities. Those that can work may find that the training and skills they gained in their home countries are inadequate for most jobs here. As a result, many start in low paying jobs [so] they need food stamps to get an adequate diet. 
That is just it. These are refugees and asylees. They do not have sponsors. A lot of them come with a shirt on their back. Let me give you one example. Mr. Wang Dan, the young Chinese man who we have all been reading about, who has now come to this country, came with a shirt on his back. We know how he was persecuted and imprisoned in China. What this amendment says to Wang Dan is, OK, up to 5 years, if you fall on hard times--you have to otherwise qualify; you do not automatically get food stamps--but otherwise if you fall on hard times, yes, you can get some food stamps. But after 5 years--you have worked here; you have worked hard; you have applied for citizenship; it is in the bill; you are going to become a citizen in 2 or 3 years--all of a sudden you lose your job, you get sick, you fall on some hard times, sorry, no food stamps. Is that a neon sign? Not in any way. Not in any way.

I listened with some amusement to my friend and colleague from Texas talking about this issue, saying that it is principle, that he is doing this on principle. I know we passed the Balanced Budget Act last year in the Senate. That extended from 5 to 7 years Medicaid and SSI to the same refugees and asylees we are talking about. I do not recall the Senator from Texas then offering an amendment to strike it out of the Balanced Budget Act.

Mr. HARKIN. I believe the Senator voted aye when the Balanced Budget Act passed the Senate--maybe not on the conference report but when it passed the Senate. And that provision was in the Senate bill to extend it to 7 years. 
Secondly, the Senator from Texas may be philosophically opposed to food stamps. That is fine. That is his position--that may be his position. That is another debate for another time. We settled that in welfare reform, and we settled it in the Balanced Budget Act last year. 
All we are doing now is making food stamps compatible with Medicaid and SSI. So I hope the Senator would not hold our farmers hostage, because that is what is happening. We know full well, if this goes back to conference, it is dead. We have hundreds of thousands of farmers who need crop insurance this summer. Over 106,000 winter wheat policies right now will be up on September 30. Farmers all over the plains States will not be able to renew their policies. Many farmers use their crop insurance policies as collateral in order to secure an operating loan. So if we do not have that, thousands of farmers will not have access to the credit they need to get the crop in. That is why we need to pass this bill.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me just wrap up by again thanking Senators for the overwhelming vote that we just had. I think that vote will send a clear signal to the House to move very rapidly on the bill. We will get it down to the President and hopefully get this important conference report signed in very short order. 
I can just tell you, there will be a giant sigh of relief among the agriculture community from coast to coast and border to border as soon as this bill gets signed, because then we can get on to the business of getting our crop insurance policies renewed around the country and we can get on with the business of revamping, revising, and strengthening agricultural research throughout America. But the most important and most vital aspect of the bill in the immediate future is the Crop Insurance Program. Farmers will be assured right away that they will be able to continue their protection against disaster losses. 
Mr. President, let me again compliment and thank my chairman, Senator Lugar, first for his leadership on the ag research provisions of the bill. He has said many times that, entering the new century, we need to have a new approach, and new ways of doing our research in agriculture. He is absolutely right. I was happy and proud to support him in those efforts. It took quite a while to get the bill worked through the hearing processes, through negotiations in conference, getting all the issues worked out on research, but it was done, and we had good, bipartisan support. 
I believe the chairman has fashioned an Ag research bill that is really going to help us move ahead in the next century in producing new kinds of crops, new products from and uses for crops, in biotechnology, in improving agricultural productivity and natural resource protection. So I believe we will see a whole new focus and revitalization of our agricultural research. It is long overdue, but this bill will move us in that direction. 
I thank the chairman also for his leadership on crop insurance, in making sure that we addressed this need to provide that critical element of a safety net for farmers, because, as we all know, they need this crop insurance, both to cover disasters over which they have no control and also to make sure they have the collateral they need for obtaining financing for their farming operations. Farmers rely on crop insurance, and agricultural lenders rely on it. 
So, this provision is going to be very, very meaningful to make sure that farmers, and we here in Congress, do not have to be worrying every single year how we will find funding to continue crop insurance--and whether in fact farmers will have crop insurance. That is going to be a great relief to our farming community all over America. 
Finally, on the food stamp provisions, again, I thank the chairman for his great leadership in making sure we produced a sound bill and held together our coalition encompassing agricultural and nutrition matters. 
I also thank all the staff who worked very hard for a long time, for well over a year now, to get us to this point: Randy Green, our staff director; and Dave Johnson, chief counsel; Ms. Terri Nintemann on the majority side; on the minority side, Dan Smith, Mark Halverson, Phil Schwab and Richard Bender. There are a number of other staff. These are our leaders. They did a great job of pulling this bill together, keeping us on course and making sure we got to conference and got it all wrapped up. We are very blessed with a very good and very capable staff. I thank them for all the long hours and hard work they put in. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand that the Senate is not on any legislation right now. I would like to take just a few minutes of the Senate's time to talk about the disturbing events that happened in South Asia yesterday. 
Mr. President, to paraphrase a speech that President Roosevelt gave 57 years ago in the House Chamber, yesterday is a day that will live in infamy, for the Nation of India. At a time when world tensions are being reduced, when the cold war is over, when nuclear arsenals are being reduced, at a time when we are on the threshold of signing a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Nation of India deliberately and provocatively, with total disregard for world opinion and total disregard for regional stability in South Asia, detonated three nuclear weapons. And to make matters even worse, they were detonated near the border with Pakistan. 
These tests were conducted without advance warning to the international community. They clearly work against the goals of nonproliferation and international stability. Indian's Prime Minister's principal secretary said afterwards that with the test, `India has a proven capability for a weaponized nuclear program.' 
Mr. President, India's behavior is clearly unacceptable. These underground tests could well trigger a nuclear arms race in the region. 
I believe that the United States should be prepared to exercise the full range and depth of sanctions available under law. For example, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 requires the President to cut off almost all U.S. Government aid to India, bar American banks from making loans to the Government, stop exports of American products with military uses such as machine tools and computers, and, most importantly, oppose aid to India by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
An article that appeared this morning in the New York Times pointed out that, `India is the world's largest borrower from the World Bank, with more than $44 billion in loans; it is expecting about $3 billion in loans and credits this year.' 
Well, I think it is time for the United States to exercise its voice and vote in the World Bank, and let India know that no longer can it come and get that kind of money if all it is going to do is spend its money on developing and testing not only fission weapons but yesterday a thermonuclear weapon, a hydrogen bomb. 
Further quoting from this article, Monday's tests `came as a complete shock, a bolt out of the blue' to the White House, one senior administration official said. `It's a fork in the road.' `Will India and Pakistan be locked in a nuclear arms race? Will the Chinese resume nuclear testing now?' 
What is also disturbing is that our intelligence agencies obviously did not pick up any signs that the tests were imminent and reported that activities at the test site appeared to be routine. 
Let's see now. How much did we spend on our intelligence agencies last year? About thirty billion dollars? And they can't even tell us when one of the largest nations on Earth is going to explode nuclear weapons? You wonder what that $30 billion is going for. I think a thorough review needs to be made of our intelligence operation. 
Back to the point, Senator John Glenn, our colleague, who is the author of the law, is quoted as saying, `Those sanctions are mandatory,' and the only way to delay them is if the President tells Congress that their immediate imposition would harm national security. And that delay can only last 30 days. Congress can only remove the sanctions by passing a law or joint resolution. 
`It would be hard to avoid the possibility of sanctions,' a senior State Department official said. `There is no wiggle room in the law.' 
Further quoting our colleague, who is quoted again in the New York Times this morning, Senator Glenn called the tests `the triumph of fear over prudence, a monumental setback for efforts to halt the global spread of nuclear weapons.' 
Mr. President, the Nation of India is no longer the nation of Mohandas Gandhi, I am sorry to say. The Nation of India has embarked on a new and dangerous course in South Asia, one that I think has ominous foreboding for all of their neighbors in that area, and also for us here in the United States. 
Of course, it is my fervent hope that India's neighbors will show restraint. It is my hope and my desire that Pakistan and China and other nations in that region will recognize the importance of caution despite this dangerous, inflammatory and provocative move by India. Again, they should not follow the lead of India but recognize the importance of restraining a nuclear arms race. 
I believe that this Senate should also press for appropriate action by the international community. The international community should join with the United States in bringing to bear whatever sanctions it can, especially in the World Bank to cut off all loans to India. 
Again, what India has done underscores the need for a nuclear test ban treaty. But now it becomes clear why, in August of 1996, after years of difficult negotiations, we finally got a final treaty supported by all countries for a comprehensive test ban, India refused to sign. Maybe now we know why. 
The treaty was endorsed by a 158-to-3 margin at the United Nations. However, India walked out and said they weren't going to sign. 
We cannot give up. We cannot let this action by the Government in India deter us from our goal of a comprehensive test ban. 
I do not in any way mean my remarks today to implicate all of the wonderful people of India, many of whom I have counted as my friends, many of whom worked very hard on the issues of human rights, social justice, ending child labor. But I do wish by my remarks today to implicate and condemn in the strongest possible language permitted in this body the actions by the Government of India. This was its decision. This was its deliberate decision to conduct these tests in clear disregard for the opinion of the world. 
So the Government of India bears a heavy responsibility for what follows. I hope they do not, although my hopes seem to be feint in light of what the Government of India said yesterday, intend to weaponize their nuclear program. Not only have they tested these weapons, they seem to have sent a clear signal that they are going to incorporate these weapons in their military arsenal both for short-range, medium- and obviously perhaps even for long-range purposes. 
At a time when India needs to invest in education, when it needs to invest in its infrastructure, at a time when India really needs to reach peaceful agreements with its neighbor, Pakistan, on the issue of Kashmir, which is still a volatile issue. At a time when China and India need to get together to discuss their roles in South Asia in the future, India has thumbed its nose at its neighbors. When the Government of Pakistan came to power under the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it reached out to India, to the previous government. Prime Minister Sharif held out the olive branch. He asked that talks be conducted, that they take steps to reduce the tensions in the region. 
Those talks proceeded, tensions were reduced, and then elections were held in India and a new government was elected. The hopes and the dreams, the actions taken by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, and others in the region are now dashed and doomed if India doesn't make a quick U-turn in its policies. But India has already taken its actions, and its actions, I am afraid, will have very serious repercussions. 
But, again, we cannot give up. I know that Pakistan several times called for restraint, to call for talks. 
Well, I call on Pakistan and the other nations of the region not give up on their efforts to pursue a peaceful path, to again reach out to India to begin the long and arduous task of negotiations to reduce tensions and to reduce the nuclear arsenal in that area of the world. 
I remain fearful not only because of Pakistan but because of China. What will China do now? Will China believe that it must now proceed to further test its nuclear weapons to show India that it is not going to be intimidated? No, Mr. President, what India did yesterday will live in infamy, and it is sad because India has made great progress in the last 50 years. I note at this time the President has recalled our ambassador to India. I compliment him for that action. 
Quite frankly, I hope this sends another strong signal to India that it is not going to be business as usual with the U.S. Government because of what they did yesterday. It cannot be said too strongly that India took a terrible, terrible step yesterday and only India can undo it. I hope they will. But their words and their actions indicate to me they may and probably will not. I feel sorry for India. I feel sorry for the people of India. I feel sorry for the kids that are working in the plants and the factories and the carpet looms who want a better future and a better education. I feel sorry for the millions of people in poverty who want a little bit better life in India but are now going to have to struggle because more and more of their money is going into their weapons and their nuclear arsenal. And I feel sorry for the people of Pakistan, too, again, who have made great strides in the last 50 years to build a nation, to build an infrastructure that will allow for a moderate Islamic State to exist in that area, and I feel sorry for the people of China. What is its Government going to do now? 
Mr. President, we can only hope and pray that South Asia will now see this as a sign that they must get together and sign a comprehensive test ban treaty now, stop nuclear testing now, stop the arms race now; that India and China and Pakistan must get together and work out their problems through serious peaceful negotiations and not through the bluster of provocative actions taken by India yesterday to increase the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race. 
Mr. President, I call on India to disavow what they did yesterday, to admit they made a mistake, to reach out to their neighbors in a serious attempt to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and to stop this madness once and for all. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, every year thousands of Americans are victimized by fraudulent telemarketing promotions. And, unfortunately, these scam artists prey most often on our senior citizens. The losses every year are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. My amendment will help law enforcement to more effectively combat these abuses. 
Today, its all too easy for telemarketing rip-off artists to profit from the current system. How do these rip-offs occur? Advertisements regarding sweepstakes, contests, loans, credit reports and other promotions appear in newspapers, magazines, and other direct mail and telephone solicitations. The operators of many of these phoney promotions set up a telephone boiler room for a few months in which a number of phones are operated to receive calls responding to their ads. They steal thousands--even millions--of dollars from innocent victims and then they simply disappear. They take the money and run--moving on to another location to start all over again. 
Here's just one example. Not too long ago, 30,000 Iowans received postcards from an organization calling itself Sweepstakes International, Inc. The postcard enticed recipients to call a 900-number and they were charged $9.95 on their phone bill. 
Based on a Postal Service investigation, civil action was initiated in U.S. District Court in Iowa. As a result, the promotion was halted and $1.7 million was frozen. This represented just one and a half month's revenue from the scam! 
My amendment will protect telemarketing victims by providing law enforcement the authority to more quickly obtain the name, address, and physical location of businesses suspected of telemarketing fraud. Phone companies would have to provide law enforcement officials only the name, address and physical location of a telemarketing business holding a phone number if the officials submitted a formal written request for this information relevant to a legitimate law enforcement investigation. It will make it easier for officers to identify and locate these operations. This is similar to the procedure that is already in place for post office box investigations. 
Mr. President, it is necessary to crack down on serious consumer fraud. With this change, we will have many more successful efforts to shut down these rip-offs artists like several recent cases in my home state of Iowa.

Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. By unanimous consent, yesterday, we were supposed to come up with the research bill at 11 o'clock. We are up against kind of a time problem here. I would like to have some idea as to how soon that will happen. I see the chairman of the Agriculture Committee is here.

Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I just want to concur in the unanimous consent agreement and commend my chairman, Senator Lugar, for his leadership on this bill. This is an extremely important bill. We should have gotten it through a long time ago. There are farmers out in my area of the country, all up and down the Midwest--I am sure in the Senator's home State also--who have contracts up this summer on crop insurance, and if we don't hurry up and get this through, we are going to be in big trouble; we will not have the money for the crop insurance program to allow these farmers to renew their contracts for next year. So it is imperative that we do get it through. 
If this bill were to be recommitted--and I will have more to say about this tomorrow, but I wanted to talk about this a little here--I think that would be the end of the bill. We tried for a long time in conference to get to this point. It is a delicate balance of many interests, but it is a good balance. It is one that balances all of the interests in all sections of the country. It advances the cause of agricultural research; it does the job of providing the necessary funds to keep the crop insurance program going; and it also fills in the gap on the food stamps for legal immigrants, elderly, disabled, and children, and also refugees and asylees who are in this country. 
Madam President, as I said, the conference report of the Agricultural Research Extension and Education Reform Act of 1998 represents a strong statement by the Senate on the importance of research to the future of American agriculture and fulfills important promises to restore food stamp benefits to legal immigrants, refugees, and asylees, and to fully fund the crop insurance program. 
Again, I am pleased that both sides of the aisle in both the House and the Senate have come together to invest in the future of agriculture in rural communities as well as nutrition programs for needy individuals who were unfairly cut off from food stamp benefits in the welfare reform bill that we passed in 1996. 
I again commend Chairman Lugar for his diligent and tireless efforts to, first of all, get the changes made in the research program that we so vitally need in this country in our ag research program, and his efforts to get the bill through, and through conference, and to the point where we are now. Chairman Lugar has done a great job in guiding and directing and leading us in a bipartisan fashion to get the bill through. 
We have had great cooperation. I am thankful to him for the great cooperation he has given me as the ranking member, and to his staff for the many kindnesses that his staff has afforded our staff. I also commend our colleagues in the House for assisting and aiding us getting this bill through. I am especially pleased that the agriculture, nutrition and immigrant communities are united in support of this conference report. 
Reinforcing the strong support for this bill, on April 24, 71 Senators sent a letter to the leadership asking that we bring up this bill and pass it. Madam President, 71 Senators signed a letter to the majority leader of the Senate asking we bring up this bill and pass it. So I hope we can move quickly on this vital piece of legislation. 
Let me just mention the three components of the bill. First, the issue of food stamps. This bill will spend about $816 million over the next 5 years to restore food stamp eligibility for nearly 250,000 individuals. Again, with this action we have reaffirmed our compassion and our priority for taking care of the most vulnerable in our society. The bill takes a major step towards fulfilling a promise that was made by our President and many of us here in the Congress on both sides of the aisle to correct inequities made in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. 
What we have done in this bill, Madam President, mirrors the changes made in last year's balanced budget agreement. That bill eliminated eligibility for several classes of legal immigrants for food stamps. Refugees, asylees, elderly and disabled legal immigrants and their children, Hmong refugees and certain native Americans who were unfairly denied food stamp benefits will once again be eligible for this important food assistance under this bill before us. 
I might also add, parenthetically, that it is not just compassion, but it is dollar wise. We know in the past when these people are cut off from the needed food stamps, the elderly and the disabled, their kids are cut off, and when they lack nutrition, where do they end up? They are at the emergency room door of our hospitals, and we pay for that. Better we put some money into adequate food and nutrition to keep them healthy in the first place rather than pay for the needed medical services they would require later on. 
Under research and rural development, the research provisions of this bill will ensure that our farmers and ranchers have the word's best science and technology at their disposal to produce food and fiber, to protect the environment, and to create rural economic opportunities. In this regard, we are devoting $600 million in new funds over the next 5 years to advance the science and technology underlying our agricultural system. This new initiative will invest in priority research topics like food safety, biotechnology and environmental quality. There are new incentives for the development of new crops and new uses for existing crops. Finally, modest reforms in the land grant system will help it to remain a leader in research, education and outreach in the coming century. 
We have also extended the Fund for Rural America through the year 2002, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to the pressing development needs of our rural communities. This fund was a key component of the 1996 farm bill, created to provide funds to help farmers in rural communities to transition to the new farm policy environment. Although I wish we could have found more funds for this purpose, I am pleased that over the next 5 years, an additional $100 million was added to the Fund for Rural America. 
Finally, the third component of the bill is crop insurance. Since the last Crop Insurance Reform Act in 1994, participation in crop insurance has more than doubled in our country. Without agreement to this conference report, millions of farmers face the possibility of canceled insurance policies in just the next few months. That would leave them without risk protection for the 1999 crop season. 
The action we have taken in this bill will secure funding for the Crop Insurance Program for the next 5 years. It will set the stage also for a vigorous debate about how to further restructure and reform the program in the coming years. I look forward to working with Chairman Lugar in moving that discussion and that debate forward. The more tools and options we can give our farmers to manage the risks of production, the more resilient our rural communities will be in the face of market and weather fluctuations. 
So this conference report accomplishes a great deal in a single package. We have let the world know that we care about the vulnerable in our society, those who are refugees and asylees who are escaping persecution--many times religious persecution in other countries. A lot of times when they come here, they don't have a million dollars in their pockets. Usually those aren't the kind of people who are persecuted. But those who are persecuted for religious beliefs or otherwise, a lot of times who flee their countries, who come here, they don't have a lot of money. They need an education. And, yes, we provide them food assistance. I think that is a part of what we ought to be about in this country. What this bill does is it restores it. We say to those people, if you are escaping intolerable situations in other parts of the world, our doors will be open to refugees and asylees, and we are going to assure that you have adequate nutrition to get you to the point where you can apply for citizenship. 
Second, we have let the world know we are serious about equipping American agriculture for future food production challenges. We have taken the steps to assure the taxpayers that research dollars are expended in the most efficient manner. Finally, we ensure that our farmers will have good risk management tools available to them. 
We have done all of this in a very strong, bipartisan manner. We can all take pride in the fact that today we have made a significant investment in a better future, not only for our farmers and ranchers, but also in a better future for an increasingly crowded and hungry world. So, Madam President, I urge my colleagues to agree to this conference report without delay. 
Madam President, I will have more to say tomorrow about the pending amendment by the Senator from Texas, who as I understand, would exempt from the coverage of the Food Stamp Program, refugees and asylees who come to this country after, I think it is August of 1996, if I am not mistaken. I think that would just be the wrong step to take, first of all, for a 
compassionate and caring society, and for those of us who care about asylees and refugees. I think that covers both political parties, and certainly covers all of the religious institutions in America. I know I received letters from--I know Cardinal O'Connor in New York, from many members of the Jewish faith, other Christian faiths who have written to us asking us to please make this fix in food stamps to cover these very vulnerable people who are in our society. 
And, second, I would just say again, if the amendment contemplated by the Senator from Texas were to be successful, that is referring this back to conference committee, that would be the end of this bill. Make no mistake about it. The amendment that I have seen written and proposed--he has not offered it yet, but as proposed by the Senator from Texas--would kill this bill. It would kill the research provisions of this bill and it could kill the crop insurance provisions of this bill along with the food stamp provisions. 
Why do I say that? For two reasons. First, because we worked long and hard to get to this point in a bipartisan fashion. There were long, serious discussions both in the Senate and in the House and in conference, and we reached our agreements and we have strong bipartisan support for this. If this were to go back to the conference committee--one, either the conference committee would not or could not make these changes, and thus the bill would die in conference; or if the conference committee voted to make these changes and it went back to the House, there is no way that it would succeed in the House. Maybe it wouldn't even succeed in the Senate. I don't know. 
But, Madam President, I have been on the Agriculture Committee now, both in the House and the Senate, for 23 years. I have been through a lot of farm bills and a lot of farm bill amendments and modifications. And we have for a long time had a good working relationship with our urban friends in keeping a good, strong coalition together to both answer the needs of those of us who represent rural America and to answer the needs of those who represent urban America. 
I believe it has been a good working relationship. When we look at it, hunger in America is almost nonexistent. Yes, we have some gaps out there. Yes, we have some nutritional gaps out there, but compared to any other country, we are light-years ahead. 
We provide the needed nutrition from the School Breakfast Program to the School Lunch Program to afternoon programs to the Food Stamp Program to Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, and then we provide support for our food banks and our soup kitchens and feeding facilities around the country along with the private sector. 
We have taken care to address the nutritional needs of those who live in our urban areas, and we have taken care of the needs of those who live in our rural areas. As I said, part of this bill is funds for rural America that helps continue to invest in rural economic development so our people who live in small towns and communities will have the kind of jobs and support they need. Our farmers will have the risk management tools and crop insurance they will need to provide the food and fiber for America. 
It has been a good coalition, a healthy coalition. The amendment contemplated by the Senator from Texas will tear that coalition apart. That is why I say, if it were to succeed--I don't think it will, I hope it won't, I don't think it will--if it were, that would be the end of this bill. 
I am hopeful, and I know the Senator from Texas is sincere in what he is trying to do--I happen to disagree with him, deeply disagree--that we ought to carve out asylees and refugees from the food stamp provisions of this bill. 
Be that as it may, I still suggest that this amendment really is a basic amendment that will kill this bill. We can't afford to have that happen. I hope all my colleagues will support the chairman and support others on both sides of the aisle who signed the letter to bring up the bill and to pass it as it is. If we do that, I think we can have a swift conclusion of this bill tomorrow, get it down to the President for his signature, our farmers can go ahead and get their crop insurance contracts renewed, we can begin the process of changing our research system, and we can meet the nutritional needs of the most vulnerable in our society. I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1579, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, of which I am proud to be an original co-sponsor. I would like to commend Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Kennedy, and Wellstone, for making reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act a priority, and for including this legislation as an amendment to the Workforce legislation. 
The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program provides $2.2 billion in formula grant assistance to States to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and engage in gainful employment. Since established by the Smith-Fess act 75 years ago, state vocational rehabilitation programs have served some nine million people. This program promotes economic independence for people with disabilities, and the numbers reflect that. 
In 1992, Congress made major changes to the Act, namely, increasing consumer participation, streamlining processes, and reducing unnecessary paperwork. In the bill before us today, we have built on the '92 amendments. The bill preserves and strengthens the themes of the '92 amendments, while fine-tuning and aligning the Act with other workforce reforms. 
The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 strengthen the role of the consumer throughout the vocational rehabilitation process, particularly in the development of the individual's employment plan. This reauthorization reduces unnecessary burdens on State VR agencies by streamlining the State plan; indeed, the bill reduces the 36 State plan requirements in current law to 24. The bill also refocuses the State plan on improving outcomes for individuals with disabilities by requiring States to develop, jointly with the State Rehabilitation Council, annual goals and strategies for improving results. 
Access of Social Security beneficiaries to VR services is facilitated, and unnecessary gatekeeping is eliminated, by making SSI and SSDI beneficiaries presumptively eligible for services under the VR States Grants program. This change will eliminate the need for the VR agency to determine on a case-by-case basis whether individuals `require' VR services in order to gain employment. Under this bill, if a person receiving SSI or SSDI walks through the door of a VR agency, that person will be presumed eligible for VR services. As the Administrator of the Iowa VR agency explained to me, `now we don't have to spend time and money determining whether an individual on SSI or SSDI is eligible for services. Instead, we can focus our resources where they should be focused--on assisting our consumers in obtaining employment.' 
Of particular interest to me and to Senator Dodd are the changes to Section 508 of the Act, which pertain to electronic and information technology accessibility. This section will make it easier for individuals with disabilities who are federal employees to obtain the assistive technology they need in order to do their jobs. 
Finally, this bill widens employment opportunities for people with disabilities by establishing linkages with larger statewide workforce systems. I would like to point out, however, as Senators Jeffords, DeWine, and Kennedy already have, that vocational rehabilitation agencies will not be required to spend any of their federal allotment on activities other than those that help provide jobs for people with disabilities. 
In sum, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 bring us closer to the goal of fostering independence for people with disabilities by providing them with the services they need in order to enter the workforce. I would like to thank Senators DeWine, Jeffords, Kennedy, Wellstone, and Dodd, and the Clinton Administration, for their leadership in developing this bill in a bipartisan manner. I also would like to commend all the staff members who worked on this bill. Without their tireless efforts, we would never have been able to bring this important reauthorization to the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is not a long amendment. That is why I wanted it read. 
It is very straightforward. It will be my intention to just speak for a few minutes on the amendment, and then I will withdraw the amendment. After seeing how all of the amendments seem to be faring here, it seemed ridiculous to waste any more time of the Senate to be voting on these amendments. 
I feel strongly about this aspect of going into NATO enlargement. More than anything else, I want to explain the purpose of my amendment and lay down a marker regarding an issue that I know concerns all of us here and which could have very severe repercussions in an expanded NATO. That is the issue of the nonproliferation treaty of which the United States is a signatory and, of course, an issue that we have pushed very hard. 
Many of us have spoken many times about the importance of not slowing down international arms control and nonproliferation efforts. This amendment is simply a sense of the Senate regarding NATO's relationship to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, and urges that the President should propose that NATO examine the compatibility-- 
Mr. President, could I have order? I have trouble hearing myself.

<DOCNO>105-harkin-ia-10-19980430</DOCNO>

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President. 
This amendment just urges that the President should propose that NATO examine the compatibility of its nuclear-weapons-sharing programs with our obligations under the NPT, the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. 
The NPT is one of our most important international agreements. Not only is the United States a member of the NPT regime, we were a strong leader in establishing the treaty. 
Its purpose, of course, is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Through a series of provisions, it helps halt the spread of nuclear materials and nuclear weapons knowledge. That is the important part of this--the nuclear weapons knowledge. 
The nonaligned members of the NPT have expressed great concern over NATO's nuclear-sharing programs. Let me make it clear. The United States has nuclear weapons at U.S. bases in NATO nations. In time of war the United States could release these nuclear weapons to these allied nations. 
Of course, in peacetime our allies do not have control over them. We retain control. However, we do assist in training foreign militaries in nuclear-use capabilities. 
For example, we train our NATO ally pilots how to drop nuclear weapons. We train their ground crews on how to store nuclear weapons and how to load them onto aircraft. And 110 nations have expressed concern over NATO's expansion impact on the NPT. 
The first indication of this, Mr. President, was in an article that appeared in Defense News, on March 30, saying that: 
`The 113 members of the so-called nonaligned movement, none of which have nuclear weapons, have asked conference leaders at the meeting to discuss assurances for parties to the NPT that they will not be targeted by nuclear weapons.' Stephen Young, of the British American Security Information Council was quoted in the article as adding, `If NATO won't give nuclear weapons up, and in fact continues to publicly declare nuclear weapons as part of its strategy for the future of the alliance, the fear is that some states that do not currently have nuclear weapons may become frustrated and decide to acquire them for protection.' 
Now, we have a news release from the same organization that came in just yesterday that stated that: `At the meeting of the member states of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty'--in Geneva on April 28, just 2 days ago, 110 nations of the nonaligned movement--`demanded an end to NATO nuclear-sharing arrangements.' 
A working paper representing the position of more than 110 states demands that--and I quote--`the nuclear weapons states parties to the NPT refrain from, among themselves, with non-nuclear weapons states, and with states not party to the treaty, nuclear sharing for military purposes under any kind of security arrangements.' 
Well, NATO is the only alliance which operates nuclear-sharing arrangements. Under these arrangements, somewhere between 150 to 200 U.S. nuclear weapons are deployed in the six European States: Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey. 
NATO countries, of course, have always maintained that NATO nuclear sharing is legal under the NPT because it does not involve the actual transfer of nuclear weapons unless a decision was made to go to war. 
However, the NPT regime also involves, as I stated earlier, the sharing of nuclear knowledge. So I think it is a well-grounded concern of the nonaligned nations to express their concerns about the expansion of NATO and the fact that we will begin sharing nuclear knowledge with the three new member nations. I think their fears are well founded and worth considering. 
Will we now, of course, with the addition of these three new nations, begin to share this nuclear knowledge? Are these three new nations full and absolute partners of NATO--as many have said here on the floor during the course of the debate, that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should not be second-class NATO partners but should have all of the rights, obligations, and powers inherent in any NATO member nation? If that is the case, then certainly we will begin to share nuclear knowledge with those three countries. I believe, Mr. President, that this could fly in the face of our obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Therein lies the conundrum. 
If we do proceed with NATO expansion--and it obviously looks like the votes will be here to do that--and if these three nations become full partners in NATO, as many have said they should, and obviously they will under the reading of the protocols, we then will proceed to share nuclear knowledge with those three nations. And what of nuclear capabilities? I am not saying that we will turn over control of nuclear weapons--we have not yet done that to any nation of NATO--but we could get to the point where we might turn over nuclear weapons to those three nations if, in fact, conditions warrant it. 
There is one other aspect--and I was going to offer another amendment, but I will not--the use and stationing of dual-use aircraft in these countries. Again, as members of NATO, we will be stationing aircraft in the countries that have dual uses. They can be used for conventional weapons delivery, but if fitted with the proper hard points and racks, they can also be used for nuclear weapons delivery. And will we then proceed to train ground crews and pilots in those countries in the delivery of these nuclear weapons, in their storage, and in their handling and loading capabilities? Again, I believe that we may do something which probably a lot of Senators have not thought about. That is how NATO expansion affects our obligations and our stated interest in the nonproliferation treaty. 
So I am hopeful that the President will give due consideration to this. Quite frankly, I don't know what the President can do. Either we are going to adhere to the letter and the spirit of the NPT and not share nuclear knowledge and capabilities and training with the three countries coming in, or we will share nuclear capabilities, knowledge, and training with these countries, and violate the letter and the spirit of the nonproliferation treaty. You can't have it both ways. 
Another reason why I believe this rush to approve these three nations' accession into NATO is a march to folly--to quote the Senator from Arkansas, who last night quoted Barbara Tuchman's book, `The March to Folly'--is that it just seems that the expansion has not been fully thought through, especially in the nuclear regime. If in fact we go ahead down that course, what then will Russia say? I know a lot of people have said, `Well, Russia, understands what we are doing; they haven't raised a lot of objections.' They have raised some. 
Again, as Senator Bumpers said last night, it is not now, it is when the elections are going to be held in Russia. That is when the hard-line right-wingers and the Communists will come out and say, see, we told you so. They will say that an expanded NATO in violation of oral assurances given to Mr. Gorbachev. Not only that, they could say that we have violated the nonproliferation treaty by providing nuclear capabilities to those three countries. 
Right now, the Duma has already delayed ratification of the START II treaty. Nationalist elements have begun to gain power by accusing members of the democratic party with appeasement of the West. This will just give them another bullet in their arsenal in arguing that, in fact, Russia should change its course of action. 
I was interested that former Ambassador Matlock, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union under the Bush administration, opposes NATO expansion. He stated, NATO expansion `may go down in history as the most profound strategic plunder made since the end of the cold war.' Ambassador Matlock further stated NATO enlargement `fails to take account of the real international situation following the end of the cold war, and proceeds in accord with the logic that made sense during the cold war.' 
I agree with those words of Ambassador Matlock. I don't know Ambassador Matlock, never met him, as far as I know, but I think he has given us wise counsel. He is joined by many others across the Nation. I have watched this debate unfold over the course of the last few months. As more and more knowledge has gotten out around the country as to what NATO expansion really entails, the possibility of derailing START II talks, the unknown factor of what the costs are eventually going to be, the fact that once we have opened this door and with, I am sorry to say, the defeat of the Warner amendment--it was close--with the defeat of his amendment, you can bet your bottom dollar next year elements within our country will start pushing for new nations to be brought into the NATO umbrella. 
How will we respond to those? By saying that they are less worthy that Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic? Will we say that somehow they are not ready, that we are going to have this hard dividing line in Europe? So it is going to exacerbate and cause even more tensions in Europe in the future.

With words from respected people like Matlock, and with concerns such as what I have pointed out this evening in this amendment, more opposition has come out in editorials around the country opposed to NATO expansion. The Des Moines Register, the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, the Salt Lake Tribune, and the Houston Chronicle--spanning the spectrum of the country geographically, spanning the spectrum of the country, philosophically and ideologically.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would have more articles, but I believe these are representative, geographically and philosophically, as to why we should not be rushing to expand NATO. 
I will close by saying that I will withdraw my amendment, but I wanted to lay it down as a marker. We are going to hear more about the NATO expansion treaty and what it will mean to the nonproliferation treaty with our sharing of nuclear knowledge with these three countries, all of whom, I might point out, are signatories to the NPT. I think therein lies a dilemma. To this Senator's way of thinking, I believe the NPT is more important to us and more important to the world community than the expansion of NATO to include these three countries. Again, as Barbara Tuchman said in `The March of Folly,' `I believe we are rushing into this without considering all of its ramifications, especially with nonproliferation.' 
So, Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.

I wonder if we can produce the MEMCOMS so we can look at those and see what did transpire.

Mr. HARKIN. As former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Jack Matlock warned: 
We're going to have a dilemma that we either encourage them--new NATO members--to divert resources they don't have or we end up fooling the American people about what it's going to cost them. 
That is what this amendment is about, not fooling the American people. 
My amendment does two things. It requires a full accounting of all U.S. contributions, all for NATO expansion by including the U.S. contributions to the national governments when calculating the U.S. share of enlargement costs. 
Right now, we are limited to 25 percent for the common costs. That does not take into account the national costs. What I am saying with this amendment is, sure, we will provide our fair share, but why should we do more than 25 percent. 
And please do not fall for the argument that we could not have done this for Greece and others in the past. The cold war is over. Europe is rich. These countries have money. We should not just stick U.S. taxpayers with the total bill.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as I may consume for opening comments and then reserve some time for others on the amendment. 
Mr. President, we are, as the Senate and the country now know, debating the issue of whether or not the Senate will advise and consent to the President's signature on a proposal to bring three more nations into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
While I was not present yesterday in this Chamber, I did watch some of the debate that unfolded yesterday, and I think the debate is taking a good course of action. The debate yesterday was a good debate. I hope that the debate today will continue along those lines. In other words, what I mean by that is not just people giving a speech and then walking off the floor but where we can actually engage one another in asking and answering questions about the implications of the NATO treaty. 
So I hope that will be the course of action during the Senate's responsibility to advise and consent here. 
Mr. President, I want to make some extended remarks about the whole picture of NATO expansion, but I will just talk very briefly right now about the amendment I sent to the desk. 
Basically, I think one of the most important issues facing us on NATO expansion is what it is going to cost, what it will cost the taxpayers of this country. So what I have sent to the desk is an amendment that will hopefully clear this up a little bit and provide for an accurate accounting of all of the expenses incident to the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And I will have more to say about that a little bit later. 
Concerns about the extension of our military obligations--and let's again be frank about this; NATO is a military alliance--have been voiced by Senators and interest groups, academics across the political spectrum, and when the voices expressing caution include Republicans and Democrats and progressives and conservatives, libertarians and others, such a diverse opposition may be a sign that we ought to really act very deliberately and deliberatively on this issue. So I am glad the debate has finally begun, and as I said, I am delighted with the course of action in the debate. 
At the outset, I hope the Senate would not simply rubber stamp this bill that we have before us. We have a constitutional responsibility to both advise and consent on treaties. This is a responsibility that is taken seriously by every Senator and ought to because, as you know, under our Constitution a treaty overrides the Constitution. So anytime we advise and consent on a treaty, we are advising and consenting on a document that basically overrides much of our Constitution. So we have to be very careful about this. 
There are important issues to consider in NATO expansion--burdensharing, command and coordination, responses to real and perceived threats, even the basic questions of mission and scope of the organization itself. They are not simple questions that lend themselves to a simple, sound bite debate. These questions and their answers will shape for better or worse our defense and foreign policy options for decades to come. 
There is no doubt that NATO has been one of the greatest military alliance success stories in our Nation's history. And, again, at the outset we have to ask the question. Here is an organization founded in 1949 shortly after the end of the Second World War--the Second World War in this century--when 12 countries signed the North Atlantic treaty to establish the military alliance known as NATO. 
Now, let's face it. The reason for NATO was the Soviet Union. 
 The reason for being in that alliance, and also to preserve the nations of Europe together, was to preclude any possibility of cross-border excursions by European countries. The treaty had as its goal `to unite their efforts for collective defense and the preservation of peace and security in Europe.' 
Four nations have been added. Spain, the most recent, joined in 1982. So, again, it has been a success. It has kept the peace in Europe for nearly 50 years, both by deterring aggression by the Warsaw Pact and by encouraging cooperation between its members. 
I must say, due to the commitment of its members and the leadership of the United States, NATO has largely fulfilled the reason for its very birth--the demise of the Soviet Union. So we have to, I think, at the outset, say, if something was born because of the Soviet Union and it has succeeded, what, then, are the reasons not only for continuing it but for expanding it? And, subsequently, are there better and other ways in which we can fulfill other goals, such as democracy, economic progress, market-based economies, and integration of the countries of Europe into one economic entity? 
So, what role will NATO play in a new century? And what is the cost going to be in financial terms? And what is the cost going to be in other less tangible areas, like the potential for strained relations with nonmember nations? Or what will the cost be in a dangerous rollback, perhaps, of nuclear arms control and nonproliferation progress made since the end of the cold war? 
By the administration's own admission, `Enlargement will take place in a European security environment in which there is no current threat of large-scale conventional aggression and where any such threat would take years to develop.' This is from the administration's own admission. There is no current threat and any threat would take years to develop. In response to questions from many Senators, the administration reiterated this point when they wrote, `Current members and prospective new members face no imminent threat of attack.' 
This seems to be one of the few issues on NATO expansion where we can find wide consensus. There is no large-scale external threat, including Russia. They just don't exist. The administration's expectation for the role of an expanded NATO include: 
No. 1, helping to deter future threats; No. 2, expanding our collective defense capabilities to respond to both traditional and nontraditional security challenges; and, No. 3, helping to support and stabilize emerging democracies. I agree that these are goals that the United States should pursue. They are worthwhile goals. But again I ask, is NATO the proper framework in which to accomplish these goals? 
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have legitimate concerns about protecting their borders and their national sovereignty. After all, they persevered through a century of invasions and decades of outside control by a large and powerful neighbor. But, again, let me also say that I remember when I happened to be in Moscow shortly after the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union was breaking up, I remember one of the Russian Members of the Duma telling me that, `You think you were the victims of the Soviet Union. You think Europe was the victim of the Soviet Union,' he said. `We Russians were the biggest victims of the Communist Soviet Union.' 
So we have to think about it in that context also; of Russia, and of them coming out from underneath the yoke of a Soviet Communist empire. Think about Russia, also, in terms of its history, when it has gone, also, through a century of invasions and decades of control by a power not necessarily of Russian being. 
I learned a lot about what countries in this region had endured. Last year I attended the dedication of the National Czech and Slovak Museum in Cedar Rapids, IA. 
It is interesting. I was there with President Clinton and Ambassador Madeleine Albright, who was then-Ambassador to the United Nations, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic, and President Kovac of the Republic of Slovakia. 
Again, these people of these nations have shown a commitment and resilience to the democratic ideals during the economic and political transition. They are working in concert with the community of nations and peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, in Iraq also. I want to commend and recognize their efforts. That is all well and good. But is that a reason to expand NATO? 
I am not convinced it is the most appropriate vehicle that we can use to get the goals of security, stability, political reform, and economic integration with the West sought by these newly free countries. 
I am really worried we are buying into a mentality that has its roots in the cold war, and not the mentality that is looking ahead to the next century. Yes, it is true that Europe has sustained decades, almost a century, of warfare, invasions, domination and oppression by the people of Eastern Europe. This approach to foreign policy would be appropriate if the world climate was similar to what it was, say, before World War II. But the world has changed. 
To those who say that, well, we can have another cross-border invasion by a country in Europe against another country, even the administration admits this is not going to happen. This would not happen for years. It would take years for anything like this to develop. You are not about to see any headlines exclaiming that Russian troops are marching toward Poland or Czechoslovakia. 
The czars are gone. The Third Reich is gone. Germany is united as a democracy. Again, we need to reorient ourselves to the realities of the 21st century where the security threats are not czars and Hitlers and people like that, but are more likely to be rogue nations, international terrorists, and, as we have seen again in Europe, internal ethnic clashes. 
For example, the security threat of most concern to Europe now is Bosnia and Kosovo. There is also the so-called nontraditional threat--terrorism, chemical, biological weapons. Again, we need to consider, is NATO the best way to deal with these challenges? But my primary concern now, and with this amendment, is the cost. 
In February of 1997, the administration estimated the total cost of between $27 to $35 billion, of which the U.S. share would be $1.5 to $2 billion. 
In December, NATO released their own study with the astonishingly low total cost estimate of $1.5 billion. Well, then the Clinton administration revised their initial projections down to reflect the NATO estimate of $1.5 billion. 
Some would argue that comparing these numbers is like comparing apples and oranges--I heard that--because of the different assumptions and scenarios. But I would argue that is exactly the point. We do not have any consensus or concrete ideas on what posture NATO will take in the future and at what cost. 
I have a chart here that shows basically the varying cost estimates so we get an idea of just how widely divergent they are. NATO, as I said, estimates $1.5 billion. The Clinton administration initially, as I said, came in last year--a year ago--at $27 to $35 billion. Now the administration says it is $1.5 billion. They just picked up the NATO estimate. CBO has given us a range of $21 to $125 billion. The Rand Corporation says it is $10 to $110 billion. 
As I said, the first Clinton administration estimate was $27 billion to $35 billion--to $1.5 billion. So we go from $1.5 billion to $125 billion. 
Where is it? How much of this will the U.S. taxpayers have to pick up? The GAO issued a report late last fall, the title of which explains my concerns and the reason for this amendment. It says, `NATO Enlargement Cost Implications for the United States Remain Unclear.' 
Now, much of the uncertainty is because--a quote from the 
 GAO report--`It will not be until June of 1998 that NATO will make decisions about whether or how much to increase the common budgets which would then be shared among current and new members. Until this has been done, the implications for the U.S. contributions to NATO's common budgets will be unclear.' 
Now, again, this is one reason why several other Senators and I asked for a delay in voting on NATO expansion. I felt and some others felt that we should have delayed this until this summer. We are not going to get this NATO estimate until at least June of this year. So why should we be voting on a blank check for the American taxpayer before we have the data? What is the rush? Why could we not wait until this summer until we get the NATO decisions on how much they want to increase their common budgets? 
The same GAO report went on to discuss the financing for commonly funded items, such as the needed infrastructure to send reinforcements to new allies in times of crisis, communications systems, or interoperability with NATO's air defense system. None has been agreed to yet. None of it has been agreed upon yet. 
Again, from the GAO report: `Whether they will be financed within existing budgets or by increasing the size of NATO's common budgets will not be determined until June of 1998.' 
That is from the GAO report. 
I am hopeful that the managers of the bill would engage with us in discussing why we would go ahead with this before we have this data that NATO will come up with in June of 1998. So that is a missing piece of the puzzle right there. 
Another piece of the puzzle we are missing is how new members are to address their military shortfalls. The countries' force goals will not be set again until this spring. In other words, we are without a plan to address the force goals and the price tag associated with it. 
Again, I and others are uncomfortable signing the American taxpayers' names to a potentially ballooning blank check, so that is a second part of this puzzle that I believe is missing. 
The GAO concluded that while DOD's key assumptions were reasonable, their `cost estimates' are speculative. `NATO enlargement could entail costs in addition to those included in DOD's estimate, including costs for assistance to enhance the PFP or other bilateral assistance for countries not invited to join NATO in July 1997.' 
So, in other words, it is not just those countries invited to join. What about the cost for assistance and other vital assistance for all of the other countries not invited to join in July 1997?

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator is making my point. My friend from Delaware is making my point. We are limited to 25 percent of the common budgets. All of the cost estimates we keep hearing about only deal with the common budgets. We don't talk about the national budget. What my amendment says is what is good for one side ought to be good for the other. We are not mixing the two. We are applying a good, sound principle. If 25 percent is good for the common budgets, it ought to be good for the national budgets. That is what my amendment says. It says to the American people, look, you are right, we don't know what it is going to cost us in the future. The Senator just stated that. He said that we don't know what it may cost us in the future. 
What this amendment says is that at no time will the portion of the national budgets of these countries or any other new members of NATO be more than 25 percent, so that if some cost comes in at $10 billion, our share, the share of the American people, will be no more than 25 percent. The other nations of NATO will have to kick in their proportionate share, also. 
That is why I drafted this amendment. People don't understand the difference between the common budgets and the national budgets. We keep hearing from the Clinton administration that this is only going to cost us $400 million--as I pointed out, we already promised as much as $1.069 billion in loans and subsidies to Eastern and Central Europe--because they are talking about the common budgets, not about the national budgets of these countries. The Senator from Delaware is exactly right. My amendment seeks to say that no more than 25 percent of those would be paid for by the American taxpayers. I would think the Senator would support that.

Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the correction of the Senator from West Virginia. 
Back to my point; the Senator from Delaware is right. If this amendment had been in effect 40 years ago, we couldn't have been in Greece. But that was during the cold war. That is when we were facing the Soviet Union. That is when we were facing, if I might say to the Senator from Delaware, facing a Europe that was on its knees, busted, broke, basically decapitated from World War II. There is no way that they could have done it on their own. That is why I say with this whole NATO argument that it just seems to me we are arguing about a world that existed 50 years ago. The Senator from Delaware in his impassioned pleas is arguing for a situation that no longer exists. Europe is powerful. Europe is wealthy, and the nations' GNPs are going up. There is no Soviet Union. There is no external threat like Greece was facing. Europe has been rebuilt. The cold war is over. Let's look ahead. 
What I am saying is that I don't believe, in the context of a Europe that we see now and in the foreseeable future, that our taxpayers ought to be liable for the national costs anymore in excess of what they are liable right now for the common costs. That is what this amendment says. Very simply, it says very forthrightly, `Any future United States subsidy of the national expenses of Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic to meet its NATO commitments, including the assistance described in subparagraph (c), may not exceed 25 percent of all assistance provided to that country by all NATO members.' 
When it comes to tanks, planes, or anything else, of course, we can still sell them. They can still buy from us. But our subsidy to this national effort cannot be more than 25 percent of the total amount of subsidies by all of the countries for that national effort----

mentions Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. It is just those three countries that we are talking about and about their national costs. There may be other arrangements in Europe. There may be other structures in which we are engaged that are not covered by this amendment.

Those are the three countries that are going to have a lot of money for interoperability, command, communications, force structures. That is where the money is going to go. I didn't want to say anything about the other countries. I don't think it is necessary for these other countries because we are not going to be involved in that kind of expenditure. That is why I limited it specifically to those three countries and why I respectfully demur from the Senator's comments that we could not be involved in other aspects of NATO beyond the 25 percent. We absolutely could. That is why I want to focus on those three countries only because that is where the money is going to be spent for force structure and modernization. I don't believe we ought to give a blank check.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. That says it very clearly and very eloquently, and I think brings the point home again. I 
say to the manager of the bill that when you talk about $1.5 billion, that is one of the common costs. That is why we are trying to reach out and find out what these other costs associated with it are. These NATO's costs, as I have pointed out, we have already allocated over $1 billion ourselves of taxpayer dollars for this. 
I also say in response to the comments of the Senator from Delaware about what happens in the future that, if there is an emergency or something happens where you have changed circumstances, I would respond with the same enjoinder that he gave to this Senator; that is, I believe it is important now to limit our taxpayers' exposure rather than a blank check. If there is an emergency in the future, if something does happen, yes, the Appropriations Committee will respond. The Foreign Relations Committee and the authorizing committee will respond. The Armed Services Committee in their capacity as authorizing committee will respond. The appropriators will respond. It is better to address it at that point rather than giving a blank check now and just sort of letting it go. I think from a budgetary standpoint, from the standpoint of protecting our taxpayer dollars better, we limit it now, and then, if there is an emergency, fine, we can come up with the money and finance the emergency.

Mr. HARKIN. I am sure the Senator will yield me some more off his time, because I have been so yielding to him. 
I think the analogy that the Senator from Delaware uses is totally wrong. Let me provide, I think, a more correct one. This amendment in no way limits how much total defense dollars we can provide to these three countries--not at all. It simply says, whatever their national budget, we will only pay 25 percent. So the Senator's analogy that we are somehow going to cap defense spending is not right. 
A better analogy, if I might say to my friend from Delaware, is this. We do have a defense budget in the United States. It is $260 billion. Let's say that for national emergency reasons, or whatever threat might come up, we have to increase it to $300 billion a year. But what we are going to do is tax the citizens of Delaware for half of it, and then we will spread the other half among the other 49 States of the Union. That is the more correct analogy as to what my amendment seeks to do. 
Now, certainly we would not say to the citizens of Delaware, `We are going to increase the defense budget. You have to pick up 50 percent of the total.' No. We would spread it out, make everybody pay a fair, proportionate share. That is what my amendment says. My amendment in no way limits the total amount of defense money spent on these three countries.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, this amendment does not preclude increased subsidies as long as we only pay our fair share. That is the point I was making prior to the Senator's comments. 
But, again, is the Senator arguing that, again, this is going to cost a lot more than the $400 million that the administration has suggested--that this could really balloon in the years ahead? That is what I am concerned about. What is this going to cost? We are told it is only going to cost us $400 million. But now I hear the Senator saying maybe, if a country there decides to buy some expensive military hardware, we will want to jump in and subsidize our sales, so, therefore, we don't give it? I mean, nothing is given? It is not free; the taxpayers pay for it. And that bothers me. It doesn't preclude the sale of weapons; it just means it must be a fair share. 
Again, I probably agree with the Senator that my amendment would preclude the kind of giveaway programs that cost our taxpayers a lot of money in order to maybe help one of these countries modernize to the point where they may not need it. But as long as it is free to them and costs our taxpayers, why not give it to them?

Mr. HARKIN. The Senator talks about prices. Again, with all due respect, when a crisis happens, Congress responds. Again, just from a budgeting standpoint, from being perhaps a little tightfisted with taxpayer dollars, and not giving sort of a blank check and saying, `Fill it in,' I think by having a cap on these costs, a national cost that I propose equivalent to what we do in our common costs, that it precludes a kind of runaway giveaway. 
It is like, OK, Hungary wants to upgrade their capabilities in a certain area, so we say, `Oh, wonderful. You need not the $1.98 version, you need the $100 version.' But Congress says, `We can't afford the $100 version.' We say, `Not to worry. We'll give it to you. That will be one of our grants. We will subsidize it, and you will get ours.' 
Again, I must respectfully say to my friend from Connecticut, this is a whole new vineyard, this debate about jobs. I thought this was about democracy and markets and peacekeeping. Now we are talking about jobs. I find this debate now is veering off course a little bit. 
To answer the question as forthrightly as I can, yes, I am saying that if one of these three countries want the $1.98 version, we could give up a 25-percent subsidy for that. We would not come in with a $100 version and say taxpayers are going to pay for the whole thing. Yes, that is exactly what I mean.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will respond with a couple of things. 
First of all, I have to ask again the question: Can these three members, these three nations, can they afford membership in NATO or can they not? Can they afford to bear the burden or can they not? We have been told they can. One of the requirements for membership is they can pay the tab. These three nations have stated over and over they could afford it. 
Now I am hearing, wait a minute, no, maybe they can't, because now we will have to give them a lot of subsidies to buy weapons systems. Well, if that is the case, then do they have the economic strength to join NATO? It seems like we cannot have it both ways. If they have the economic strength, why do they need all the subsidies? If they don't, are they really capable of joining NATO? 
Secondly, yes, I am concerned about these types of giveaway programs and loans and grants. I say to my friend from Connecticut, we have--I have been on the Defense Appropriations Committee for several years now, and I have been in some aviation things going back almost 20 years, both in the House and the Senate. I say to my friend from Connecticut, we have always been faced with other countries subsidizing, in many cases more than we ever subsidized our arms manufacturers. 
So how do we beat them? We beat them because we make the best 
products. We have the best quality. No one can match our aircraft. No one can match our weapons systems. No one can match not only the quality but the kind of support infrastructure that we can provide for those weapons systems. So other countries might have to subsidize theirs a little bit more, but only because they cannot match us in those areas. So we have been quite capable of competing and winning in the world market our share of defense items in the past. I do not think that will change in the future. 
So in the last decade we have written off or forgiven over $10 billion in default of loans on military-related items on this. I think, again, we have to be very careful about this. We are told it will only cost us $400 million, but now what I hear is no, that is only for the common costs. This could go up and up and up and up, subsidy after subsidy after subsidy. 
Then we hear that is only if there is a crisis. Fine. If there is a crisis we will address it then. But even the administration has said any threat to Europe to these nations is not imminent and would take years to develop. So we are not facing something that might happen in the next few months or even in the next couple of years or so, even according to the administration's own admission. 
Therefore, I submit once more, Mr. President, that to keep the costs down, to be honest with the taxpayers of this country, what my amendment says is what is good for the common costs--that is, we limit our involvement to 25 percent--that we should limit the 25 percent, for subsidies for all of those national costs, also. That is all this amendment does. My friend from Oregon, my amendment does not stop NATO expansion. It simply says no longer will our taxpayers simply pick up the tab. 
I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to briefly touch on an issue the Senator from Connecticut mentioned, and that is lobbying by defense contractors. 
At the outset, I want to say that I have not been contacted by any either. I don't know that my staff has; at least they haven't told me that. I respond by reading from an article that appeared in the New York Times on March 30, which I obviously got off the Internet, in which the writer of the article went on to say that `The chief vehicle of support for NATO expansion is a group called `The U.S. Committee to Expand NATO'.' The president of that innocent-sounding group is Bruce Jackson, director of strategic planning for Lockheed, a vice president for Lockheed for strategic planning. 
Mr. President, again, a lot of these people have been championing NATO membership for these countries. He quoted me as saying that `This may amount to `a Marshall Plan' for defense contractors who are chomping at the bit to sell weapons and make profits.' Well, I am a Democrat, and it says, `A top Republican aide joked that the arms makers were so eager for NATO expansion, we will probably be giving landlocked Hungary a new navy.' Those are just musings and comments by various and sundry people. 
Again, this gets back to the question of whether or not we are going to ask the taxpayers of this country to provide subsidies over, above, and beyond what they kind of have been told in terms of NATO expansion as to what the costs would be. Yes, if these countries are going to upgrade their weapons system, sure. Do I want our defense contractors to be in there to provide them the necessary resources they need for defense? Absolutely. But do I want them there when the taxpayers say--as I pointed out to my friend from Connecticut, which we have seen so often in the past, for one of those countries may say that we need a certain system and it cost $1.98. Since there is no limit on the subsidies, one of our contractors could come in and say: You don't need the $1.98 one, you need the $100 version. Hungry, Poland, or the Czech Republic may say: We can't afford that. The contractor may say: Not to worry. You see, under the situation we have now, the U.S. taxpayers will provide the subsidy for it and you can go ahead and have it. 
Once again, our taxpayers are stuck with it. I think that is 
the normal course. If there is a crisis, as has been stated many times, well, this would hamstring us in terms of a crisis. Again, I point out that no one is saying there is any imminent threat of any crisis at all. The administration says that for years ahead Russia is no threat. So if, in fact, a crisis comes up in the future--in the distant future--we have time to react, we have time on both the authorizing committee and on the appropriating committee to make changes, to make sure these countries have the adequate and necessary defense capabilities to defend themselves. But to just give a blank check now, I think, is wrong. I think it will cost the taxpayers of this country untold billions of dollars, unless we put the same cap on our subsidies for national expenses that we have on the common costs. 
We have agreed with our fellow member nations in NATO that on the common costs we would provide about 25 percent. I see no reason why that same logic cannot prevail and be used to cap our exposure on the national costs. In fact, I have gotten an idea this morning that I may offer another amendment to this bill, and that is to get other member countries of NATO to also agree that their subsidies, their proportion of the national costs, would not exceed what their proportion is under the common costs. Now, we cannot force them to do that, but it seems to me that should be one of the negotiating principles that we would use with other countries when they want to expand and enlarge NATO. In fact, it kind of comes as a surprise to me that we did not do that in the beginning. If we really want honest accounting, and we want the European countries that are quite wealthy now to bear their fair share of the costs, it seems to me that we should have insisted in the beginning that the same proportionality that pertains to the common costs should pertain to the national costs. To me, this is a gaping hole, and the first place to close it is here with this bill, by saying that the United States will provide no more than its 25-percent share of those national costs. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve my time.  
Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Susan Collins, in the introduction of the `Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998.' This bill tries to fix what we believe to be an unintended injustice in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
As many of you know, home health agencies have historically been reimbursed on the basis of costs. The Health Care Financing Administration paid each agency to cover the cost of providing care. This arrangement has been widely criticized because of offers no incentive for agencies to control their costs. 
In order to correct this, we in Congress agreed that Medicare should move to a prospective payment system to control costs and ensure quality and access to care. The Balanced Budget Act establishes this system for home health, effective as of October 1, 1999. In the mean time, an interim payment system has been put in place. These changes were needed in order to rein in the incredible growth--some due to inappropriate payments--in the industry in the last seven years. In 1990, Medicare spent $3.7 billion on home health care. In 1996, $16.7 billion was spent. In addition, the average number of visits per beneficiary soared from 26 in 1990 to 76 in 1996. 
I believe the change to the prospective payment system had to be done. However, the interim payment system will reward high-cost, inefficient home health provides at the expense of those home health agencies that have historically kept their costs low. I don't believe this was the intent of Congress, and that is why I am cosponsoring Senator Collins' bill to correct this injustice. 
As co-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I've been working for a long time to change the big city, urban bias in Medicare's reimbursement payments. It penalizes more conservative cost-effective approaches to health care, and that hurts rural areas like Iowa. We went a long way towards fixing that bias in Balanced Budget Act by equalizing Medicare's reimbursement payments for managed care services. 
But unbeknownst to me and, I believe, most of my colleagues, while we provided rural equity in one area, we took it away in another. It is just common sense that we should reward those who provide quality care in a cost-effective, efficient manner. We did this when we changed the Medicare managed care rates. It doesn't seem right that in the same Act, we created an interim payment system for home health services that rewards the high cost, wasteful agencies and leaves those that have successfully kept their costs low struggling to survive. 
The system's reliance on a provider's historical costs in determining their reimbursement amounts has produced an uneven playing field. Many of the newer agencies, who got started during a period of high growth, now have a competitive advantage. They will now be reimbursed at a higher rate than their lower cost competitors. 
Senator Collins' bill does the right thing--it rewards those agencies who have done the most to save Medicare money. These include many visiting nurse associations, non-profit free standing agencies and most non-profit hospital based programs. 
The Home Health Equity Act will revise the current system of reimbursement based on 75 percent of agency cost blended with 25 percent of national costs. The legislation would create a 75 percent national rate blended with 25 percent regional rate to level payments to providers in a given geographic area. In addition, this bill continues the cost savings that the interim payment system was intended to achieve. Price Waterhouse has analyzed the bill and found it to be budget neutral. 
If we don't fix the interim payment system, I am afraid we risk a reduction in access to and quality of health care for Iowa seniors. Iowa home health care agencies have historically provided efficient, quality service and they ought to be rewarded, not punished for this. Most importantly, rural patients and their families deserve continued access to the best possible care.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just over two years ago I stood on this floor as the Senate voted overwhelmingly in support of a historic rewrite of the 1934 telecommunications act. We were told at that time that the act would bring the benefits of competition in local telephone exchange service--better service and lower prices for the American consumer. 
One part of that legislation in which I had a personal interest were the provisions concerning the burglar and fire alarm industry--a highly competitive industry still dominated by small businesses. Many of us, both in the House and the Senate, feared that allowing the Regional Bells to enter the market prior to real competition in the local telephone exchanges would result in the Bells using their business monopolies and vast financial resources to drive small alarm dealers out of business. 
That is why Congress adopted a five year transitional waiting period before the Bells could enter the alarm monitoring business. The bill made an exception for Ameritech. 
The Ameritech exception was included because Ameritech had already purchased two large alarm companies--before the bill was passed. However, these acquisitions were quite controversial because they were made during a time when all of the Bells had agreed not to enter this line of business until the legislative rules had been established. Only Ameritech broke that understanding. Nonetheless, the Congress felt it was better to grandfather those acquisitions rather than to force a divestiture. 
However, in order to insure that we were not granting a five year competitive advantage to Ameritech over the other Bells, who had kept their pledge not to enter the business, we specifically prohibited further growth by acquisition during the five year transition period. We, in effect, told Ameritech that it could stay in the alarm monitoring business, but that its growth would be restricted to direct marketing to customers. 
And, to make our intentions crystal clear, several Senators, including then Majority Leader Bob Dole, engaged in a floor colloquy on the subject when the bill was being considered. At one point I said: 
 There is one issue which deserves some additional clarification. The bill and the report language clearly prohibit any Bell company already in the industry from purchasing another alarm company for 5 years from date of enactment. However, it is not entirely clear whether such a Bell could circumvent the prohibition by purchasing the underlying customer accounts and assets of an alarm company, but not the company itself. It was my understanding that the conferees intended to prohibit for 5 years the acquisition of other alarm companies in any form, including the purchases of customer accounts and assets. 
The two managers of the bill, Commerce Committee Chairman Pressler and Ranking member Hollings, both agreed on the record that my understanding was correct. 
Despite that clarification in the formal proceedings, Ameritech disregarded Congressional intent. Soon after passage of the bill, Ameritech went out and purchased the customer accounts and assets of Circuit City's alarm monitoring division. 
When the alarm industry challenged Ameritech's action, a divided FCC Committee supported Ameritech. For reasons I don't understand, all the commissioners--except for Susan Ness in a vehement dissent--said that purchasing the customer accounts and assets was permissible so long as Ameritech did not purchase any of the stock. 
This opened the flood gate. During the next 16 months, Ameritech purchased over 550,000 customers by acquiring the assets and customer accounts of: Republic Industries alarm division, the 7th largest company in the alarm industry; Rollins, the 10th largest company in the industry; Masada, the 20th largest company in the industry; Central Control and Alarm, the 40th largest company in the industry; and Norman, the 46th largest company in the industry. 
This acquisition binge was exactly what Congress wanted to avoid when it created the five year transitional waiting period. The industry's fears of market domination by those companies which control the local telephone exchanges--the alarm industry's lifeline--have proven to be justified. 
In the late 1980's and early 1990's, just before Congress embarked on its effort to transform the telecommunications industry, there were approximately 13,000 alarm companies in this country employing over 120,000 workers. By 1997, that number had dropped dramatically to 10,750 companies and 90,000 workers--according to an industry source, Freeman & Associates. 
At the same time, there was significant consolidation among the top 100 alarm companies. Most industry experts agree that several top 100 companies have concluded that they would have to consolidate to compete with the rapidly expanding Ameritech. This hastened the demise of many small alarm companies, driven out of business by having to compete with the new giants in the industry, especially Ameritech. 
At the same time that small companies were being driven out of business, there have been dramatic layoffs in the companies Ameritech acquired. Just last year, Ameritech's SecurityLink alarm division announced layoffs of over 1,500 workers out of a workforce of 8,000. 
One example of this can be found in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. About 20 years ago, my friend Patrick Egan started his own small alarm company, Commonwealth Security Systems, Inc. He built his company into a significant regional player with 11 offices and a central monitoring station in Lancaster. He employed over 200 people in Lancaster alone. 
In January of 1997, believing that he had won the battle against Ameritech purchasing alarm monitoring companies, Patrick sold his business to Republic Industries. He sold with the understanding that all of his employees would be retained, monitoring would continue in Lancaster, and he would remain on as President of Republic Industries' Mid-Atlantic operations. During the short period Republic owned Commonwealth Security Systems, they significantly expanded operations and doubled the size of its workforce from 200 to 400. 
However, thirty four weeks later, Ameritech's SecurityLink came in and purchased all the customer accounts and assets of Republic's alarm division. That day, Ameritech chose to let Patrick go. Then, it proceeded to layoff nearly 100 of the Lancaster-based employees. More layoffs are expected as SecurityLink eliminates its Lancaster monitoring station as well as 22 others across North America. Not only are jobs lost, but also the industry is convinced that safety is compromised. 
Last December 30, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stepped in and vacated the FCC's ruling that precipitated the buying binge in the first place. 
In its ruling, the Court said, `When the purported (by the Commission) `plain meaning' of a statute's word or phrase happens to render the statue senseless, we encountering ambiguity rather than clarity. . . So [it is] here.' The Court continued: `The Commission's interpretation means that although Section 275 (a) (2) precluded Ameritech from acquiring even one share of Circuit City's stock, Ameritech was free to acquire the company's entire alarm monitoring services division--lock, stock, and barrel. We asked the Commission counsel at oral argument what possible rationale Congress could have had in mind if this is what it intended.' The FCC's counsel has not provided a cogent answer to the court's question. 
I share the court's confusion. I know what we meant when we adopted Section 275 and Ameritech certainly knew what we meant. But that did not stop Ameritech's management. It has been their intention all along to push as far and as hard as they could while they had their unique advantage over the other Bells. They would hope that either the FCC or the courts would sustain their position. They have deep financial pockets which they have relied upon in the hope that they could drive the alarm industry into submission. 
But that's not going to happen. The Court has signaled that an interpretation of Section 275 which circumvents the prohibition on purchases by specifying the method of purchase does not adhere with what Congress intended. The Court has directed the FCC to issue an interpretation of Section 275 which makes sense. It is my hope that the Commission in its next ruling will send a clear and unambiguous message to Ameritech that it must cease and desist from flaunting the law and should be ordered to divest itself of any customer accounts or assets it acquired after the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
Congress clearly intended to prohibit Ameritech from acquiring all or any part of an alarm monitoring company in any form. It's time for Ameritech to realize that. The only way they will, though, is if the FCC forces them to follow the law.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a couple of minutes about a conference report that is now before the Senate which is of the utmost urgency that we proceed to and pass yet today. I am hopeful we can do it. That is S. 1150. It is the agricultural research bill which we passed here last year by unanimous consent. What happened is, the House passed it also last year but the House, for one reason or another, refused to go to conference, and then the session ended last year. 
About 3 weeks ago, the House finally consented to go to conference. We went to conference. We worked out our agreements on a very important bill. And that bill now is before the Senate. 
In the ag research bill, there are at least three very important parts: The ag research; crop insurance, to work out the problems in crop insurance so we can have a disaster crop insurance program for the next 5 years; and there is also a food stamp provision for refugees and the asylees that were inadvertently left out of the welfare-to-work reform bill that we passed in August of 1996. 
We need to pass this bill today. It is of the utmost urgency. We have over 717,000 catastrophic crop insurance policies in America today, farmers all over this country, from California to Maryland, from North Dakota to Texas. All rely upon this crop insurance program. 
If we don't pass this bill very soon, those policies will start to lapse and those farmers who have to plant in the summertime for winter crops will not be able to get their crop insurance. That means if they were to have a natural disaster that would wipe them out completely, they would be in here to Congress again begging us to bail them out. That is why it is so important we pass this today. 
Now, why today? Because we have a very strange parliamentary situation. If we don't pass it today and this budget passes tomorrow, which it will, then we lose all the money that we have for crop insurance to help out our farmers. I might also add, we lose the money that is in there to meet a need for refugees and asylees who are legal immigrants in this country. Some of them, like the Hmong who fought alongside our American troops in Laos during the Vietnam war, were inadvertently cut out of the welfare reform bill. This is in the bill before us, S. 1150. 
As I said, S. 1150 had bipartisan support in conference, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate. We worked out all the differences. There are no objections in our committees to this. That is why it is so vitally important that we pass it today. 
I guess I ask here on the floor, the majority leader, and to the staff who are here, if they could possibly bring up S. 1150 today, sometime by the end of the day. I don't know if the managers of the bill would mind if we set it aside for 15 minutes--I don't think it would take longer than that; after all, it passed by unanimous consent last year--and pass it today. I don't think it would take much time. As I said, I am sure Senator Lugar, being the chairman, and I, the ranking minority member, don't need more than 15 minutes on this bill. It is vitally important, because if we don't pass it, we will lose the crop insurance for our farmers, especially those who need to plant summer crops. 
I yield to Senator Conrad from North Dakota.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank both Senators from North Dakota for their strong voices and strong support for the crop insurance program. 
To sum it up, our farmers, our refugees, our asylees, should not be penalized because of the delay on the part of the House last year--not going to conference--and they should not be penalized because of this odd parliamentary situation we have. 
I hope the majority leader and his staff who are listening to this will hopefully bring up this bill today, and let's get it passed. I don't think it will take more than 10 or 15 minutes to get the job done and we can say to our farmers that their crop insurance policies are, indeed, going to be renewed for next year. 
I thank both of the managers of the bill for yielding us this time to talk about this very important subject.

Mr. HARKIN. 
Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleagues Senators John Chafee, Bob Graham in introducing the first bipartisan comprehensive proposal to cut youth smoking--The Kids Deserve Freedom From Tobacco Act, or simply, The KIDS Act. Today marks the turning point in the drive for tobacco reform this year. 
Before I go further, I want to thank my partners in this effort, John Chafee and Bob Graham. They are real heroes in the fight to save kids from tobacco. They've taken significant risks in joining this effort. And they have done a terrific job in putting our proposal together. This has truly been a bipartisan team effort. 
I also want thank the leaders of the public health community who have joined us to support our efforts. They will play a critical role in shaping the course of this historic tobacco reform effort in the coming months. And their support is vital to the success of The KIDS Act. Finally, I want to thank Dr. C. Everett Koop and Dr. David Kessler, for their help and counsel to us in crafting our proposal. 
We are introducing this bill because we face a public health crisis affecting our children. 3,000 kids start smoking every day and fully 1,000 of them will die prematurely because of it. That's the equivalent of 3 jumbo jets packed with kids crashing every day. 400,000 Americans die every year of tobacco related illness at a cost of over $50 billion. And the tobacco industry has been engaged in a systematic campaign of distortion and deceit to hook kids and hide the facts from the American people. 
Tobacco reform is the issue of 1998. It is the crown jewel of this Congress. And passing a tobacco bill like the KIDS Act is a once and a lifetime opportunity. Unfortunately, though, the tobacco debate so far has been largely partisan. That's why we've joined arms across party lines behind the KIDS Act. We hope and believe that the introduction of our bipartisan bill will change the debate and significantly increase the odds that reforms will be made. 
The KIDS Act would cut tobacco use by kids in half over the next three years through aggressive and comprehensive reforms. That's the sharpest and fastest reduction achieved by any bill proposed to date. Our goal is to cut it by at least 65 percent shortly after that. The Food and Drug Administration has found that reducing the use of tobacco by children by 50 percent could prevent well over 60,000 premature deaths every year, and will save up to $43 billion annually in reduced medical costs and improved productivity. 
Now is not the time for anything but the strongest, most effective bill possible. 
Experts agree that a substantial price hike over a very short period of time is key to changing teen smoking behavior. If left unchanged, the Commerce Committee draft bill, which spreads a $1.10 price increase over 5 years will do little to impact teen smoking. In contrast, the KIDS Act increases the price by $1.50 in just two years, achieving a 50% reduction in just three years. That's the bottom line and anything less is just smoke and mirrors. 
In addition, our bill gets tough on the individual companies that addict the most kids by imposing tough penalties if the company doesn't meet teen smoking reduction targets. I'm very concerned that the Commerce Committee proposes no company-specific penalty. Without a profit-based deterrent, the penalty will just be passed through to consumers, giving companies no incentive to cut youth smoking. 
Finally, our bill caps the annual liability of the tobacco industry as part of a tough, comprehensive bill that dramatically reduces youth smoking. Without a tough public health bill, the annual liability cap is not acceptable. 
As Drs. Koop and Kessler say in their letter, our bill is `tough medicine for a tough problem.' Our proposal sends a simple message to the tobacco industry: Keep away from our kids. Our plan will be a very, very bitter pill for the industry. And no doubt they will criticize us. But in the end, I believe they are going to have to swallow it. 
Creating a more sensible policy toward tobacco has been a goal of mine for many years. It was in 1977, over 21 years ago, that I first introduced legislation calling for repeal of the tax deductibility of tobacco advertising and marketing. 
Unfortunately, victories in the tobacco wars have come few and far between. In 1988, we finally changed federal law on smoking in airplanes. It was a full ten years later, and after failing one time, the Senate took its next step last September by passing the Harkin-Chafee plan to fully fund enforcement of the FDA youth ID check. 
But I am more hopeful now than ever that we can pass a comprehensive plan that would once and for all change how this nation deals with tobacco and dramatically cut the number of our kids addicted to this deadly product. Mr. President, our goal is to be on the Senate floor three years from now announcing that indeed, child smoking has been cut in half. We're going to put all our energies into making that happen. 
We urge our colleagues to review our proposal and join us in sponsoring it. We look forward to working with all our colleagues on a bicameral, bipartisan basis to make good on the historic opportunity we have this year.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1998. I would like to thank Senator Kennedy and Jeffords for all their work on this important piece of legislation. I'd also like to commend the work of their staff, Connie Garner and Chris Crowley. 
Many individuals receiving SSI and SSDI want to work and are able to work. But less than 1/2 of 1% of these individuals leave the Social Security rolls and become self-sufficient. Clearly, there is something wrong with the system. 
When we enacted the ADA, we put our nation on a new path. A path toward independence, not dependence. Toward inclusion, not exclusion. Toward empowerment, not paternalism. The ADA opened the door to employment opportunities for people with disabilities. 
Today, we take another major step along that path. The Work Incentives Improvement Act removes artificial impediments faced by people with disabilities when they are ready to work. The bill offers persons with disabilities affordable and accessible health care, so that they no longer have to face the choice between working and paying taxes, on the one hand, or having access to health care benefits on the other. 
In the wake of the ADA, we must now bring our other federal policies into the 1990s. This Act begins to do that. Access to health care is critical if people with disabilities are to live independently and remain self-sufficient. If we can provide a reasonable support structure for people with disabilities who can work and who want to work, then we should. It's the right thing to do. 
Things usually don't get done because they are right. They get done because people stand up and take action. Now is the time to take action on this issue. If our efforts here are successful, Americans with disabilities will no longer face disincentives for working, for wanting a piece of the American dream, for remaining vital members of our society, and for reminding all of us that disabled does not mean unable. 
I hope my colleagues in the Senate quickly take action on this bill, and that this bill soon becomes law.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak just for a few minutes about the issue of the NATO expansion that has come to the floor today. As I understand the parliamentary situation, the NATO expansion resolution has been laid down, we are now in morning business, and we will not be back on the NATO expansion resolution until sometime later--not tomorrow--maybe later this week or maybe next week or beyond. 
I am hopeful at the outset that even though the bill has been laid down, the Senate will be given time for due discussion and debate on the proposed NATO expansion. Quite frankly, I was one of those who signed a letter with my colleague Senator Smith from New Hampshire and, if I am not mistaken, 17 other Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, asking that the debate on the proposed NATO expansion be suspended or postponed for a while. I will get into the reasons for that in just a moment. I am sorry it is now before the Senate. I think it should have been postponed for very good and sufficient reasons. 
This is an issue with profound implications for our Nation and the international community. It is also an issue that, I am disappointed to say, has not received the kind of vigorous national debate that it deserves. I was asked the other day when I was in my home State of Iowa about the NATO expansion bill and what kind of interest was in it. I said basically it is a big yawn. No one is talking about it, very few people are writing about it, and yet this may be the most serious vote that we take this year in the U.S. Senate. 
Quite frankly, even though I respect the Foreign Relations Committee, they have had a lot of hearings on it I know, they have had witnesses in, but still it has not received the kind of national debate and national focus that it really deserves. I think we are kind of rushing this issue right now in light of the fact that there is supposed to be a NATO study that is due this June. Again, I will talk about that in a moment. 
Taking such a huge step in foreign policy with such low levels of awareness among the public and even in Congress is not a good idea. The debate or, more accurately, I should say the lack of debate on this important policy question has concerned and surprised me. Moving forward before legitimate concerns and competing viewpoints receive a complete airing does not seem prudent. The usually deliberative Senate seems to be in a rush to pass judgment on this issue. I ask, what's the rush? 
Concerns about the extension of America's military obligations have been voiced by Members, interest groups and academics across the political spectrum. One must observe more than just casually that when the voices expressing caution include progressives, conservatives, libertarians and others, Republicans and Democrats, such diverse opposition may be a sign to act more slowly and deliberatively on this issue. 
Let me be clear, I have not yet decided how I will vote on NATO expansion. If I had to vote tomorrow, I would vote no, because I believe, more often than not, that is the safest way to proceed when one does not have all the information that one needs and when there are, I think, sufficient questions about the expansion and what it is going to cost and what its implications for our foreign policy will be. However, later on, after more information is gleaned in a vigorous public debate, I might be inclined to vote for it. But at the present time, I cannot support it without more information and without some more enlightenment as to the actual cost figures. 
Without a comprehensive consideration of the issues surrounding NATO expansion, I am concerned that we will continually have to revisit potentially divisive issues, such as cost and burdensharing among member nations, the issues of command and coordination of forces, issues of responses to real and perceived threats, or even the more basic question of the mission and scope of the organization itself. These are not simple questions that lend themselves to a sound-bite debate. These are questions which will shape, for better or for worse, our defense and foreign policy options for decades to come. 
To be sure, NATO has been a success. It has helped keep the peace in Europe for nearly 50 years both by deterring aggression from the Warsaw Pact nations and encouraging cooperation between NATO members. I must say that due to the commitment of its members and the leadership of the United States, NATO has largely fulfilled the reason for its very birth--the Soviet Union. NATO has fulfilled its original intent, it has outlived the Soviet Union, and now we have to ask, what is its future? What role would an expanded NATO play in a post-cold-war era? What role would it play in a new century, in a new millennium? And the question I will be raising tonight and many times during this debate is, at what cost, both in financial terms and in less tangible areas such as the potential for strained relations with nonmember nations or even a dangerous rollback of the nuclear nonproliferation progress made since the end of the cold war? 
One of my primary concerns, as I said, is the wide variance in and suspect reliability of projected financial costs. I have seen projections range from $125 billion down to $1.5 billion. When you have that kind of wide variance, something is very strange. 
Another piece of the puzzle we are missing is how new members are to address their military shortfalls. Although the shortfalls were to be identified in December 1997, the countries' force goals will not be set until this spring. In other words, we are without a plan to address the force goals and the price tag associated with it. I am very uncomfortable signing the American taxpayer's name to a potentially ballooning blank check. 
What share the taxpayers ultimately will pay for NATO expansion is not at all clear, not just because there is no consensus on what the overall costs will be, but also because burdensharing arrangements between current and prospective members have not been firmly established. 
I will offer an amendment at the beginning to deal with some of the cost concerns I have been raising. As we know, the $1.5 billion cost figure that we have seen for the United States for NATO expansion is quoted widely and broadly. That figure includes only what is known as common costs. The figure excludes a number of other expansion costs for the three nations that are due to join NATO if this resolution passes relating to the upgrading of their militaries. The United States is expected to contribute substantially to the `national' costs through bilateral subsidies my amendment would require, including the bilateral contributions, when calculating the U.S. share of enlargement costs.

Mr. HARKIN. Basically, we see this figure bandied about that it is going to cost $1.5 billion. That is common costs. There are other national costs to which we have committed to subsidize. Already, just in the past 2 years, the figures that we have been able to unearth and dig into show that the United States has already spent about $1 billion in subsidies to these countries for their NATO expansion purposes. That is not calculated in the $1.5 billion. It should be, because it is still a cost to the U.S. taxpayers. 
This amendment, plus some others that I will have, will try to fashion this resolution so that we will have a really good handle as we go year by year as to just what the costs are to the U.S. taxpayers. We know already that $1.5 billion is not the total cost to U.S. taxpayers. It is more than that. How much more? We don't know. That is why I was one who wanted to postpone the debate and vote on NATO expansion after June. I thought we could take it up in July, have a serious debate, pass it in midsummer, or not pass it, as the will of the body would be. At least at that time we would have a study being done by NATO at the present time that is due in June. We don't have that study right now. This study is basically on the requirements for upgrading the militaries of these three countries. That way we would have a better idea of the shortfalls in these countries, in their militaries, and the costs to the United States--not just the common costs, but the other kinds of costs that we will be enlisted to come up with in terms of the national costs which we will be subsidizing for these three countries. 
I am hopeful as this debate ensues that I will be able to engage with members of the Foreign Relations Committee to explain thoroughly for the record exactly what these national costs are, what our commitments are, what the subsidies are, and if we have any data at all, to give us a better idea of what these subsidies and the national costs will be. If we just projected ahead based upon what we found in the last couple of years, in the next 10 years we would be looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of at least an additional $10 billion for our taxpayers, at a minimum, and that is before any of the upgrades have taken place in any of these countries. So that is just based upon what we spent in the last couple of years. 
Mr. President, again I hope we have a good debate on this. I am hopeful we can get some better cost figures. As I said, I will offer this amendment at the appropriate time. I printed it in the Record today, to get a better handle on the costs. I also will be placing in the Record letters from former Senators, questions raised by academics around the country as to just what the purposes of NATO expansion are, what the goals will be, how will this affect our relations with Russia, how will it affect our relations with other countries that are not members of NATO now but perhaps want to be in the near future. 
I understand there will be an amendment offered that will close the door for certain other countries to join NATO for some specified amount of time. What will this do to our relations with these countries and the relations of those countries with those nations that will be joining NATO if this resolution passes? I think these are all very serious questions. I hope the debate will flesh these out and that we can have some solid answers, especially as to the costs. 
Perhaps as to relations between nations in the future, this may be more in the realm of speculation. But I believe that at least these ought to be talked about and debated, and they ought to be debated in light of what the costs to our taxpayers would be. 
I am more interested in that than any of the other aspects of the bill that is now before us. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join many of my colleagues in support of the `Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998.' This legislation, introduced by my distinguished colleague, Senator Bill Frist, and cosponsored by nearly all the members of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, is an important step forward in the study and prevention of diseases and conditions unique to women. 
In the late 1980's, I learned that there was an embarrassing lack of research on diseases and conditions prevalent in women. In addition, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that women were routinely excluded from medical research studies at NIH. Because of this information, in 1990, I fought for legislation creating the Office of Research on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Since its creation, the Office successfully worked to ensure that research focuses on women's health and that women be included in clinical trials. 
Senator Frist's legislation builds upon the base of research and prevention knowledge we have developed over the past few years. The bill reauthorizes essential programs relating to women's health research at NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
I am particularly proud of the reauthorization of the programs promoting research and education on the drug `diethylstilbestrol,' otherwise known as DES. This drug was prescribed to pregnant American women from 1938 to 1971 in the mistaken belief that it would prevent miscarriage. But DES is now known to cause a five-fold increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, as well as a three-fold increased risk of miscarriage. I was proud to introduce legislation in 1992 that established a pilot program through NIH to test ways to educate the public and health professionals about how to deal with DES exposure. Last year I introduced legislation that would give people across the nation access to information developed through this pilot program. I am pleased that this bill has been incorporated in the `Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998.' 
In addition, I am pleased that the bill extends research programs for basic and clinical research and education efforts with respect to cancer, particularly breast cancer and ovarian cancer. I have fought for a long time for increased funding for breast cancer research. During my tenure as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations that handles NIH we provided dramatic increases in funding for breast cancer research. 
This legislation also extends important research at NIH on osteoporosis, Paget's disease and related bone disorders, and research on cardiovascular diseases in women. It reauthorizes programs at the National Institute on Aging, including research into the aging processes of women, with particular emphasis on the effects of menopause and the complications related to aging and the loss of ovarian hormones in women. 
CDC also plays an important role in the prevention diseases and conditions in women. This legislation would extend CDC's collection of statistical and epidemiological information, which is often the only national data available on the health status of American women and their use of the health care system. The bill extends CDC's National Cancer Registries Program, which provides funds to states to enhance their cancer surveillance data needed to monitor trends and serve as the foundation of a national comprehensive cancer control strategy. 
I am particularly proud that this legislation extends the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. In 1990 I worked to start and fund this program which provides mammography and cervical cancer screening to low income women without insurance. This program has provided vital access to services for thousands of women across the country. 
In addition, the bill would extend authorization for grants to academic health institutions for research on health promotion and disease prevention. A number of these institutions are working together to develop strategies for prevention of cardiovascular disease in women. Finally, the bill reauthorizes grants administered by CDC to non-profit private organizations to establish projects in local communities to coordinate intervention and prevention of domestic violence. 
Mr. President, the research into and prevention of diseases prevalent in women is an investment in our daughters, wives, mothers, and sisters. It is an investment in our future.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in this body to pay tribute to the gifted science fiction and fantasy writer Jo Clayton, who died Friday, February 13, in Portland, Oregon, two days short of her 59th birthday. Clayton was hospitalized in July 1996 with the multiple myeloma that eventually killed her. Her fight against the cancer of the bone marrow (plasma cells), mobilized the science fiction community and led to a national fund raising campaign to help her deal with the financial burden of her illness. 
Jo Clayton was the author of 35 published novels and many short stories. She wrote in both the fantasy and the SF genres. In her best known work, `The Diadem' series (1977), she anticipated by many years the current technology which may allow development of computerized components that can be integrated with a human mind. Jo Clayton's writing was marked by complex, beautifully realized societies set in exotic worlds, lyrical prose, and compelling characters, both male and female. 
Not counting sales of her last series, DRUMS OF CHAOS, Clayton's works sold over 1,250,000 copies. While in the hospital, Clayton impressed everyone with her courage by finishing DRUM CALLS, writing a number of short stories, and completing approximately half of the third volume in the DRUMS trilogy, titled DRUMS OF CHAOS. San Francisco writer Katharine Kerr, who worked with Clayton on a number of writing and editing projects, is Clayton's literary executor as well as good friend. Kerr is expected to either finish the third book herself or select a writer who will complete it. 
Jo Clayton's impact on the science fiction community goes far beyond the numbers of books sold which bear her name. Many people who didn't know her personally were touched by her humor, compassion and zest for living, even some who knew her only through the medium of electronic communications. It was an unexplained interruption in those communications which alerted friends to her health problems and led to her hospitalization. Those friends and others from afar supported her battle with the illness which took her life 21 months later. Even those with only fleeting contact were stirred by the courage and determination she displayed during that struggle. 
Her legacy will live on not only in her books but in the memories of her friends and fans. Toward the end of her life, her friends gathered in person and on-line to honor her achievements and remember her enjoyment of things large and small. One friend, a fellow Portlander, John C. Bunnell, composed a poem for that evening, which I would like to share with you. 
Au Revoir 
Joy shared with friends is what we'll think of first, 
Or stories in a book too good to close. 
Comes now a twilight, bringing with it tears; 
Let no one shed them for her spirit, though, 
As after evening, morning reappears, 
Yet where the new day beckons, none here know. 
Tomorrows without number yet remain 
On printed page, or on some other plane; 
No need to weep: her words will be her rose. 
Mr. President, I submit that we all should be fortunate enough to have friends willing to bear witness in ways such as this.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I want to recognize those Americans who were exposed to radiation fallout from government testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950's, the effects of which are still being studied. 
I was recently contacted by Karen Anderson and her two children, Leah and Seth, who are constituents of mine from Urbandale, Iowa. Included in their correspondence was a moving and touching tribute to Bob Anderson, their husband and father, who, after a lengthy and courageous battle, succumbed to cancer on September 7, 1996. As someone who grew up in Iowa and lost two sisters and a brother to cancer, I understand and empathize with their situation. 
The letters, photos and other personal materials that made up a bound volume memorializing the life and struggle of Mr Anderson displayed the obvious affection and love he felt for everyone and that he received in return. In fact, dozens of friends and relatives signed the notebook in tribute to Bob Anderson. It is always a tragedy when someone is taken from us when they have so much left to offer. There is no doubt he will be greatly missed by all. 
The anguish of the Anderson family was compounded by the circumstances surrounding the cause of Mr Anderson's cancer. Atomic bomb tests in Nevada during the 1950's exposed millions of Americans--particulary children--to large amounts of radioactive Iodine-131, which accumulates in the thyroid gland and has been linked to thyroid cancer. `Hot Spots'--where the Iodine-131 fallout was the greatest--were identified as receiving 5-16 rads of Iodine-131 
To put that in perspective, Federal standards for nuclear power plants require that protective action be taken for 15 rads. To further understand the enormity of the potential exposure, consider this--116 million curies of Iodine-131 were released by the above ground nuclear weapons testing in the United States compared with 7.3 million from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in the former Soviet Union. Exposing our citizens to these risks is unacceptable. 
The `Hot Spots' included many areas far away from Nevada, including New York, Massachusetts and Iowa. Due to the character of Iodine-131, those exposed to the highest concentrations were those who drank large amounts of milk from cows that grazed in fields with radiation fallout. Because their thyroids are smaller and still growing, children were most vulnerable. 
Mr. Anderson grew up in Iowa in Woodbury County , an area noted as a hot spot by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). He also suffered from Thyroid cancer. It is understandable that his family now wonders whether his cancer could have been detected and treated more effectively if the NCI information was known earlier. 
This hits very close to home for me. During the 1950's, like Bob Anderson, I was living in a rural Iowa county which has now been identified as a `Hot Spot' by the long delayed National Cancer Institute study. Along with many Iowans, I drank milk from cows kept on the farm. This increased the risk faced by myself and my family because of the accumulation of radioactive iodine in milk. 
When it comes to the government and nuclear testing, history shows the problem hasn't just been a fallout of radiation, but withholding of facts which may be detrimental to the public health. Information has come to light that government officials were aware that fallout from nuclear testing would contaminate areas that were hundreds, even thousands, of miles away. Additionally, it is outrageous that the government provided maps and forecasts of potential radioactive contamination to the Kodak film corporation during the 1950's and not to the American public. As I've said before, if we could protect a roll of film, we should have protected the parents and children. 
On October 1, 1997, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee held hearings where I raised questions about Iodine-131 fallout and its impact on our nation's citizens. I am working with NCI and other federal health agencies to ensure that useful and timely guidelines on the health impacts of radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing gets to physicians and concerned scientists. Although NCI has started this process, a lot more needs to be done. 
There is strong evidence that exposure to other radioactive isotopes, such as strontium 90, cesium 137, and barium 140, which were also spread by nuclear testing, could lead to bone cancer, leukemia, higher infant mortality, and a host of other illnesses. This needs to be examined. So do the nuclear weapons tests that took place in other parts of the United States and around the world. I am hopeful that my colleagues will support legislation I have introduced, S.1524, which continues the study of the health impacts of nuclear fallout. I feel this is important legislation that needs to become law this year. 
I am grateful to the Anderson family for sharing their highly personal and powerful story of the struggle with Bob's illness and the lack of forthcoming information on the potential exposure to radiation fallout in the 1950's. A story like the Anderson's underscores the need for accurate and timely dissemination of information to protect the public health. 
Mr. President, I ask to include a letter from the Anderson family in the Record.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud today to speak in support of the confirmation of Dr. David Satcher to be our Nation's Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health. 
I want to speak about Dr. Satcher's qualifications for these important jobs, but first I want to quickly comment on the circumstances that have led to the delay of our consideration of his nomination. I think the course of events that have taken place is very unfortunate. I think whenever we let certain political views interfere with the public health, we are doing the American people a great disservice. It has been 3 years since we have had a Surgeon General. That has not been good for this country. It has created a vacuum of leadership on public health issues. I hope that once everyone has had a chance to voice his or her opinion on his nomination we can quickly move ahead and fill the longstanding vacancy. 
Mr. President, as chairman and as now ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, I have had the pleasure of working very closely with Dr. David Satcher since he has been the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Over the past 4 years, he has directed the CDCP with integrity, compassion, and a commonsense approach. Because of his leadership, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has successfully addressed some of the most pressing public health challenges facing our Nation by promoting health and preventing disease, injury, and premature death. 
Mr. President, let there be no mistake, the position of Surgeon General is an important one. Americans look to our Nation's top medical official for leadership and guidance on a number of critical health care issues. For example, one of our most honored Surgeons General, Dr. C. Everett Koop, used the office's bully pulpit to further public awareness of the dangers of smoking, and he was a courageous advocate for public health measures to address the growing AIDS crisis. Now those are big shoes to fill, but I can think of no one more qualified or capable than Dr. David Satcher. 
In 1992, I worked with former CDC Director William Roper to change the name of the CDC from the Centers for Disease Control to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We added the word `prevention' to the name. Now, Dr. Roper has moved on, but under Dr. Satcher's direction the CDCP has truly lived up to its new name. 
Since he took the helm, Dr. Satcher has spearheaded a child immunization initiative, upgraded the Nation's ability to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases, and he has expanded the participation in the agency's breast and cervical cancer screening program. 
Dr. Satcher has taken the lead in creating an early warning system to detect and prevent food-borne illnesses and did the bulk of the work on the first-ever Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health, which outlined ways in which all types of Americans can be more physically active. These initiatives have been very successful, and they have made the CDCP renowned worldwide for its leadership on prevention efforts. 
As many of you may know--and I will probably repeat a lot what has been said here, but I think it is worth repeating--Dr. Satcher has a distinguished background. President of Meharry Medical College from 1982 until he was named Director of the CDCP in 1993. At Meharry, he gained national recognition as an able administrator, and his leadership has been accorded wide recognition. 
In 1986, he was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences for his leadership skills. 
In 1996, Dr. Satcher received the prestigious Dr. Nathan B. Davis Award for outstanding public service to advance the public health. 
He has also received Ebony Magazine's American Black Achievement Award in Business and the Professions in 1994, and the Breslow Award for Excellence in Public Health in 1995. 
Most recently, Dr. Satcher has received the James D. Bruce Memorial Award for distinguished contributions in preventative medicine from the American College of Physicians. He has received the John Stearns Award for Lifetime Achievement in Medicine from the New York Academy of Medicine, and the Surgeon General's Medallion for significant and noteworthy contributions to the health of the Nation. 
These awards all testify to the fact that Dr. Satcher is a talented, compassionate doctor, researcher and administrator who, throughout his career, has committed himself to caring for those less fortunate and to focusing on preventative health care. Dr. Satcher's lifelong commitment to improving the health of the American people began not long after he survived a near fatal brush with whooping cough as a child. Because of this experience, he understands how important it is to have a Surgeon General who communicates clearly with the people about health-related issues and policies that can literally save their lives. He has strong and practical positions on ways to improve the public health, and as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health, he will provide a positive and articulate voice on some of our Nation's most important health issues. 
The Atlanta Journal and Constitution stated in an editorial endorsing Dr. Satcher:  
He is the right man at the right time for these positions. 
I can think of no truer statement, Mr. President. So I look forward to concluding this debate, hopefully, on a positive note. I look forward to seeing Dr. Satcher confirmed as our Nation's Assistant Secretary of Health and Surgeon General. America needs a Surgeon General. We need that leadership, and Dr. Satcher is the best person for that job.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I, as in morning business, want to digress here just a moment, if I might, to talk a little bit about another issue that is going to be coming up here tomorrow. I understand we are going to be voting on cloture on a bill that has not gone through any committee, hasn't had any hearings. It involves an area of science and medicine which very few, if any, of us in this entire body are qualified to vote on with short notice, without proper hearings and proper input. Yet, it's trying to be rammed through here. I am talking about the bill regarding cloning research. 
Now, there has been a lot of, I think, undue, inflammatory kinds of statements and comments made about this cloning research. It seems odd to me that on something that has so much potential to alleviate human suffering and which is also, I will be frank to admit, fraught with perils of ethics and bioethics--it seems odd to me that a bill of that nature would be rushed so soon to the floor of the Senate. It seems to me that this is the kind of bill that ought to go through a lengthy and involved hearing process, to bring in the best minds, ethicists, physicians, doctors, researchers, those involved in gene therapy, those who have been involved in cloning research in the past, to hear their views on this. And then out of this, perhaps we can develop a more reasoned, logical, bipartisan approach on the issue of cloning research. 
So I have to ask, what is this so-called rush? Why bring it out on the floor like this without the proper kind of hearings, because there is a hidden political agenda? Is this to inflame fears among people? Well, I hope not. To take away that apprehension, I think the best thing would be to refer this to committee and have hearings on it. I serve on the Labor, Health and Human Services Committee, and I would assume that committee would be the proper one to have the hearings, at least some of them, plus those on the House side. So I want to speak about it in that context. 
Mr. President, each year, too many of our loved ones suffer terribly. They are taken away from us by diseases like cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's. For many years, I have worked hard to expand research into finding cures and preventative measures and improve treatments for the many conditions that rob us of our health. Over the last several years, there have been major breakthroughs in medical research. We need to make sure that our world-class scientists continue to build on this progress, but that we also say to young people who are in college today, maybe even in high school, who are thinking of pursuing research careers, that we welcome their inquisitiveness, we welcome their experimentation, we want there to be no bounds put on their inquiries by a rush to judgment by the Congress of the United States, which is ill-equipped to make such a judgment. I think our actions here send a very chilling message to young people, who want to go into biomedical research, that somehow there is going to be the heavy hand of `Big Brother' Government overlooking their research, telling them you can do this but not that, or you can go no further than that, or you can ask this question, but you can't ask that question. I think this bill that we have, again, pushed before us in this rush, can have that kind of chilling effect. 
Now, another area of research that has been ongoing for a long time--this is nothing new--has recently captured public attention. That is the research into cloning, cloning cells. Now, there is a man in Chicago--I don't know him and I never have met him--and his name is Richard Seed. Well, he caused quite a sensation a few weeks ago by saying he intends to clone infertile people within the next 2 years. Well, when I first heard this, I said, who is this guy? I never heard of him and I have been involved in research, medical research for a long time. Well, I found out that, quite frankly, he is a very irresponsible individual. He doesn't have the expertise himself. He doesn't have the laboratory, the money, or the wherewithal. I think most researchers and policymakers that I know who know of this person say that he is both out of the mainstream and that his plans for cloning are, at the very least, premature. 
Now, again, from all that I have read--and now I have seen him on television--I think that Mr. Seed is more interested in getting his name in the paper than actually carrying out any legitimate scientific research. This is the unfortunate part of it. Why should the irresponsible actions of an individual like Mr. Seed lead to irresponsible actions on our part, because that is exactly what we are doing? Is Mr. Seed irresponsible? I believe so, absolutely. As I said, he doesn't have the expertise, the lab, or the wherewithal to even carry out this research. So he is making very irrational, irresponsible, inflammatory statements. But then why should we respond irresponsibly? I think we should respond responsibly and very carefully to an area of scientific research that can hold so much promise to alleviate pain and suffering and premature death all around the world. 
Let's not act irresponsibly because one person in America has spoken irresponsibly. S. 1601, the bill we will be having a cloture vote on tomorrow, bans the use of cloning technology called somatic cell nuclear transfer. 
To create an unfertilized egg cell, even if this egg cell is for research, is totally unrelated to the cloning of a human being. For example, if the cell is grown under special laboratory conditions, it does not become a child, or a baby, but instead becomes specific tissue such as a muscle, nerve, or skin. 
Just think of the potential of this kind of technology. I have looked into this a lot over the last several years. Science makes genetically identical tissues and organs for the treatment of a vast array of diseases. 
I gave a sort of off-the-cuff set of comments last summer when this issue came up with Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in Scotland. Dr. Wilmut was at our committee. I talked about the need to continue research into cloning of cells. I said it was going to happen in my lifetime. I certainly stand here and hope that it does. 
Shortly after that, I was at a restaurant in a small town in Iowa. A person came up to me, a friend of mine. I went over to their booth to see them. There was a woman there whom I had never met, a rather young woman with her husband. I was introduced to them. Just right out of the clear blue she said, `Thank you for what you said about cloning and taking the position you did on cloning.' I don't even think it was in the newspaper. It was on television, I think. CNN may have carried that type of thing. But I was curious as to why this young woman, who, if I am not mistaken, lives on a farm, I believe--I can't quite remember that detail. I asked her, `Why are you so interested in this?' She said because she has a rare kidney disorder. She is hoping because of rejection possibilities that there might come a time when we could actually grow the kind of tissue that would develop into a kidney to replace her kidney so that there wouldn't be that possibility of rejection. She got it. She understood it. 
That is what we are talking about. Those are the kinds of possibilities that I believe will happen in my lifetime if we do not act irresponsibly and irrationally. 
This bill, S. 1601, would make it a crime to conduct some research seeking to generate stem cells to treat a wide variety of and a wide range of deadly and disabling diseases.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for example, I want to read a couple of things from the article. It says: 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey has thrown his weight behind a bill that would ban human cloning permanently. `This is the right thing to do, at the right time, for the sake of human dignity,' said Armey. `How can you put a statute of limitations on right and wrong?' 
Right and wrong? It is wrong to conduct cloning research that might enable us to grow a liver out of a person's own DNA? To grow skin out of a person's own DNA? Perhaps even to grow heart tissue, or even a full heart, out of a person's own DNA, so there would be no rejection possibilities? It is wrong to do research in cloning of cells that might permit my nephew, Kelly, who, at the age of 19, got injured in the military, his spinal cord was broken and he has been a quadriplegic since and still holds out the hope that research someday is going to enable him to walk again? And, yes, cloning research might be able to rebuild those kinds of cells from his own DNA that will get those nerve endings going again so that my nephew can walk again. That research is wrong? I ask who appointed the House majority leader as the arbiter of what is right and wrong in biomedical research? 
Well, as the drafter of this article went on: 
. . . hasty legislation could easily be too restrictive. Last year, for instance, Florida considered a law that would have barred the cloning of human DNA, a routine procedure in biomedical research. 
You might say that's not what we are doing here. But we could be sending the wrong signals to State legislatures, again, to try the same thing: 
Cloning individual human cells [the writer goes on], however, is another matter. Biologists are already talking about harnessing for medical purposes the technique that produced a sheep called Dolly. They might, for example, obtain healthy cells from a patient with leukemia or a burn victim and then transfer the nucleus of each cell into an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has been removed. Coddled in culture dishes, these embryonic clones--each genetically identical to the patient from which the nuclei came--would begin to divide. 
The cells would not have to grow into a fetus, however. The addition of powerful growth factors can ensure that the clones develop only into specialized cells and tissue. For the leukemia patient, for example, the cloned cells could provide an infusion of fresh bone marrow, and for the burn victim, grafts of brand-new skin. Unlike cells from an unrelated donor, these cloned cells would incur no danger of rejection, patients would be spared the need to take powerful drugs to suppress the immune system. 
And this, I think, says it all: 
Given its potential benefit,' says Dr. Robert Winston, a fertility expert at London's Hammersmith Hospital, `I would argue that it would be unethical not to continue this line of research. 
Mr. President, I hope that tomorrow, when we vote on this, that the Senate will choose to be on the side of the Galileos, those who want to expand human knowledge, those who will not be constricted by outmoded and outdated ideas, who understand it's the very nature of our humanity to ask how and why and what if. No, not to be on the side of those who wanted to keep the Sun moving around the Earth, but to be on the side of progress and advancement, enlightenment and unlimited human potential.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dodd in sponsoring the Child Care ACCESS Act to improve the affordability, availability and quality of child care. 
One of the major accomplishments of the last session was to help make college more affordable for working Americans. We passed bipartisan legislation to increase Pell Grants to the highest level in history and to provide tax credits for college expenses. As a result, more Americans will now be able to afford college. 
We must now turn our attention, with the same firm resolve, to the education of our young children and making child care affordable, available and safe. This must be the top priority for this Congress. 
The recent research on brain development has provided the importance of the first three years of a child's life. Early education opportunities are essential for the positive emotional, physical and social development of children. 
Last year's appropriations bill included several important provisions related to early childhood education and development. We increased funding for the Early Head Start program by $66 million and provided and 11% increase in early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities. We also provided an additional $50 million for the Child Care and Development Block Grant to improve the quality of care for infants. I would have liked to do more, but we were constrained by provisions in the budget agreement. These accomplishments set the stage for us to do much more during 1998. 
Mr. President, many low and middle-income families simply cannot afford high quality or even get decent child care. According to the Children's Defense Fund, child care can cost between $3,000 and $8,000 for each child. This clearly makes child care inaccessible to many low-income and middle-income working parents with young children. The need for safe and affordable child care is great and this legislation will provide families with the help they need. 
Last year, the President and First Lady sponsored the first White House Conference on Child Care. The child care concerns facing families was summed up quite simply by Secretary of Health and Human Service Secretary Donna Shalala. Can they afford it? Can they get it? Can they trust it? This legislation is a comprehensive response to those questions. 
First, the bill improves the affordability of child care for low-income families by providing additional resources for the Child Care and Development Block Grant. This new funding will double the number of families who can qualify for these subsidies. Second, it provides significant additional assistance for many middle income families struggling with these huge costs. 
We have all heard concerns about the difficulty working families have in securing child care subsidies. In Iowa, eligibility for Block Grant assistance is restricted to families who earn less than 125% of poverty--or less than $1,389 per month for a family of three. I have long championed the need for parents to have the opportunity to work rather than to be on welfare. But, we cannot expect that to happen without sufficient resources to pay for child care. 
I am pleased that this legislation includes a significant increase in the child care tax credit, similar to a measure I introduced in 1996 and 1997. A key feature of this legislation is to make the credit refundable so that those will the greatest need--those that making near the minimum wage would be able to receive this tax benefit. Under current law, they are not eligible. 
However, low-income families are not the only ones who are struggling to pay for child care. Middle income families also need relief and this legislation expands the Dependent Care Tax Credit and makes this credit refundable. The limits of the existing tax credit was last changed in 1982 and it has been seriously eroded by inflation. Under existing law, a working family with two children in child care making $30,000 can receive only $960 which, in Iowa often that amounts to only a fraction of child care costs. This is a huge burden on young working families. The tax law in this area is especially unfair since other tax provisions allow some taxpayers with generous company benefits to acquire tax reductions equal to over $1500 for child care with only a single child in day care. 
In 1996 and 1997, I introduced legislation to substantially increase the assistance available to working families and to make those benefits refundable so lower income families would also benefit. My proposal provided for a benefit of up to $2300 when two children are in day care. I am pleased that the proposal being introduced today, and the proposal submitted by the President reaches that same level. Because of need to keep this overall proposal within our ability to pay for it without eating into the surplus, the benefits start to phase down for families making over $30,000 in this proposal. I would favor starting to phase out the size of the increased benefit at a higher level covering a larger share of middle income families if we can find the additional offsetting funding. 
A key feature of the tax provision is to make the credit refundable so that those with the greatest need--those that making near the minimum wage would be able to get this benefit, that is currently available to higher income families. While some make technical arguments against the provision regarding budget and tax policy issues, I feel that we must do more to help working families bear this considerable cost and help their children receive decent child care so important to establish a good foundation for their years in school and thereafter. And, I find it most unreasonable that those with the most need would be receiving less benefit then those with far more resources. 
After our constituents tell us about the trouble they have paying for child care, the next thing we hear is that they can't find child care, especially for children who are school age. An estimated five million children spend some times each week as `latchkey' children without the supervision of an adult. Further, the Department of Justice tells us that most juvenile crime occurs during the hours of 3 and 8 pm. 
This legislation addresses this critical need by expanding funding to improve the supply and quality of child care for school age children. In addition, more funds would be made available to the 21st Century Community Learning Centers to help public schools create before and after school activities for their students. 
Finally, families want quality child care that they can trust and this legislation provides additional funding to encourage states to improve the quality of child care. These funds could be used for a variety of different activities that we know make a difference such as providing additional training for providers or reducing provider-child ratios. 
The legislation also provides a modest tax credit to allow a parent to stay at home with children under the age of one and provides a tax credit to employers for expenses related to child care for their workers. 
Mr. President, this legislation provides the most comprehensive response for families struggling to meet their child care needs and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes to speak about an individual and a case that is now taking place in the State of Oregon. The individual I refer to is one Casey Martin, an outstanding golfer who just happens to have a disability. I am also referring to the PGA Tour's determination to exclude Casey from participating in a professional sport for which he is eminently well qualified and by which he has attempted to earn his living. The PGA Tour has said no, Casey can't play with the cart he needs to accommodate his disability. The Tour wants to keep Casey out because of his disability and because of a certain rule and tradition. 
Mr. President, Casey Martin has had the guts and the gumption not to back down, but to take on the PGA Tour. 
Last week, Senator Dole and I held a press conference in Washington, DC, with Casey Martin to show our support for him and to state for the record that as two of the primary sponsors of the Americans with Disabilities Act, it certainly was our intention, and the legislative intent, to cover this type of a situation. We wanted to state for the record that the ADA did, in fact, apply to the Casey Martin situation. 
Yesterday, Casey Martin's case started. His trial began in Oregon. 
Casey Martin has a powerful story. He has worked, he has practiced, he has played, he has spent an enormous amount of time and energy--a lot of it painful--reaching the highest levels of one of America's most popular professional sports. It has been for him a very difficult road. Now Casey stands at a roadblock, much like the roadblock that millions of Americans with disabilities have confronted--Americans who each and every day only ask for reasonable accommodations and modifications that will allow them to live their lives and pursue their dreams just like everyone else. 
We passed the Americans with Disabilities Act to give Casey Martin, and others with disabilities, an equal opportunity to fully participate in American life. That means in everything--employment, education, recreation, social activities and opportunities. I have often said that ADA really stands for the `American Dream for All.' That is what it is all about, and that is what it is about in this case, too--will Casey Martin have the opportunity to pursue his American dream? 
I would like to take a moment to compliment those who have already shown their support for Casey Martin. Particularly, I would like to congratulate Mr. Phil Knight and all of the folks at Nike. Their commercial that they are running now showcasing Casey Martin makes a very powerful statement about the ability of people who also happen to have disabilities. 
I would also like to compliment the golfers, like Greg Norman and Tom Latham, two outstanding golfers, who have publicly stated their support for Casey Martin. 
Mr. President, I am here to say that Casey Martin should have an opportunity to compete in the PGA Tour and to say that the ADA guarantees him that right. As Senator Dole said last week at our press conference, PGA does not stand for `please go away,' and the PGA Tour shouldn't try to send Casey Martin away from a game for which he is otherwise well-qualified. Casey is someone who spent his entire life playing golf; he played in college, along with Tiger Woods, at Stanford in the NCAA; he is a golfer who, with his disability, recently won one of the tours, a Nike tour in Lakeland, Florida. So this man is eminently well-qualified to play professional golf. 
I am disappointed--I am sorely disappointed--in the PGA Tour's failure to reach an agreement with Casey, to come to some kind of an accommodation that would allow him to compete and earn his living being a professional golfer. 
As I understand it, the sticking point here is the PGA Tour's tradition and rule of no carts. Well, Mr. President, I believe there are values to upholding traditions and rules, but there is no merit in rigidly standing on tradition simply because of outmoded assumptions. 
Over the years, all kinds of traditions have scuttled the aspirations and limited the possibilities of millions of Americans with disabilities. People with disabilities just didn't do certain things. I always tell the story about my brother who I grew up with who had a disability. He became deaf at an early age. He was sent away to the Iowa School for the Deaf and Dumb--that is what it was called in those days, the School for the Deaf and Dumb. The Presiding Officer sitting in the Chair may be a few years younger than I am, but I remember when I was younger, that is what they called deaf people, they were deaf and dumb. As my brother said to 
me, `I may be deaf, but I am not dumb.' So we have done away with that tradition. We don't refer to people as deaf and dumb, and we don't have deaf and dumb schools any longer either. 
But when he went to that school, they told him he could be one of three things: He could be a baker, a shoe cobbler or a printer's assistant. That was it. There was nothing else he could do. `That is it, you can pick one of those three things.' 
He said, `I don't want to be any one of them.' 
They said, `Fine, you are going to be a baker then.' 
Tradition and rules had it that deaf people could only do certain things. That has all gone by the wayside. We see deaf Americans now doing everything. Why, we even have a person who is deaf who is the president of a college. So we have done away with a lot of these old traditions, and the ADA is helping to change the old traditions. It is asking us to rethink our assumptions about people with disabilities and what they can do. It is asking us to look at reasonable modifications that would permit them, as I said, to pursue their American dream. 
The ADA is intended to include people in the mainstream of American life. It requires entities to make--and I quote from the law--`reasonable modifications' to `policies, practices and procedures' so long as those modifications do not create a `fundamental alteration' to the program or activity. 
So, Mr. President, rules and traditions that create barriers for people with disabilities are rules and traditions that must be changed. 
I am reminded of a recent incident here in the Senate, where we were asked to make a reasonable modification to a Senate policy. A staff person with a vision impairment was precluded from coming on to the Senate floor with her guide dog because we had a no-animals rule on the floor. Certainly, it sounded like a very reasonable rule and tradition. We don't want animals running all over the floor of the Senate. You don't want me bringing my pet dog on to the Senate floor. Well, that was a rule and tradition. 
So we had a debate about whether we should change the rule to accommodate the needs of the staff person. We talked about the history, the traditions of the Senate. Ultimately, we did the right thing. We made a reasonable modification to that rule and that tradition so the staff person could do her job and bring her dog on to the Senate floor. 
Allowing Casey Martin to use a golf cart is a reasonable modification under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The cart will help level the playing field a little on which Casey Martin competes without giving him an undo advantage. What we are talking about here goes to the heart of the principles and the foundation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
The PGA Tour can say all they want, that a cart somehow alters the fundamental operation of the golf game. Yet, if that is so, then why do they allow carts to be used on the Senior Tour? Why do they allow carts to be used in the qualifying rounds for the younger people? 
When the court enjoined the PGA Tour and said, yes, the Tour must allow Casey to use a cart, and he used a cart, the Tour said, `We will let everybody use carts.' I am told that out of 168 golfers, only 15 decided to use a golf cart. I thought to myself, if a golf cart gives players that much of an advantage, why wouldn't everyone use them? 
So I consulted some of my golfing friends. I am not a golfer, but I have friends who are avid golfers. One individual told me, `Well, there is nothing like walking a golf course, because when you walk, you feel the wind and you see how often it gusts and you know what direction it is blowing in. You get a feel for the lay of the fairway, and you can think about your next shot and what went wrong on the last one. You get in a golf cart and you lose all that feel.' 
I have tested this hypothesis with other golfers, and they say, `Yes, that is true.' 
Allowing Casey Martin to use a golf cart will not give him any 
advantage at all in the PGA Tour. In fact, it may very well present a disadvantage. So, again, I just think this is one of those old rules and traditions that needs a reasonable modification under the ADA so that Casey Martin can compete in professional golf. 
Lastly, Mr. President, Casey Martin may not fit the stereotype of what the PGA considers a competitive golfer, but millions of Americans who don't fit the typical image of a golfer have now taken up the game. It has moved from an exclusive sport played at private country clubs to an inclusive sport played by a cross-section of Americans. 
When I was growing up in my State of Iowa, I bet I could count on one hand the number of golf courses in the State of Iowa, all at private country clubs, exclusively played by those people who belonged to those clubs. We have 99 counties in Iowa, Mr. President. I bet you every one has a golf course now. Some of them have more than one. Farmers out in the field get off the tractor and come in and play a game of golf. So it is no longer this sort of exclusive game it once was. Everyone is playing golf. Barriers to the sport have come down. 
As I said earlier, barriers and traditions that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating are barriers and traditions that must come down. Holding up a barrier for Casey Martin sends exactly the wrong message not only to Americans with disabilities but to each and every one of us. 
I am sorry that the PGA Tour saw fit to take this to court. They first tried to argue that they weren't even covered by the ADA, when the law was plain on its face they were covered. They went to court and, of course, the court threw that out and said, `Of course, you are covered.' Now they are back in court again to drag this thing out. 
I wish they hadn't done it, because that very action alone tends to create a chilling effect. A lot of Americans will say, `Well, I may have a disability, but if I want to do something and there is a rule or tradition against it, do you mean I have to go to court? Do you mean I have to hire lawyers? I have to go through all that just to get my rights?' 
That is the message the PGA Tour, by going to court, is sending to Americans all over this country. 
Mr. President, people with disabilities get up every morning, and they have a tough day ahead of them. They have to prepare for that day, many times with the aid of an assistant, perhaps they have to use a wheelchair or get in a special bus to go to work. It takes a lot of effort, a lot of time. They don't have the time and they don't want to go to court, but they want the Americans with Disabilities Act to work. People with disabilities want entities like the PGA Tour to use some common sense and some common decency to make reasonable modifications so that people like Casey Martin can pursue their American dreams. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in co-sponsoring the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. I particularly wish to thank my Republican colleagues, Senators DeWine and Jeffords, for developing this bill in a bipartisan manner. The bill that we introduce today represents the work of Republicans, Democrats, and the Administration. I am pleased that our work together continues the long history of bipartisanship in developing legislation that addresses the needs of persons with disabilities. 
The State Vocational Rehabilitation Service Program provides $2.2 billion in formula grant assistance to States to help individuals with disabilities prepare for an engage in gainful employment. Since established by the Smith-Fess Act 75 years ago, state vocational rehabilitation programs have served some nine million people. This program promotes economic independence for persons with disabilities, and the numbers reflect that: 
The percentage of individuals who reported that their income was their primary source of support increased from 18% at the time of application to 71% at the time of exit from the program; 
The percentage of individuals with earned income of any kind increased from 22% at application to 93% at program exit; and 
The number of individuals working at or above the Federal minimum wage rate increased from 18% at application to 86% at closure. 
In 1992, Congress made major changes to the Act, namely, increasing consumer participation, streamlining processes, and reducing unnecessary paperwork. In the bill we introduce today, we have built on the `92 amendments. The bill preserves and strengthens the themes of the `92 amendments while fine-tuning and aligning the Act with other workforce reforms so that individuals with disabilities can benefit from them. 
This bill strengthens the role of the consumer throughout the vocational rehabilitation process, particularly in the development of the individual's employment plan. It reduces unnecessary burdens on State VR agencies by streamlining the State plan. The bill also refocuses the State plan on improving outcomes for individuals with disabilities by requiring States to develop, jointly with the State Rehabilitation Council, annual goals and strategies for improving results. 
The due process protections provided in the State Grant program to VR applicants and clients are strengthened by eliminating State VR agency review of decisions by impartial hearing officers. The bill would also require States to provide for voluntary mediation (modeled on the provisions in IDEA) as another mechanism to resolve disputes. 
Access of Social Security beneficiaries to VR services if facilitated, and unnecessary gatekeeping is eliminated, by making SSI and SSDI beneficiaries presumptively eligible for services under the VR State Grants program. This change would eliminate the need for the VR agency to determine on a case-by-case basis whether these individuals `require' VR services in order to gain employment. 
Of particular interest to me and to Senator Dodd are the changes to Section 508 of the Act which pertain to electronic and information technology accessibility. This bill strengthens the provisions regarding procurement by Federal agencies of technology that is accessible to individuals with disabilities. 
I am pleased to co-sponsor this bill and look forward to its passage.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to join Chairman Lugar, Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy in introducing legislation to reauthorize several programs, primarily relating to nutrition assistance for children, whose authorizations are set to end this year. These programs are vitally important to our nation, and I applaud the introduction of this legislation as a clear demonstration of our strong support for them in the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee and our commitment to reenacting authorizing legislation this year. 
The bill introduced today is a simple extension of expiring authorizations, without amendments or modifications, and thus only marks the beginning of the legislative process. As Chairman Lugar has indicated, the Committee will complete the normal child nutrition reauthorization process, as in past years, allowing for full discussion and consideration of the programs requiring reauthorization as well as those having permanent authorizations. I look forward to working with colleagues on the Committee, in this body, and in the House of Representatives on this very important legislation. 
An essential part of our work on this reauthorization bill involves examining the child nutrition programs to ensure they are functioning well, particularly in responding to changing circumstances and new demands. Another, no less important, part of our efforts must focus on making the programs more effective by finding better ways to address longstanding unmet needs and reach individuals who are not adequately served by the programs in their present form. Of course, we must always be alert to opportunities for streamlining, paring paperwork and reducing administrative burdens. A number of thoughtful proposals for improvements and modifications have already been made, and I know that we will receive more of them as work on the legislation proceeds. 
All of the programs involved in this reauthorization are important, but I want to mention specifically a few of my priorities. We should strengthen the school breakfast program in order to reach students who need school breakfasts but do not currently have access to them. We also should improve the child nutrition programs in ways that enhance their effectiveness in helping families obtain quality child care. And we need to ensure that the summer food program is adequately serving kids who without it are quite vulnerable once school is out for the summer. In addition to reauthorizing the Iowa and Kentucky child care nutrition pilot project, we ought to examine its positive results for guidance in shaping our national approach to child care nutrition assistance. With respect to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, it is important to continue an effective competitive bidding system for infant formula and to extend and strengthen the WIC farmers market program. 
Nothing is more important to the future of our nation than its children, and nothing is more important to children than the sound nutrition they need each day. It is beyond dispute that good nutrition is critical to physical growth, intellectual development and lives that are healthy, productive and happy. Trying to educate children who are hungry or malnourished is just as foolish as trying to build a house on a crumbling foundation. Federal child nutrition programs constitute investments in the future--of our children and our nation. This legislation will ensure that we continue to reap the immeasurable dividends of those wise investments.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Mikulski and many of my colleagues today to support reauthorization of the Mammography Quality Standards Act. I want to especially commend Senator Mikulski for her invaluable leadership on this issue. She brought the problem of poor quality mammography screening to the Senate's attention several years ago and authored the historic legislation we are today reauthorizing. 
As many of you know, I lost my sisters at an early age because of breast cancer. This experience has helped to make me acutely aware of the need for research on and improved early detection of breast cancer. I've always thought if they had had access to quality mammography screening, they would be alive with us today. 
Starting in 1990, as chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee, I worked with Senator Mikulski and others to start and fund a program at the CDC to provide screening for lower income women without insurance. And in 1992, I offered an amendment to dedicate $210 million in the Defense budget for breast cancer research. Because of this legislation, funding for breast cancer research has been included in the Defense Department budget every year since 1992, and will be included again in Fiscal Year 1998. 
It is clear that if we are to win the war on breast cancer we must continue to support research on improved treatments, but we must also ensure that breast cancer is detected early enough to apply these treatments effectively. The need for legislating mammography quality standards is obvious--every year approximately 180,000 women will be diagnosed and 44,000 women will die of breast cancer. We can prolong and save the lives of millions of women if we can detect the cancer early in its development. The earlier we can diagnose breast cancer, the sooner a women can begin to receive appropriate treatment, and the more likely it is that she will survive. It is vital that all women have access to mammograms which are both properly performed and accurately analyzed. This screening is a very powerful weapon in the battle against cancer. 
Early diagnosis, and consequently early treatment, depend upon accurate evaluations of breast tissue. This means that the health care professionals taking mammograms and reading mammograms must be properly trained. This Act sets forth requirements that all mammography facilities meet stringent standards in terms of equipment used, personnel, and reporting of mammography findings. 
Congress must act quickly to pass this reauthorization so that women throughout our nation can be confident that they are receiving the safest, most reliable mammography available. Without these standards, women do not have such guarantees. They would be forced to place their lives in the hands of a random patchwork of Federal, State, and voluntary standards. This is unacceptable. We cannot return to the days before this law was passed, when women were misdiagnosed because mammography clinics did not have standards for quality control. 
Women also deserve the best technology available when it comes to early detection of cancer because advanced technology means more accurate, and therefore earlier diagnosis. One such advance is digital mammography. This screening technique involves the creation of digital images which are more easily visualized and can also be stored and forwarded to other medical sites. This can provide women in rural areas with vital access to expert medical diagnosticians. 
When women and their doctors have access to the best technology available, such as digital mammography, it can mean the difference between life and death. It can also mean money saved, because it is cheaper to treat a small, confined tumor than it is to treat a full-blown metastactic cancer which has spread to other organ systems. 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women, but it does not have to be the No. 1 cancer killer among women in the United States because we have ways to detect it early on. The National Cancer Institute advises that `high-quality mammography combined with a clinical breast exam is the most effective technology presently available to detect breast tumors.' We have an obligation to American women to ensure that the mammographies they receive meet high-quality federal standards. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and I look forward to its speedy passage into law.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Rural Cooperative Act, a measure proposed by the administration. Under current law, the Rural Business--Cooperative Services within the Rural Development Administration provides a wide variety of services for farm cooperatives. They conduct economic analysis, provide advice on how to form and best operate cooperatives and a wide variety of other services for farm cooperatives, including how to deal with the complex laws under which cooperatives operate. 
Farm cooperatives are very important in rural America. They allow farmers to come together to purchase goods, to sell their products, and to process their agricultural commodities under farmer ownership. Some cooperatives only perform one of those functions. Some do two or three of them. In all cases, they allow farmers to come together and more effectively bargain for a fair price. 
Funding for cooperative services within the Department of Agriculture has been under considerable constraint in recent years and it is now difficult for the Department to provide the full range of services allowed by law to farm cooperatives. I do not want to see those services reduced. But, I do agree with the administration, that cooperative services should also be available to those in rural areas, in addition to farmers who want to form cooperatives. Therefore, I am introducing the administration-proposed bill to broaden the responsibilities of the Department in this area. I do so, requesting that the administration increase its request for funding to carry out these additional responsibilities and will be urging that the Appropriations Committee appropriately increase funding in this area. 
The bill provides that rural residents who are considering forming a cooperative for one of a number of purposes or who have formed a cooperative may receive a variety of kinds of assistance from USDA. 
The types of cooperatives that would benefit would include those purchasing consumer goods, business products or services, health care, utilities, communications, child and day care, housing, credit, insurance, or other goods or services. It would also include cooperatives that market goods made by members or goods made by the cooperative. 
The Department could provide advice for such cooperatives including conducting economic surveys and analysis of proposed cooperative activities. It would also conduct surveys of cooperatives and issue reports about them as well as promote rural cooperative principles and practices. 
The bill authorizes such sums as might be necessary to carry out the purposes of the act. 
I urge that the Congress consider and pass this bill in the coming year.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill requiring studies of the health effects of nuclear weapons testing. This would build upon the study by the National Cancer Institute that was released October 1 of this year. 
On October 1, following some major news coverage, the NCI testified before the Senate Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee on their efforts to connect nuclear weapons testing with thyroid cancer. The NCI testimony and the report released that day were startling. Atomic bomb tests in Nevada during the 1950's exposed millions of Americans--particularly children--to large amounts of radioactive iodine-131. The levels of radioactive iodine exposure is far worse than previously reported by the Government. Hot spots where the iodine-131 fallout was greatest includes many counties far away from Nevada, including New York, Massachusetts, and Iowa. 
Hot spots were identified as receiving as high as 5-16 rads of exposure of iodine-131, with children being exposed to a risk up to 10 times higher. Iodine-131, which accumulates in the thyroid gland, has been linked to thyroid cancer. To give some understanding of the enormity of the U.S. atomic tests in Nevada, 116 million curies of iodine-131 were released in the United States above ground tests. This compares to 7.3 million from Chernobyl disaster the former Soviet Union. The NCI report clearly shows that the U.S. atomic tests exposed a lot of people to risks now considered unacceptable. 
The topic hits very close to home for me. During the 1950's, I was living in the small town of Cumming located in south-central Iowa. Along with many Iowans, I lived in the hot spots detailed by the NCI study. Further, like many of my neighbors, I drank milk from the cows kept on our farm. This increased the risk faced by myself and my family because radioactive iodine accumulates in milk. 
The NCI report has attracted a lot of attention. Much of this stems from the history of nuclear weapons testing. As we all know, the U.S. Government was fairly cavalier with its nuclear weapons program during the early days of the cold war. Historians can argue about the reasons, but most people recognize the terrible toll suffered by the American public because of our nuclear weapons program. Only recently has the extent of exposure to radiation and other hazards to the `down winders' living near nuclear weapons sites such as the Nevada test site, Hanford in Washington State, and the Marshall Islanders in the South Pacific. 
So it is no surprise that a report detailing exposure to millions of Americans would attract attention. However, we need to continue the research into the health impact of nuclear weapons testing. That is why I am introducing this bill to require further study by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The HHS study will build upon the NCI study. There is strong evidence that exposure to other radioactive isotopes that were spread by nuclear weapons tests such as strontium 90, cesium 137 and barium 140 could lead to bone cancer, leukemia, higher infant mortality, and a host of other illnesses. This needs to be examined. So do the nuclear weapons tests that took place not only at the Nevada test site, but at other places as well. For example, the NCI report did not examine the nuclear weapons testing conducted by the United States in Mississippi, Alaska, New Mexico, Colorado, or the South Pacific. The studies should research not only the United States nuclear weapons program, but also tests by foreign nations including the Soviet Union and its successor states, France, China, India, and Great Britain. 
I also believe that such studies should be conducted in an open manner. For example, this bill will require that the studies fall under the review authority of the Advisory Committee on Energy Related Studies and other entities established by the Federal Government to ensure public accountability over health related studies pertaining to nuclear weapon research, production, and testing. The bill also requires that HHS report to Congress within 90 days of passage as to its plan for completing the studies, as well as report to Congress each year on its progress. 
This is a simple bill that seeks some understanding of the health consequences of our nuclear weapons testing program. I would ask my fellow colleagues to review and support this important legislation.

Mr. HARKIN. I want to speak a little about the fast-track bill that is before us and which is scheduled to be voted on in the House tonight. 
I doing so, I reread the President's speech on September 10 that he gave on fast track. He gave it at the White House, I believe in the East Room. 
I found some interesting remarks in the President's speech. He talked about change. He said, `As we have done throughout our history, we have taken our Nation and led the world to the edge of a new era and a new economy.' 
He is absolutely right. 
He talked about the economy, and how we are the largest producer of automobiles, agricultural exports, semiconductors, steel, and other items. 
Then, closer to the end of the speech, the President said, `As we continue to expand our economy here at home by expanding our leadership in the global economy, I believe that we have an obligation to support and encourage core labor standards and environmental protections abroad.' 
He further said in his speech--this is the President's speech on September 10--`Our goal must be to persuade other countries to build on the prosperity that comes with trade and lift their standards up. As we move forward, we must press countries to provide the labor standards to which all workers are entitled,' et cetera. 
The President said in his speech that we are part of a new world economy. I would say, yes, Mr. President, we are also part of a new world community--a new world community the likes of which we have never seen because of the rapid dissemination of information, the globalization of communication, the instantaneous 
transmission of images and voice, transmittal of information around the globe. People living in the remotest villages of Africa, China, or Asia now know what is happening in other parts of the world. No longer is it kept from them. Increasingly the people on this planet are going to demand their human rights, their fundamental basic human rights, their individual freedoms. That is what Tiananmen Square was all about. 
Yes, Mr. President, you were right. You were right, Mr. President, to say to President Jiang of China that China was on the wrong side of history at Tiananmen Square. You were right, Mr. President. But, Mr. President, to the extent that we have a trade bill before us that limits your authority to negotiate under fast track regarding exploitative child labor, that weakens the provisions dealing with child labor, then you, Mr. President, and this country are on the wrong side of history. 
Those may sound like strong words, but as I have read the President's speech, and as I read the fast-track bill before us, one can only come to one conclusion. This legislation takes us in the wrong direction. It severely limits the ability of the President and our trade negotiators to address the issue of exploitative child labor in trade negotiations. That is right. This bill limits the President's authority. The 1988 bill didn't. I will explain this. 
In this bill, child labor is included in a category of issues under the heading `Regulatory Negotiations.' Under this heading in the bill, negotiations under fast track on child labor may only cover--I will read it--`the lowering of, or derogation from, existing * * * standards.' 
That is all. The language does not allow negotiations aimed at getting a country to agree to raise its child labor standards, no matter how weak or nonexistent they may be. 
Furthermore, the negotiations may only address cases where the other country's lowering of, or derogation from, its child labor standards is--and I will read it directly from the bill--`for the purpose of attracting investment or inhibiting United States exports.' 
I want to make sure my colleagues understand that. 
First of all, the President may only negotiate regarding the lowering of, or derogation from, existing labor standards. He can't negotiate on strengthening them. And he may only negotiate regarding the situation where the lowering of, or derogation from, standards is done for the purpose of attracting investment or inhibiting U.S. exports. 
What about the case where a country lowers or fails to enforce its child labor standards for the purpose of producing goods at lower cost so it can ship them to the United States? That situation is not mentioned in this language, so the President does not have authority to negotiate on that basis according to the terms of the bill. Allowing the use of exploitative child labor to hold the price of goods down is unfair competition, plain and simple, but a country could do that. 
Exploitative child labor in foreign countries unfairly puts competing firms and workers at a disadvantage in the United States and in other countries that do not allow it. Yet, the language in this bill does not indicate that President would have the authority to address that kind of unfair competition against U.S. companies and workers in negotiations and agreements under fast track. As long as the other country is not lowering or derogating from its standards for the purpose of attracting investment or inhibiting U.S. exports, our negotiators cannot negotiate to end this unfair competition. 
The bottom line is that this bill limits the President's authority to seek agreements that would curtail exploitative child labor. 
It is important to clarify this point. I think people will say `Harkin, what are you talking about? How could it limit the President's authority?' 
Well, let us examine that question. 
Under this bill, the President actually has less authority to negotiate regarding child labor, and submit an agreement to Congress under fast-track procedures, than he had in the most recent fast-track legislation, which was contained in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988--the last bill laying out fast-track procedures that we voted on and which this Senator voted for. 
That is right. Let me be very clear. The bill before us provides less authority to negotiate on child labor than the bill that we passed in 1988. 
And that bill has done precious little in terms of exploitative child labor. 
Now, let me explain specifically. The 1988 fast-track law was set up in the same way as the bill before us. It had a listing of principal trade negotiating objectives. One of those listed objectives pertained to worker rights, and I will quote from the 1988 law:  
The principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding worker rights are (A) to promote respect for worker rights. 
As used in the 1988 fast-track law, the term `worker rights" certainly includes the right of children not to be subjected to exploitative labor. That is the plain meaning of the language, and I have confirmed that interpretation with the Congressional Research Service. 
So the 1988 fast-track bill clearly included a negotiating objective encompassing child labor and affirming the President's broad authority to negotiate regarding child labor. 
Well, now someone, I am sure, will point out that the bill before us specifically mentions child labor. Yes, it does. The 1988 bill did not, although as I noted child labor was encompassed in the 1988 bill under the heading of worker rights. But the 1988 bill and this bill are vastly different from one another in the way they are structured and how they deal with child labor. The 1988 bill's negotiating objectives were written in broad terms to urge the President to pursue worker rights issues which included child labor. The 1988 language was not really written as a limitation on the President's authority, but rather as an affirmation of the President's expansive authority to negotiate on these issues and an encouragement to seek agreements on these issues with other countries. 
By contrast, this bill before us is narrowly drawn to circumscribe and limit the President's negotiating authority regarding exploitative child labor. Unlike the 1988 bill, this bill before us is not written to set objectives and encourage the President to reach them, and to do even better if possible, in reaching sound agreements on exploitative child labor. 
Understand this. This bill before us says he may negotiate under fast track only agreements designed to prevent other countries from lowering or derogating from existing child labor standards--no matter how low they may be. He may not negotiate under fast track an agreement in which a country would commit to raise its child labor standards if they are too low or if they do not exist. 
And further, a fast-track agreement may prevent a country from lowering or derogating from its child labor standards only in cases where it does so for the limited purposes of attracting investment or inhibiting U.S. exports. This bill is very limited on the President's authority to negotiate regarding exploitative child labor. Again, he can only negotiate on agreements designed to prevent other countries from lowering their standards, and then he can only do that if that country is lowering its standards for the limited purpose of attracting U.S. investment or limiting U.S. exports. 
Mr. President, you wonder who wrote this. Now, I have in good faith talked a lot to the people around the President about exploitative child labor. I have talked to his Trade Representative in good faith about this issue. And you know, initially they said we are going to put child labor in there. Well, they did, but what they didn't say is they put it in in a way that actually limits the President's authority from what he had in the 1988 bill. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. HARKIN. In my remaining time, Mr. President, I would like to explain why my amendment that I will be offering on fast track deals specifically with exploitative child labor in a way that will enhance and strengthen the President's position. 
Now, there are other labor provisions that ought to be put into this bill, and there has been a lot of debate and disagreement on ways to address labor, environmental, and health and safety issues in this legislation. I understand the reasons for these disagreements. But, honestly, I do not see how there can be any disagreement on the need to address exploitative child labor and to ensure that the President and our trade negotiators do not have their hands tied when it comes to negotiating and concluding agreements on this issue. 
This is the benchmark that I believe should be applied to exploitative child labor in examining the bill before us. It is simply this. The President's authority and our directions to him to negotiate on exploitative child labor should be no less than that for the other important issues contained in this bill. 
Using that benchmark, I would invite my colleagues to examine the fast-track bill that we have before us. This bill has numerous principal negotiating objectives dealing with a wide range of issues--trade in goods, trade in services, foreign investment, intellectual property, agriculture, unfair trade practices, a host of them. 
Again, with respect to all of these other issues, the bill is drafted to articulate objectives, to give guidance and direction to the President, to ensure that the President has sufficiently broad and expansive negotiating authority and to encourages him to use it--a far cry from the limiting way child labor is addressed in this bill. 
Look at the language dealing with intellectual property. The bill sets ambitious goals here and confirms the President's broad authority to negotiate and submit any resulting agreement under fast track. In fact, one of the principal negotiating objectives on intellectual property is `the enactment and effective enforcement by foreign countries of laws that recognize and adequately protect intellectual property.' 
Now, when it comes to intellectual property, the President is not limited to negotiating under fast track only to prevent other countries from lowering or derogating from existing standards. Nor is negotiation limited only to those cases where a country is seeking to attract investment or inhibit U.S. exports. 
To protect intellectual property, the President is to seek agreements in which other countries commit to adopt and enforce higher standards if they need to. Not so for child labor. And his negotiating authority to protect intellectual property covers the broad range of ways in which intellectual property rights may be violated. Again, not so for child labor. 
My amendment regarding exploitative child labor simply tracks the language in the bill on intellectual property. It is basically the same language, with conforming modifications. My amendment ensures that the President has the same authority to negotiate on exploitative child labor as he has on protecting intellectual property. It puts into the bill that one of our trade negotiating objectives includes the enactment and effective enforcement by other countries of laws against exploitative child labor. It adds exploitative child labor to the bill as a negotiating objective. 
My amendment does not tie the President's hands. It does not say there has to be a predetermined outcome on child labor in trade negotiations. It just says that in dealing with exploitative child labor, the President has the authority, the same authority, as he has to protect against the pirating of a song, a computer chip or a compact disc. We ought to ensure this bill gives the President the same authority to seek protection against exploitative child labor as a means of unfair competition as he has to seek protection against the misappropriation of intellectual property as a means of unfair competition. 
My amendment says that exploitative child labor will be on the table during negotiations. It will be one of our principal trade negotiating objectives. It will have the same status and stature as intellectual property. 
Mr. President, again I am not talking about 18-year old kids 
working, or 17-year-old kids, no. This is what I am talking about right here. This picture is of a young girl working in a field in Mexico after NAFTA. We have more children working in Mexico today after NAFTA than we did before. And I do not mean just teenagers. I mean kids 8, 9, 10 years of age, too. And yet we had some side agreements covering child labor on NAFTA, but they are not being enforced. 
We have over 200 million working kids in the world today, more and more being put into factories and plants and, yes, agriculture. My Iowa farmers can compete against anyone in the world, but they cannot compete against that girl because that girl is a slave laborer. That is slave labor. This girl has no choice. She has no options. She cannot go to school. She cannot go to school because she is out in the fields all day, the same as a kid working in a glass factory, a shoe factory, a garment factory, or a rug factory. And these are often kids that are 8, 9, 10 years old. 
Now, I believe that our trade negotiators and the people down at the White House have the best of intentions. I am sure there is no one there who likes exploitative child labor. For the life of me, I cannot understand why they sent a bill to us such as they did and why they will go along with such a weak bill relating to exploitative child labor. If they would only compare this bill with the one in 1988, they would understand that the bill before us curtails, circumscribes and limits the President's authority on exploitative child labor relative to the 1988 bill. 
I have been talking to people down at the White House about putting exploitative child labor in this bill at the same level as intellectual property, but for some reason they just cannot quite seem to get on board. 
There was a time not too long ago when intellectual property rights were regarded as extraneous to trade, just as some argue child labor is today. I remember when I was in the Navy back in the 1960s. People would go to Taiwan and they would get records for perhaps 10 cents each--books and encyclopedias for just pennies--because Taiwan was pirating the records; they were pirating the books and printing them. I remember people I knew in the Navy would go to Taiwan and load up with books and records, but today there are international rules in trade agreements to protect intellectual property. So there was a time when intellectual property was considered extraneous to trade agreements. Not so today. Exploitative child labor should not be extraneous today. 
Yes, we are in a new era. We are in a new world economy, but we are also in a new world community. And just as we have taken the lead in the world economy, as we have taken the lead in breaking down trade barriers--and I believe we should--we must take the lead in stopping this, the last vestige of slavery in the world today, exploitative child labor. 
We can debate and discuss labor issues, environmental issues, and there are all kinds of different perspectives and arguments about them. There should be no argument on exploitative child labor. There should be no disagreement on this. There are distinct lines. Children should not be working like this. Our trade negotiators, when they sit down at that table, ought to be negotiating on exploitative child labor. It ought to be a trade negotiating objective. It ought to have the same stature, the same force, the same effect as intellectual property because not only is this a moral imperative of ours; it is imperative to stop it as unfair competition because that child laborer, that child slave, is producing goods that are sent to this country, that compete against our products. My farmers cannot compete against that. Our workers cannnot compete against that. They should not have to compete against it. This bill is fatally flawed and the administration needs to send get behind the amendment that I will be offering. We need to adopt that amendment to make sure that stopping exploitative child labor has the same force and effect, and the same level of authority, in trade negotiations as stopping the pirating of intellectual property. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Every year thousands of Americans are victimized by fraudulent telemarketing promotions. And, unfortunately, these scam artists prey most often on our senior citizens. The losses every year are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. My amendment will help law enforcement to more effectively combat these abuses. 
Today, it's all to easy for telemarketing rip-off artists to profit from the current system. How do these rip-offs occur? Advertisements regarding sweepstakes, contests, loans, credit reports and other promotions appear in newspapers, magazines, and other direct mail and telephone solicitations. The operators of many of these phoney promotions set up telephone boiler rooms for a few months in which a number of phones are operated to receive calls responding to their ads. They steal thousands--even millions--of dollars from innocent victims and then they simply disappear. They take the money and run--moving on to another location to start all over again. 
Here's just one example. Not too long ago, 30,000 Iowans received postcards from an organization calling itself Sweepstakes International, Inc. The postcard enticed recipients to call a 900-number and they were charged $9.95 on their phone bill. 
Based on a Postal Service investigation, civil action was initiated in U.S. District Court in Iowa. As a result, the promotion was halted and $1.7 million was frozen. This represented just one and a half month's revenue from the scam! 
My amendment will protect telemarketing victims by providing law enforcement the authority to more quickly obtain the name, address, and physical location of businesses suspected of telemarketing fraud. Phone companies would have to provide law enforcement officials ONLY the name, address and physical location of a telemarketing business holding a phone number if the officials submitted a formal written request for this information relevant to a legitimate law enforcement investigation. It will make it easier for officers to identify and locate these operations. This is similar to the procedure that is already in place for post office box investigations. 
Mr. President, it is necessary to crack down on serious consumer fraud. With this change, we will have many more successful efforts to shut down these rip-off artists like several recent cases in my home state of Iowa.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and my good friend, Senator Specter, for yielding this time. 
I especially wish to thank Senator Specter, our chairman, and his staff for the skill they have demonstrated and the cooperation which they have given us in putting this bill together and working out the many compromises that were necessary to come up with this very bipartisan conference agreement. It took a lot of staff meetings, a lot of give and take, but the result is one that merits the support of all Senators. 
This conference report, I believe, is the most important bill we will pass this year after the balanced budget agreement. It includes a number of very important advances. 
First, the agreement significantly expands our Nation's commitment to quality education for our children. We have provided the largest increase for special education in our history. I repeat that. We have provided the largest increase for special education in our history. We have made college more affordable by increasing the maximum Pell grant to $3,000, the highest ever. We have expanded support to make sure schoolchildren have access to computers and other technology and for training teachers on how to use this technology. Computers in the classroom are of little value if the teachers do not know how to use them. 
I am especially pleased that the conference committee agreed to my proposals to place greater emphasis on making sure that every American child enters school ready to learn. The agreement before us increases Head Start funding by $374 million. That is $50 million more than the President requested, and, more significantly, I believe this bill doubles the Early Head Start Program, that is, the birth-to-2-year-old program, at $279 million, so we have doubled the early intervention program for Early Head Start. 
The conference agreement also provides an 11-percent increase in funding to $350 million for the early intervention program for infants and toddlers with disabilities under part H of IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. That is an 11 percent increase for that part H. 
Finally, the conference report includes an additional $50 million for the child care and development block grant to increase the quality of child care for infants. We all know that these are front-end investments that will pay dividends for us in the future. 
Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, our subcommittee has worked for many years to combat fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicare Program. A recent audit by the HHS inspector general found that somewhere in the neighborhood of $23 billion was lost last year alone just to this problem of fraud, waste and abuse. I am pleased to say that the agreement before us significantly expands our efforts to stop this Medicare waste. Coupled with 
mandatory increases, our bill provides a full 25-percent increase in support for audits and other fraud-fighting activities, from $440 million to $550 million. 
In addition, we have included bill language that provides Medicare greater resources to more aggressively target problem providers who are bilking the system. We need to do even more, including, at long last, to get to competitive bidding in Medicare just like they have gotten in the Veterans Administration. But the reforms in this will save Medicare and the taxpayers billions of dollars. 
One major concern I have about this bill is our inability to adequately address our health services and training needs and simultaneously provide generous increases for health research. I am pleased that we have included nearly $1 billion additional for NIH, a total of over $13.5 billion, for medical research. But I am concerned that most health services programs received small or no funding increases. We just cannot continue to have this battle between the challenge to adequately fund biomedical research, which we have to meet, and the lack of increased funding for health services programs and training. 
Now, I will not go into it at length here--I have given many speeches on the floor about this--but I feel strongly that the money we provide for biomedical research must come from outside of the discretionary pot of money we have. 
Mr. President, during this session of the Congress, the Senate went on record 99 to nothing to double the funding for NIH over the next 5 years--99 to nothing. In other words, 99 Senators stood up and voted and said, yes, we should double funding for NIH in the next 5 years. 
Now, if we did that within the constraints of the balanced budget agreement, with the pot of money that our committee has, at the end of this 5-year period of time there wouldn't be one penny for any other discretionary health program. In other words, the Senate has said 99 to nothing we want to double NIH funding. OK, if we do it through our Appropriations Committee, through the discretionary money that we have, there will not be anything left for any other health program. There would be no Centers for Disease Control, no Ryan White funding, no health training funding, nothing. That would all have to be zeroed out, and we still would not have enough money to double NIH funding. 
So if we are really serious, and I hope we are, about doubling NIH funding over the next 5 years, then we have to find some source of funding that is outside of the normal appropriations process. 
I am also concerned that our agreement does not adequately assure that the rerun of the Teamsters election will be supervised. 
I think that is vitally important. This bill does not adequately assure that. I am hopeful that is eventually what will happen. It is a commitment that we cannot back away from. I am hopeful that we can take some steps, when the Congress comes back in January and February, to make sure that the next Teamster election is in fact supervised. 
But overall, as I have said, this is a very good agreement. It is a bipartisan agreement that deserves our support. 
I again compliment Senator Specter and his staff and mine for a job well done. I want to specifically thank Craig Higgins, Betilou Taylor, Jim Sourwine, Dale Cabaniss, and Jack Chow of the majority staff and Marsha Simon and Ellen Murray of my staff. In addition, I want to thank Bev Schroeder, Laura Hessburg, and Peter Reinecke of my personal staff for their contributions. 
Mr. President, I urge all Senators give wholehearted support to this conference agreement. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this week marks the end of Iowa native Paul Johnson's remarkable 4-year tenure as Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation Service at the Department of Agriculture. As a long-time farmer and conservationist, Paul brought to NRCS a bold vision of private lands as a national resource to be managed in harmony with the environment. 
During the past 4 years, Paul guided his agency through a major reorganization, from the Soil Conservation Service to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and has shaped the agency's programs and policies to reflect this new emphasis on the conservation of all natural resources. Paul's leadership has inspired a new commitment to conservation both within USDA and across the country. 
Paul's influence was obvious in the development of the landmark conservation title of the 1996 Farm Bill, which included among many important provisions the new Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. The creation and implementation of these programs under Paul's direction are hallmarks of the energy, creativity, and commitment that he brought to NRCS, and of the legacy he leaves behind. 
The agency's eloquent publication, `A Geography of Hope,' is a visionary statement of the NRCS mission and testimony to Paul's farm roots and passion for the land. For 23 years on his farm in Decorah, IA, Paul has raised corn, hay, and Christmas trees, and had a dairy herd and sheep. 
In our home State Paul is highly regarded as an architect of environmental legislation. As a representative in the Iowa General Assembly from 1984 to 1990, he authored the Iowa Groundwater Protection Act, the Iowa Resource Enhancement and Protection Program, the Iowa Energy Efficiency Act and the Iowa Integrated Farm Management Program. For his leadership in the State he was named conservation legislator of the year by several organizations in Iowa and was named to the Iowa Conservation Hall of Fame by the Wildlife Society. 
Paul holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in forestry from the University of Michigan, where he also pursued doctoral studies in forestry. He taught forestry in Ghana for two years, and has been visiting professor of environmental policy at Luther College. Paul worked for the USDA Forest Service in the Pacific Northwest and also has studied and consulted on forestry, agriculture, environment, and energy issues in Honduras, Costa Rica, Sweden, and the former Soviet Union. 
Paul served on the Board of Agriculture of the National Academy of Sciences from 1988 to 1994, where he was involved in major studies in agriculture, forestry, and conservation. He also has served as an assistant commissioner for his local soil conservation district. 
Paul brings both a global perspective and a local sensibility to conservation. While I am sorry to see him leave NRCS, I look forward to his return to Iowa, where he will continue to enrich our State. I would like to extend congratulations on a job well done, and wish Paul and his wife Pat the best on their return home.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, earlier this week an expert scientific panel at the National Institutes of Health strongly endorsed acupuncture as an effective treatment for certain conditions. This is the first time that the NIH has endorsed a major alternative therapy. It is truly a breakthrough, and is just the type of advance that I envisioned when I worked to establish the Office of Alternative Medicine at the NIH. 
The consensus conference held by NIH involved top scientists from around the Nation, including those with expertise in acupuncture and experts in research evaluation and design. These scientists, led by Dr. David Ramsey, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, objectively evaluated the evidence of acupuncture's efficacy and came to a consensus that this therapy is safe and provides significant help for a number of health problems. 
They found that acupuncture is an effective treatment for postoperative dental pain, postoperative and chemotherapy-induced nausea, nausea during pregnancy, and other conditions. They also identified a number of other conditions, including asthma, substance addiction, stroke rehabilitation, headache, general muscle pain, low back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, for which acupuncture demonstrates effectiveness but with a less degree of certainty. 
I was dismayed to read that despite this consensus agreement after rigorous evaluation of the scientific evidence, there is still a fringe element in the medical community that refuses to acknowledge the facts. These critics seem only to be interested in bad mouthing anything out of what they consider to be the medical mainstream. While we all benefit from a healthy dose of skepticism in the scientific process, I hope in the future, this small group of critics take off their blinders long enough to objectively look at the scientific evidence and give credit where credit is due. 
Mr. President, as I have said before, millions of Americans--more and more each day--are using alternative medical therapies. In 1993, the FDA reported that Americans were spending $500 million a year for between 9 and 12 million acupuncture treatment visits. Unfortunately, research has not kept pace. The NIH has failed to break through biases that exist and devote the attention to this area that is needed. As a result, American consumers have been denied information about the effectiveness of the therapies they are using or thinking of using. 
I am pleased to report that the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 Health and Human Services appropriations bill has agreed to provide more than a 50-percent increase to the Office of Alternative Medicine to expand efforts like this week's consensus conference on acupuncture to other work and to investigate and validate complementary and alternative therapies. Our report also guarantees that this increase will be spent on grants and contracts that directly respond to requests for proposals and program announcements issued by the Office of Alternative Medicine. 
Mr. President, this week's endorsement of acupuncture by NIH is a positive step forward for the American public and for the medical research in our Nation. I hope that it will lead not only to greater acceptance of, and access to, cost effective acupuncture services, but to increased willingness on the part of NIH and the medical community to commit to the objective evaluation of a range of promising complementary and alternative medical therapies.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today Senator Mack and I, joined by a strong bipartisan group of our colleagues, are introducing legislation that would prevent tobacco companies from claiming the settlement or judgement payments as a tax-deductible expense, and use the resulting savings to substantially expand our Nation's investment in the search for medical breakthroughs. 
It is important to note that this common sense proposal is the first major tobacco legislation this year to be introduced with strong bipartisan support. We have 16 cosponsors--8 Democrats and 8 Republicans--and I believe we'll have many more as more of our colleagues have the time to review this bill. Senator Mack and I are also very pleased to have the support of over 170 organizations from across the Nation signed up in support of this plan. 
During the negotiations that led to the proposed national tobacco settlement, lawyers for the big tobacco companies insisted on a provision stating that `all payments pursuant to this agreement shall be deemed ordinary and necessary business expenses.' This means that all payments under this proposal, an estimated $368.5 billion over 25 years, would be tax deductible. Thus the industry could write off about 35 percent of the entire settlement payment of $368.5 billion, as well as any future payments or fines. So, if this were allowed to happen, the American people--not Big Tobacco--would be forced to pay approximately $130 billion of the tobacco settlement. 
But the American people have paid enough. They've paid by having their kids deliberately targeted in slick advertising campaigns. They've paid by having the industry lie to them about the health effects of tobacco. And they've paid with disease and death. 
Tobacco products kill more than 400,000 Americans every year--that's more deaths than from AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, drugs, and fires combined. Last year, close to 5,000 Iowans died from smoking related illnesses. 
Mr. President, our bipartisan bill would close this outrageous loophole in the proposed national tobacco settlement, and open a new source of funding for investing in health research. 
And that's what we really need. The proposed settlement provides funding for smoking cessation programs, anti-smoking education programs, and FDA enforcement--but only a tiny amount is set aside for vital scientific research on lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. 
The Senate is already on record, in a vote of 98-0, to double the budget of NIH within 5 years. If we create a trust fund for medical research as I have been calling for since 1993 and deposit in it the savings from the elimination of this special interest loophole, we could take a major step to meet the Senate's objective and make even more headway in curing killer diseases. 
A fund for health research would provide additional resources for our search for medical breakthroughs over and above those provided to NIH in the annual appropriations process. The fund would greatly enhance the quality of health care by investing more in finding preventive measures, cures and more cost effective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions that strike Americans. 
In 1993 and 1994 I argued that any health care reform plan should include additional funding for health research. Health care reform was taken off the front burner but the need to increase our Nation's commitment to health research has only grown. 
While health care spending devours nearly $1 trillion annually our medical research budget is dying of starvation. The United States devotes less than 2 percent of its total health care budget to health research. The Defense Department spends 15 percent of its budget on research. Does this make sense? The cold war is over but the war against disease and disability continues. 
Increased investment in health research is key to reducing health costs in the long run. If we can find cures for lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease, the savings would be enormous. 
Mr. President, I do everything I can to increase funding for NIH through the appropriations process. But, given the current budget situation and freeze in discretionary spending what we can do is limited. Without action, our investment in medical research through the NIH is likely to decline in real terms. 
The NIH is able to fund only about 25 percent of competing research projects or grant applications deemed worthy of funding. This is compared to rates of 30 percent or more just over a decade ago. Science and cutting edge medical research are being put on hold. We may be giving up possible cures for diabetes, Parkinson's, cancer, and countless other diseases. 
Our lack of investment in research may also be discouraging our young people from pursuing careers in medical research. The number of people under the age of 36 even applying for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993. This is due to a host of factors but I'm afraid that the lower success rates among applicants is making biomedical research less and less attractive to young people. 
I am tremendously heartened by the significant bipartisan coalition of 16 Senators that has formed in support of our bill. Our colleagues who have joined with us on this legislation understand that health research is an investment in our future--an investment in our children and grandchildren. 
Mr. President, this legislation is common sense, bipartisan--and it's the right thing to do. Senator Mack and I join in asking our colleagues for their willingness to carefully review our proposal. Certainly any tobacco legislation that this Congress adopts next year should contribute significantly to our Nation's commitment in the search for medical breakthroughs.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes about a very troubling shortcoming in the legislation to grant the President fast-track authority, and that is its failure to adequately address the issue of abusive and exploitative child labor. 
First, let me discuss what I mean by exploitative child labor. It is a term well known in international relations. We are not talking about children who work part time after school or on weekends. There is nothing wrong with that. I worked in my youth. I bet the occupant of the Chair worked in his youth. There is nothing wrong with young people working. That is not the issue. 
Exploitative child labor involves children under the age of 15, forced to work, many times in hazardous conditions, many under slave-like conditions, who sweat long hours for little or no pay. They are denied an education or the opportunity to grow and develop. It is the kind of work that endangers a child's physical and emotional well-being and growth. The International Labor Organization estimates that there are some 250 million children worldwide engaged in this sort of economic activity. 
These are the kind of kids we are talking about. We are talking about this young Mexican girl, harvesting vegetables in the fields of Hidalgo State. They are out there working long hours, all day long. They are not in school. You know, my farmers in Iowa can compete with anybody around the world. That is why we have always believed in free trade. But we believe in a level playing field. My farmers cannot compete with this slave. That is what she is. You can dress it up in all kinds of fancy words and cover it up, but that girl out in that field is working under slave-like conditions because she has no other choice. And isn't that the definition of slavery? 
She is not alone. It is in Pakistan and India, Bolivia, Southeast Asia, all around the world--children working under these kinds of conditions. I am not talking about after school. I am talking about kids who are denied an education, forced to work in fields and factories under hazardous conditions for little or no pay. 
I have been working on this issue for a long time. In 1992 I introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act, to try to end abusive and exploitative child labor. It would have banned the importation of all goods into the United States made by abusive and exploitative child labor. 
Some have said this is revolutionary, but I don't believe so. I believe it is written in the most conservative of all ideas that this country stands for; that international trade cannot ignore international values. 
Would the President of the United States ever send a bill to Congress dealing with free trade or opening up trade with a country that employed slave labor? Of course not; he would be laughed off the floor. But what about this young girl? What about the millions more like her around the world? They are as good as slaves because they don't have any other choice and they are forced to do this under the guise of free trade. 
We, as a nation, cannot ignore, this. In 1993, this Senate put itself on record in opposition to the exploitation of children by passing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that I submitted. 
In 1994, as chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee, I requested the Department of Labor to begin a series of reports on child labor. Those reports, now three in number, represent the most thorough documentation ever assembled by the U.S. Government on this issue. They published three reports; the fourth will be completed shortly. 
Earlier this year, I introduced a bill called the Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act, which would give consumers the power to decide through a voluntary labeling system whether they want to buy an article made by child labor or not. Every time you buy a shirt, it says on the shirt where it was made. It tells you how much cotton, how much polyester and how much nylon, et cetera, is in that shirt. It has a price tag on it and tells you how much it cost to buy. But it won't tell you what it may have cost a child to make that shirt or that pair of shoes or that glassware or that brass object or that soccer ball or any number of items, including the vegetables that this girl is harvesting in Mexico. 
So we said, let's have a voluntary labeling system, and if a company wanted to import items into the United States, they could affix a label saying it was child labor free. In exchange for that label, they would have to agree to allow surprise inspections of their plants to ensure that no children were ever employed there. 
To me, this puts the power in the hands of consumers. It gives us the information that we need to know. I still think this is the direction in which we ought to go, a labeling system, and we have experience in that. 
Right now `RUGMARK' is being affixed to labels on rugs coming out of India and Nepal that verifies that rug was not made with child labor, and it is working. It is working well, because now the people authorized to use the `RUGMARK' label have to open up their plants for people to come in and make sure no children are employed there, and they get the label `RUGMARK,' which certifies it was not made with child labor. The `RUGMARK' program also provides funds to build schools and provides teachers to educate these children so that they are not displaced. So if I, as a consumer, want to buy a nice hand-knotted rug, if I see that `RUGMARK' label, I know it was not made by child labor. More and more importers are importing `RUGMARK' rugs into this country. It has worked well in Europe, and now it is in the United States. 
In October of this year, Congress passed into law another provision that I had worked on with Congressman Sanders in the House. It is regarding section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which makes it clear that goods made with forced or indentured labor are to be barred from entry into the United States. Section 307 of the tariff law of 1930 banned articles made by prison labor and forced labor from coming into this country. That has been on the books since 1930. What Congress passed was a clarification of that law or an explanation of that law to say that it also covers goods made by forced or indentured child labor. Congress passed it as part of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. 
So you might say, Well, if you have done that, then there is nothing else to do. But that is only an appropriations bill, and it is only good for 1 year. We are now working with Customs officials to try to decide how they find those articles made by 
exploitative child labor. Again, it is only good for 1 year. Will we be able to put this into permanent law next year? I don't know. And that still does not address the issue of children who don't make goods bound for the U.S. market. 
Right now, Mr. President, it is estimated somewhere in the neighborhood of 12.5 million kids around the world are involved in this kind of exploitative child labor, making goods that go into foreign trade that come into this country; 12.5 million kids, a large number being exploited for the economic gain of others. 
Make no mistake about it, their economic gain is an economic loss for this child and their country and for the United States. Every child lost to the workplace in this manner is a child who will not learn a valuable skill to help their country develop economically or becoming a more active participant in the global markets. 
We have done much to address the issue of exploitative child labor, but I am sorry to say that one of the most important measures that we will be asked to vote on this year or perhaps next year, depending on when it comes here for a vote--this bill, S. 1269, the so-called fast-track bill--does not recognize the depths of the problem of exploitative child labor and does little to help protect them from exploitation. 
This bill protects songs. It protects computer chips. Let me read. Intellectual property. This bill, under part B, says, `the principal trade negotiating objectives.' There are 15. Principal trade negotiating objectives. The first is reduction of barriers to trade in goods. The second is trade in services. The third is foreign investment. Fourth is intellectual property, and it says:  
The principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding intellectual property are-- 
And it has a bunch of things here. It says: 
. . . to recognize and adequately protect intellectual property, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, semiconductor chip layout designs. . .

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know people are here to speak. I just want to finish. 
We are protecting semiconductor chip computer design layouts. If we can protect a song, we can protect a child. That is my bottom line on this. What do they do with child labor? Oh, it is back here on page 18, `It's the policy of the United States to reinforce trade agreements process by seeking to establish in the International Labor Organization'--the ILO--`a mechanism for the examination of, reporting on'--et cetera, and includes exploitative child labor. It doesn't mean a thing. I know all about the ILO. It is a great organization. It has absolutely zero enforcement powers. 
If we can protect a song, why can't we protect a child? Why don't we elevate exploitative child labor to the same status as intellectual property rights? Let's make it a separate principal trade negotiating objective of this Government that when we negotiate a trade agreement with a country, yes, we will negotiate on trade in services and on foreign investment and intellectual property. But let's also put child labor right up there as one of the principal negotiating objectives of our Government. 
I have an amendment drafted to that extent. It mirrors exactly what is done in intellectual property. We make this young girl the equivalent of a song or a computer chip layout design. Anything less than that means that this fast-track legislation ought to be consigned to the trash heap of history. If we are not willing to take that kind of a step to announce it loudly and forcefully to the White House and to instruct the people who are 
involved in negotiating our trade agreements, then this body has no reason at all to pass fast-track legislation. We must elevate the issue of exploitative child labor to that level. Anything less will not do. 
I yield the floor and thank my friend from Missouri for giving me the opportunity to finish my statement.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to continue the discussion that I began a few days ago about the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board as it pertains to the two nominees that are about to be before the Senate for confirmation. Again, as I said before, I do not take this time in any way to try to keep these two nominees from being on the Board. I have met with both of them. They are fine individuals. I just happen to think, as I will state a little more in depth later, that their economic philosophy and their positions on what the Fed ought to be doing are just too much in line with the present thinking at the Fed. And I think that is going to cost us dearly in the years ahead. 
Having said that, I don't intend in any way to try to block their final confirmation. But I wanted to take this time of the Senate to talk a little bit more about the monetary policy of the Fed and what it is doing to this country. 
In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee yesterday morning, Mr. Greenspan said he would welcome a debate on whether or not the Federal Reserve should make inflation its sole goal, or whether there should be a balance between lowering unemployment and fighting inflation. Well, I welcome that opportunity. I hope my statements from Monday and today will help begin the debate on this important issue. It is an important issue and it affects every American. It especially affects working Americans and their families. Fed policy--basically the decisions they make--tells every American family how much they are going to have to spend on their car payment or home mortgage payment, or whether or not they are going to be able to put away some money for a college education for their kids. It affects every American family. Yet, we seem to just sort of let monetary go by the way, without ever calling into question the assumptions and reasons behind the decisions of the Fed. 
There seems to be this sort of attitude that, well, if the Fed says it, it must be true. What can we do about it? Aren't they independent? Don't they operate independently? That is true. They do. But the Federal Reserve is not a creature of the Constitution. It does not have a constitutional framework in which to operate. The Federal Reserve was set up by Congress; it is a creature of Congress. We represent the people of this country. I don't think Congress ought to be in the position of making monetary policy on a day-to-day basis. Far be it from that. I do believe the Fed ought to have that independence, but I also believe that the Congress ought to exercise judicious oversight over the Federal Reserve and carve out, guide, and direct the Federal Reserve in the area in which we believe it ought to go in setting its monetary policy. 
I think the question should be asked, `How independent really is the Fed?' Is it not really made up of the major banks of this country and the major lending institutions? How really independent are they? We do have a Board of Governors and, obviously, they are not all bankers. There are economists, people like Mr. Greenspan, and others not in banking. I believe one of the new nominees was an investment banker prior to his coming on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. You wonder sometimes really how independent they really are. I think the Congress has every right and responsibility to the people of this country to help set the policy and guidance for the Federal Reserve. 
Now, much of the Federal Reserve's policies are driven by what I have now come to believe to be a very arcane concept called NAIRU, the nonaccelerating inflationary rate of unemployment. I doubt that one in a million Americans even knows what that means. But it is a guiding principle of the Fed, and it has determined that interest rates will remain high for working Americans. Because of NAIRU and because of the grip that this arcane concept has on the Fed, we have unduly high interest rates today, higher than our historical averages, higher than what is warranted by the rate of inflation out there. 
Well, NAIRU says is that if unemployment goes below a certain level, then inflation will take off--not just increase, but it will accelerate at such a rate that only unusually high interest rates could ever stop it. Well, as I said Monday, NAIRU has been proven to be inaccurate. It was once believed that inflation would accelerate if unemployment went below 6 percent. They said if it goes below 6 percent, look out, inflation is going to take off. Well, it went below 6 percent and inflation didn't take off. Well, the believers in this concept said, we were just wrong, it is really 5.5 percent unemployment. Well, then it went down below that. Then they said it is 5 percent. Surely, if we get to 5 percent unemployment, boy, inflation is going to take off. And because of that, we saw the Federal Reserve, under Mr. Greenspan, double the interest rates, the Federal funds rate, from 3 percent to 6 percent in 18 months. I believe it was in 1993 and 1994 when they increased those interest rates--or 1994 and 1995. In an 18-month period of time, it went from 3 percent to 6 percent because they said unemployment was getting so low that we are going to have to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check. 
Then unemployment went below 5 percent, and still no signs of accelerating inflation. And the Fed admits there are no sings of accelerating inflation. And, despite no signs of this, the Fed is still willing to raise interest rates through the use of its so-called `preemptive strike.' I don't understand the justification for an interest rate hike based on an assumption that sometime in the future accelerating inflation may occur. We don't know when but sometime down that road it may happen. So, therefore, we have to jack up interest rates now. 
In fact, Alan Greenspan admitted that `economic understanding is imperfect and measurement is imprecise. . . .' If the Fed's measurements are imperfect and they are not precise, how can we assume that the Fed knows what it is doing when it launches one of its preemptive strikes? We don't know, because, first of all, the Federal Reserve Board meetings are kept secret for 5 years. Why? There is no reason to keep their Board meetings secret for 5 years. I would think that at least after 1 year we ought to at least be able to look at their Board meetings and find out why they decided to do what they did. 
So we have a Fed that uses an outdated concept to fight inflation when it might not even know how much inflation is actually in the economy. 
Again, what we need to understand is that there is a difference between rapidly accelerating inflation and modest inflation. Mild inflation may redistribute income--causing some pain to those who are unemployed--but it doesn't destroy employment, and in fact may even be beneficial in terms of more employment and rising incomes. 
To quote James K. Galbraith, a professor of economics at the University of Texas, `It therefore makes little difference, from the standpoint of inflation dangers that matter most, whether one pursues low unemployment or not. The inflation costs of lower unemployment are small, tolerable, and easily reversible, if necessary--and that is using pessimistic assumptions. The dangers of an external supply shock, though much greater, are not closely related to the rate of unemployment, and cannot be reduced by a slow-growth policy. The lesson to be drawn is that there is no benefit in failing to pursue full employment.' 
To further quote Galbraith, `Therefore, at a minimum, policy should do nothing to slow economic growth. Let the economy grow. And if growth slows, policymakers should react quickly by lowering interest rates in an effort to keep progress going. There is certainly no benefit from slower growth and rising unemployment while the inflationary costs of a stimulative policy in response to evidence of a slowdown are speculative and small.' 
However, there may be greater risks posed to the economy should the Fed continue its all-out effort to fulfill the bond market's goal of zero inflation. 
And that really is what Mr. Greenspan is after. They want zero inflation. But I believe that may pose a very great risk to our country. Last summer, George Akerlof, William Dickens, and George Perry of the Brookings Institution published a study called `The Macroeconomics of Low Inflation.' Their study argues that controlled amounts of modest inflation are beneficial to the economy by preventing very high enduring levels of joblessness. In sum, this paper suggests the economic and social costs of getting to zero inflation, otherwise known as `price stability,' are far higher than most economists believe. 
To quote the study, `The main implication for policymakers is that targeting zero inflation . . . will lead to a large inefficiency in the allocation of resources, as reflected in sustainable rate of unemployment that is unnecessarily high.' 
I raise this point because zero inflation--`price stability,' as it is otherwise known--is the stated goal of Mr. Greenspan and the two nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson. 
Again, to quote Mr. Greenspan in his 1997 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, `The view that the Federal Reserve's best contribution to growth is to foster price stability has informed both our tactical decisions on the stance of monetary policy. * * *' 
Mr. Gramlich stated, `In the long run, the most fundamental of these objectives is stable prices.' 
Mr. Ferguson said, `Price stability should be a central goal of monetary policy.' 
What concerns me is that in their blind pursuit inflation based upon this arcane notion of NAIRU, that we are coming very dangerously close to deinflation. It may even be there right now. 
Over the past year the core inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index, has increased by approximately 2.2 percent. But Mr. Greenspan and others say the CPI is overstated by as much as 1.5 percent. That means we might have basically zero inflation in our country. 
So what happens when you reach zero inflation? Beyond the question of the Federal Reserve's policies on incomes of average people, which I mentioned on Monday and which I will talk about shortly, my concern is about the real possibility that the Fed may send our economy and the world's economy into a serious period of deinflation. 
In the United States, expectation of accelerating inflation is shrinking significantly. We brought down our budget deficit to where it is practically nothing. So we have our fiscal house in order. Inflation is very low. Unemployment is going down. But the Federal Reserve and the nominees before us see zero inflation at the end process. But, in fact, zero inflation is a point on a continuum. You can have inflation. You have zero inflation. Then you have deflation. 
I believe right now we are on the precipice of risking a destabilizing situation which may push us into a deflationary period. 
So I think deinflation to me right now is more scary than modest inflation. I believe that a serious escalation on that side--deinflation--is more likely over the next 5 years than significantly higher inflation. Yet, the Fed is paying no mind at all to that. 
The old `pay any price, bear any burden' to battle inflation has prevented the American economy from reaching its full potential. And what it has done is it has said to the middle class that you get less and less of growth of our economic pie. 
Before I yield to the Senator from North Dakota, I want to point out what is happening here with the distribution of the economic pie, as we see it. This chart says it all. If you are in the top 20 percent of the income earners of America, you are getting a larger and larger portion of the income in America. But if you are in the bottom 20 percent--actually, if you are in the bottom 80 percent--you are getting less and less. It is the top 20 percent that is getting more and more of the growth in the economic pie of our country. Again, that is because we have kept the inflation rates artificially high. 
That seems to make sense when you think about it. Who likes high interest rates? If you have money you like high interest rates. If you do not have money, you are a low-income American, and you are a working family wanting to buy a new car, or new home, or put away some money for your kids' college education borrowing money for college education, you are hurt by high interest rates. 
Again, this chart also spells it out. `Labor and Capital Shares of National Income, 1993-1996.' If you look at 
the percentage share of national income, what we make as a Nation, labor's share since 1993 has gone down, and is continuing down. But if you look at capital's share, from 1993 to 1996, it keeps going up. That is because of the policies of the Federal Reserve System. More money is going into capital; less and less going to labor. 
Again, this chart also shows it. This shows the corporate profit rates and median weekly earnings, 1989-1996. If you look at the corporate profit rate since 1993 it has skyrocketed. 
Keep in mind that Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates--doubled the Federal funds rates--in 1994 and 1995. Look at that tremendous increase in corporate profits. Yet, look at median weekly earnings during the same period of time. Down they have come, especially after 1993. 
So, again, more and more of our national income is going to corporate profits, and less and less is going to median weekly earnings of the families of this country. 
We have all seen what has been happening on the stock market the last few days. One person from the administration called me the other day and alluded to the fact that my holding up these two nominees sent the wrong signals to the financial markets. I said, `What about the signals we are sending to working families?' What about those people out there working hard with maybe two jobs or maybe three jobs with the husband and wife trying to make ends meet, trying to borrow money for a home or a car? What about signals to them? We are not sending any signals. All we are sending to them is higher and higher interest rates all the time. 
The high rates of interest, I believe, are slowing the growth of our economy. And, more than that, it is redistributing the growth that we have in such a way that those at the top--the top 20 percent--are getting more and more of national income. The bottom 80 percent are getting less and less. 
Again, just before the Federal Reserve began its series of rate hikes in 1994, the Federal funds rate was nearly zero. This chart shows what happened on real interest rates. 
They are higher than people think; higher than historical rates. Here they were in 1994. The real Federal funds rate was about one-half percent. Today it is about 3.3 percent. They have come up, and they have stayed up during this entire period of time. So we have higher real rates than we have had before during a period of time when there was absolutely no signs of accelerating inflation in our economy; none whatsoever. Why are these interest rates still high? 
It is because the Fed has a misguided policy called NAIRU. 
I would like to discuss this chart entitled `Alan Greenspan and Long-Term Interest Rates.' It is interesting that every time interest rates, long-term interest rates, start to come down, Mr. Greenspan gives a speech, and interest rates go back up. Back here--this was last year--Mr. Greenspan gave a speech. He called said the stock market was characterized by `irrational exuberance.' What happened? Well, interest rates started going up. 
Then interest rates started to come down again. Then Mr. Greenspan gave his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and hints that the Fed may change its interest rate policy. Interest rates go up again. 
Then the market forces start to bring interest rates back down again. And then again just this month Mr. Greenspan testifies before the House Budget Committee, again drops subtle hints that in fact the economy is overheated, things are going too fast or maybe there is the specter of inflation. Interest rates start up again. And yet there is absolutely no sign of any inflation. In fact, I think a case can be made that we are right now near zero inflation in our country. 
This is the time when labor's share ought to be a little bit better. This line ought to start going up. This line ought to start going up so our working families get a better share of the income of our country, and yet the policies of the Federal Reserve System will not let that happen.

Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield? I just asked my staff--I was unaware of this--I am advised there are no small businessmen or businesswomen on the Federal Reserve Board. I understand they are all bankers or economists. I will further look into this, but that is what I was told. I do not think a such an important decision-making body should be comprised of persons representing two select groups of our society. This is also a nation of small businesses and farms. Small businesses are the ones that employ people. They are the backbone of our economy. If that is true, that there is not even one small businessman or woman on the Federal Reserve Board, it is shocking.

Mr. HARKIN. It is funny how oftentimes I will talk with people from my State of Iowa about the place of the Federal Reserve Board on monetary policy there seems to be a perception among a lot of people in this country that we have the Federal Reserve Board to not only prevent inflation, but to keep us from going into a depression. I find a lot of times when I tell people that, look, the Federal Reserve Board was in existence for over 20 years prior to the Great Depression of the 1930's, the Federal Reserve Board was in existence, yet they didn't prevent the Great Depression and they did nothing to help us get out of it--that is kind of startling to people, to hear that actually happened. The Federal Reserve Board was in existence when we have had a lot of slowdowns and recessions in our country, yet nothing happened. People are amazed at that. 
I think one of the reasons for the Fed's existence is to make sure we don't have those kinds of recessions and deflations in our country about which I have just spoken and which I think we are very dangerously close to right now. So I think a lot of people in this country have a mistaken idea. I think it is because we don't have a good debate on monetary policy. 
I just say to the Senator from North Dakota, talking about his cookie-cutter images of people on the Fed, I met with both of the nominees, Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson. They are nice, nice individuals. They are very pleasant, obviously very smart, very learned individuals. They are successful in their respective careers. But from what they told me and from their statements before the committee, they are just going to sing out of the same hymn book; the same song, second verse, same thing that they hear down at the Fed. 
I said I would like to hear some people down at the Fed who would say, `Wait a minute, let's have a different view on this.' One of the things I like about the Senate, or the House of Representatives where we, the Senator and I, both served before, is not everyone here believes the same thing. You get good discussions and good debate on almost every issue. Out of that I think you get policies that are better for our country. But if everyone thinks the same, you are not going to get good policies that really benefit our country. That is what I am afraid of. At the Fed you just have one line of thinking and whoever gets nominated by the President and gets put on that Board, they think 
the same.

Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate what the Senator said, and I appreciate his long-time involvement in this issue. I hope that we will take time in the Senate and the House to really have some more discussions on monetary policy and on the Federal Reserve System. 
I hope that sometime soon we might even entertain some legislation to change the operation and the functioning of the Federal Reserve System. As the Senator from North Dakota said, it is a dinosaur; it hasn't changed. We try to change the way we operate around here. The Federal Government is undergoing reorganization. But the Federal Reserve just keeps on the same way it has been doing things year after year, and it never changes. 
I think perhaps we would be well advised to think of legislation to perhaps change some of the operations of the Fed and have a good healthy debate on how the Fed is structured, what its responsibilities are, how nominees are selected, how they are approved and whether or not we might want some different voices and different kinds of people periodically on the Fed to take a look at what they are doing. 
Should their meetings be secret? Should they be secret for 5 years? I don't know. I tend to think they shouldn't be secret for 5 years. I have said that one year might be an appropriate period of time. Some said why even a year? I had to think, why even a year? 
I believe we must have some sort of time limit because you don't want markets to fluctuate drastically due to speculation on the Fed's decisions. But, Mr. President, isn't it true that markets always operate the best when there is transparency? I have served on the Agriculture Committee for many years. I have looked at the commodities markets, and we have always said that when you have transparency, that is when markets function most efficiently. It is when things are hidden and no one knows what is going on and you have a few people making one decision behind closed doors that affects thousands of others, that is what skews the market. 
The market works best when there is transparency, and if you have a Federal Reserve System operating behind closed doors, with secret meetings and their minutes are kept secret for 5 years, I believe that more than anything skews the financial markets. Secrecy does not provide for a more orderly functioning market system. 
Mr. President, in all of this debate, we can talk about monetary policy and what it all means. It gets kind of arcane and people's eyes get a little bit heavy. Sometimes we have to bring it home, who and what are we talking about. We are talking about Ken Bishop, a senior records clerk for AT&T in Morristown, NJ. This is an older story but still very appropriate. Mr. Bishop has endured two rounds of layoffs, commutes 110 miles a day, works two jobs, yet his family income remains stuck at $40,000 a year, right where it was 10 years ago. But 10 years ago, he owned his own home; now he rents. His wife works two jobs at times, and he still owes money. 
So when AT&T said it would lay off another 40,000 workers, the 48-year-old Bishop said, `You stop and look at this and say, `When is it all going to end?'" 
Or it is about Cynthia Pollard. Two years ago, she was making $40,000 a year selling computers. She wore suits and heels to work, lived in a tony Atlanta neighborhood and ate out often. Then the company closed its Government division and Pollard was laid off. 
Between jobs without health insurance, she totaled her car and 
suffered a pinched nerve. Now she is a waitress earning half her former salary, taking the bus to work, too exhausted from 14-hour days to even think about going out. 
These are the people we are talking about. We are talking about labor's share, working people's share of the national income. 
Since 1993, it has been on a downward track. Capital share of growth in this country keeps going up and up. What that means is a further widening of income and wealth in our Nation. The middle class is being shoved further and further down, and this chart shows it. This chart represents a change in the share of income received by each quintile, each 20 percent of our income earners in America. The top 20 percent of income earners are getting an increasing share--this is a percentage--an increasing share of our national economy at the expense of the other 80 percent. 
The lowest 20 percent, that is low income. Obviously, they are getting squeezed the hardest. Up here you have middle-income people and their share of our national income is going down as well. 
I believe that spells a great danger for our country, more dangerous than this specter or this fear or this ghost of inflation that the Federal Reserve System keeps saying they want to fight at any price. Well, this is the price we are paying right here, a tearing apart, I believe, of our American middle class. 
Why? Why is it that unemployment can come down and inflation won't go up? Why is it that NAIRU is outdated and arcane? It is because we live in a new world where prices can decline because of fierce international competition? 
For example, over the past few months, we have heard announcements from most of the major automakers. They are either going to hold their 1998 model prices at the 1997 level or even lower because they are facing competition both domestically and internationally. Companies are more aggressive as they cut costs. There is a spreading anti-inflationary mentality among individual and corporate consumers. 
For example, Larson Manufacturing, a storm door manufacturer with operations in my home State of Iowa, raised workers' wages by 4 percent over the past year despite pressures to keep his prices flat. Mr. Jack Welch, the CEO of General Electric, said: `There is absolutely no inflation. There's no pricing power at all.' 
All of this means we can have fuller employment, higher incomes, a better share of our national income for labor, for working people without having any inflation. 
Again, I will quote an article by Greg Jaffe in the July 31 Wall Street Journal: 
Many economists are increasingly concluding that with fundamental changes in the world of work--for now at least--the unemployment rate does not mean exactly what they thought it meant: There are far more people than ever before who don't think of themselves as unemployed but will take jobs they find appealing. Far more people are available for employers than the unemployment rate suggests.' 
How many times do we pick up the paper and see that some company has opened a new division and they put out the hiring notice, and if the wages that they are paying are even modestly over minimum wage, they can advertise for 200 positions and 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 people will show up for jobs that pay just a little bit more than minimum wage? This shows Americans are desperate for higher paying jobs. But to get higher paying jobs, we need a healthy, vigorous, growing economy. 
We also have to recognize that more people are entering the work force, that combined with increasing productivity will allow our economy to grow at a faster rate. We have a welfare-to-work program. We have a lot of people on welfare that are now going to be coming into the work force. And, quite frankly, we have a lot of women who have not entered the work force before who may float in and out of the work force. 
I will repeat again from the article by Mr. Peter Huber in the Forbes magazine of September 8, 1997. He said:  
Officially speaking, America hasn't yet discovered microwave ovens or women's lib. Bone-weary though she may be, the stay-at-home mother doesn't labor at all in the eyes of employment statisticians. But she could, easily enough. With one new mom working at a day care center, three other moms can enter the official work force when they choose. So long as many women remain ambivalent about where to work, in the home or out, the supply of labor will remain far more elastic than the statistics suggest. Memo to Alan Greenspan: Wire roses to Gloria Steinem. 
The article goes on to say that: 
If the officially audited supply of labor keeps falling and the price doesn't rise-- 
Which is what has been happening-- then we must either give up on economics completely or conclude that there's more to the supply side of labor markets than meets the official eye. Perhaps it's simply that American women, Mexican men and Intel's progeny have all become good substitutes for what the official statisticians call U.S. labor.

Mr. HARKIN. As I pointed out earlier, average economic growth over the past 25 years has been a full percentage point lower than what its average in the previous 100 years. Slow economic growth is a zero sum game. There are going to be winners and there are going to be losers. Unfortunately, more Americans are finding themselves to be on the losing end. 
Over the past 2 and a half decades the losers have been hard-working American families. And the winners--the winners have been the top 20 percent income earners in America. 
The September 1, 1997, Business Week had an excellent article. It described the plight of workers that I previously read about. There is the story of Ted Oliver, a 27-year veteran of Con-Agra. I know that company well out in the Midwest. He works at the shipping dock of Con-Agra's Batesville, AR plant. 
Last March, the employees of the plant got a 17 percent raise over the next five years. While that may sound like a lot, it is not. 
I am quoting the article from Business Week. 
Even though the 5 percent hike that took effect this year pushed Mr. Oliver's hourly salary up to $8.96 an hour-- 
And mind you, he is a 27-year veteran of this company. He is now up to making $8.96 an hour--he and his coworkers earn less in real terms than they did in 1988. In fact, he will still be behind his 1988 earnings levels when the entire raise kicks in. Despite his working 9 to 10 hour days, 6 days a week, and his wife working two jobs, Mr. Oliver said, `We've been strapped, and we're not even back to where we were.' 
Think about that. Think what that does to you as a family. You worked all these years, you think you get a decent raise, and yet you are not even where you were in 1988 in terms of your real income. 
It is little wonder why the amount of personal debt keeps going up all the time. 
Of course we have a movement afoot to change the bankruptcy laws so people can't declare bankruptcy like they used to. I would suggest, Mr. President, before we go down that road we begin to find out why more and more Americans are going into debt and why they are piling up the debts and why they are declaring bankruptcy to get out from underneath it--rather than us just rushing to pass legislation to make it harder for people to pay off their debts. 
I just also point out that Mr. Oliver's grand wages of $8.96 an hour, assuming a base 2,000-hour a year job, is less than $20,000 a year for him and his family. 
So the median family household income has not yet returned to its pre-1989 level. That was the last year in which we had a recession. In theory, periods of economic growth are supposed to allow wages and incomes to surpass the levels enjoyed in prior years of economic growth. In a capitalist society, we have periods of growth, and then we have a slowdown, and we have a growth again. In theory, each period of economic growth should lead to an increase in incomes for all Americans. But in this economic expansion incomes for most Americans have not even caught up to the level we had for 1989. 
Well, the bill for Alan Greenspan's slow-growth economic policies and high interest rates is coming due. As a recent editorial in the Washington Post said:  
The United States is six years into an economic expansion, with low inflation, low unemployment and a famously soaring stock market. Yet the benefits of economic growth are not filtering down as much as might be expected. Median household income remains lower than in 1989, before the last recession. 
The number of poor people in the United States did not diminish in 1996 from the previous year, the poverty rate is still higher than in 1989 and the number of those considered very poor--[that is] earning less than one half of the poverty threshold--actually increased in the last year. Wages for men working full-time declined in 1996 by 0.9 percent from the previous year. 
Imagine that. Huge stock market boom. This top 20 percent getting more and more money; members of Congress increasing their salaries. And yet wages for people working full-time declined last year by nine-tenths of a percent from the previous year. 
The editorial goes on to say: 
Beneath these disappointing statistics is a trend of increasing inequality . . . it seems to us that most Americans aren't likely to be comfortable with an economy that leaves one sector further and further behind. It's not a recipe for future steady growth, nor for a healthy society. 
We have heard a lot of talk about how the recent records in the stock market are benefiting millions of Americans. But that is not true. Over 80 percent of the American people do not even own stock. 
As a U.S. News & World Report article pointed out: 
Middle Income Americans have most of their assets in their home and [in] their savings, while the rich keep a higher percentage of their wealth in financial instruments such as stocks and bonds. Housing prices haven't kept pace with the torrid stock market, and the middle class has virtually stopped accumulating savings. While the wealthy have been running up huge gains in the stock market, middle-income Americans have been running up credit card debt to compensate for stagnating wages. 
That is what is happening. The solution to reversing these dangerous trends is strong, sustained economic growth. The Federal Reserve has been on a course to try to limit economic growth to around 2.2 percent. Again, we have exceeded that. No thanks to the Fed, but we have exceeded that. Yet the Fed is determined at all costs to keep that growth from increasing, and also at all costs to keep interest rates high. 
The Federal Reserve doesn't seem willing to let American workers enjoy even modest gains in wages. 
Lower unemployment and rising wages all tie back into this NAIRU concept that I raised earlier in my statement. Again, NAIRU says that when unemployment drops below a certain level, employers will be forced to raise wages. Because of this, we will have inflation accelerate at an uncontrollable pace. That is a view supported at the Fed, and I am sorry to say, including the two nominees before us, Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson. 
Again, Mr. President, even Mr. Greenspan said in his March 5 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that job insecurity is something to be welcomed, `If heightened job insecurity is the most significant explanation of the break with the past in recent years, then it is important to recognize that * * * suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can only be carried so far. At some point the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end.' 
Well, I support the opinion of James Galbraith of the University of Texas, who said, `Mr. Greenspan is concerned about the possibility that the American worker might start to demand and receive a slightly bigger share of the economic growth that has occurred over the last several years. Repressing wages is the essential thing, and the way to do that is to slow economic growth, raise unemployment, and make sure that job insecurity that Mr. Greenspan explicitly credits for suppressing wage growth does not diminish nor disappear.' 
Again, this is what we are confronting. That is why I tried to take this time to talk about monetary policy. We don't talk about it much in the Senate and don't pay much attention to it, but the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board is having a devastating impact on American society. What it means is that real interest rates continue at an unnecessarily high level. It means that more and more moderate-income Americans are paying unduly high interest rates for their homes and cars and their kids' college education. The high interest rates mean that more and more income will go into corporate profits and less and less will go into weekly earnings of hard-working Americans. High interest rates mean working Americans will rack up more and more debt, and it means a hidden tax on the American family. 
A 1 percent increase in rates raises the average home mortgage by almost $1,000 a year. A mortgage on a $115,000 house goes up $80 per month. A 1 percent increase in rates raises the payments for an average farmer by $1,400 per year. A 1 percent increase in rates raised the payments for the average small business by $1,000 per year. These interest payments amount to nothing more than a hidden tax on hardworking Americans. And unlike a tax, which you can reasonably argue that at least it goes into the Government that is used to build better roads, better bridges, schools, health care and things like that, that doesn't go there. The benefits of higher interest rates go to the top 20 percent of Americans, who increasingly get more and more of the share of our national income. Again, I believe our free-enterprise system and our capitalist system and our capitalist economy will be far better off if, instead of keeping wages low and keeping the bottom 80 percent of our income earners falling lower, if we had a more balanced monetary policy in our nation. I believe our free enterprise system and our economy will be better off if the incomes and wealth of the top 20 percent grow at a proportion equal to the rest of society. If we do that, then I believe we will have a vibrant, growing economy that will be shared by all. 
It is not going to happen unless we have a different mindset at the Federal Reserve System. I will continue to talk about this and will continue to fight for these policies as long as I am at least here in the U.S. Senate. I hope we will get people on the Federal Reserve Board who will bring a different view and a different opinion and who will not be afraid to go out and state those opinions and engender a more healthy, public debate. 
I have to say, Mr. President, it would do my heart and my mind good, and I think the hearts and minds of the American people a lot of good, if we had a member of the Federal Reserve Board go out and 
start debating and talking about a different method, a different way of approaching the monetary policies now in place at the Federal Reserve Board. 
I think the last time we had that happen some of the powers that be at the Federal Reserve Board came down on that person pretty hard. But I think that debate has to happen, and I am hopeful it will happen there, and it should happen here in the U.S. Senate. But we don't seem to be having that debate. We should have that debate because it means a lot to working Americans. 
I sum up my comments by saying I didn't really want to unnecessarily hold up the appointments of Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson. I know they will go through by voice vote. That is fine with this Senator. But I think more often than we have, we have to debate monetary policy here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and what it means to the American people. Just as war is too important to be left to the generals, so is monetary policy too important just to be left to the bankers. We must also include our small business people, our farmers, our consumers in this debate and in the setting of the policy. That can only be done if we have a good, healthy debate. 
Again, to sum up, Mr. President, what we need at the Fed is a policy of lower interest rates that will help our wages go up for our working Americans who have fallen too far behind so that they should get a fair share of our growth. Those lower interest rates will also mean our economy will grow at a faster rate, which I believe it can. I believe the Federal Reserve is saying that the best economic growth we can hope for is the equivalent to a C average. I believe the working people of this country can do a lot better than that. I think our productivity is such and our work force is such that we can do a B+ or an A. Why shouldn't we try for a higher rate of growth? 
I also believe that a change in the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board will mean that a lot of working Americans will have a little bit better lifestyle. Perhaps they can buy a better home with lower interest rates. Perhaps they can have a more decent car. Perhaps they can take their wife or kids out to a local restaurant to eat once in a while. Nothing wrong with that. Perhaps they can take a nice vacation once a year. Nothing wrong with that, either. Perhaps they can borrow a little bit more money at a better interest rate to put their kids through college. Nothing wrong with that, either. 
In sum, the Federal Reserve policies, if they are changed to reduce our interest rates, I believe can mean a better life for working Americans all over our country. On the other hand, if the Fed continues its blind adherence to this arcane concept of NAIRU, if they continue their blind adherence to raising interest rates at merely the ghost of inflation, then I predict, Mr. President, that we are on the precipice of falling into a deflationary period in America. If that deflationary period happens, working Americans are going to be hit a lot harder than they ever would be by a small or modest increase in inflation.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate has passed one of the most important agriculture bills it will consider this session. The Agricultural Research, Extension and Education Reform Act of 1997 not only represents a strong statement by the Senate on the importance of research to the future of American agriculture but also a substantive improvement in USDA's research efforts. I am pleased that both sides of the aisle have come together to invest in the future of agriculture and rural communities in this country. I am especially pleased with the cooperation I have enjoyed with the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar, and his staff throughout the development of this important legislation. 
This bill ensures that our farmers and ranchers have the world's best science and technology to produce food and fiber, protect the environment upon which agriculture depends, and create rural economic opportunities. We are devoting over $1 billion in new funds over the next 5 years to advance the science and technology underlying our agricultural system. I am also pleased that we were able to find the resources to improve the nutrition of our Nation's poorest children. 
We have also extended the fund for rural America through 2002 and reaffirmed and enlarged our commitment to the pressing development needs of our rural communities. The fund was a key component of the 1996 Farm bill, created to provide funds to help farmers and rural communities to transition into the new farm policy environment. I am pleased we have allocated an additional $300 million to these purposes so the fund will continue to emphasize creative research and rural development efforts. 
This bill contains substantial new initiatives for research and development of new uses for agricultural commodities. I believe that the most important way to increase farm income is to find new nonfood markets for agricultural commodities. New uses activities at the USDA will be conducted in a coordinated manner to garner the maximum benefit from the various research programs. We have authorized the USDA to use its resources to conduct research on lowering the cost of production of alternative agricultural products in cooperation with startup companies, including AARCC companies. Finally, AARCC is a priority for the new research initiative included in this bill. 
This bill also contains significant reforms in the current research programs. We have increased the accountability of the research and extension formula funds. We require the Secretary to consult with producers, industry and consumers in setting research priorities. We require external scientific peer-review of ARS research. 
Finally, we have taken the first steps in encouraging the inter-State cooperation on research and extension problems. States are required to dedicate a portion of research and extension funds to problems of national or multi-State significance. In the process I believe we are making our research system more responsive to critical issues and we hopefully will eliminate unnecessary duplication of efforts. 
Mr. President, we have increased the funding, competitiveness, accountability and credibility of U.S. agricultural research. We have let the world know that we are serious about equipping American agriculture for future food production changes. We also take steps to assure the taxpayer that research dollars are expended in the most efficient manner. We have done all this in a strong bipartisan manner. I think we can all take pride in the fact that today we have made a significant investment in a better future for not only the U.S. farmer and rancher but also in a better future for an increasingly crowded and hungry world.

Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, 
today I am introducing the Animal Agriculture Reform Act, a bill that for the first time sets tough environmental standards governing how large livestock and poultry operations handle their animal waste. Animal waste pollution is a national problem that demands a national solution. 
Nationwide, 200 times more animal manure is produced than human waste--five tons for every person in the United States--making large livestock operations the waste equivalent of a town or city. For example, 1,600 dairies in the Central Valley of California produce more waste than a city of 21 million people. And right here outside of Washington, DC, the annual production of 600 million chickens on the Delmarva Peninsula leaves as much nitrogen as a city of almost 500,000 people. 
The shrinking number of farms producing an ever greater share of animals means that too much manure is produced in some areas of the country to be put on land without causing water pollution. Nitrogen and phosphorous in animal manure are valuable crop nutrients--but in excessive levels in water they are serious pollutants. 
High levels of nitrogen and phosphorous cause the excessive algae growth of algae, whose bacterial decomposition uses up oxygen in the water and kills fish. Animal waste also carries parasites, bacteria and viruses--and can pollute drinking water with nitrates, potentially fatal to infants. 
While towns must have sewage treatment plants, excess waste from large-scale animal feeding operations is simply stored indefinitely or over-applied on land. That means water pollution from over-application, and the ongoing risk of pollution and even massive spills from stored waste. 
In 1995 in North Carolina 35 million gallons of animal waste were spilled, killing 10 million fish. And last year more than 40 animal waste spills were recorded in Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri, up from 20 in 1992. 
In 1997, the toxic microbe Pfiesteria, whose increased presence is linked to excessive nutrients in the water, killed approximately 30,000 fish in the Chesapeake Bay and approximately 450,000 fish in North Carolina. Major attacks by harmful microbes in U.S. coastal and estuarial waters between 1972 and 1995 have doubled--and excessive nutrients are the suspected catalyst. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, farm runoff including animal waste is linked to the formation of a so-called `dead zone' of hypoxia (low oxygen)--up to 7,000 square miles of water that cannot support most aquatic life. 
The Environmental Protection Agency's regulations in this area have not been revised since they were written in the 1970s, and they do not go nearly far enough to address current animal waste problems. 
Animal waste management practices must include limiting the application of both phosphorous and nitrogen to amounts that can be used by crops. In addition, environmentally sound standards are needed for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of excess animal waste. 
Under my bill, large animal feeding operations must submit an individual animal waste management plan to USDA designed to minimize the risk of surface and ground water pollution. My bill would require that USDA work with farmers in developing plans to address potential problems before they happen. USDA will do this by establishing guidelines and providing technical assistance and information to develop farm-specific plans to be approved on an individual basis. 
I am using the term animal waste, but it is important that we recognize that manure is a valuable resource for farmers who need nutrients for their crops. Promoting wise use of manure for crop nutrients is the guiding principle of my bill. For a plan to be approved, an operator must agree to apply animal waste to land only in amounts meeting crop nutrient requirements. Furthermore, liquid waste that cannot be safely used for nutrients or another environmentally sound use must be treated in accordance with waste water treatment standards. 
My bill also applies sound technical standards to the construction of all new earthen manure lagoons to prevent leaks and spillage of animal waste. Existing earthen manure lagoons are given a reasonable phase-in period to meet appropriate standards. 
In addition, my bill puts the burden of complying with these requirements on the animal owners. The bill would prevent animal owners from using contracts or similar arrangements to avoid responsibility for animal waste management. 
The bill covers operations with an approximate one-time animal capacity above 1,330 hogs; 57,000 chickens; 270 dairy cattle; or 530 slaughter cattle. Each animal owner with at least that many animals must submit a waste management plan to USDA for approval, whether or not the animals are kept in one place. Animal feeding operations under those sizes will qualify under USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program for additional technical and cost-share assistance to implement animal waste management plans. 
I want to be clear that my bill does not interfere with the role of EPA and the States in monitoring pollution, or is it a substitute for EPA strengthening its current regulations. I see it as an essential part of a cooperative approach to the problem by both EPA and USDA--and I look forward to EPA's proposals in this area. I also look forward to reviewing the recommendations of the National Environmental Dialogue on Pork Production, which is working on these issues in great detail. 
We must take strong action now to halt the pollution of our water from animal waste and other farm runoff. Other issues that are outside the scope of this bill also need to be addressed, including management of municipal and industrial wastewater and more careful application of commercial fertilizers. My proposal is one part of a national solution to our water quality concerns.

Mr. HARKIN. I respond by saying I appreciate the position the majority leader is in. Quite frankly, I think that the occasion of considering a couple of nominees to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors should be a time of some debate and some discussion on the Senate floor as to the Fed policy and to the direction the Fed has taken. 
Again, I do not need to remind the majority leader of this. He knows full well there seems to be so many people who think the Federal Reserve is some great Federal agency that is not beholding to the Congress. I keep pointing out it is a creature of Congress. It is not a constitutional entity. It is a creature of Congress and by law we have the right and I think the constitutional obligation to oversee the Federal Reserve, obviously to pass judgment, to advise and consent on nominations but also to give guidance and direction as to what their policy ought to be. And I think that these nominees deserve to have some discussion and debate. 
I would say in all honesty to my friend from Mississippi, there are on this side other Senators who I know want to engage in this discussion and debate who cannot be here today. I am here. And I am willing to talk--well, I have my notebook here, if the majority leader would like to see it. I have a few hours I could talk.

Mr. HARKIN. If the leader will yield further, if last week is any prelude to this week, I think we are going to have large gaps of time this week on the Senate floor. There will be time for people to come out and discuss extraneous and various things. As I said, I know there are some other Senators who have expressed to me a desire to engage in some discussion. I do not know how long but some discussion. And I think the leader would agree this is important enough that we ought to discuss it anyway. I know he is not impressed that they are not here today. I understand that. But I am hopefully operating within my right to engage in a discussion on these nominees. I would, of course, object to them being brought up en bloc. I do not desire to thwart these nominations. However, I do want them brought up separately and singly as individual nominees and to be able to use some time this week to talk about them. 
I would be prepared to do that at great length today. I am here, and I am in pretty good physical shape so I am ready to discuss them at length today, if he would like to do that, as is his right, but I would also be willing to see what we could do during the remainder of the week to engage in some discussion, and I will do that. If there are gaps this week, I will come to the floor and talk about it.

I would be prepared to talk at length further on Fed policy and on these nominees in particular, if need be. Hopefully, we can reach some resolution of this matter. If not now, perhaps later on. Not today, certainly, but hopefully perhaps sometime later on this week.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 16 months ago we had a debate on the nomination of Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve System. I argued at that time that he was far too concerned about a possible increase in the rate of inflation and had far too little concern about the employment and incomes of working people. 
At that time, we had a number of Senators who came to the floor and said, with unemployment at 5.5 percent, a further decline in unemployment would likely lead to higher inflation. They seemed to believe that raising interest rates was the best course of action. 
In the last year, unemployment has dropped three-tenths of 1 percent. But that represents only a part of the increase in the work force. The pool of workers that can get jobs not only comes from the 4.9 percent who are unemployed now but also from those who are not considered part of the labor force, such as younger retirees, women at home, and people who have been discouraged from looking for work in the past, and, of course, persons on welfare. Our economy has brought an additional 400,000 of these persons into the work force over the year beyond those considered as unemployed. 
In the past year, the economy has grown at a rate of about 3.3 percent, roughly about 1 percent over what the Federal Reserve's target was to be. 
In terms of economic growth, a little means a lot. A 1 percent higher rate of economic growth in an $8 trillion economy means at extra $80 billion a year, year after year. That comes out to be $300 for every man, woman, and child in America. 
Now, unfortunately, the Fed seems intent on restraining the economy and keeping from building on its success. Many at the Fed, including the two nominees, Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson that will soon be before the Senate, believe in a concept called NAIRU--the non-accelerating inflationary rate of unemployment. If it sounds arcane, that is because it is. 
But it is still important nonetheless. It is important because so many people adhere to it and believe in it. NAIRU basically says, if the unemployment goes below a certain level, inflation will accelerate, not just increase, but will accelerate at such a rate that only unnecessarily high interest rates can slow it down. 
Just 3 years ago, it was widely accepted among the economic elites that the economy would shift toward higher inflation if unemployment fell below 6 percent. That was the NAIRU cutoff. But it fell below 6 percent, and actually some measures showed inflation dropping after unemployment went below that. 
Then the common wisdom was then if unemployment went below 5.5 percent for long, then inflation will accelerate. Greenspan and others insisted on this. Well, it fell below 5.5 percent. Then the magic point became 5 percent, below which inflation was sure to accelerate at dizzying speeds if we went below 5 percent. 
Unemployment has been under 6 percent for more than 3 years now and less than 5 percent since early this year, and no one, including the Fed Chairman, can point to any signs of accelerating inflation. 
Unfortunately, economic reality and the new world has yet to penetrate the thinking of those at the Fed. 
I was deeply disappointed with Mr. Greenspan's statement before the House Budget Committee on October 8 when he said, `the 
performance of the labor markets this year suggests that the economy has been on an unsustainable track.' 
In other words, a 3.3 percent rate of growth, he says, is unsustainable. Let me respectfully disagree. 
I disagree with the basic premise that Alan Greenspan and the nominees before us are promoting. Their focus seems to be on when we should raise interest rates--not `if' but `when.' 
I believe the debate should be broadened. Let us broaden it to consider lowering interest rates. 
A number of economic experts believe that unemployment could possibly go as low as 4.5 percent, maybe even lower, and economic growth increased beyond current levels without triggering any inflationary threat. 
Defenders of Fed policy constantly point to the inflation we experienced in the 1970's as the No. 1 reason why it is better to sacrifice higher unemployment for lower inflation. 
Let us take a look at the causes behind the inflation of the 1970's. 
We had massive Government spending, both on the Vietnam war and the war on poverty; there was a serious energy crisis; and American companies and their workers were no longer as productive as their foreign counterparts. 
Today, all that has changed. Congress and the President recently reached an agreement to balance the Government's budget by 2002. I might also point out that it was the 103d Congress--and I am very proud to say I was one of those who helped to cast the deciding vote in the Senate on the budget of 1993--that enacted President Clinton's budget package that helped put our Government's finances on the road to balance. However, we heard from the other side of the aisle saying, `If this budget passes, disaster is going to happen. We're going to have recessions and people will be out of work.' And on and on. 
Well, we passed that budget. What happened? The size of the budget deficit began to shrink dramatically. That, coupled with the Clinton administration's goal of downsizing Government and reorganizing Government, with the Clinton program of reorganizing welfare and restructuring welfare and making welfare-to-work, with the other constraints put on the Government side of the ledger, that budget, plus that, has led us through about 4 straight years of reducing the deficit to the point now where it is at the lowest point, I think, since the early 1970's, in fact, it might even be balanced as early as next year rather than the year 2002. 
So the Government's finances are getting in good order, thanks again to that budget we passed in 1993 and further actions taken by the Clinton administration. 
Also, oil and gas prices have been stable for quite some time. There seems to be no danger of any acceleration there. Our workers now are the most productive in the world. I will have more to say about that. In other words, our economy is much more able to ward off inflation and control its harmful effects than it was in the 1970's. 
Perhaps before I go any further, I want to explain how the Federal Reserve experts have tremendous influence on the economy. Some people say it is not the Federal Reserve; there are really a lot of other things going on. Simply put, the Fed sets the interest rates charged to banks for the banks' loans. In turn, that rate determines how much the bank charges to their consumers for auto loans, credit cards, home mortgages, and everything else --business expansion, new plants, and new equipment. 
By increasing the costs of borrowing money, the Federal Reserve is able to limit the number of new loans that are used to expand or start a business, buy a new car, finance the purchase of a home. If consumers cannot afford to purchase these items, demand will decline and the economy will slow down. So the Fed must realize that the gains from encouraging economic growth far outweigh the gains from needlessly increasing interest rates in order to fight the ghost of inflation. 
That is exactly what they are fighting--a ghost. They cannot point to any inflation. They cannot point to any accelerating inflation. Again, I will have more to say about that. 
Unnecessarily high interest rates that ensure a stagnant economy or an economy that is growing at less than its full capacity virtually assures that hard-working Americans will not get ahead. You cannot give everyone a pay raise simply by redistributing dollars within a stagnant economy. To increase incomes for everyone, you need a strong, growing economy. 
Last year, we enacted a very ambitious welfare-to-work program. If that is to succeed, we must have an economy that is creating new jobs that pay real well and provide benefits such as health insurance and retirement savings--most important, health insurance. 
The unemployment rate measures the number of people who are looking for work compared to the number of people who have jobs. That is the basic formula. Many of the persons counted as unemployed are actually underemployed and would jump at the chance for a better paying job. Again, I will later read from many articles around the country where job openings have shown up and, even in areas where we have low rates of unemployment, hundreds, thousands of people have shown up for these jobs because they are better paying jobs. 
Many unemployed are discouraged--the recently retired or those who are not now thinking of working but will start to do so should the opportunity arise. A growing economy and tight job market are the surest way to bring these people into the work force. 
We also have a reservoir of women that I will be talking about very shortly in terms of their coming into the market and what that might mean. 
In fact, referring to an article that appeared in the September 8 issue of Forbes magazine, I thought it was very good. It was written by Peter Huber. The title is `Wage inflation? Where?' I will read some parts of this. I do not know if I need to read the whole thing. I think it was very crucial and right on point in terms of what we are talking about here. There are reservoirs and things happening in our economy in the employment and work sector that were not there in the 1970's.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. Huber, in his article in Forbes said: 
Here's why stock prices are really supposed to fall. Employment rates rise above some critical flash point. So wages rise sharply. So prices of goods rise--just as rising wages are boosting demand. Inflation soars. So interest rates go up. Stock prices crash. 
This is a perfectly sound theory, but it requires some facts. Where's the critical flash point? Do the employment statistics mean what they used to mean? Do they mean anything at all? 
Officially speaking, America hasn't yet discovered microwave ovens or women's lib. Bone-weary though she may be, the stay-at-home mother doesn't labor at all in the eyes of employment statisticians. But she could, easily enough. With one new mom working at a day care center, three other moms can enter the official work force when they choose. So long as many women remain ambivalent about where to work, in the home or out, the supply of labor will remain far more elastic than the statistics suggest. Memo to Alan Greenspan: Wire roses to Gloria Steinem. 
Again, I am reading from the article that was in Forbes written by Mr. Peter Huber. 
Labor markets have stretched into the home; they have also spilled out of the country. A U.S. multinational doesn't raise wages in Maine if it can shift production to a more elastic labor market in Mexico.* * * Labor statistics, in short, don't mean much unless they track where goods are produced and consumed. The more transnational economies become, the worse the tracking gets. 
Then there's silicon. It takes a mix of capital and labor to manufacture a mousetrap, and economists have always allowed that the mix can change. In the past, however, the substitution effects were slow. You could hire and fire workers a lot faster than you could acquire or retire machines and buildings. So ready supplies of capital didn't discipline the price of labor in the short run. 
Is that still true? Computers are getting easier to deploy, smarter and--because of rapid innovation and falling costs--shorter-lived. Many a manager can now expand production as easily by investing an extra dollar in chips or software as he can by hiring new workers. Technology can have a powerful wage moderating effect long before silicon becomes a complete substitute for sapiens. All it takes is enough substitution at the margin. 
The substitution is happening. Productivity, it now appears, has been rising a good bit faster in recent years than government statisticians recognized. Three new working moms with computers produce as much as four old working dads without. And newly minted Pentiums to the ranks of those in search of useful work, and unemployment statistics look very different. * * * * * 
This much we do know for sure. If the officially audited supply of labor keeps falling-- 
Which is what I have just said has been happening-- 
 and the price does not rise-- 
Which has been happening-- then we must either give up on economics completely or conclude that there's more to the supply side of labor markets then meets the official eye. Perhaps it's simply that American women, Mexican men and Intel's progeny have all become good substitutes for what the official statisticians call U.S. labor. Maybe welfare reform is effectively expanding labor pools, too. * * * 
According to official statistics and economic models, a supply-side crisis in labor markets should have reignited inflation some time ago. 
Almost 3 years ago. 
Investors may indeed be crazy to ignore this indubitable, though theoretical, truth. But if so, wage earners are crazier still--so crazy they don't raise the price of their labor when they can. Then again, maybe they can't.

Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, because of the new labor pool that is there and because of the international marketplace, because of increasing technology and productivity, I believe the economy can continue to expand for some period of time, at least at its current pace, without causing a significant rise in inflation. 
Second, we need to do more to increase the wages and incomes of average Americans. This should be one of our Nation's very top priorities. So we have an economy growing 3.3 percent. That is good, but who is taking part in it? 
The Federal Government should complete a very good year from a budgetary perspective, as I said. In February, the White House said there would be a $125 billion deficit. CBO, our budget estimator for Congress, said it would be $115 billion in March of this year. In fact, it looks like it will only be a $23 billion deficit this year. 
So why do we have the good news? Because the economy grew faster than the traditional economists perceived likely. I am pleased with the growth. I am pleased with that growth and the lower deficit level and the fact that prices are not rising. But I am disappointed that a fairly small share of the gain went to average Americans. 
Look at this chart which says it all. Look what has been happening in the last several years in the recent economic boom in this country. If you look at the corporate profit rates, they are really going up. Especially since 1992 and 1993 they have gone up tremendously. Look at the median weekly earnings during the same period of time. They keep going down. Corporate profits are going up and median weekly earnings are going down. 
The reality is that the incomes of average Americans are not rising very much. Median household income remains lower than in 1989, before the last recession. The poverty rate is still higher than in 1989, and the number of persons considered very poor, earning less than half the poverty threshold, actually increased. The poverty rate is still higher than in 1989, and the number of persons considered very poor--that is, earning less than half of the threshold poverty rate, actually increased. At the same time, corporate profits are soaring. 
If the Fed clamps down and the economy ceases to grow at a reasonable rate, there will be no real chance that wages will grow at anything more than a minimal rate. This line will continue to go down even more. If we allow the economy to move forward, then, workers may achieve some real income growth. That means a higher standard of living for all Americans. That really should be our bottom economic line, a higher standard of living for all Americans, including those at the bottom who are falling further and further behind. 
If someone asked me what I would want, I would say I just want average Americans to be able to buy a home with decent mortgage rates, low monthly payments, to go on a nice vacation every year with the family, treat their kids to a ball game, go out and have a nice dinner at a restaurant with their spouse on their anniversaries or birthdays, be able to save some money for a rainy day or for their kids' education. In other words, to improve their quality of life. This should be our fundamental goal. 
To not allow a chance of an improved standard of living because of an innate fear of a possible rising inflation is not only unfair to Americans, it flies in the face of economic reality and it fails to recognize basic changes that have taken place in the global economy. 
A little history. Back in 1933 the Congress set the Federal Reserve policy goals as `the maintenance of sound credit conditions, and accommodation of commerce, industry and agriculture.' In 1946, the Congress passed the Employment Act of 1946 which set out a shared Federal Reserve responsibility, the goal being `responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practical means * * * to promote maximum employment, production and purchasing power.' It was only in 1978 that the law was modified 
to add the goal of containing inflation, interestingly. Not until 1978--we had some pretty good years before 1978, but it was in 1978 that the law was modified to add the goal to the Federal Reserve's policy of containing inflation. That goal did not replace maximizing employment and production. It didn't say in lieu of maximizing employment and production, but in addition to maximizing employment and production. 
In the last Congress, Senator Mack, my good friend from Florida, introduced a bill to make fighting inflation the sole principal goal of Federal Reserve policy, to undo everything it has been doing since 1933, to take what was done and added in 1978 as another goal, and make that the only goal of Fed policy. 
Alan Greenspan supports this proposal and said in open testimony that he supported taking out of the Federal Reserve's consideration `promoting maximum employment, production and purchasing power, the maintenance of sound credit conditions to accommodate commerce, industrial and agriculture,' all of which has been in there at least since 1933 and 1946--do away with all that and have only one goal for the Federal Reserve--to fight inflation. Mr. Greenspan supports formally shifting the focus of the Fed to controlling inflation and achieving price stability. 
Well, I do not think this policy is a wise course of action. Alan Greenspan may want to change the Fed's mandate, but that does not relieve the Federal Reserve of its responsibility to carry out the law and its mandate which is not just inflation but `to promote maximum employment, production and purchasing power.' 
Unfortunately, under the leadership of Mr. Greenspan, the focus has become only oriented toward a fear of fighting the ghost of inflation. I say `a fear of fighting the ghost of inflation' because there is no inflation. But out there sometime around Halloween the ghost of inflation that might actually appear, and we need to be worried about that, according to Mr. Greenspan. 
I recently met with the two nominees for the Federal Reserve board that will shortly be before the Senate, Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson. We had two very productive and informative meetings. I found them both very learned individuals and fine individuals. They also have good career backgrounds. But what American families need at the Federal Reserve are Board members who will not simply follow the prevailing wind at the Fed but follow what is set out in law, and that is balancing the goals of sustaining rates of growth from employment, production and purchasing power as well as minimizing inflation. 
Unfortunately, our two nominees before us still adhere to that outdated consent of NAIRU, nonaccelerating rate of unemployment, and I am afraid that they will fail to aggressively challenge many of the current assumptions at the Fed. 
We need a good healthy debate at the Fed and we need a good healthy debate outside of the Fed about economic policies. I also believe that the nominees are just not likely to push for this kind of debate prior to risking the upward movement of the economy with an interest rate increase. That, in my view, is unfortunate. 
The Federal Reserve seems to look at the economy solely through the eyes of lenders. They need to look at the needs of manufacturers and builders, entrepreneurs and hard-working families, as the law requires. These are the people that move the economy, the people that make things, that take the risks, that sell things for whom the Federal Reserve policy should aim to benefit. The nominees before us, unfortunately, I believe share that view of just simply looking at the economy through the eyes of the lenders and the bankers. 
Lastly, and while this is not being talked about very much, I believe we are facing an increasing risk of deflation--deflation. While the Fed focuses on getting inflation down to zero, I think and fear they may overshoot it and send the economy into a deflationary spiral. 
Inflation as measured by the CPI for the past year has been 2.2 percent. Unemployment is below 5 percent, and the economy is moving at a GDP rate of around 3.3 percent. Most of the members 
of the Federal Reserve seem to feel the CPI overestimates inflation by a percentage point or more. If that is the case, then inflation is somewhere down around 1 percent, maybe less. Maybe inflation is really somewhere between zero and 1 percent. 
These people at the Fed fear inflation might rise because the unemployment rate is so low, 4.9 percent. If it does, we can react, but there is nothing in our history that points to our inability to slow down and reverse inflation due to an overheated economy. But the preemptive strikes launched by the Fed do not restrain inflation. Instead, this reaction to the remote possibility of accelerating inflation has tremendous costs to our nation. 
A preemptive strike blocks the chance of people to be more employed; it blocks the chance of people, on average, to see their incomes truly rise; and it increases the risk of recession. A recession in the current economic environment creates a real possibility of deflation. I believe that right now we are very close to zero inflation, but if we go into recession, that could slip down below zero, and indeed we would have inflation. That would deepen the recession and make it even harder to come out. 
Because of this excessive fear of inflation at the Fed, we now live in a world where good economic news for working families is bad news on Wall Street and at the Fed. I don't know how many times I have seen that if there is some good news out there for working families, they say stocks will fall, the Fed is going to have to raise interest rates. 
I will read from an article written by Mr. Robert Reno earlier this year, entitled `Economic Prosperity Not Fully Shared,' to underscore this point. Mr. Reno said in his article of March 14, 1997, talking about the unemployment rate falling to 5.3 percent and below.  
Wall Street held its breath recently, fearful that one of the greatest bull markets in history was about to be handed the excuse it was looking for to crash. 
He said that was because early in March the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics was ready to release the report on unemployment. 
It could have been another Black Friday. But closer inspection of the employment report showed things weren't all that dreadful. Average earnings rose just 3 cents an hour. 
No sign there that wage inflation was any threat except in the minds of those who use a Hubble telescope to see inflationary signs invisible to everyone else. Moreover, there were `healthy' signs that American workers are still scared witless. 
The percentage of workers holding down two jobs, seen as a barometer of job insecurity, was 6.2 percent, about the same as it was a year ago. And the percentage of job quitters--those who felt confident enough to strike out in search of new employment--fell significantly. . . . 
It says something weird about the economic culture of the 1990s that the docility of the American labor force has come to be regarded as the chief barometer of the Nation's economic health, the indicator that causes the largest holders of wealth to prosper even as wage-earner incomes stagnate. 
Again we see it here, wage earners going down, corporate profits going up. 
Still, the alarmists continue to talk about a `tight' labor market. This is not the same labor market viewed by most American wage earners. 
They see an economic landscape littered with the victims of downsizing, a corporate strategy that has institutionalized the process of maximizing short-term share values by minimizing worker security. They also see a system in which health-care coverage, especially the fear of losing it, is increasingly a factor in workers' decisions to change jobs or to hang on for dear life to the one that they have. 
These and other factors, including the weakening of the labor movement, combine to make workers less likely to demand higher wages even as they see their CEO's taking home grossly swollen compensation packages that are an embarrassment to capitalism. 
I think that paragraph needs repeating.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to point out that just 2 weeks after this article appeared, the Fed launched one of its preemptive strikes, despite admitting the fact that there was no accelerated inflation, and raised interest rates again. 
The issues that are before us are much more important than just two nominees to the Federal Reserve system. It is about strengthening our Nation's economy and ensuring that all Americans have a better standard of living than their parents and their grandparents. It is about everyday Americans making everyday decisions, families trying to make a payment on their House, pay for their kids' college education, Main Street merchants paying for a loan for inventory to run their small business, and farmers making decisions on borrowing to put in next year's crop. 
The Federal Reserve policies affect families budgets and national budgets. The Federal Reserve policies shape the course of America's future. If we hope to reach and maintain a balanced budget and move people from welfare to work and ensure the solvency of Medicare and Social Security, we must have a vigorous, growing economy. 
Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve is standing in the way. As I have said many times, the Fed has kept its key interest rates, such as the Federal Funds rate, unnecessarily high and, as a result, sacrificed job growth and the living standard of hard-working Americans in the blind pursuit of fighting the ghost of inflation. 
The reason the Fed is willing to pay any price and bear any burden to fight the ghost of inflation is that the Fed's prime constituency is the Nation's largest banks. Bill Wolman, an economist for Business Week magazine and CNBC News, wrote in the Judas Economy: 
The Federal Reserve's anti-inflation hysteria is, pure and simple, special interest politics, practiced by an institution almost totally free of effective oversight. 
I will continue the quote by Mr. Wolman: 
As a class, Bankers are creditors who have a strong interest in making sure that the money they lend out--ranging from revolving credit, such as Visa or MasterCard, to thirty-year mortgages--is paid back in money that does not lose value through time. The central bank is most concerned to limit inflation because inflation depreciates the value of the assets held by commercial banks. When prices are rising (inflation), debtors can repay their loans to creditors in cheaper currency; for this reason creditors hate inflation. But when prices are falling, debtors are forced to repay their debts with expensive (harder to earn) currency. Thus, creditors benefit at the expense of workers. . . . 
As I previously noted, this mindset that we are confronting is largely based on this outdated and faulty concept called NAIRU, the Nonaccelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. 
As Robert Eisner wrote in his book, `The Misunderstood Economy,' which I recommend to all, the NAIRU concept is the purest example of the old saying, `Statistics are the straightest line from an unreasonable assumption to a foregone conclusion.' 
Again, NAIRU basically says that if unemployment goes below a certain level--once and for many years thought to be 6 percent--inflation will accelerate at such a pace that it will take excessively high interest rates and subsequent levels of unemployment in order to bring inflation under control. Describing NAIRU, Robert Eisner wrote: 
It tells us that if we persist in trying to get and keep unemployment (below its natural level) [whatever that is], we will have, not merely inflation, but accelerating inflation. Literally that might mean a very slowly accelerating inflation like one-tenth of one percent per year. But somehow the term is used to imply that inflation will accelerate rapidly, conjuring up visions of the Germans in the 1920's carrying marks in wheelbarrows and using money as wallpaper. 
The strongest and most unabashed supporter of NAIRU at the Federal Reserve is Fed Governor Meyer, an appointee of the Clinton administration. He said: 
I am a strong and unapologetic proponent of the Phillips Curve and the NAIRU concept. Fundamentally, the NAIRU framework involves two principles. First, the proximate source of an increase in inflation is excess demand in labor and/or product markets. In the labor market, this excess demand gap is often expressed in this model as the difference between the prevailing unemployment rate and NAIRU, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment. 
Mr. Mire goes on to say: 
Second, once excess demand gap opens up, inflation increases indefinitely and progressively until the excess demand gap is closed, and then stabilizes at the higher level until cumulative excess supply gaps reverse the process. 
Visions of Germany in the 1920's. Why, my goodness, if the unemployment rate goes a little lower, you will be taking your dollars to the banks in wheelbarrows. They will be worthless. We will have this huge inflation. That is the kind of fear-mongering done by those who adhere to this concept of NAIRU. 
Now, Mr. Greenspan has recently made some public statements kind of distancing the Fed from NAIRU. I guess, after 3 years, it has finally kind of come home to him that maybe a 5-percent rate of unemployment is not going to accelerate unemployment, maybe not 4.9 percent, and maybe not even 4.5 percent. In his July 22 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Mr. Greenspan said: 
The rise in the average workweek since early 1996 suggests employers are having a greater difficulty fitting the millions who want a job into available job slots. If the pace of job creation continues, the pressures on wages and other costs of hiring increasing numbers of such individuals could escalate more rapidly. 
Furthermore, the prospect of adding more employees to the workforce is equally unappealing to Mr. Greenspan who believes this will ignite inflation. He said this in July: 
Presumably, some of these early retiree, students, or homemakers might be attracted to the job market if it became sufficiently rewarding. However, making it attractive enough could also involve upward pressures in real wages that would trigger renewed price pressures, undermining expansion. 
To that, I say: Not true. Turn again to this chart. Median weekly earnings are going down and corporate profits are going up. All I am saying, and others are saying, is that more of the growth in our economy needs to go to those who are working and making weekly wages. More should be going to the bottom part of our economy who are falling further and further behind and who rely more than anyone else on interest rates. 
Well, again, Mr. Greenspan linked wage pressures, no matter how little to the specter of accelerating inflation in his October 8 testimony earlier this month before the House Budget Committee. He admitted, `There is still little evidence of wage acceleration.' But he said, `If labor demand continues to outpace sustainable increases in supply, the question is surely when, not whether, labor costs will escalate more rapidly.' 
I know Mr. Greenspan is a skilled economist, but I would like to point out a few things to him. First, you have increasing technology with the silicon chip; second, you have a lot of women who are in the pool that can come into the work force because they are homemakers, and as we develop more and more safe, affordable daycare in America, more of those women can come into the work force. Third, we have a global economy, Mr. Greenspan. 
Now, some may say it's odd for me, for this Senator, to be talking about this global economy as part of an element that contributes to economic growth in our country and the keeping down of wage demands. But it is true and it's a fact. All I am saying is that as long as it is a fact, then don't further penalize the workers in our economy by keeping unnecessarily high interest 
rates, which penalizes them in buying a home, or buying a car, or taking a vacation, or saving some money for a rainy day, or for their kids' college education. We can use the global economy as it is with increasing technology, with a vast pool of women, early retirees, and the underemployed, to move into that work pool and hope at least to get some increase in the wages of those that are on the bottom, and at least give them a better ability to be able to increase their standard of living by not paying so much in interest rates. 
Mr. Greenspan, as recently as October 8, is warning us that if the labor demand--once again, that old NAIRU concept--out there continues a little bit further, then inflation is going to accelerate and take off. 
Another simple component of the NAIRU concept is, of course, the preemptive strike. It's when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to fight inflation, despite seeing no signs of accelerating inflation. The justification behind a preemptive strike is the possibility of inflation increasing at some point in the future. Again, Mr. Greenspan said, in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony this year:  
Given the lags in which monetary policy affects the economy, however, we cannot rule out a situation in which a preemptive policy tightening may become appropriate before any sign of actual inflation becomes evidence. 
That leads me to another change in Fed policy that I think we ought to enact and enact rapidly. 
There is no reason why the minutes of the Federal Reserve Board meetings need to be kept secret for 5 years. That's right. When the Federal Reserve meets and sets their policy, it's sealed for 5 years. We don't do that in Congress. We don't do that in the Supreme Court. There is no reason why the Fed has to have that capability to withhold important information. I grant that there may be some economic reasons--in terms of market stability--why their minutes may be kept sealed for a short period of time, but certainly no longer than a year. 
We ought to know from year to year why the Fed is making the decisions it is making. People ought to go back and read the minutes of the Fed meetings back in 1990 and 1991 when it was making some of its decisions. Then you will begin to see that their crystal ball is pretty cloudy indeed. 
Mr. Greenspan, as I have pointed out on many occasions, raised interest rates seven consecutive times in 1994 and 1995. Think about that--seven consecutive times. I say he doubled interest rates. The Fed fund rates went from 3 percent to 6 percent in less than 2 years--about 18 months. He did this despite seeing no signs of accelerating inflation. There never were any signs of accelerating inflation. 
For example, in his February 22, 1994, testimony given shortly after the first of the rate hikes, Mr. Greenspan said the current economic statistics `do not suggest that the financial tender needed to support the ongoing inflation process is in place.' 
Yet, they kept raising interest rates. So during a period of time when we had great economic growth in this country, the raising of those interest rates pushed a lot of our people on the bottom further down on the bottom and let the people at the top get more of the growth that we have had. 
Since the last of the seven rate hikes, Mr. Greenspan lowered the rate slightly and then put them back up again a quarter of a point--at about 5.5 percent right now. 
In July, Business Week published a cover story entitled `Alan Greenspan's Brave New World.' He said Greenspan has moved the Fed into `uncharted territory * * * by allowing faster growth and lower unemployment than the Fed would have permitted in the past.' 
I think we should continue on that track. But I am concerned about the recent testimony given by Mr. Greenspan just earlier this month. The pervasive fear of inflation still holds true to that. This is best shown as the preemptive strike launched by the Fed in March of this year, despite minimal signs of inflation and Greenspan's February Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, in which he said, `This year overall inflation is anticipated to stay restrained.' Mind you, in February, Mr. Greenspan said: `This year overall inflation is anticipated to stay restrained.' One month later the Fed increased its Fed funds rates by a quarter of a point. On April 24, Governor Meyer--again, the biggest proponent of NAIRU--gave a speech in which he said, `The recent Federal Reserve policy action was clearly a preemptive one. This means that it was undertaken not in response to where the economy and inflation were at the time of the policy change, but in response to where the economy and inflation were projected to be in the future absent a policy change.' 
Again, I would like to know exactly what the Fed is looking at when it makes these decisions. What is that future? What is the long run? One economist once said, `In the long run we are all dead.' What are we talking about in the future? One month the head of the Fed says inflation is going to stay restrained, and the next month they raise the Federal funds rate. The next month Mr. Meyer says it was preemptive because we projected that in the future sometime we would have inflation. Obviously, not this year, because just a month before, they said it was going to be restrained. And, yet, over the last several months, our consumers, our small businesses, our farmers, our homeowners, our manufacturers have had to pay a quarter point more interest rate. That hits everyone. It is just like a hidden tax; just like a nice little hidden tax on everyone. 
A lot of people believe that preemptive rate hike in March was totally unnecessary. In the April 14, 1997, edition of Barron's, David Ranson wrote an article entitled `The Federal Reserve's Pointless Quarter Point: A Preemptive Strike Against a Non-Threat.' 
Mr. Ranson said first: 
There isn't any inflation around to curb. Everyone, including Alan Greenspan, concedes that inflation is absent. Thus, the traditional pretext for Fed action is nowhere to be found. I am reminded of the two buzzards sitting on a tree limb. One turns to the other and announces: `Patience, my foot. I'm going to kill someone.' 
We have all seen that cartoon before. So it is like the old Fed sitting there. `Well, patience my foot. We are going to raise interest rates. Inflation isn't there. By gosh, we are going to raise it anyway.' 
According to the official story by Mr. Ranson, the Fed's action was a necessary preemptive strike against inflation before it becomes evident. 
If it is not evident, how do they know it? If it is not evident to a lot of preeminent economists in this country, how is it evident to the Fed? What is their basis for it? Again, we will not know for 5 years. We ought to know a lot sooner than that. 
Mr. Ranson said,  
The real enemy for now is not inflation itself but unwarranted angst about inflation brought on by stubborn adherence to basic misconceptions. Inflation is certainly detrimental to growth, but it is not true that growth must lead to inflation. This principle is observable worldwide. Low-inflation countries have tended to be economically successful while high-inflation countries have tended to stagnate. 
Fourth, increased interest rates do little to curb inflation; mostly they just ratify it. There is powerful evidence that an increase in interest rates slows the economy, but we find surprisingly little evidence that it curbs inflation. Inflation does not decline perceptively following a rate rise. Nor does inflation increase noticeably following a rate cut. 
Mr. Ranson concludes the article by saying: 
The notion that inflation is generated by economic success belies history and perpetuates the `good news is bad news' syndrome that bedevils government policy and the financial markets. 
The assumption that we need the Fed to tinker endlessly with interest rates needs to be challenged. Policymakers are prone to assume that the Nation needs them to take vigorous action . . . even when the pretext for action is elusive. 
It is unclear whether those clamoring for higher interest rates will be mollified by the Fed's token action. It is only more likely they will be encouraged to demand more. One policy mistaken facilitates another.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, I am also concerned that the nominees that will be shortly before us to the Board of Governors seem equally frightened by this ghost of inflation. For example, nominee Roger Ferguson said in his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, `Therefore, I agree with the Fed's historic approach'--I would challenge that word `historic approach'--`to reduce monetary stimulus before the emergence of obvious and strong inflationary pressure. Unfortunately, the timing and appropriate amount of change in monetary policy involves some guesswork and some risk taking.' 
He agrees with the Fed's historic approach. It seems to me the historic approach of the Fed back in 1933 was to facilitate commerce and keep employment high. Only in 1978 was it added to keep inflation in check. 
Mr. Ferguson's view is not a comforting thought given that we have a chairman of the Federal Reserve System who has echoed that comment when he said, `economic understanding is imperfect and measurement is imprecise.' 
That is interesting. Mr. President, if measurements are not perfect, can we assume the Fed knows what it is doing when it launches one of its preemptive strikes? Maybe all it is doing again is simply raising the corporate profit rate and cutting down median weekly earnings. 
This is what is happening. Change in the share of income received by each quintile from--look what is happening. The lowest quintile, the lowest 20 percent of our population, their share of income received is going down. All of it is going down. But in the top 20 percent it is going up--their share of the income. 
So I suggest that what the Federal Reserve is doing is not stopping inflation at all. What they are doing is shifting who gets the money; who gets the biggest share of this great growth that our country is now engaged in. 
Furthermore, I submit that their policy inhibits that rate of growth and keeps it from being even greater than it is. 
So we have a Fed that has used a method to fight inflation when we may not even be sure if inflation actually exists in the economy. 
Well, Mr. President, I believe I have used up my 30 minutes. I see others who are on the floor who want to speak. But I will have more to say about this as the week progresses if the nominations are put before the Senate for consideration. I have a number of other charts that I am going to use to illustrate how the Federal Reserve policies, I believe, are hurting the working families in America, how their policies are mistaken in bending this country toward higher interest rates when those higher interest rates are not needed, when they are not legitimate, and when those higher interest rates benefit the top 20 percent of the people of this country and hurt everyone else. 
The Fed's policies, in short, are keeping growth restrained more than should be. 
Second, the Fed's policies, I believe, are keeping wages from keeping up with productivity in this country. 
Third, the Fed's policies are skewing who gets whatever the growth is in our economic pie. In other words, we know and all of the figures show--and I will release those later on this week--that in our country the richer are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. We know that. All we have to do is look at this chart. 
So the Fed's policies are destroying the broad middle class in America, that middle class that has always been the ladder of opportunity for those who ascend. I fear that if we do not stop the policies of the Fed, that rather than accelerating inflation, what we will have is an accelerating spread between the rich and the poor in our country, 
an acceleration of depressing wages, an acceleration of pushing people in the middle class down further on the economic scale, and that I submit will be harder to turn around and more dangerous for our country, more fraught with the possibilities of deflation and severe recession than any fear of a small increase in inflation that might come about if the Fed were to actually reduce interest rates. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just this week, we in the U.S. Senate have been confronted with two strong reminders of the importance of renewable fuels to this country. This emerging industry, potentially lucrative for American farmers and agribusiness, can help solve two key problems that we face: the impact of greenhouse gases on the global climate, and the growing dependency of the American economy on the import of foreign petroleum products. 
On Wednesday, President Clinton, announced the U.S. position with respect to the climate change treaty to be negotiated in Kyoto in December. Under his instructions, American negotiators will seek to fashion an agreement that will commit, on an equitable basis, the nations of the world to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases over the next several decades. If implemented, our ability to meet such goals will depend greatly on the development and adoption of new technologies which are more energy efficient. The President's proposal to provide tax incentives for more energy efficient technology should be important in spurring such development efforts. Renewable fuel technologies, especially those derived from agricultural products, will be a crucial component of such activities. Many forms, such as the energy that will be produced from the switchgrass project underway in Centerville, IA, offer the added benefit of actually withdrawing carbon from the atmosphere. Expansion of production of renewable fuels also increases income for the farm sector, and creates new jobs. In keeping with a key theme voiced at the recent White House Conference on Climate Change, with renewable fuels we can do well by doing good, for American agriculture and the whole country. 
If that were not enough, Mr. President, Tuesday's announcement by the Commerce Department that record oil imports caused our merchandise trade deficit to increase in August gives added urgency to the promotion of renewable fuels. It is clear that even if no treaty on climate change comes out of Kyoto, our dependence on oil imports still looms on the horizon. The share of imports in U.S. oil consumption has been climbing steadily over the last few years, and the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy projects that the share could reach 75 percent within the next 10-15 years. Increased production and use of renewable sources of energy could help to stem that tide, and reduce our need to rely on energy sourced in large part from a politically unstable region of the world. 
During this session of Congress, we can begin to respond to these events in at least one concrete way, by passing into law the proposed extension of the ethanol tax credit to the year 2007. I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity now to show our confidence in agriculture's ability to make a positive contribution in these areas by producing renewable energy for American consumers to use.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr President, I want to express my appreciation to the chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee and to Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing for working with me to address the special difficulties concerning the treatment of rural elderly housing projects under the new Multifamily Housing Restructuring Program contained in the conference report. As the statement of managers states 
A large portion of the properties in the upper Midwest are elderly facilities in rural areas, which are particularly disadvantaged under the Department's fair market rent system because these properties were built to a different standard compared to general rental properties, and the nature of the rental housing depresses the FMR's. 
The statement of Managers clearly recognizes the situation confronting a large number of projects in my state of Iowa and in other states in the Midwest. There are a variety of factors causing an especially difficult problem for many rural elderly projects. First, they were logically built with common rooms, elevators and other amenities to serve their elderly occupants which added to construction costs and are rarely found in the rental housing surveyed by HUD for FMR-setting purposes. Second, the nature of rural rental housing in much of the rural upper Midwest creates very low FMR's. Third, a very large share of the projects built in the late 1970's which are now coming up for renewal were rural elderly projects in many States. That means that those States will see a large number of projects needing exceptions from the rent limitations requiring actions by the Secretary. The measure provides for some waiver authority with limits set by geographic areas. 
I want to clarify that the waiver authority and other requirements placed in the legislation during conference are intended to provide maximum flexibility for restructuring projects to ensure that elderly projects, and especially rural elderly projects, are preserved as project-based, low-income housing. This valuable resource is needed to ensure the availability of affordable, low-income housing for the elderly and disabled.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I along with Senators Leahy, Daschle, and Johnson will introduce legislation to enhance the enforcement of our Nation's meat and poultry inspection laws and preserve consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat. Earlier this year, Americans were stunned by the recall of 25 million pounds of hamburger. They were further amazed when they learned that the Secretary of Agriculture does not have the authority to demand a recall of adulterated product. He does not even have the authority to impose civil fine on a company which knowingly or repeatedly violates food safety laws. 
Given the recent number of E. coli outbreaks across the country, Americans are demanding that we do more to prevent food-borne contamination and to stop it in its tracks once an outbreak has been identified. Farmers and ranchers expect us to do more to protect consumer confidence in the products from which they make their hard-earned living. 
This legislation I am introducing, which has been developed in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, will give the USDA important new tools to enforce our food safety laws. The legislation would require processors and handlers to notify the USDA of the existence of adulterated meat and poultry products, allow the Secretary to recall adulterated products, and give him the ability to levy civil penalties. 
Currently USDA is limited to the atomic bomb of food safety tools. The Secretary can request a recall of product which is suspected to be tainted, withdraw inspection from a processing plant, and issue press releases alerting consumers. In the case of Hudson, a company went out of business, several people were hospitalized and consumer confidence in beef products was shaken. Clearly we need other tools for the USDA to address food safety concerns short of such extreme measures. 
The Secretary already has civil penalty authority under 11 other statutes. He can issue civil penalties for the abuse of a circus elephant, but not for the shipment of adulterated meat. In addition, 68 percent of States with State meat inspection systems have civil penalty authority. The number of states with mandatory E. coli 0157:H7 reporting requirements has more than doubled since 1992. 
To be sure, we cannot guarantee that the new enforcement powers in this legislation would have prevented the Hudson recall from occurring or that they will prevent future outbreaks. But mandatory reporting of adulterated meat and mandatory recall authority just makes good sense. With these powers, the USDA will be able to respond more quickly to ensure public safety and consumer confidence. 
I view this bill, however, as only the beginning of a process to identify needs in the meat and poultry food chain that can lead to enhanced public safety. All sectors of the food system, from the producer to the consumer need to take responsibility for improved safety. Real food safety cannot be achieved by any one method. We need multiple defenses, using each to their maximum potential. To lower the incidence of food-borne illness we must take a number of steps: Additional research into the way that food-borne pathogens infect animals, remain in the meat products and cause illness in humans; increased research into treatments of food-borne illnesses; improved identification and regulation of hazard points in the production and processing processes; electronic pasteurization as a means of actually reducing pathogens in meat and poultry products; and consumer education on the proper handling and preparation of meat to reduce the risk of illness. 
We are currently making progress toward improving food safety. The new Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points [HACCP] meat inspection system will begin to go into effect in 1998. This new science-based inspection system will specifically target E. coli and salmonella in the meat processing system and is designed to prevent, not just identify contamination. We need to get this system in place and inspectors trained as fast and thoroughly as possible. 
Clearly we need to do more. The events of the past few months underscore that need. We cannot sit around and wait until the next fatal food-safety scare. We have to act proactively and decisively. All sectors of agricultural economy have a stake in ensuring food safety, from the producer to the consumer. I will work closely with consumer advocates, producers and industry to develop a comprehensive package of legislation that will raise the standard of food safety in this country. I believe this bill is a good starting point.

Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, there are many positive provisions in this bill that I am pleased to support. However, I am disappointed that an essential element has not been included in this bill. A major goal of FDA reform is to ensure that the public has access to medical innovations without compromising public safety. But the multimillion-dollar cost of obtaining FDA approval often excludes from the review process all medical therapies not promoted by major corporations, those that are nonpatentable or low cost. 
Very few sponsors of alternative medicines and treatments have the resources to go through this process. Unfortunately, this means that millions of Americans are denied access to important alternative medicines and treatments every day. In committee, I proposed and withdraw an amendment that would improve the access to medical care. It was called the Access to Medical Treatment Act. It was introduced this spring by Senator Daschle, cosponsored by the majority leader, Senator Lott, Senators Hatch, Inouye, myself, and many others. It would allow greater freedom of choice and increased access in the realm of alternative medical treatments, while preventing abuses of unscrupulous practitioners. 
However, it appears that we may not be ready to move on this important consumer reform. Mr. President, while we may not be ready for this, we cannot delay in moving to assure and improve and expand rigorous scientific review of alternative and complementary therapies. That is the purpose of my amendment. 
Mr. President, increasingly Americans are turning to alternative medicine. A study done by Harvard University showed, in 1990, American consumers spent over $14 billion on these practices. In that year, there were over 425 million visits to alternative practitioners, more than visits to conventional practitioners. 
In light of that, in 1992, the Congress passed a bill setting up the Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. We now have 4 1/2 years' experience with that office operating. It has done some good things, but it has been severely hampered by the fact that it must go through the entire process at NIH, through the institutes at NIH, for its peer review and for its grant-making authority. 
The amendment I have before the Senate now would simply change the status of the Office of Alternative Medicine from an office under the Director to a center for complementary and alternative medicine. It would not be an institute but a center. As such, that center could set up a peer review process and make its own grants. 
Now, why is that important? Mr. President, every year since we established the office, we put in the legislation that the office's responsibility was to investigate and validate treatments, practices and medicines. That has been in there every year--to investigate and validate--because what we want is scientific analysis done of these treatments. Now, I have always heard, `There are a lot of quacks out there practicing alternative medicine.' While that may be true, there are a lot of good people out there doing good things with alternative medicine. We need the review and the science to let us know what is good and what is working. 
I asked the Director of NIH a few months ago, who was in my office, how many treatments, or practices, or medicines they had investigated and validated since 1992. I was met with a deafening silence. The answer is, none. Yet, next year we are putting $13 million into the Office of Alternative Medicine. One might rightly ask, where is it going? What is happening? 
So the purpose of my amendment was to set up a center to elevate its status so that that center could do its own peer review and have its own grant-making authority. That way, we can cut through and save a lot of money and save a lot of time, without in any way compromising rigorous scientific review. That is what this amendment does. It also incorporates within that center the Office of Dietary Supplements, which was also set up at NIH, to bring the two of them together in a new center which would provide more independence, assure economies of scale and efficiencies without in any way denigrating good scientific research. That is the purpose of the amendment. 
Now, I understand that the Senator from Tennessee is going to raise a point of order that this amendment is not germane. Under the rules of cloture, I admit that it is not germane. That doesn't mean it is not important. It is very important. It is critically important. It should be passed. 
Mr. President, I understand my 5 minutes are up. I yield 2 minutes to one of my chief cosponsors, the Senator from Maryland.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will respond to my friend from Tennessee who made the argument. He said it would create a huge center at NIH. I am sorry. The Office of Alternative Medicine has 14 employees, the last count I had, and its budget next year is $13 million out of $13 billion at NIH. That is one-tenth of 1 percent. Huge? I beg to differ. 
There are only two changes under this amendment. It provides that it could make grants, that it could do its own grants, and could have peer review. That is the only difference. We are not creating anything new and huge. It is up to the Congress to decide later on if they want to expand it or not. I am just changing its status. 
Also, Mr. President, I want to say that if it were not for this point of order this amendment would pass. The cosponsors are Senators Hatch, Daschle, Craig, Mikulski, Lugar, Specter, Grassley, Durbin, Wellstone, Moseley-Braun, and a number of others. I am not going to read them all. 
This amendment would pass, if the point of order were not raised. 
The Senator says it should go through the committee structure, that we have not had hearings, and stuff. I say in all friendship--and he is a great friend of mine, the Senator from Tennessee--that just a couple of weeks ago the Senator voted on the Gorton amendment that cut out title I--vocational education, safe and drug-free schools, education technology, bilingual education--knocked it all out. And, yet, we never had one hearing on it. It never went through our committee, of which the Senator and I both sit. We never had any hearings on that. Yet the Senator from Tennessee says fine. He stepped up and voted to abolish all of those without going through the hearing process. 
But I would say to my friend from Tennessee, you want more testimony. Look at the Record. Our subcommittee on both the appropriations side and on the authorizing side have had hearing after hearing after hearing on this. We have had all kinds of testimony come in. 
But the most compelling testimony, Mr. President, for this amendment is that more and more Americans are using alternative practices in medicines than they are using with mainstream doctors. They are spending billions of dollars a year. At last count it was over $13 billion in 1 year. 
It is up to us to make sure that we do the adequate scientific research to find out what alternative medicines are working and what are not. 
That is why this center is needed. It may not be germane to this bill. But I will tell you. It is needed. It is drastically needed today--not next year or 2 years or 3 years from now. We have had enough testimony basically from the American people.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the work of Jim Wengert--a good friend and great fighter for working people across the state of Iowa and around the country. 
For well over a generation, Jim Wengert has been a leader at the Iowa Federation of Labor. From 1966 to 1979, he was Secretary-Treasurer of the statewide organization. And from 1979 until his retirement this year, Jim has been at the helm of the Iowa Federation of Labor serving as its President. 
Prior to his years at the Iowa Fed, Jim worked at Swift and Company in Sioux City. In 1952, he joined Local 71 of the United Packinghouse Workers of America and he wasted no time rising up the ranks. He served as Vice President and Steward of his local--and Recording Secretary and President of the Woodbury County Labor Council. 
In addition, Jim has been a legislator in the Iowa General Assembly, and a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, the University of Iowa Labor Advisory Committee, and the Iowa Workers' Compensation Advisory Committee. 
Mr. President, Jim Wengert has had a long and distinguished career but there is a common thread that weaves all his work together. For almost half a century, Jim Wengert has been on the frontlines of the battle for dignity and economic and social justice for the working people of this country. 
That fight has not been easy--far too often, the deck has been stacked against working people. But Jim never picked his battles because the odds were on his side. He did it because America's best values were on his side. Values like dignity, justice and fair play. Time and again, Jim Wengert put it on the line for workers on the line. 
To Jim, it's simple. Fighting for working people is a labor of love. That's why he has used his position and his platform to speak out for good jobs, a living wage, secure pensions, and a better future for our children and grandchildren. 
And if one looks across the landscape of Iowa and at all that's happened that's been good for working people, I guarantee you'll find the fingerprints of Jim Wengert. Because whether it's passing legislation, electing progressive candidates, or changing attitudes, Jim helped make it happen. 
Mr. President, Jim Wengert is an optimist, a doer and a believer. He believes with his head and his heart that tomorrow can be better than today. And the power to make that happen isn't in the hands of `them'--the powerful and privileged. The power to make the future brighter rests with us--by organizing and working together. 
That is what a union is all about. And that's what Jim Wengert is all about. 
I know the Senate joins me in wishing Jim many more years of health and happiness. And even though his retirement is a loss for the working people of Iowa, it is truly a gain for the Wengert family--for Jim's wife Joanne, his children and, of course, his grandchildren. 
Once again, Mr. president I want to thank Jim Wengert for his commitment and service. We owe him an enormous debt for a lifetime of building our communities and advancing the cause of justice and dignity for the working people of Iowa and our Nation.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important issue, child labor. Over the years, I have come to this floor many times to speak about abusive and exploitative child labor and have introduced legislation to combat it. 
But today I am here to specifically raise awareness about child servitude and to speak out against this horrific practice. Several years ago, the South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude (SAACS) based in New Delhi, India, began to devote this day, September 18, to raising awareness about children forced to work. I would like to take a moment to talk about SAACS and their endeavors under the leadership of my good friend, Kailash Satiyarti. In April of this year, I visited Mukti Ashram or liberation retreat established by SAACS which is located outside of New Delhi. This is a place where bonded child laborers are freed from the shackles of slavery and are able to attend school, learn a trade and most importantly to regain their self-worth. I was deeply moved by these children and impressed by their progress in overcoming their previous circumstances. 
Mr. President, I want to be clear. I am not talking about children who work part-time after school or on weekends. There's nothing wrong with that. I worked in my youth--perhaps so did you. That is not the issue. 
The issue is children who are forced to work in hazardous environments--many under slave-like conditions who sweat long hours for little or no pay and are thus denied education or the opportunity to grow and develop. It's the kind of work that endangers a child's physical and emotional well-being. 
And let there be no mistake: When the growth of children is stopped so is the growth of a nation. 
I would also like to take a moment to remember a former child laborer whose life was ended but whose message still resonates throughout the world. His name was Iqbal Masih. He was sold into slavery at age of 4. He was shackled to the carpet looms to slave 14 hours a day, 6 days a week for 6 long years. Until, he broke free. 
But instead of turning away from the hell that was his life, Iqbal did the opposite. He brought his world to us. He showed us things we didn't want to see. He told us things we didn't want to hear. And he challenged us, when he said `the world's enslaved children are your responsibility.' Iqbal Masih was a leader and a crusader, sadly, he was assassinated on April 16, 1995. At the age of 13, his voice was silenced. We remember him today and the hundreds of millions of children who toil away and remember them in the best way possible--by keeping his message alive and his crusade going strong. 
As I mentioned earlier, I traveled to South Asia in April and laid a wreath at Iqbal's grave in Pakistan. I also visited the school in Kasur that was built in Iqbal's memory with the support of students from the Broad Meadows School in Quincy, MA and donations from children throughout the United States. 
Throughout my visit to South Asia, I carried the same message everywhere I went and to anyone who would listen: child labor is a big concern in the United States and that concern is not going to go away. I am going to continue to work hard to make sure that it's on the agenda in Congress, at the United Nations next month, and at the ILO. 
The definition of child labor is not an American standard--it is an international one. ILO Convention 138 is clear. The minimum age for employment is 15 years--developing countries may invoke a transitional age of 14--and 18 years is the minimum for hazardous work. 
Virtually every nation on Earth has similar laws on its books today. So let me put to rest the notion that somehow this is the `West' imposing its will on others. These are not the West's standards. These are the world's standards. 
And the fact is, some of the most powerful calls for the elmination of child labor have been sounded from the governments of the developing world. The Delhi Declaration, adopted in 1995, includes a strongly worded resolution on child labor. As does a resolution adopted at last year's ministerial conference of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation held in Pakistan. 
I believe that it is our job to work together to transform the resolutions we adopt from words to deeds--from intentions to actions. And that is what I have committed much of my time and energy to doing. 
In 1992, I introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act, the most comprehensive legislative initiative in the United States to end abusive and exploitative child labor. Some called it revolutionary legislation but, in truth, it is rooted in the most conservative of notions: International trade cannot ignore international values. 
It is true that the vast majority of child laborers do not work in the export sector. And of course, the exploitation of children is deplorable under any circumstances. But, the reason I have focused on child labor in industries that export to the United States is that we need to begin somewhere. The export sector is an area where we have leverage and where we can try and effect some change now. 
Since the time I began my effort, support has grown tremendously. As I have traveled around the United States and spoken with people about the issue of child labor, I have found that consumers want to get involved. They want information. 
They want to know if products on the shelves are made by children. And they don't want to buy it if it is. A recent survey by Marymount University of Virginia found that more than three out of four Americans said they would avoid shopping at stores if they were aware that the goods sold there were made by child labor. 
Consumers also said that they would be willing to pay more for a garment if it were guaranteed to be made under humane conditions. So, Mr. President, American consumers have spoken. They don't want to reward companies with their hard earned dollars by buying products made with child labor. 
And the Senate too has spoken. In 1993, this body appropriately put itself on record in opposition to the exploitation of children for commercial gain. In my view this was the first step toward ending child labor. 
Earlier this year, I introduced a bill, the Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act, to inform and empower American consumers by establishing a voluntary labeling system for wearing apparel and sporting goods made without child labor. I support labeling for three fundamental reasons. First, it takes a comprehensive approach. It says legislative assemblies--such as the U.S. Congress--can't do it alone through legislation. The U.S. Department of Labor--can't do it alone through enforcement. It takes all of us from the private sector to labor groups to human rights organizations--to take responsibility and work together. We must attack the scourge of child labor from all fronts. 
Second, labeling is based on choice. Companies can choose whether to use the label to keep consumers fully informed and consumers can choose to vote against child labor with their pocketbook. 
Third, I support labeling because it is practical. It is working. Earlier this year, I traveled to India to visit Kailash Satyarthi, the founder of South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude, and the RUGMARK headquarters. RUGMARK is a label placed on hand-knotted carpets to assure consumers that they were made without child labor. In Europe, about 700,000 carpets have been imported from India bearing the RUGMARK label. And here in the United States, where the RUGMARK campaign just began, several thousand rugs have already been imported. 
So, Mr. President, I would conclude by saying this. We have made some progress. Five years ago, I introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act. 
Four years ago, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a resolution, which I sponsored, prohibiting the importation of products made by child labor. 
Three years ago, the U.S. Department of Labor began a series of reports on child labor that represents the most thorough documentation ever assembled by the American Government on this issue. 
Two years ago, a historic memorandum of understanding was signed in Bangladesh to move children from garment factories to schools. 
Last year, a similar effort began in Pakistan in the soccer ball industry. 
Mr. President, in the coming weeks we will be debating the fast track legislation which gives the President the authority to negotiate trade agreements. I have been a supporter of such legislation in the past. During these past weeks, I have had several meetings with members of the administration and have raised my concerns about children making goods or picking agricultural products in Mexico that end up in the United States. 
So, Mr. President, I have to ask are the NAFTA side agreements on labor standards adequately preventing the exploitation of children for commercial gain? 
According to the September 1 issue of the U.S. News and World Report, as many as 4 million children work in Mexico. These children can be found gluing shoes in workshops, lifting two or three times their body weight in produce and cleaning up toxic oil residues, despite the laws in their country outlawing child labor. 
Mr. President, the administration is fond of saying that trade agreements are necessary to level the playing field for American workers, but for the life of me I can't understand how an American worker can compete with a child working 7 days a week, 14 hours a day for 14 cents. The United States must not lower its standards rather we should insist on countries raising their standards to ours. 
It seems to me that the challenge before us is how to stop this exploitation. The global market is now the local market. Today our neighbors are no longer around the block, they are around the world. And we all have a responsibility to help our neighbors. 
Now is the time to learn from our past trade agreements and insist on a basic fundamental premise of protecting children. While, I don't claim to have all the answers on eradicating child labor. I will continue my efforts to end the scourge of child labor. I am always looking for new suggestions, ideas and approaches. But I do say the progress that's been made on eradicating child labor is irreversible. We must keep looking forward.

Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 8 of the 10 minutes. If the chair will interrupt me, I will appreciate it. 
This amendment all but eliminates the National Endowment for the Arts. In other words, it eliminates a Federal role. 
I believe the Senator from Texas is well-intentioned. However, the result would be disastrous for the arts. NEA national leadership grants have supported a number of very worthy projects that would not have been supported by a State. For example, the design competition in 1981 that led to the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. What State would have funded that if it was not going to be in the State, but was going to be located in the District of Columbia? 
The Senator from Ohio made mention of all the money that goes 
to New York. Let's look at some of that money. Through the national leadership grants, the NEA provided a grant to Chamber Music of America in New York, but this grant sponsored chamber music rural residencies, which brought professional musicians to small towns, such as Jesup and Decorah and Fayette and Mount Vernon, IA. Artists lived and worked in these small towns for up to 2 years. They taught in the schools. They performed concerts for citizens in the communities all over the State of Iowa. Thousands of Iowans benefited from this. But, if you look at the grant, it went to New York. But the artists performed in Iowa, for up to 2 years. 
If we take all of this money, as the Senator from Texas wants, and give it just to the States, will, then, the State of New York fund a program that goes to Iowa? I rather doubt it. They will keep the money there. But because we have the NEA making these grants, giving them out, then they can direct and guide those to go out to States like Iowa and Nebraska and Missouri, and States where we don't get a lot of money for arts. 
So, what State would fund a program like that? What State? Would Texas? Would Texas fund a program that would send artists to Iowa for 2 years? I doubt that. 
The NEA has also supported dance touring programs. The Alvin Ailey dance group traveled to Atlanta, GA; Redding, OR; Tuscon, AR; Iowa City, IA; Milwaukee, WI. Would Texas fund something like that? I doubt it. Would New York fund something like that? I doubt it. Would California fund something like that? I doubt it. But, because we have a National Endowment for the Arts, we are able to get this out. 
A grant to the American Library Association sponsored the `Writers Live At The Library.' This program went all over America, to places like Rapid City, SD; Medina, OH; Buchanan, MI; Muncie, IN. Would Texas have sponsored that? I doubt it. Would New York alone have sponsored that? I don't think so. But the National Endowment for the Arts did. 
That is my point. You could look at a lot of these grants. They may go to a State. But they seep out and go around the United States. If we adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, that will end. We will not have a National Endowment for the Arts. We will simply have a bunch of States out there. I rather doubt that States will fund programs that will go to another State. 
Mr. President, this amendment has never been reviewed or discussed in any format before. Present law provides 35 percent to the States. Under the bill, under the leadership of Senator Jeffords, that goes to 40 percent. It was adopted by a 14-to-4 bipartisan vote in committee. 
I might also point out that Federal funds are matched by the States on a 1-to-1 basis. If you increase this amount of money to the States, they will have to go to their State legislatures to get the amount of money up. Will that happen? Well, in some States it might, in some States it might not. 
I also will point out that the Hutchison amendment imposes a cap on administrative costs of 5 percent. Right now the President's budget calls for a cap of 14 percent. Here is the problem. Many of the State agencies are quite small, so State support varies from State to State. If you put a cap on like that and you have low spending, that just destroys the program. Obviously, as you know, the more money you have in the program the less the amount of administrative costs there are for administering that program. 
So the 5-percent cap would also not only hurt many of the State agencies, but would be disastrous for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Mr. President, the Hutchison amendment is a severe and undeserved rebuke to the arts endowment. It may be well-intentioned, but I also point out that if this is so good, why is this opposed by the very agencies that would supposedly benefit from this? The National Assembly of State Arts Agencies is opposed to this amendment. That organization believes that the current distribution between Federal and State is appropriate. 
So, again, while it may sound good to give all this money to the States, the fact is, the Chamber Music of America in New York came to Iowa and lived there for 2 years in our small towns and communities. It may have looked like a grant to New York, but it was run by the National Endowment for the Arts. If you give all this money to the States, if New York got all this money, would they then of their own volition fund the chamber music program that we had in Iowa for 2 years? As I said before, I doubt it, and I don't think Texas would either. 
For those reasons, this amendment should be defeated. I am told also, and I have a letter from the White House--I will just read it:  
The administration understands that an amendment may be offered to increase significantly block grants to the States, thus severely diminishing the Federal leadership role of the NEA. In addition, the administration understands that an amendment may be offered making it administratively impossible for NEA to carry out its function. 
That's the 5-percent cap. 
If such amendments were adopted, the President's senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill. 
I believe this bill is too important to be vetoed. I believe the NEA is too important to be cut up, segmented and destroyed by this amendment. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me just say that we have a lot of budding artists in Iowa, a lot of them musicians. I can tell you, when the Chamber Music of America came out and spent 2 years in our small towns, it was wonderful. These wonderful artists went to these small towns. They got these kids excited about music and about chamber music. I can't tell you how many hundreds of Iowa kids, I say to the Senator from Texas, were enthused and got involved in music and are progressing now because of that. 
That would not have happened without the National Endowment for the Arts. It just simply could not have been funded by the State and wouldn't have been, and I don't think the State of Texas would have funded it either. 
Yes, there are a lot of budding artists out there, and that is why we need a national program to reach out to these budding artists.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas may say she wants to preserve and keep the National Endowment for the Arts, but this really is a stealth amendment. This is the stealth amendment that will kill the NEA. It will do great damage to a lot of our small States like Iowa, States that may not have a lot of money. We have a lot of budding artists, and we need the national commitment to the arts program to ensure that these young poets and these young writers and these young musicians and these young painters and these young artisans know that there is a national commitment and they have the kind of support and the kind of encouragement and the kind of role models that they need to encourage them in their efforts. 
No, Mr. President, this stealth amendment would do drastic damage to the NEA. It would kill the NEA, and we cannot afford to do that. I urge its rejection.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, first of all, the Senator from Missouri has repeatedly talked about the poem `Lighght.' He has held up this little piece of paper, and he has talked about this poem and castigated it as one of the great spending holes of the U.S. Government, we spent money on the poem `Lighght.' 
Well, I saw that and I recognized it. Believe it or not, I recognized that poem. And so I thought I would take some time since I have a history in this to shed a little light on `Lighght'. 
Now, again, I am glad that the Senator from California brought this up because the Senator from Missouri never did mention this until the Senator from California, Mrs Boxer, brought it up. This poem `Lighght' was published in 1969. The Senator from Missouri did not say that. He admitted it after the Senator from California pointed that out. But in listening in the last couple of days to the Senator from Missouri, one would have assumed that this grant was just made, not in fact made in 1969, when it was. 
Mr. President, the debate on the NEA, National Endowment for the Arts, has set a new standard for debate in the Senate. First of all, suggesting that we should eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts in 1997 because of a grant that was made in 1969 begs incredulity. That would be like saying the State of Missouri, since it had laws on its books that allowed segregated schools until the 1960's, will not be eligible for Federal education programs. Or saying that the University of Alabama will be prohibited from participating in Federal student aid programs because it was segregated prior to June 1963, or the schools in Little Rock, AR. 
Times change. Conditions change. Well, now, the Senator from Missouri said, oh, OK, fine. `Lighght,' this was 1969, but then he held up a piece of paper which he was reading something from--I didn't catch it all, but it was from a book called `Blood of Mugwump,' which I never heard of until today, but I remembered someone had said something to me about it and I looked it up. My staff gave me this. Lo and behold, the Senator from Missouri is wrong again. `Blood of Mugwump' did not receive any NEA funding. How many of these misrepresentations will we hear from the Senator from Missouri in debate on funding of the National Endowment for the Arts? 
Now, I have here a letter, Mr. President, from People For The American Way. It said: 
In a letter to Congressional Members dated June 25, 1997, the Christian Coalition urged Members to `vote against any amendments to increase NEA funding' and asserted that the NEA is now `funding the proliferation of pornography,' citing specifically two films, `Sick' and `Age 12,' and one book, `Blood of Mugwump.' 
Fact 5: The Christian Coalition is wrong. The NEA did not fund any of the three examples used.

Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator from Missouri would like, I am sure that we could sign him up for People For the American Way, and he could get the correct information as to what is going on and not the false information that he got from the so-called Christian Coalition. 
And so again the Senator from Missouri has brought up something that simply has no basis in fact. And I have here again, Mr. President, a letter dated March 17, 1997, from Karen Christensen, general counsel of the National Endowment for the Arts. It is written to Mr. Curtis White. I will not read the whole thing. It just said here: 
The progress report which you filed with this agency erroneously included `Blood of Mugwump' as among those volumes partially supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts; this is not the case. 
In any future publications, including promotional materials and reprints of FC2 volumes, please remove any reference to the National Endowment for the Arts from any publication which is not supported by an NEA grant. 
I would appreciate prompt attention to this matter.

Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, if the Senator from Missouri was really serious, I am sure that he could have found out that in March of this year the National Endowment for the Arts wrote a letter to the director, who put out this book, I guess, under this grant, that it wasn't supported by the NEA. And the Senator from Missouri would not have stood in this Chamber today and said that `Blood of Mugwump' was another example of bad taxpayer spending by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
I caution my friend from Missouri that he simply check his facts. That is all. And I am certain that if he just wanted to check his facts, if the Senator from Missouri just simply wanted to check whether or not what he was saying was factual, a simple call to the National Endowment for the Arts--they are not hard to get hold of. They are right down here in Washington, DC. Their phone number is 682-5400. I would suggest to my friend from Missouri that he simply pick up the phone and call them, ask them: Is it so that `Blood of Mugwump' was funded by an NEA grant? And he would have been told the facts. 
So I think we have an obligation when we debate here on the Senate floor to be, at least, somewhat careful. I know we make mistakes around here. But, at least, try to check our facts out. 
In that regard, Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit more about the poem `Lighght.' Now, the reason this came to my attention is because this was an issue in my first campaign for public office in 1974 when then incumbent Congressman Bill Scherle in the House had gone after the National Endowment for the Arts on the same basis, that they had funded this word, one-word poem `Lighght.' 
And so I want to set the record straight, and I want to talk a little bit about it to get the facts out, the latest facts out. Mr. President, here are the facts. The National Endowment for the Arts sponsored a three-part series entitled `American Literary Anthology.' This was the idea of George Plimpton and also Roger Stevens, that they would seek out writers, poets around the country who were not well known, who maybe had published in small literary journals that had small circulation, to have a contest to put them together and to pick what judges decided were the best of these new writers and to put them in an American anthology to give them a wider berth so that more people could read them. 
The purpose again was to support small literary magazines and their contributors. After all, most writers, Mr. President, don't start writing for Esquire or the New Yorker or the big magazines. They start with small literary journals around the country. And so that was the idea of George Plimpton and Roger Stevens, to get some of these new writers out there and bring them in and give them a wider circulation. 
I spoke just the other evening with George Plimpton about this. He and Peter Ardery were the directors of the `American Literary Anthology.' He told me that the NEA grant in 1966 had three goals. First, to provide wider distribution for literary works which first appeared in magazines with limited circulation. Second, to supplement the small stipend the magazines used to provide to the authors. 
As Mr. Plimpton told me, in many cases these writers got nothing except four or five copies of the magazine in which they were published. 
So, it was to supplement it. And here was the supplement: $1,000 for prose material, $500 for poems. That was to the contributor, the writer. And, third, to reward the magazines which published the literary works in the first place: $500 for prose, $250 for poems. The total was $60,000 for the second volume. So the Senator from Missouri is wrong again. Again, I ask the Senator from Missouri, please check your facts. The amount of grant for this one-word poem was not $1,500, it was $750: $500 to the writer, $250 to the magazine. 
I am certain the Senator will say that $750 is still too much for this poem, but nonetheless I thought it important to set the record straight, that it is not $1,500, it was $750. 
I got a copy of the American Literary Anthology, volume II. Actually I read some of the poems in it. It is interesting that the Senator from Missouri picked out a poem written by Aram Saroyan, the son of William Saroyan, by the way. I don't know Aram Saroyan. I have never read his poetry before and I have not since. But I looked in volume II of the American Literary Anthology to see who else was published: people like Robert Penn Warren, John Ashberry, Jim Harrison--I say to the Senator from Missouri, Jim Harrison, who later wrote `Legends of the Fall,' which has been made into a movie, I guess; W.S. Merwyn, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet who also attended the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa, and I will say more about that in a second; James Tate, one of our foremost poets in America; Joyce Carol Oates, also in volume II. 
That is just a sampling. Why didn't he pick out some of those? No; he picked out this one-word poem, just to show people how it appeared in the book. Here it is, volume II, a one-word poem, on one page. 
This is called calligraphic poetry. Calligraphic poetry is poetry where it's not just the content of the poem, but it is how it is laid out on the page that also sends a message, or conveys a thought or a feeling. I might point out to the Senator from Missouri that calligraphic poetry is not new; it is very old. In fact, some calligraphic poetry goes back to the 18th century, some in religious poetry. These religious poetry might be shaped in the form of pulpits, crosses, churches, saints, icons, things like that, to convey a religious image by the way the poem looked as well as the words that the poem contained. 
I must say, I think the Senator from Missouri, if I might just say--I think the Senator from Missouri picked the wrong poem. There is a poem, it starts on page 273 of the second volume of the American Literary Anthology. It is `The Last Will And Testimony of Art Evergreen,' and it goes on for 17 pages. If the Senator had picked that poem, he might have a little more sympathy from this Senator. I say that tongue in cheek. 
But why did the Senator not also pick the poem on page 339 by James Tate called `Stray Animals'? No; he picked this one-word poem because, obviously, he doesn't like it. Frankly, I am not certain I like it either. It doesn't say much to me. But some calligraphic poetry I like, in the way the words are shaped and put on a page. That one doesn't say much to me at all. But, nonetheless, it is legitimate poetry. And there are a lot of other poems in there. 
Again, the Senator may not care for this type of poetry, but that is no reason to abolish the National Endowment for the Arts. Over its 32-year history, the NEA has made 112,000 grants. To date, about 40 that we have been able to find have caused people some problems--about 40 out of 112,000. I think that is a pretty good record. Again, the Senator did not mention all of the other people who have gotten grants from NEA. 
A little while ago I spoke on the phone with Jorie Graham. She is at the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa. Last year, 1996, she won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. I had a long talk with her. Here is an individual who received an NEA grant, 
and she told me without that she would not have been able to take the year off and write poetry because she had a young child. So that grant enabled her to do that. 
I might also point out with some sense of pride that in 1996, last year, the three nominees for the Pulitzer Prize in poetry, Charles Wright, Donald Justice and Jorie Graham, were all from the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa. It is interesting to note that it was the student, Jorie Graham, who won the prize. All three were recipients of NEA grants. 
Why does the Senator from Missouri not talk about that? Why doesn't he go after the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa? 
Here, I will be glad to give it to my friend from Missouri. Here is a whole packet of pages, going clear back to 1970, of writers and poets who have received grants, who were at the Writers Workshop. Who will the Senator find in here? People like Robert Penn Warren, he'll find people like Kurt Vonnegut, he'll find people like Tennessee Williams--he may not like Tennessee Williams.

I just had a long conversation on the phone with Jorie Graham, the poet from the University of Iowa Writers Workshop, who won the Pulitzer Prize last year. She told me without that NEA grant--she had a little child--she would not have been able to take the year off to develop her talents as a poet that enabled her to win the Pulitzer Prize. Yes, she absolutely stated that to me. 
Some of these, maybe not. But I can tell you some people like Kurt Vonnegut and some people, when they first started out--no. They needed these grants to get up to a level.

Mr. HARKIN. I will respond to my friend this way. That is true. We have had a lot of great poets and writers who received no NEA grants. How many more, though, were out there in the little towns of Missouri, in the fields of Iowa, around the coal mines of Kentucky and in the hills of Kentucky, who wanted to develop their writing skills and their talents but did not have the support to do so? How many were left lying fallow in the ground because we wouldn't even come up with the two pennies, the two pennies per taxpayer per year, to help them to develop their talent? 
I think that is the appropriate question to ask, is how many were out there who didn't get the nourishment who, if they had the nourishment, could have been great writers and poets in our society today?

Mr. HARKIN. I only responded because the Senator raised the issue. He was saying, questioning me, that was I saying all these great ones all received NEA grants. I would say no. But I think the question I asked was how many more were out there that could have risen up? 
He mentioned Samuel Clemens. That was the last century and of course, again, we had great musicians and we had great artists and poets in the past. But again, I challenge my friend from Missouri to think about this. The few that we talk about in the past century were so few in number. I mean, they were absolutely the pinnacle, absolutely the best. How many more who didn't quite make it up there could have been very good? Maybe they wouldn't have been the top echelon, but they might have been very good writers and purveyors of senses of the esthetics of different regions of this country that weren't there. 
Sure, you can point to Samuel Clemens and a few others. But how many more might have come along, might have been great, might have been maybe not at that pinnacle, but maybe up in that level who died aborning because they had no support whatsoever? 
I might also, tongue in cheek, ask my friend from Missouri, who has gone after some writings that he claims are not quite appropriate for readers to read--you know, old Samuel Clemens wrote some things that were pretty risque. I wonder if the Senator from Missouri has ever read `Letters From Heaven'? If the Senator from Missouri has never read `Letters From Heaven' by Samuel Clemens, I ask him to read it and bring it on the floor and read it. I doubt he would want to read `Letters From Heaven' on the floor of the Senate.

Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Missouri, he couldn't be further from the truth. This is the American Literary Anthology in which the poem `Lighght' appears. No Government agent or employee decided what went into this book. I can't for the life of me figure out what the Senator from Missouri is talking about. 
For example, who decides whether a writer gets published? It is the editor of a magazine, the publisher of the magazine. Who decided what poems and what fiction, essays, went into this anthology? Editors and publishers of magazines. They all got together and went through all of their different magazines and decided who they thought ought to be in here. It wasn't Government. No Government agent did this. No Government employee did that. 
Does the Senator think that writers just sort of spring up and, because they are so good in the beginning, that right away they appear in the New Yorker Magazine? Of course not. 
They appear in these small literary magazines around the country, and it is the editors of those magazines and the publishers who decide what gets published. They were the ones who decided what went into this anthology. There is no Government agency. I don't know of one Government agent who decided on an NEA grant. It has all been done in a peer review process. 
That would be like saying, I say to my friend from Missouri, that we should cut out research at the National Institutes of Health because it is Government money, and why should the Government pick which research to do, whether it is cancer or heart, whether it is diabetes or Alzheimer's? The present occupant of the chair knows a lot about this. Should the Government be picking the researchers because we put the money into the NIH? We put a lot of money, as the occupant of the chair knows, into NIH. We don't tell them what to pick. They do it through the peer review process, through scientists in the field who decide what is legitimate, good research to do. 
The same is done in the National Endowment for the Arts. We don't sit there. No one in the Government sits there and says we pick this and we pick that. They set up boards, commissions, they set up peer review entities that decide what is going to be. You can disagree with them, and sometimes I have disagreed with them, too, but that is no reason to end the National Endowment for the Arts. 
So I repeat, Mr. President, I had a lengthy conversation yesterday with Mr. George Plimpton and today, again, with Jorie Graham, who, I repeat to my friend from Missouri, won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for poetry. She was emphatic that she and so many of her colleagues would not have been able to develop their talents were it not for the NEA grants they received, and then go on to win the Pulitzer Prize. 
She said the NEA took a risk, I say to my friend from Missouri. She said it was a gamble. They didn't know if she was going to be a good writer, poet or not. But she said the cost to the taxpayers for the creative fellowship was 2 cents, two pennies. That is what we are putting into supporting writers and poets around the country--2 cents per taxpayer. 
Again, if I may use the analogy of the National Institutes of Health, we don't expect that all $13.5 billion that we have put in every year at NIH is going to produce a medical miracle. Not at all. A lot of that research is dead end and nothing ever happens, but we believe in doing the research. 
So, again, NIH is not right 100 percent of the time, and we shouldn't expect the National Endowment for the Arts to be right 100 percent of the time and that every writer that is picked through this process is going to be a Pulitzer Prize winner or another Samuel Clemens or another Jorie Graham. No, some of them won't make it, but at least we are getting them out. 
As Jorie Graham told me, she said, `You know, there is a market out there. The American people aren't stupid. If they read the poetry and they read the literature, like cream on milk, the best will rise to the top.' But until you put that milk together and put it in the bottle, forget it. That is what we are doing through the NEA grants; we are bringing these people together and giving them an outlet for their creative abilities. Some will make it, some won't. Some will write a one-word poem that is calligraphic. It may mean something to somebody. It doesn't particularly to me. Or some people like the poet I just pointed out will write a 17-page poem, which also didn't mean much to me either. 
But I can tell you that there are some writers in here that have meant a lot to me and a lot to a lot of other people. People like Robert Penn Warren, John Ashberry, Jim Harrison, W. S. Merwyn, who, by the way, was also at the Writers Workshop and received the Pulitzer Prize in poetry, and James Tate, Joyce Carol Oates. They were in this anthology, too. So I guess that is what we are 
saying. It is not an elitist institution. The creative writer fellowships are made to writers with no other means to support themselves. These grants don't go to the wealthy; they don't even go to the middle class. 
Second, I might point out to my friend from Missouri, these grants also are awarded geographically, not just to a few areas. Since these grants are awarded on a geographical basis, the writings that we get reflect the regional and aesthetic values of those regions. How else could we get the flavor of what it means to be born and raised in Iowa on a farm unless perhaps we read something by Jane Smiley, `A Thousand Acres,' and what it means today about what is happening to the farmers in Iowa. Or what would it mean if we didn't have a flavor of what was happening in the West or in the South with writers who can understand, who feel and are sensitive to the aesthetics of that State or that region or that area? That is why NEA grants go out to regions and geographically so it doesn't just go to one certain area of America. 
The critics many times focus only on those from the cities, but as I have just pointed out, many, many, many rural writers have also received awards and many have gone on to do great things. 
So, the Senator from Missouri can get up all he wants. I just wish he would be straight with the facts. First of all, he or his staff should have checked and let us know--let everyone know--that this poem was awarded a grant in 1969. 
Second, I wish the Senator from Missouri had further checked his facts and found out that the book `Blood of Mugwump' received no NEA grant. A letter from NEA March 17, 1997, points out that `Blood of Mugwump' did not receive an NEA grant. 
As I said to my friend from Missouri, all he has to do, if ever he has a doubt about what NEA is doing, is pick up the phone and call them--they are here in Washington--and ask them and they will be glad to set you straight on what they are doing. 
I will wind up by saying, Mr. President, for 2 cents from every taxpayer in America--just 2 pennies--we can go out and lift up some of these young writers and poets all over America, artists who may be like Jorie Graham and have a young child but they have innate talent, to be able to get across to people, as she did with poetry, what it is like in small rural towns or small communities of rural Iowa. She said without those 2 cents and with a small child, she wouldn't have been able to do it. 
The Senator can get up and say he doesn't like `Lighght'; that is fine. There is a lot of poetry I don't like either. As I said, I am not partial to this particular poem, although there is a lot of calligraphic poetry I do like. 
I will say one other thing. I was looking at some information that came out from Mr. Frank Luntz. I don't know Mr. Frank Luntz, but he has been in the news a lot lately. He wrote a book on how the GOP can use language to manipulate people. His book is called `The Language of the 21st Century.' I guess it was presented to the Republican conference before the August recess. I was looking at some excerpts from Mr. Luntz' book. He is saying how people should talk about things. Oh, there is addressing the gender gap. There is health care. How to talk about Clinton. Education. And then he has here, `Prolog: Luntz's 12 step program to make Republican language more soothing to voters.' 
Here is a quote from his book:  
Every time Republicans get into a conflict with the President, you begin to shout, mistakenly believing that if you speak loud enough, your message will get through. But the American people aren't deaf. They simply don't understand what you're saying, nor understand its relevance to their day-to-day lives. Linguistically, you're out of touch with the American people. 
So he has 12 principles. I will not read them all, obviously, but I will read the seventh principle of Mr. Frank Luntz, who is writing this for the GOP: `Abolish the National Endowment for the 
Arts.' That is what he is saying Republicans should say: `Abolish the National Endowment for the Arts.' 
`This makes sense,' Mr. Luntz says, `for strategic reasons as well as on principle.' I will give him that benefit. `Napoleon spoke of the importance of feeding your army if you expect the soldiers to go off to battle. You must deliver some nourishment to the true believers. You need a symbol that both differentiates the two parties and stirs up the troops.' 
No. 7 in his book of the 12 principles. 
If you want to stir up the troops, that is fine. Again, I hope they will be clear on the facts and that we understand what this is about. I don't believe it is really valid, and, again, I happen to like the Senator from Missouri, he is a good guy and I like him, but I think he has gotten mixed up on his facts. But then, again, we all do periodically around here. But I just wish that he would be a little bit more careful in looking at what the National Endowment for the Arts really does and how it operates in Missouri and Iowa and the Midwest and to think about whether or not we would want to throw out all funding for the National Institutes of Health because some of the money we gave them might have gone for bad research or something we didn't like. I don't think so. 
We may not like all the things the NEA does, but on the whole, out of 112,000 grants in its history, this Senator only knows of 40 that has been raised as issues on the floor of the Senate or the House in the 22 years I have been privileged to serve here. 
So, again, Mr. President, the National Endowment for the Arts is much too important to us as a nation, much too important for America, for our diversity, for understanding who we are and where we have come from and perhaps even where we are going to have maybe one example of one poem disliked by one or two or three Senators be the cause of not funding the entire National Endowment for the Arts. It has done an outstanding job. We should make sure we continue to fund it, not so that Government can pick winners and losers and all that, but to make sure that those who are out there in the field, those budding writers and poets will at least have some hope that they, too, can become the next Jorie Graham at the Writers Workshop in Iowa and win a Nobel Prize for her or his poetry. I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise now to pay tribute to a great friend of mine, a close personal friend and someone who has added significantly to the Senate and the House over the course of almost an entire adult lifetime of work and, moreover, who has added to moving America forward in terms of how we feel and how we care about each other and really moving America forward toward the ideal of our Nation. And that is a nation without barriers to anyone, a nation of opportunity for all. 
Mr. President, I speak of Bobby Silverstein, who later this month will leave the Senate to teach and establish a center for the study and advancement of disability policy at George Washington University. 
For the past decade, Bobby has been my chief counsel and staff director of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy. During this time, he has been the behind-the-scenes architect of legislation that has truly revolutionized our Nation's policy towards its citizens with disabilities and expanded opportunities for the more than 49 million Americans with disabilities and their families. There is simply not a more knowledgeable, skillful, accomplished and respected person in the field of disability policy in our entire Nation. 
Bobby Silverstein played a significant role in crafting the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA. Before the ADA, discrimination on the basis of disability was wrong, but it was not illegal. Bobby helped me fashion a coalition of grassroots and Washington-based advocacy groups and demonstrated the significant political strength of this unity. Through this coalition, every Member of Congress was educated that disability is a natural part of the human experience, that discrimination on the basis of disability can be tolerated no longer, and that people with disabilities must be judged on what they can do, not on the basis of myths, stereotypes or fears. 
His mastery of the issues, unrivaled negotiating skills, patience, and excellent working relationships with those in the disability community, the business community, the Congress, and the White House enabled what many have called the emancipation proclamation for people with disabilities--the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
Under Bobby's behind-the-scenes leadership, public policy for infants, children, and adults with disabilities and their families has been strengthened and expanded in every aspect of life: education, employment, civil rights, housing, income maintenance, health, transportation, telecommunications, and recreation. In addition to the ADA, he was my chief aide responsible for securing passing of legislation establishing the National Institute of Deafness and Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health. This Institute has contributed significantly to the knowledge of deafness, and has led to improvements in the lives of millions of Americans who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, including senior citizens. Bobby also shaped legislation to reauthorize the Rehabilitation Act, which supports essential job training, employment, and independent living opportunities for thousands of adults with disabilities. On October 16, 1990, the Television Decoder Circuitry Act became law and opened up the information available on television to the millions of individuals who can benefit from captioned television, including deaf individuals and those children and adults who are learning English. 
Prior to this time, people who were deaf, like my brother Frank, had to have a great big box that they set on top of their television set that would receive the signal and decode it for that television. Those units cost, if I am not mistaken, in the neighborhood of a couple of hundred dollars. But as my brother said to me one time, that's fine when I'm home watching television; I can get the news and the weather and other information I need through my decoder on my television. But what about when I travel and I stop at a motel or hotel and I want to find out what the weather is going to be, or I want to listen to the news? I can't take that box with me. 
So, beginning in 1988, 1989, we began having hearings on the possibility of mandating every television set sold in America have a little chip put in it so that every television could decode the signal for closed captioning. I remember the hearings. The companies came in and said, `Oh, no, this was going to cost too much money.' 
Bobby wasn't satisfied. He went to the manufacturers of the chips, asked how much it would cost to produce the chips, and if every television set had them in it how much would it cost. And it came down to mere pennies. So, armed with that information, we were able to get that information to our committee, to Members of the Senate and the House. The bill passed and, as I said, was signed into law by President Bush on October 16, 1990. 
So, every time when you turn on that television and a phone call comes in and you want to watch what is going on but you want to turn the sound down so you punch that button on your remote and the captions come up so you can follow the news and still answer that phone call, think of Bobby Silverstein. He is the one who made it happen. It was a great law and one that has just helped millions of Americans, including people like me who do not suffer from deafness, for just the very kind of purpose I just mentioned. 
Bobby also championed the Assistive Technology for Individuals With Disabilities Act, protection and advocacy legislation for individuals with mental illness, the Development Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act and landmark family support legislation. Most recently, Bobby was the lead Democratic staffer for the negotiations that led to the bipartisan enactment of Public Law 105-17, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--known as IDEA--Amendments of 1997. This passed this year. IDEA guarantees a free, appropriate public education for more than 6 million children with disabilities. 
Bobby came to the Senate after several years working for Congressman Pat Williams of Montana in the House of Representatives, where his skills resulted in landmark legislation that established early intervention and preschool opportunities for very young children with disabilities--what we now call part H. These two programs have enabled hundreds of thousands of children to obtain the services and support they need to live with their families and develop to their potential. 
In addition to his impressive legislative achievements, Bobby has extensive experience working in Federal agencies and the private sector. He has drafted policy interpretations for the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare on issues related to persons with disabilities under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; race and national origin issues under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and gender issues under title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. In private practice, he trained professionals on the legal framework of the Rehabilitation Act, as well as serving as legal counsel for parents of children with disabilities in cases relating to securing a free appropriate public education for their children. 
Bobby Silverstein has won not only my unquestioned respect and deep admiration, but that of Republican and Democratic Senate and House Members, leaders of the disability community, the business community and grassroots activists. His knowledge of the issues and his intellectual rigor and honesty are recognized by everyone with whom he's worked. 
If Bobby Silverstein says something or is involved with putting forward a point of view, everyone knows that he has come to that position after meticulous study and careful, objective and reasoned analysis. Bobby has taught us all the importance of working together to achieve a common goal. He was able to achieve consensus among parties with strongly held competing views. The great respect he commands from those across the political spectrum is rare and is clearly a tribute to his abilities and tireless dedication to good research and sound analysis. It is this widespread trust and respect for Bobby and his work that has made much of the legislation we've enacted possible. 
Mr. President, I, along with every American, owe a great debt to Bobby Silverstein. In all my years in public service, I have not encountered a more dedicated, caring and good-hearted person. He exemplifies all that is good about public service. He is truly among the best and the brightest individuals in the field of public policy. In the field of disability policy, he has no equal. 
Mr. President, as you know and as I know and so many people know, as we pass legislation here, it gets our name on it. We are the sponsor of the bill. When it is enacted into law, it is our name that is on it. So often we know it is dedicated staff that really do the work. 
I said so many times that most of the legislation that we pass dealing with people with disabilities, if it were not for Bobby Silverstein, it never, ever would have happened. 
So, in that way his mark will remain for a long, long time, not only here in the Senate but all across America. 
I will yield to my friend and colleague, the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend, the Senator from Vermont, who again is known for his keen intellect, but also a big heart. I appreciate what he just said about Bobby Silverstein. I should have recognized the fact that the Senator would have worked with him, of course, on the House side. 
Again, the people who worked so hard to make our country more fair and to break down barriers of discrimination against people--surely no one can claim that Senator Jim Jeffords needs to take a back seat to anyone. 
Certainly, Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont need not take a back seat to anyone. Senator Jim Jeffords has always been in the forefront of those fights, especially working on the issue I have been talking about, people with disabilities. The Senator from Vermont has always been in the forefront assuring that people with disabilities have their full constitutional and civil rights in this country. So I appreciate what he said about Bobby Silverstein, and coming from the distinguished Senator from Vermont, believe me, it means a lot to me and it means a lot to Bobby Silverstein.

So, Mr. President, as the Senator from Vermont said, Bobby is moving on. I am absolutely certain that his next endeavor, which is the center for the study and advancement of disability policy located at George Washington University, will have an immediate and long-term effect on national policy for Americans with disabilities. I might just add as an aside, Bobby is capable of nothing less. 
So as Bobby Silverstein leaves the Senate, I congratulate him on his outstanding accomplishments. I thank him for his tireless service to his country. I extend my best wishes to Bobby, to his wife Lynne and their sons, Mark and Evan, for continuing success in the many years ahead. So, Bobby, thank you for a job well done. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have the distinct pleasure of having a visitor on the floor of the Senate today, the Honorable Mr. Evgeney S. Savchenko, who is a Senator in the Russian Senate. He is also the chairman of the agriculture committee, the Committee of the Council of Federation for the Agrarian Policy. In other words, it is the Senate Agriculture Committee for the entire Russian Federation. 
We are delighted to have Mr. Savchenko here. 
He also holds another position, Mr. President. He is Governor of the Belgorod region of the Russian Federation. I thought the occupant of the chair might be delighted to know that in Russia, when you are elected a Governor of a region or Governor of a state, you automatically become a senator. So, therefore, you can fulfill both positions at the same time. 
I know the occupant of the chair, in his former life, was the chairman of the Agriculture Committee of the House of Representatives. So I know that the occupant of the chair, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, would have a lot to discuss, I am sure, in terms of agriculture with Mr. Savchenko who is the chairman of the agriculture committee of the Russian Federation. 
I am delighted to have him here and present on the Senate floor today. 
With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. Let me agree with Senator Kennedy on this issue. The stories in the paper this morning ought to alarm us all about the need to proceed very cautiously and very carefully about what we are doing. I spent a lot of time looking at devices. I had amendments on the bill itself, when it was in committee, on devices. The FDA has the authority now, if a device is used for a certain purpose, to make sure that there are not misleading or false advertising proposals. But when they want to use the device for a purpose for which it is not intended, there is nothing in the bill to prohibit that. That is what we are talking about, and I think we have to proceed very cautiously and carefully here. 
Mr. President, I did want to talk about another issue. I thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their hard work and leadership on this bill. I think we all agree we need some reform of FDA. I have been in favor of that. We need to streamline the processes. I agree with Senator Jeffords in that regard. There are many positive provisions in this bill.

Mr. President, the pending legislation increases funding for Head Start by $324 million and directs that 10 percent of the fiscal year 1998 increase be dedicated for further expansion of the Early Head Start Program which serves children from 0-3 years of age. The appropriations bill does not amend the underlying Head Start statute, therefore, there is no change to the 5 percent set-aside for the Early Head Start Program as prescribed by that law for fiscal year 1998. 
I would ask the chairman if he could clarify the intent of the legislation with respect to the Early Head Start Program. It is my understanding that the 10 percent from the fiscal year 1998 increase is in addition to the 5 percent set-aside already provided by law.

As the chairman knows, this bill includes funding for the National Mediation Board [NMB] which is responsible for mediating labor-management disputes in the railroad and airline industries under the Railway Labor Act [RLA]. To help meet this responsibility section 3 of the RLA requires the arbitration of certain disputes that arise between employee and their employers in the rail industry. 
Unfortunately, there is a serious need to help the NMB fulfill its section 3 responsibilities. Delays in care processing cause uncertainty and hardship for both rail workers and the carriers. I want to thank the chairman for recognizing this problem and for including an additional $500,000 to the budget of the NMB. It is my understanding that it is the intent of the chairman and the committee that the NMB should use this extra money to deal with the section 3 cases. Is this also understanding of the chairman?

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take just a minute before the final passage of this bill to comment upon an amendment that was just adopted here, the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington State. I am concerned about the impact of that amendment and what it is going to do to education. 
I do not know how many people understand what we have just done here. What we have just said in adopting this amendment on such a narrow vote is that many education programs including vocational education, bilingual education, education technology, immigrant education, safe and drug-free schools, and Goals 2000--some you may like, some you may not like, but all of these programs are now part of a block grant. This money now goes to local education agencies in the form of a block grant. All of the things that we have worked so hard on, on a bipartisan basis, in terms of technology, safe and drug-free schools, vocational education, all of these are gone under this amendment. 
Mr. President, $4 billion of that money now goes out to local education agencies in the form of a block grant. There will be no requirements on how this money is to be spent--none whatsoever. In other words, they can take the money and build a swimming pool and say the heck with education technology or safe and drug-free schools or vocational education. There is no limitation. We have had in the past limitations on how much of this money could be used for administrative costs, to pay for superintendents and all the administrative people who make up our schools.

These requirements are done away with in this amendment. So now they can use this money to pay superintendents or other school personnel more money.

That is all taken off. 
I heard time and time again from people on both sides of the aisle how we should cut down on how much money we put into administration. I agree with that. We all agreed with that. Now those restrictions are gone. They will be able to use this money for whatever they want. I just think it is a terrible mistake on the part of the Senate to have adopted this amendment.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, my chairman, Senator Specter, in commending, first of all, the staff for all the wonderful work they did in pulling this bill together. I especially want to thank Craig Higgins, Bettilou Taylor, Jack Chow, Jim Sourwine of Senator Specter's staff. And our staff on our side: Ellen Murray and Marsha Simon. 
This is a very complex, very big bill. It took us a long time to get it through. The Senate worked its will, and we did finish action on the bill. For the most part, I think it is a good bill, and I think it does move us in the right direction. There is a lot of good stuff in there for children's health, preventive health care measures. There are good provisions in there dealing with human services. For the most part, there are a lot of good items in there that will advance the cause of education in this country. 
However, I must once again, Mr. President, for the record state that the adoption of the Gorton amendment basically does away with all the targeted programs that this Congress has supported on a bipartisan basis for so long; things like vocational education, bilingual education, education technology, and some of the newer ones, like Goals 2000. These are all done away with by the Gorton amendment. 
What it says is we are going to take all this money and it goes to the local education agencies without any restrictions whatsoever. I am concerned that this was not widely known by a number of Senators when the vote was taken, and what also was not widely known, I don't believe, is that we have always had a cap, a limitation on how much money could be spent for administration. 
That has been even more heavily supported on the Republican side than the Democratic side, and yet that is removed. So the money that we have said should go out to States for vocational education will now go to a local education agency, and they can do whatever they want with it. They can build a swimming pool. They can pay their superintendents whatever they want. They can take, not the 5-percent cap we have on administration, they can say we want to use 20 percent for administration. 
Also, we have said in the past that these moneys should be used to supplement, not supplant, State efforts. That is taken 
away. So what can happen is all the money we put out to an area now that normally would go for vocational education or education technology or safe and drug-free schools, all of that money now doesn't have to be used for that, and the State can say, `OK, we're not going to put the money in, we'll just use the Federal dollars and we'll take our money for roads, bridges' and whatever else the State wants to do with their money, thus downgrading the amount of funds that actually go into education. 
I know it was said by the Senator from Washington, `Well, not all knowledge resides in Washington; do we know what to do best in local school districts? The answer to that, obviously, is no. Keep in mind this money is not forced on the States. We are just saying this is Federal tax money that we vote to collect. And, yes, we do have a right and an obligation under the Constitution of the United States to decide how that money is to be spent. 
We don't have the obligation or the right to decide how States spend their own State tax dollars, but we certainly do have the right and the constitutional obligation to decide how we spend Federal tax dollars. And that's what we said. We want it spent on vocational education. We want it spent on safe and drug-free schools. Those programs have been supported widely on both sides of the aisle. 
We have also said we don't want more than 5 percent of that money to go to administrative costs, which has been widely supported on both sides of the aisle. That is all taken away by the Gorton amendment. 
Mr. President, I talked with a number of my colleagues on this side of the aisle--certainly not all of them--but a great number of them prior to the vote on final passage. While I voted for final passage of the bill, because there is a lot more good than bad in it, I must state for the record that if, in fact, this provision is not dropped in conference, if we don't have the votes to drop it in conference, if it comes back from conference, as the minority manager on this bill, I am going to vote against it. 
I hope that the President will send strong signals that he will veto this bill if this provision remains in the bill because it would do away with years and years of what we have done to focus attention on areas of education, like vocational education, safe and drug-free schools, education technology and others, that we thought were so necessary in order to move this country forward. I just hope this provision will be dropped in conference and that we can come back and support the bill out of conference with the same strong vote that we had here. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>105-harkin-ia-1-19970910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota. 
The Senator's amendment is simple. It would shift $525 from the Pentagon budget to Head Start, a very worthy program under the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. The amendment does not specify where in the Pentagon budget the funds would come from, we leave that for a later time and for input from our military leaders. 
The first National Education Goal states that by the year 2000, all children will start school ready to learn. Earlier this year, scientific research provided irrefutable evidence that the best way to achieve this goal was in a child's first three years of life. 
The release of this research was followed by a White House conference, television specials, magazine articles and a lot of talk about the need to improve activities to promote the development and education of young children. 
The pending legislation made some very modest efforts to seize the momentum created by these activities, but were limited by the constraints of the budget agreement. The bill does make some improvements, such as: 
Head Start is increased by $324 million with 10 percent dedicated to the Early Head Start program. This action doubles the set-aside for the programs which serve children up to the age of three. 
The early intervention program for infants and toddlers with disabilities is increased by 11 percent to $351 million. 
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is directed to examine the quality of child care funded by federal resources to determine to what extent recent research on the brain development of young children is being applied by recipients. 
In addition, the bill provides more resources for other programs to enhance the education and development of young children such as the Parents as Teachers Program, child care block grant and the Healthy Start Program. 
While I am pleased with these investments in the education of young children and appreciate Senator Specter's support, however, we need to do more--much more. 
That's why I am pleased to support Senator Wellstone's amendment to provide additional funding for Head Start. At the present time, Head Start is serving only a fraction of the number of children eligible for these services. The additional funding would expand the number of children receiving the education and health services that will enable them to start school ready to learn. 
The key to our economic security requires a well-educated, highly skilled and healthy work force and the strong foundation for this skilled work force is formed during the first years of a child's life. To achieve this goal however, it is critical that children start school ready to learn so that they will leave school able to earn. 
The amendment would reduce funds for the Department of Defense so I would like to take a few moments talking about the Pentagon spending. 
A perfect example of unnecessary spending is the plan by the other body to spend $331 million for additional B-2 bombers. The Department of Defense has spent $44.4 billion to develop and purchase 21 planes. Now B-2 bomber advocates want to purchase an additional 20 planes at a cost of $35.9 billion for procurement and operations. This works out to more than $1.7 billion per plane. In fact, this means that the B-2 bomber costs more than three times its weight in gold. Both the House Defense authorization and Defense appropriations bills include $331 million as a down payment for an additional nine planes, with the hopes of building even more later on. 
The list of folks who oppose additional B-2 bombers has become noteworthy. The Air Force doesn't want more B-2 bombers. This has been well know for quite some time. Now, other parts of the defense establishment oppose additional planes. In August, Defense News--hardly a bastion of the liberal press--published an editorial entitled, `Time to Pause on B-2.' To quote the editorial, `the U.S. House of Representatives should pause for reflection before it takes one more step to resuscitate the B-2 bomber program and buy nine more planes.'

Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the latest bad news for the B-2 bomber program is a GAO report that describes some serious shortfalls with the planes stealth features. Specifically, the aircraft is more sensitive to climate and exposure than expected. The B-2 requires special shelters to maintain its stealthiness or prolonged exposure to the rain and other common weather problems can negate the planes' ability to avoid radar. 
This is not the first time that the B-2 bomber has faced problems with rain. Two years ago, we heard how the bomber's radar had trouble telling the difference between a rain cloud and a mountain. 
In fact, the Air Force hinted at the stealth problems back in 1990, when they sought approval for a series of special hangars for the B-2 bomber at a cost of $4.7 million each. I am sure the cost has gone up in the past 7 years, but even then, the problem of maintaining the sensitive stealth skin of the B-2 bomber was talked about. And now the GAO has shed more light on the B-2 bomber stealth problems. According to the GAO, the B-2 bomber must be kept in shelters because of their sensitivity to moisture, water or other severe climatic conditions. Unless flown in only the most benign environments--low humidity, no precipitation, moderate temperature--the plane requires extensive maintenance or it will not be ready for use. I think modern warfare will included conditions that aren't exactly the most benign environment. 
Here is how some newspapers are now describing the bomber. 
The New York Times has said: `The $2 billion Stealth Bomber Can't Go out in the Rain.' 
The St. Peterburg Times used the headline: `Not so stealthy when wet.' 
And Robert Scheer of the Los Angeles Times said `Let's hope it rains on the B-2's parade.' 
No one disputes that the Cold War is now over, but some in this body would like to continue funding the Department of Defense as if it had never ended. The B-2 bomber is the perfect example of that view. 
The world today is not the world of 1985. True, there are dangers to the United States, but they are not the kind of dangers which justify a military budget that swallows discretionary spending and harms the very citizens it seeks to protect. They are not the kind of dangers that require more B-2 bombers at a price we cannot afford. 
Even with the elimination of the Soviet Union, our defense spending is still over 80 percent of United States cold war spending levels. 
The United States will spend nearly three times what any other country on the face of the Earth will spend on defense. In fact, if you added up the military expenses of all of Europe and South America combined, that is to say every country in Europe and South America together, you would find that the United States still out spends them on defense. 
I ask you Madam President, what is all of this money for? What enemy are we going to fight? Cuba, who spends less then 1 percent of our military budget? Or Lybia or Iraq or Iran or North Korea or Syria? Or are we spending $266 billion a year simply to have a large military. 
Let's look at some more figures. United States military spending is three times more than China, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Vietnam combined. It is more than double all of our NATO allies combined and it is larger than the next eight largest military budgets combined. 
As it stands now, such a large portion of our discretionary budget goes toward defense spending, that the security of our citizens is threatened. Yes, Madam President, you heard me correctly, they are threatened by increased defense spending. Why? Because every extra dollar we spend on defense is a dollar less for education, for putting police on the streets, for stopping the drug epidemic and feeding our children. 
The amount of discretionary funding spent on defense totals over 50 percent of the discretionary budget. That means that the portion of the total budget that Congress actually decides where it will get spent, or the discretionary budget, goes overwhelmingly toward defense. For every discretionary dollar, 50 cents goes to defense. Not education, not health care for children, but defense. 
Every dollar we spend on defense has to come from somewhere. My question is, Where does the funds for defense come from? Does it mean one less school gets connected to the Internet? One more child can't read, or one more child goes hungry?

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Coverdell's amendment. Americans need to have the cleanest and safest meat and other foods. The emergency of E. coli:0157H7 is a real threat which we must quickly respond to. The Coverdell amendment provides funding to address this important issue. 
There are several ways to reduce E. coli and other microbial contamination and we need to take a multifaceted approach. More research is one of those. The new hazard analysis and critical control point inspection system will start to be implemented on January 1, 1998. That will be a considerable benefit. I believe that an additional improvement that can be made is the use of electronic pasteurization. Through that means, we can kill a wide variety of pathogens that may come into accidental contact with foods with no downside to the consumer other than a very small cost. 
I would expect that the Department should coordinate its research efforts with USDA in those areas where the Department of Agriculture has expertise. 
I am hopeful that we will move along all of these paths in order to provide the safest and most reliable possible food supply.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment fundamentally alters the distribution of Federal education funds by converting a poverty based formula to a general aid formula. This is major change in Federal education policy and there has not been a single hearing on the impact or advisability of such a change. 
The Senator from Washington said it is his goal to get more money into the classroom. However, I wonder how there can be any such assurance since his amendment eliminates the requirement that Federal funds must supplement and not supplant existing education funds. We all know that dollars are fungible and there is nothing to prevent a state from merely reducing State Support for education and spending more money for other worthy things like roads and bridges. 
The 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provided schools with greater flexibility, especially with respect to title I. These changes are working. 
As Federal lawmakers, we have a responsibility to make sure the Federal dollar is well spent. This amendment undermines the provisions of the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to improve accountability of Federal education programs.

Now, this has to do with attorney's fees paid in connection with a State recovering money. This does not have to do with the so-called proposed big settlement that is going to come to us in the future. This applies to States. 
I wonder how we, here, can limit attorney's fees in a State action?

Mr. HARKIN. I listened to the Senator make the explanation but I thought the amendment was going to go toward limiting attorney's fees if there is a global settlement, this thing we are being asked to do at some point. We do not know if it is this fall, next year, or whatever, when we will be asked to ratify a so-called global settlement. 
But your amendment does not just speak to that, it speaks to ongoing cases in the States. For example, as I understand it, the State of Mississippi just settled, the State of Florida just settled, other States will maybe be settling. Your amendment seems to me to apply to those States that make those settlements. It has nothing to do with the proposed universal or global settlement that we will be asked to ratify at some point later on. 
That is why I wonder, by what right or power do we have in the Federal Government of saying to a State government, a State attorney general and the State government that you can't, in your agreement, whatever your agreement is, you have to limit attorney's fees? 
That seems to me to be an odd kind of a thing for us to do--the Federal Government telling the State government when you make your agreement, here is all you can do. It does not seem to me to be constitutional.

Mississippi made an agreement, Florida has made an agreement, maybe there will be a couple of other States that make agreements, what if later on we make a global settlement, do they have to go back and renegotiate all the attorney's fees? That is what I wonder. 
How can we tell a State what they have to do prior to our reaching this national settlement--and whether we reach it or not, I do not know. What would happen, for example, to a State like Mississippi that has already negotiated and make their deals--I guess, I assume they have.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for many years, I have worked to identify and eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicare Program. Senator Specter and I have held hearing after hearing and released report after report through our subcommittee. And along the way, we have had some successes. We've stopped a number of scams and ripoffs and we've forced Medicare to reduce excessive prices for a number of devices. These actions have saved Medicare and taxpayers over $1 billion. However, the problem continues to grow. Much more needs to be done. 
Several years ago, the General Accounting Office testified before our Appropriations Subcommittee that, based on their analysis, Medicare was losing up to 10 percent of its expenditures, or $16 billion to fraud, waste, and abuse. However, on July 17, HHS Inspector General June Gibbs Brown released a major new report that indicated that the problem was even worse. It was the first national audit of a statistically significant sample of Medicare claims for payment errors. This chief financial officer [CFO] audit found that up to 14 percent of Medicare payments in 1996 were made inappropriately. That's up to $24 billion in 1 year alone. 
And this was not a flimsy study. It was detailed and in-depth; 5,300 claims of all types--physician and hospital services, home health care, lab tests--were thoroughly audited. Patient medical records were reviewed and providers and beneficiaries were interviewed. Fully one third of all the claims were found to contain mispayments--all or a portion of the claims should not have been paid. 
Some 46 percent of the mispayments were for claims that had either inadequate or no documentation to justify their need; 36 percent of the payment errors involved services that upon review were found not medically necessary. For example, Medicare was charged for x rays on both knees for one patient, when the patient only had problems with one knee. And 8 percent of the payment errors were due to improper billing codes used by health care providers. For example, a physician billed for one office procedure when upon review of the medical records it was found another less expensive procedure was actually performed. 
This report is a devastating indictment of the administration of Medicare. And if it goes unaddressed, Medicare will lose as much money over the next 5 years to fraud, waste, and abuse as was cut by the 
balanced budget act we just passed. That is simply unacceptable. 
Making sure that doesn't happen should be at the top of the priority list for the Department of Health and Human Services and this administration. I am afraid, however, that this may not be the case. 
The Department has drafted a corrective action plan that, if fully implemented, would take some important steps to addressing the problems identified in the CFO audit. My understanding is that it calls for a 10-percent increase in medical reviews, a 20-percent increase in prepayment review of hospital claims, a 20-percent increase in post-payment review of physician claims, and increases in provider education, expanded audits of home health agencies and nursing, and other improvements. 
These are important improvements, but they are woefully inadequate. We need to at least double the number of audits Medicare is conducting. Right now, only about 3 percent of claims are reviewed and only 3 of every 1,000 providers receive a comprehensive audit in any year. That needs to change. And this amendment would help Medicare meet this need. 
I send an amendment to the desk for myself and Senator Graham of Florida, who has been tireless in the fight against Medicare fraud, and ask for its immediate consideration. 
This amendment would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to obligate no less than an addition $50 million this fiscal year to increase Medicare audits and to comply with its correction action plan developed in response to the CFO audit. 
Mr. President, there is about $53 million in the Medicare contractor account for fiscal year 1997 that will likely go unspent. This is due to problems the Department has encountered in the administration of its Medicare transaction system [MTS] initiative. Rather than seeing this money lapse or be rushed inefficiently into a last minute contract, our amendment would assure that this money is well spent to address a pressing problem. It would be easy for the Department to implement because it would simply obligate it to existing contractors to expand the number of audits and reviews that they undertake--it will simply, in effect, increase a current work order. 
Mr. President, it would be unconscionable for the Department to let these funds lapse when they know how inadequate their current efforts and resources are to combat Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse. This is not time for bureaucratic business as usual. We need to take bold action to begin to turn the tide against these losses. Our amendment is a simple, commonsense step that would have a significant impact. 
If properly implemented, it would more than double the percentage of problem providers receiving comprehensive audits. This would save Medicare and taxpayers many times over its costs. 
I understand the amendment has been cleared on both sides. I urge its adoption.

Mr. HARKIN. The United States has for years been a leader in refugee protection. Since 1975, over 2 million refugees have resettled in the United States. The Refugee Act is the core of U.S. refugee policy. This act sets out the criteria for persons to be designated as refugees. In addition, the Refugee Act allows the Department of Health and Human Services to run several important programs to assist refugees in adjusting to their new life in the United States. These programs include the Refugee Assistance Program, which provides assistance to refugees to help them become self-sufficient in the shortest time possible, social services programs which provide funding to States to support English language classes and employment training for refugees. Refugees receiving cash and medical assistance under this program are required to be enrolled in employment services and accept employment offers. 
Furthermore, the Refugee Act allows HHS to provide overseas medical screening of refugees before they enter the United States. Also, it provides targeted assistance to States and counties with high refugee populations. For instance, in 1996, Polk County IA received $160,500 in targeted assistance. HHS also provides a matching grant to voluntary agencies which take responsibility for resetting refugees and ensuring they become self-sufficient. In Iowa, the Refugee Act allowed HHS to provide a targeted assistance award of almost $50,000 to the State and Lutheran Social Services for a program which helps former political prisoners achieve economic independence.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume on this issue. 
Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to revisit an issue that has been settled and should remain settled. It attempts to reverse a decision supported by both pro-choice and pro-life Senators alike. The last time this body voted on this issue, the vote was 93 to 4. 
The ban on fetal tissue research was lifted 4 years ago. Since that time, the NIH has awarded over $23 million in grants for research involving the study, analysis, and use of fetal tissue. This research holds the potential to provide tremendous advances in the treatment of debilitating conditions such as Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, epilepsy, blindness, multiple sclerosis, leukemia, and a host of other illnesses. 
The issue of fetal tissue research has been debated, as I said, and legislated by the Congress. The Senate voted 93 to 4 that the benefits of this research far outweigh the unsubstantiated fears and concerns that it would lead to increases in abortions. 
The bill enacted in 1993 established rigorous standards to safeguard against any potential that the needs of researchers would affect individual decisions about abortion. Those safeguards are in place and they are working. In 1997, a GAO study of the safeguards reports that `the act's documentation requirements were met' and that there have been no reported violations in the acquisition of human fetal tissue for use in transplantation.' 
These safeguards were not written specifically to address research involving Parkinson's disease, but all research using fetal tissue. There is no need to revisit this debate as it relates to research on Parkinson's. The research being conducted today with fetal tissue is also providing new techniques such as specialized cell lines and genetically engineered cells. In fact, the development of these new technologies may well eliminate the need for using fetal tissue for research purposes in the future. 
Mr. President, yesterday I received a letter from Joan Samuelson, president of the Parkinson's Action Network. It was addressed to Senator Kennedy and others. I would like to read for the Record what she had to say. Her letter starts: 
For decades, despite the eight-year ban on federal support for the research, significant progress has been made in the therapeutic benefit of cell transplants, including the following: 
Major progress has been made in confirming the new neural cell transplant process works. In the last two years, post-mortem review of transplanted cells has proven that the transplanted cells can take hold in the host brain and produce dopamine, thereby replacing the dopamine in the body. 
Major progress has been made in developing an alternative source of tissue for transplantation, so that when a therapy is available to the public, it will not be dependent on elective abortions. Several alternatives are in development, including use of porcine (pig) cells, stem cells and genetically engineered cells. 
The research is also providing valuable insights into the fundamental issues of Parkinson's cause. For example, the transplanted cells do not appear to be affected by the underlying disease process: While the original cells continue to degenerate, the transplanted ones do not continue to degenerate. This fact is giving essential clues into the nature of the cause and disease process. 
The transplanted cells are proving more and more effective at treating Parkinson's symptoms. A few transplant patients are now off medication and symptom-free--a dramatic change.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the letter points out that we are making progress, that we are discovering new things. Now is not the time to revisit this issue. This issue has been settled and I believe we ought to leave it alone. As we have said, the studies have shown that the safeguards we put in place are working. No violations have been encountered, and I believe the best course of action is to stay the course that we have had since 1993, and, of course, I think at the appropriate time there will be a motion made to table the Coats amendment. And I urge all Senators to support that motion to table and to continue what we have been doing since 1993 in providing for fetal tissue research but with adequate safeguards to ensure that unintended consequences do not happen because of this research. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<DOCNO>105-harkin-ia-3-19970903</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Before I return to the substance of our amendment, I want to address a couple of points raised yesterday. 
The distinguished chairman of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee suggested that my amendment should not be adopted because it skirts the rules. Well, the rules governing this body clearly permit this Senator or any other Senator to offer an amendment to the House Agriculture appropriations bill once it comes over to us. 
There was a quotation in AP today of Senator Cochran saying, `This is an unfortunate effort to go around the rules and procedures.' 
How, I ask, can this Senator, be going around the rules when I am in full compliance with the rules of the Senate? Our amendment is fully within the Senate rules. There is no point of order that lies against offering it. And I will point out that offering this amendment at this time is in full compliance with the unanimous-consent agreement worked out with the majority leader during the Senate's consideration of its Agriculture appropriations bill. 
The distinguished chairman, Senator Cochran, was involved in those discussions also. I did not wait until after the Senate passed its version of the bill and then spring this amendment on the Senate. Before the Senate passed its bill, there was a unanimous consent agreement worked out which plainly provided an opportunity for me to offer an amendment at this point, an amendment that is clearly permitted under the rules. That was all worked out under the rules openly and aboveboard before the Senate passed its Agriculture appropriations bill. 
If, I submit, the argument of the distinguished chairman, Senator Cochran, prevails and our amendment is defeated on the basis of his procedural argument that this Senator should not be able to rely upon the Senate rules, every Senator should be concerned about the precedent that outcome would set regarding his or her ability to rely upon the Senate rules. Senators who are inclined to vote with Senator Cochran should think again and ask themselves what options under the Senate rules they may be closing off that they may one day critically need. I am not just talking about the rule I am relying on here. I am talking about a whole host of other rules protecting the rights of Senators that could be swept away in the name of expediency, rules that could be eviscerated as mere trifling inconveniences. 
This procedural argument made by the distinguished chairman is both dangerous and bogus. Let's get to the real issue here. The issue is whether or not kids under the age of 18 should be able to buy tobacco and whether we ought to fund efforts to stop such sales. That is what this vote is about. It is about our kids and protecting them from the ravages of tobacco. With the death toll of over 400,000 a year, smoking is killing more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, motor vehicles, fires, homicide, illicit drugs, and suicide combined. And I might add, with the addition of the Byrd language, States will be encouraged to crack down on the illegal sales of alcohol along with the illegal sales of tobacco. Teenage smoking rates are climbing--a 17-year high among high school seniors. 
Why do we need these FDA rules? Because without the ID checks and a strong rule against underage sales, kids will continue to fall prey to tobacco. 
This picture says more than a thousand words about why the FDA rules are needed. Here is Melissa on the left, Amy on the right. `Can you tell which one is 16? If they walked into a store, would the clerk know which one was under 18? To eliminate the guesswork, FDA requires retailers to card anyone who is under 27.' 
You could not tell which one of them is under the age of 18. It just so happens the young woman over here, Melissa, is 16 and Amy, over here, is 25. That is why this rule is needed. That is why the court in Greensboro, NC, upheld this rule. 
Our amendment seeks $34 million in funding, minuscule in comparison to the $50 billion in smoking-related medical costs in our Nation each year.

Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, Senator Cochran said that only a few States are getting FDA funding right now. That is the point. Six States right now are receiving FDA enforcement money, and only 10 States are expected to receive such money in fiscal 1997, because FDA does not have the money for all States. What this amendment provides is enough money to expand the FDA initiative to all 50 States. I thank my friend from Mississippi for pointing that out. That is the essence of this amendment; to expand to all interested States FDA funding for enforcement of rules providing for ID checks and prohibiting illegal sales to kids who come in to buy cigarettes and tobacco. 
Madam President, we hear time and time again the tobacco companies saying they want to stop kids from smoking. This amendment does that. Yet has one tobacco company stepped forward to support this amendment? A deafening silence. Not one penny comes out of their pockets under this amendment, and yet not one tobacco company has come forward to say, yes, this amendment by Senators Harkin and Chafee is good because it will keep kids from smoking and buying tobacco. They say they want to help stop kids from smoking. Not one of them has come forward to support this amendment. Shame on them. 
We debated the previous version of this amendment on July 23, and it was tabled 52 to 48. Since that time another 125,000 young Americans have gotten addicted to smoking, and every day that we delay, thousands more kids like these young women here walk into stores, buy cigarettes and tobacco products, and get hooked. That's why the tobacco companies are not here supporting this amendment.

Mr. HARKIN. I want to concur with what the chairman just said about this amendment. Obviously, all of us are very concerned about the lack of, shall we say, appropriate funding levels for research into the causes and interventions and cures of Parkinson's disease. This is something that I have been very close to for the last several years. I know that both Senator McCain and Senator Wellstone have been leaders on this issue in the Senate. And I congratulate them and commend them for their leadership on the issue of proper funding for Parkinson's research. 
There have been some recent breakthroughs in the causes of Parkinson's, some recent breakthroughs in genetic tracing, some recent breakthroughs in possible interventions, early interventions for those who are detected early with the onset of Parkinson's disease. 
This is a quantum increase. It is not out of bounds. Certainly the incidents of Parkinson's disease in this country and around the globe warrants the type of investment in research that the amendment anticipates. It remains to be seen whether or not we can accommodate this huge increase within the confines of the conference. I can assure the authors of the amendment that this Senator, and I am sure that Senator Specter, will do what we can to maintain this type of a level for Parkinson's research. What the disposition will be on the House side, obviously, we have no control over that. But I want to commend both Senator McCain and Senator Wellstone for their leadership on this issue and hope that we can do what we can in conference to keep the funding level up for Parkinson's research. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise--and I am sure this is no surprise to anyone--in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Arizona. Again, I would concur with what my distinguished chairman said. About half I agree with; half I do not agree with in terms of the Senator's comments. 
We are all in favor of increasing Pell grants and making sure everyone is covered, but I would say this committee, under the able leadership of Senator Specter, has done a great job of increasing the Pell grants to historically high levels--a maximum grant of $3,000, up from $2,700 last year. Certainly you always perhaps could have more. But I haven't heard from any institution of higher learning or anyone that is involved in the Pell grant program saying that this is insufficient. I think what I have heard is that they are very, very happy with what this committee has done in meeting these requirements and getting the level up. 
In taking the cut out of LIHEAP for this, though, talk about robbing Peter to pay Paul, because we are talking about the same kind of universe. We are talking about low-income families. 
Again, just to reiterate and reaffirm what the chairman said, the LIHEAP Program has gone down 50 percent in the last decade. We started out at about $2.1 billion in 1985 and it is down now to $1 billion--a 50-percent drop in the amount of money, yet the eligible population for LIHEAP has grown by about 30 percent--33 percent in that same period of time. So the eligible number has gone up and the pie piece has gone down. Over 70 percent of the families receiving LIHEAP assistance have incomes of less than $8,000 a year; 7 out of every 10 have incomes--that is not individuals--family incomes less than $8,000 a year, and 44 percent of the households receiving it are elderly, over age 65. So that is the universe we are talking about. 
The Senator from Arizona said this is a program that's outlived its usefulness; the energy crisis is gone. Well, it may be that for those who are making more money it is gone, but my figures show that the prices of natural gas, electricity, if you adjust for inflation, are about as high now as they were in 1979. But if you look at the universe of people who are getting LIHEAP, their inflation-adjusted incomes have not gone up. So they are basically in the same position they were in, or like families were in, when the energy crisis hit in 1979. 
As Senator Specter said, 50 percent of these families in LIHEAP use natural gas, 15 percent use electricity, 35 percent use oil, propane, wood, and coal. So for these families the energy crisis still exists, and it especially exists when the weather gets the coldest. 
The Senator from Minnesota is in the Chamber, and as we found out last year when we had some extremely cold weather, we found anomalies in the upper Midwest where in some States the cost of propane and oil spiked, went up 25 percent during the coldest times of the year as compared to some other States. In other words, in those areas where it was the coldest, where it was needed the most, the price went up the highest.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. It would gut the whole program. To answer the Senator's question, we always come in for emergency funds. But here is what happens. When you don't fund the LIHEAP Program enough, what happens is family--let's face it; the average family gets about 215 bucks. It's what, around 30 percent, I think, of their heating bill. But what happens--and we know this from experience in my State of Iowa especially--when they don't know if they are going to get the money to pay their heating bills--and you know elderly people are very proud. They don't want to be on welfare and most of them are not on welfare. They are getting Social Security, very small Social Security checks. What they do is they turn the heat down and they put their shawls on, they put on coats, they wear coats around the house. And then what happens. Well, they get ill and then they have to go to the hospital, and they go to the emergency rooms. 
We have found this time and time and time again. That is what poor people, and especially elderly people, will do when they don't know if they are going to get their heating money. And so again, the crisis is real for these people, very, very real. 
As I pointed out, last year we had--and I have called for an investigation of it--in some States, a 25-percent increase, and I do not think there is any need for it other than the demand was there, it was very cold, and a lot of these elderly people simply could not pay these prices. 
Lastly, let me sort of respond philosophically to the Senator from Arizona. I couldn't help but notice the comment that this was a program of the liberal welfare state; like a lot of programs of the liberal welfare state, it just goes on and on and on even when the need is not there. 
Well, I could ask the Senator from Arizona, what about the Pell Grant Program? That was a program of the Lyndon Johnson Great Society just as well as--well, not LIHEAP; that came later, but the Pell grant was a program from under the Great Society, and the need was there and the need is still there for the Pell Grant Program. 
So I would submit to the Senator from Arizona that this is not a program of the liberal welfare state. It is a program of a caring and compassionate and fair state. We are, as I said the other day, fulfilling our obligation under the Constitution of the United States. 
A lot of people do not realize this, but twice in the Constitution the word `welfare' is mentioned--twice--first, in the preamble when it says, `We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare.' 
`Promote,' it does not say just stand by. It says `promote the general Welfare.' That is why we established the Constitution. So that is the first place it is mentioned. And then in article I, section 8 of the Constitution. Article I is, of course, Congress and what Congress is supposed to do. Section 8 outlines the responsibilities of Congress: To borrow money, regulate commerce, to establish post offices and roads, provide and maintain a Navy, et cetera, et cetera. Here is the first paragraph of section 8 of article I of the Constitution. 
The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States. 
It is our obligation, first, to promote the general welfare and then, using the powers that we have to lay and collect taxes and disburse those moneys, to provide for the general welfare of the people. 
That is what we are talking about. Whether we are talking about Pell Grant Programs or whether we are talking about heating energy assistance programs for the elderly and the poor, we are fulfilling our obligation as a caring and compassionate state to promote the general welfare and to use our taxing and spending powers outlined in the Constitution of the United States to provide for the general welfare of our people. 
So, no, this is not a program of a liberal welfare state. It is a program of a caring and compassionate and fair state, just as the Pell Grants Program is. These are good programs. We should not be robbing one that hits at the poorest, those with the lowest incomes of our people--70 percent of these families have less than $8,000 a year income--to use that to try to help other low-income people to get an education. Don't tell me there are not other sources of funds here. There are. 
I might submit that we now have this B-2 bomber we are building that cannot even sit out in the rain, $1 billion a copy, and now we have to build special hangars for them because they cannot sit outside. We can't forward deploy them. All this is coming out now. We are going to put money in that, but we are going to take money out of the heating energy assistance programs to help other poor people get an education? I am sorry, that doesn't quite compute for this Senator. 
So I am hopeful--and I know the Senator from Arizona means well. As I said, I support half of what he is talking about, in terms of getting the Pell grants up. I just think his sources of getting the money are just not good for this country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield for this colloquy, just yield for a question. Even taking the Senator's figures, if the real prices have dropped by a third, the fact is that since 1985 the LIHEAP Program has come down 50 percent. So we are spending half as much money today. Of course, in real terms it would be even less than that, if you adjusted for inflation. I am just talking about the actual dollars. It's $2.1 billion in 1985, it's $1 billion now. So, even if the cost--I ask the Senator to think about this and see if my reasoning is wrong here--even if the cost of energy has come down by a third, if in fact the amount of money we are putting in the program has come down by over a half, does that not compute out to the fact that there is less money going into the program today and that less money is there to meet the heating needs of those families who are getting the money?

So if other Senators have them, now is the time to come over, and perhaps if amendments are offered now and after the caucuses, after the 2:15 time, we could stack a bunch of votes at 5 o'clock. I know Senators like to do that, because they can schedule their time a little bit better. I hope any Senators who have amendments will come over now before we break for our party caucuses or come over at 2:15 and then we can stack the votes at 5 o'clock.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for his leadership on this plan and for outlining in great detail the various aspects of the bill that he just covered, in our efforts to craft a truly bipartisan bill to bring to the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, S. 1061, the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and related agencies for fiscal year 1998, is now before us. 
Again, I want to start by commending our chairman for his skill and his craftsmanship in putting this bill together. 
Senator Specter has ably balanced the many, often competing requests we have received--as he mentioned, over 700 different types of requests from Senators. It is always a very tough job, and I appreciate how closely he has worked with me and my staff in crafting a truly bipartisan plan. 
For example, the bill's broad support was reflected in its unanimous approval by the full Appropriations Committee. 
I am especially pleased that the bill provides significant increases in funding for key education programs. 
Senator Specter quite ably went over those. I will not repeat those again. I will just mention what Senator Specter had said in terms of the bill grants--the increase in the stipend from $2,700 to $3,000. This will help over 3.6 million low- and moderate-income students in colleges and institutions of higher learning this next year. This is the highest level of Pell grant support. 
The bill exceeds the support for education recommended by the bipartisan budget agreement by $164 million. It includes significant increases for special education and education technology and, in particular, funds to support teacher training. Computers in the classroom are of no value if teachers don't know how to use them effectively. 
The mark in the bill puts special emphasis on early intervention. The cornerstone, as we know, for educational success are the first years of a child's life. Recent research on the brain provides irrefutable proof about the dramatic development in children before the age of 3. So we must intensify our efforts to make sure that all children enter school ready to learn. We have begun to lay the foundation in this bill by increasing Head Start funding by $324 million, and we have doubled the set-aside for early Head Start which serves children up to the age of 3. 
This bill also provides an 11-percent increase in funding to $350 million for the early intervention program for infants and toddlers with disabilities served by part H of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. 
Again, Mr. President, as we know, it is vital for children without disabilities to have early educational services. We know that it is doubly vital for kids, infants, and toddlers with disabilities to have those early intervention programs before the age of 3. 
I am also very pleased that we are able to make a start--not a big one, but at least a start--on the Education Grant Infrastructure Program. I think we can all agree that the infrastructure needs of our school systems are truly staggering. Most estimates of nationwide school repair and construction costs exceed $100 billion. Again, clearly, school construction and repair will and should remain primarily a State and local responsibility. Nevertheless, I think there is a limited Federal role here, and it is one would that is connected to the longstanding Federal support for the education of disadvantaged children through the title I program. 
I am often asked the question, Mr. President, `Where is it indicated in the Constitution of the United States that education funding must come out of property taxes?' I have here a little pocket copy of the Constitution that I try to carry with me at all times. I find it a very good reference. A lot of times I hold it up, and ask people, `Where? Show me where in the Constitution of the United States, as amended, that it says that education in America is to be funded on the basis of property taxes.' 
You can read every word in the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights, all the amendments thereto, and you will not find one thing in the Constitution that says how education is to be funded. It doesn't say we have to pay for it through property taxes. But that is sort of the system that evolved in our country over the years. So what we have are these anomalies. 
I happen to maintain a residence, as many of my colleagues do, in suburban Virginia, in Fairfax County. To be sure, both of my daughters have gone to public schools in Fairfax County, and I can tell you the schools here are wonderful. They are great schools. That is 12 miles from where we are standing right now. 
Five blocks from here, in the District of Columbia, are some of the worst schools in our country. Why is it? Why the difference in 12 miles? Well, it is because in Fairfax County, you have a lot of high-income people who pay a lot of property taxes. And they have great schools. Yet, five blocks from the Capitol, you have very low income with very low property taxes, and no ability to fix up and repair their schools. This is true all over our country. 
I refer those who are interested to a book, of course, written by a good friend of mine, Jonathan Kozol, called `Savage Inequalities.' It is not a new book. It is at least 10 years old, I guess, by now. That problem is very clearly across America--what it means to be a child lucky enough to be born to moderate to well-to-do parents who live in an area where there are high property taxes and high property values. The schools are good. If you live in an inner city, or sometimes in Appalachia, or rural areas of America where you have low property taxes, you have bad schools. 
So homeowners who are living in poor school districts have to carry a much heavier tax burden to raise school construction funds. Where they have the worst schools, they need the most repairs. Yet, they have the least ability to do so because they have a low tax base. 
Homeowners who live in affluent districts, however, have it much easier. So the homeowners who live in the poor areas have a much harder burden to carry in repairing and constructing new schools. And so I have long felt it is, indeed, at least part of the responsibility of the Federal Government to equalize this, to equalize it somewhat. 
Now, in States we have acquisition formulas. In my State of Iowa, for example, yes, property taxes are local, but the State recognizes, as many other States have done, that it provides for a lot of inequalities. So the State has stepped in with equalization formulas to try to equalize funding for schools at least in regard to construction and repair for those who are in poor areas and those who are in rich areas, more affluent areas. But, again, we have anomalies existing throughout the country, and so I think the Federal Government could emulate a little bit of what the States have done and have some kind of equalization where we will provide funds for repair and construction of school facilities to those areas with the greatest needs and the fewest local resources. 
Now, again, I would not want this money to replace money that is already being provided by the States. We do not want to do that. We do not want to provide money to a low-income school district and the State will say, well, good, we are getting all those Federal dollars; now we don't have to do anything. 
Therefore, there must be an effort at equity by the States to continue to have their equalization programs. And I would envision that the rules developed by the Department would take that into account in providing this money that we have for school construction and repair. 
A major concern I have about the bill is our inability to more adequately address our health services and training needs while at the same time simultaneously providing generous increases for health research. 
Now, again, I will not go into it at length here. I have talked about it many times in the Chamber, and I will talk about it and keep talking about it until we do something about it. And that is the need to provide more money for biomedical research. 
As my friend, the chairman, said earlier, a few months ago the Senate went on record 99 to 0 to double NIH funding over the next 5 years. A few weeks after that, Senator Specter and I offered an amendment, very modest, to provide about a $1.1 billion increase out of our pot for increased funding for NIH. And as Senator Specter pointed out, that went down almost 2 to 1. We got 37 votes for it. 
So it was sort of the will of the Senate. It is our will to provide a doubling of funding for NIH over 5 years, but there is no money there to back it up. 
Now, there are some who say, well, we can take it out of our bill. If we did so, Mr. President, under the constraints of the Balanced Budget Act that we have adopted here, under the constraints of that balanced budget agreement, if we doubled funding for NIH out of the pot of money that we have, there would not be one single penny left for any other discretionary health program. 
What does that mean? There would be no Centers for Disease Control. We would have no money for that. We would have no community health centers in any States, no substance abuse programs, no family planning money, no mental health program money from the Federal Government. All of that would be wiped out. And we still would not have enough money to double NIH funding over 5 years. So here we have it, on the one hand, 99 Senators saying we want to double NIH funding, biomedical research funding over 5 years, but we don't have the money to do it--not within our bill we don't, unless those 99 Senators, or at least 51 of those Senators want to cut all of the funding for the Centers for Disease Control and wipe it out, cut out all Ryan White funding, cut out every one of our community health centers in America, and on and on and on. If we do that, we get close. We do not get the double, but we get close. 
Obviously, there are not going to be 51 Senators who will vote to cut out the community health centers in America or the Centers for Disease Control. That would be ridiculous. As I have said many times, we have to go outside the discretionary fund that we have for the National Institutes of Health. We have to provide a different source of funding--outside of our appropriations process. 
What I have advocated, along with our former colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield--we advocated it at least since 1991, 1992--is setting up a medical research trust fund that would be funded out of the premiums that we pay in for our health insurance coverage. 
Again, Mr. President, you and I and all the rest of us here and Americans throughout the country who have insurance programs, we pay in every year and our employer pays in, matches it. It varies how much is matched, but we pay in, both employers and employees pay in for health insurance to the tune of about $700-some billion a year. 
I always ask audiences when I talk about this, do you know how much of that money goes for health research, to find the causes and cures for things like diabetes and Alzheimer's and cancer and AIDS and Parkinson's disease and mental health? How much of that money that you put into your premiums goes to pay for medical research? 
The answer is zero. Not one single penny. No corporation in America would try to continue to move along without putting some money into research. And yet we sort of stagger along in this country every year putting more and more money into health insurance programs to pay for taking care of people with Alzheimer's or with cancer or with Parkinson's disease or with diabetes, et cetera, et cetera. We pay all that money in to take care of those illnesses once they occur, but not one penny is used to find the causes and cures. 
It does not seem to make sense. So what Senator Hatfield and I advocated for several years was that just one penny, just one penny out of every dollar that we put into our health insurance programs go to a trust fund. 
Think of it like this. We have a highway trust fund. Every time you buy a gallon of gas, some of that money goes into the highway trust fund. It cannot be used for anything else. It must be used for transportation purposes. We have an airport and airways trust fund. When I buy an airplane ticket, some of that goes into the airports and airways trust fund. So it is not new. Well, we have a Social Security trust fund, obviously, but we have a lot of different trust funds to meet what we have determined to be national priorities that otherwise could not get sufficient funding through the appropriations process. And the American people by and large have supported us. Most everyone I know supports the highway trust fund and airways trust fund. 
What they do not support is us using the money for something else. But they support us using that trust fund money for highways and for bridges and for airports and for airways because that is what the money was put in there for. And so we have proposed that we set up that trust fund. That one penny a year would provide us a little over a 50-percent increase in funding for NIH. That would get us a long way toward doubling that funding in 5 years. 
Now, Senator Hatfield is no longer in the Senate, but my cosponsor on the bill is now my colleague and our esteemed chairman, Senator Specter. We are both pushing very hard again to find another source of funding for biomedical research, and I believe the trust fund concept is the way to go. We have hundreds and hundreds of different entities throughout America supporting that concept. 
We had a vote in the Senate a few weeks ago on this concept of having this trust fund. I believe we got--we got over 51 votes, I know that, for it, but we needed 60 votes because of a point of order. So over 50 Senators have, indeed, voted at least in concept for setting up this type of a trust fund and funding it this way. I know I can speak for Senator Specter in saying we will continue our efforts to enlist the support of other Senators to set up this form of a trust fund. Otherwise, we are simply never going to have the kind of funding for biomedical research that we need. What we are going to do basically is to keep raising insurance premiums to pay for the illnesses that continue to plague us. But if we put the money into research and find the causes and cures--Mr. President, we all struggle around here trying to figure out what is the long-term solution to the Medicare problem: People living longer, fewer and fewer people paying into the Medicare trust fund. We know we have a problem. We have to do something about it. Every medical expert will tell you, if you want to solve the Medicare problem, find the causes and cures; it is early intervention of illnesses and diseases. 
If we, for example, could just delay, delay the onset of Alzheimer's by 5 years, we could have no problem in the Medicare trust fund--just delay it 5 years. That is not to mention actually finding the cure for Alzheimer's. That is not to mention osteoporosis or diabetes that so plagues our culture, or hearing loss or eye loss. All the things that affect us in our older age are now coming back and costing Medicare more and more money because people are living longer. 
These are the things we can do to make sure the Medicare trust fund is solvent in the future, but only if we put adequate money into biomedical research. 
I said I was not going to talk about it, but once I got on a roll I could not stop myself because I feel so strongly that we really are shortchanging ourselves when we are not putting the money into medical research. 
Finally, Mr. President, in our report we have tried to focus the Department of Health and Human Services on the issue of fraud and abuse in Medicare. Speaking of Medicare, a recent inspector general's report found that improper Medicare billing losses could be as high as 17 percent of last year's $194 billion Medicare budget--17 percent. 
Now, again, let me digress here a little bit, Mr. President. A few years ago, when I held the position that Senator Specter now holds as chairman of this subcommittee, I asked for a study to be done on losses in Medicare due to waste, fraud, and abuse. Well, we did the study. It came back and said it was as high as maybe 10 to 14 percent. Well, some of those in the system challenged those findings. They said, well, your survey wasn't big enough. You only did one area of the country. You did not sample enough items. And so it was a skewed kind of study--the losses surely are not that big. 
Well, I said, OK, fair enough criticism. So then, under the leadership of Senator Specter, when we changed hands in the Senate, we went back and we asked them to do another study, nationwide. Several thousand were sampled. Every region was sampled. Guess what happened. The first study came up short. It was not 10 to 14 percent. It was as high as 17 percent of Medicare payments were going out for waste and abuse. 
Well, we must make this a priority and address this serious problem. We have in this bill; we have focused on it. Senator Specter has taken the lead. 
Let me sum up once again by complimenting our chairman, Senator Specter, and his staff and my staff for their work in putting together this legislation. I look forward to a smooth process, hopefully, as Senator Specter said, that will enable us to be done by tomorrow. 
And I would again just close by referring, as I did earlier, to the Constitution of the United States. Time and again I have had people question why we do what we are doing here in this subcommittee--in health and in human services and in education, labor, all of the various things that we cover here. The National Institutes of Health, what business is that of the Congress? Why are you getting involved in all those things? 
Well, you know, it is interesting, Mr. President, that twice in the Constitution of the United States there is mention made of the general welfare of the people of this country--first in the preamble when it says, `We the people of the United States,' and it lays out why we are developing the Constitution, `in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare'--promote the general welfare--`and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity * * *' Right there in the preamble it says we are doing this because we want to promote the general welfare of the people of this country. 
Well, how do you do that? Article I of the Constitution, which lays out the structure of Congress and our responsibility, section 8 of article I lays out what we are supposed to do here, lays out our responsibilities. 
Congress shall have the power to do all kinds of things--borrow money, regulate commerce, coin money, establish post offices, declare a war, et cetera, et cetera. But, in the first paragraph it says:  
The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imports and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States. * * * 
Interesting, they put the common defense and the general welfare together. That is our responsibility--article I, section 8. What we are supposed to do in providing for that general welfare obviously changes with times and circumstances. What was providing for the general welfare in the last century certainly is not what we deem to be providing for the general welfare in this century, and certainly it will change in the future. But, nonetheless, I believe that the bill before us meets our constitutional requirement in two ways: First, by promoting the general welfare, and second, by providing for the general welfare through the appropriations process. So, that is our constitutional obligation and I believe that we have done our level best, in a bipartisan manner, to meet that requirement of article I, section 8 of the Constitution. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. During previous consideration of the appropriations bill on agriculture I offered an amendment, along with Senator Chafee and others to protect America's kids and crack down on illegal tobacco sales. We would do it by providing full funding for the FDA's youth tobacco use prevention initiative. 
That amendment was debated and received a strong bipartisan vote of 48 Senators, but some of my colleagues expressed concerns about certain aspects of the amendment. Those concerns seemed to focus primarily on the nature of the offset and on whether the FDA initiative should be funded before the outcome of the pending tobacco settlement is known. I have, in good faith, modified my amendment in two important respects that I believe fully address both concerns. 
First, this amendment contains an entirely different offset. It would reduce spending by the USDA Commodity Credit Corporation on automated data processing and information technology equipment during fiscal year 1998 by $29.1 million, just enough to allow full funding for the FDA initiative. 
Second, to clear up any uncertainty about the relationship of the FDA initiative to the pending tobacco settlement, this amendment contains a sunset provision that would become effective if funding for FDA youth tobacco use prevention activities becomes available as a result of the tobacco settlement. 
I want to make it clear there is nothing in my amendment having to do with tobacco marketing assessments or tobacco farmers or anything that could remotely be called a revenue measure that could conceivably interest the Ways and Means Committee of the House. 
I also add the amendment includes language suggested by Senator Byrd that would have the FDA encourage States to coordinate their enforcement either under the youth tobacco use prevention initiative with enforcement of laws against underage drinking. I want to commend and thank Senator Byrd for that addition. As I said in the debate earlier, the two go hand in glove. You find kids using illegal tobacco, you find them illegally buying alcohol at the same time more often than not. 
With that background, Mr. President, I hope we can zero in on what this is all about. Plain and simple--this amendment is about protecting America's kids from killer tobacco. With a death toll of more than 400,000 a year, smoking kills more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, motor vehicles, fires, homicides, illicit drugs, and suicide combined. 
This is an epidemic, and we know where it starts. It starts with kids. It starts with illegal underage smoking. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers began at or before age 18. 
Put this in perspective: The Senate last took up this debate 40 days ago with my previous amendment. Since that time, another 120,000 young Americans got hooked on tobacco and began smoking; 40,000 of those will die because of it. That is the toll just in the past 7 weeks. At current rates, 5 million American kids under age 18 who are alive today will be killed by smoking-related disease. And teenage smoking rates are still climbing. 
Smoking among high school seniors is at a 17-year high. The statistics on smoking among young women and girls is just shocking. Smoking among 8th grade girls jumped over 60 percent from 1991 to 1996, with rates of smoking now higher for 8th and 10th grade girls than for boys. 
Now, briefly reviewing what this amendment will fund at FDA. FDA needs $34 million to carry out enforcement of rules setting a minimum age of 18 for tobacco purchases and requiring photo ID checks. In its initiative, FDA is signing contracts with State and local jurisdictions for cooperation in carrying out enforcement of these rules. 
The FDA initiative also includes funding to provide information to retailers and the public about the rules to help retailers comply with the rules and not sell tobacco to kids. This excerpt from an FDA brochure shows why it is necessary to have a photo ID check. 
FDA has $4.9 million in fiscal year 1997 that it is using to fund contracts with 10 States. The $34 million will allow FDA to provide money to all 50 States to help them prevent youth tobacco use. This is not some big new bureaucratic program. The bulk of the money goes to the States and local jurisdictions. 
Of the $34 million, $24 million will go to enforcement and evaluation, and $10 million will be used to educate retailers and the public about the rules so retailers can comply. The point of the rules is not to punish anyone, it is to protect kids. I add that these photo ID check and minimum age rules were fully upheld by the Federal district court in Greensboro, NC. 
This funding request is part of the President's budget request for the Food and Drug Administration. I have a letter from Vice President Gore expressing the administration's strong support for my amendment. I ask unanimous consent the letter, dated August 28, 1997, from the Office of the Vice President, be printed at this point in the Record.

Mr. HARKIN. Keep in mind the $34 million FDA needs is just a drop in the bucket compared to the $50 billion in annual smoking-related medical costs in our Nation. 
As I close, I want to bring the discussion back to the central issue. That is, whether we will stand up to big tobacco and stand up for America's kids. If we cannot even take this modest step, $29.1 million, what kind of message does that send? 
We talk a lot around here about protecting kids. Well, it is time to quit talking and do something about it. Let's do what is right for our kids, right for law enforcement, right for the future. Let's pass this amendment and give our kids what they deserve--better health and a brighter future. 
Again, I point out that this amendment is in full compliance with the rules. This Senator is offering the amendment parliamentarily to the House-passed bill as it came over here under the unanimous-consent agreement reached with the majority leader prior to the Senate going out in early August.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the arguments made by my friend, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee. However, let me point out that, first of all, no point of order lies against my amendment. Therefore, it is in full compliance with the rules of the Senate. I know of no one who would say that something ought to be defeated because it is in compliance with the rules. 
I, through my staff, consulted the Parliamentarian's office about researching any precedents for the procedural situation of my amendment on the bill. My staff was told it would be virtually impossible to research precedence because offering an amendment in this posture is clearly within the rules and would not be identified as having set a precedent. By the same token, I believe that adopting my amendment would not set any precedent whatsoever. We are simply using the rules. 
Now, the fact is that, as the chairman said, most of the time bills are passed in the House and they come over and we substitute, in the beginning, before the process, the House-passed bill, and therefore we work on one bill, and when third reading is made, that is the end of it. But in this case, we passed the bill prior to the House passing it. The rules clearly allow that any bill that comes over from the House taken up by the Senate is amendable. That is all this Senator is doing. It sets no precedent whatsoever. 
Second, I point out that I did not need a unanimous-consent agreement to offer my amendment. I could have done it without any unanimous consent agreement whatsoever. The only reason the unanimous consent was entered into is I was accommodating to the majority leader that night, who wanted to get the bill done. I want to make it clear that I didn't need unanimous consent to offer this amendment. 
Third, there was a lot of confusion at the time that I offered this amendment that, by offering it, it would go to the House, it would be blue-slipped by the House, would go to the House Ways and Means Committee, all of which I thought at the time was spurious. But I think some Members were swayed by that. Even in light of that, this amendment got 48 votes. I now point out that no such argument can be held on this, because this will not go back to the House. It will go right to conference. Therefore, it cannot be blue-slipped. It will not go to the Ways and Means Committee in the House. So, therefore, there was some confusion about that at the time. 
Next, there was a feeling by some that the offsets I had were not appropriate. So we changed the offsets, as I said in my initial opening comments, to accommodate certain Senators who didn't feel I had the right offsets. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman and the ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding abusive and exploitative child labor. 
According to the International Labor Organization [ILO], some 250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 are working in developing countries and the number is on the rise. I strongly believe that access to primary education reduces the incidence of child labor around the world. It is my understanding that the Asia Foundation supports efforts to improve access to primary education. 
I would like to see some language in the conference report urging the Asia Foundation to continue its work in Pakistan. I know that our staffs' have conferred, and that you and the ranking member share my concern about abusive and exploitative child labor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President it is my great pleasure to offer this sense of the Senate to recognize and commend John H.R. Berg for 50 years of service to the U.S. Government on behalf of myself and Senator Warner. Mr. Berg's employment with the U.S. Government began at age 15 working for the U.S. Army in 1946. From July 1947 to February 1949 he worked with the American Graves Registration Command in Paris. 
In July 1949, Mr. Berg began his employment with the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Currently, he is the chief of the visitors and travel unit in our Embassy in Paris. Currently, he is the chief of the visitors and travel unit in our Embassy in Paris. So far this year, as chief of the Embassy's travel and visitors office, Mr. Berg and his staff of three have supported over 10,700 official visitors, 500 conferences, and over 15,000 official and unofficial reservations. The position entails coordinating all travel, transportation, housing control rooms and airport formalities for visits and conferences. Mr. Berg's dedication, efficiency, and wide range of useful host government and private sector contacts have been invaluable to the Embassy and the U.S. Government. His support efforts, personal interest, and ability to accomplish the impossible have become legend in the Foreign Service and to those of us who know his work personally. 
I know I speak for those who have worked with Mr. Berg when I say that he has devoted his life to providing dedicated, faithful, and loyal service to the U.S. Government. He willingly and cheerfully works long hours--evenings, weekends and holidays--to ensure that our visits are handled in the most skillful and efficient manner possible. And he has received five Department of State Meritorious Honor Awards for his outstanding work. 
A little known fact about John Berg was that he was a stateless person at the beginning of his service to the U.S. Government. He was born in Germany in 1930, but lost his German citizenship in 1943 due to Nazi Jewish persecution. After his father was deported to Auschwitz, he and his mother with a small group of brave Jews, hid in Berlin from the Gestapo until the end of the war. The heroism they exhibited and the dangers they faced are documented in the book, `The Last Jews of Berlin,' by Leonard Gross. His father died in the concentration camp. And after World War II, John Berg moved to France where he began working for the American Government, and has now completed 50 years of service to the U.S. Government. For all his adult life, John Berg's most fervent desire was to become a U.S. citizen. That goal was realized, and he was sworn in as an American citizen in 1981. 
Mr. President I cannot think of a better role model for those in the public sector. Therefore, I believe that John Berg deserves the absolute highest praise from the President and the Congress for his 50 years of dedicated service to the U.S. Government.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I want to commend the chairman, Senator Cochran, and the ranking Democratic member, Senator Bumpers, for their efforts in putting together this Agriculture appropriations measure. They have put a lot of work into crafting a bill that stays within the subcommittee's allocation while seeking to satisfy many competing demands for funding. I have appreciated very much working with them and with their staffs in the subcommittee on this bill.

Mr. HARKIN. Overall, I believe it is an excellent bill and one I wholeheartedly support. However, there is in this bill, I believe, a glaring shortfall relating to the level of funding provided for the Food and Drug Administration's enforcement and outreach efforts to prevent smoking by America's children. 
The budget request for FDA includes $34 million for this purpose, but the reported bill provides only $4.9 million. The amendment that Senator Chafee and I will be offering will provide FDA the full $34 million it needs to implement a nationwide effort in all 50 States to help our kids avoid the deadly trap of tobacco. The needed funding is truly a drop in the bucket compared to the $50 billion or more our Nation spends each year on medical costs attributable to smoking. 
Everyone, including even the tobacco companies, claims to be against underage smoking. But those assertions are just empty words if we fail to provide the necessary resources to carry out the FDA rules specifically designed to prevent sales of tobacco to children. 
With this amendment, the rubber really meets the road. It presents this body with a clear choice whether we are really serious about attacking underage smoking. 
In discussing our amendment, I hope that Members of the Senate will not lose sight of what is really at stake. Disease, suffering, and death caused by smoking and nicotine addiction is clearly at horrendous proportions in our Nation. With a death toll of more than 400,000 each year, smoking kills more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, motor vehicles, fires, homicides, illicit drugs and suicide all combined. 
Here is a chart, Mr. President, that shows that in graphic detail: The comparative causes of annual deaths in the United States. Here we see 30,000 in AIDS deaths, 105,000 from alcohol, and those from homicides, illicit drugs, suicides. Here is smoking, 418,000 per year. There are more deaths caused by smoking than all of the rest put together. 
This is truly an epidemic, an epidemic that begins with underage smoking. Mr. President, 4.5 million kids aged 12 to 17 are smokers today. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers began at or before the age of 18. The average youth smoker begins at age 13 and becomes a daily smoker by the age of 14 1/2 . Thousands of our kids are drawn into smoking every day. It is no longer even an arguable point that they have been targeted for recruitment into a deadly habit. Today, just like every day, 3,000 young Americans will begin smoking and 1,000 of them will die from it. At current rates, 5 million American kids under 18 who are alive today will be killed by smoking-related disease. 
The upward trend in teenage smoking is even more frightening. Smoking among high school seniors is at a 17-year high. Mr. President, again, here is a graph that shows it in detail. The smoking rates among high school seniors are at a 17-year high. These are the trends of cigarette smoking among high school seniors, 12th grade, 1980 to 1996. Look what has been happening since about 1991, 1992. This graph is going off the charts--a 17-year high. 
The statistics on smoking among young women and girls are just as shocking. Smoking among eighth grade girls--yes, I said that correctly, eighth grade girls--jumped over 60 percent from 1991 to 1996, with rates of smoking now higher for 8th- and 10th-grade girls than for boys. And smoking among black children of this age nearly doubled during this time period. 
Our children are our future, as we all know. But thanks to smoking, millions of American kids will not be leading long and fulfilling lives. Instead, they will be filling hospital beds and coffins long before their time. 
The epidemic of teenage smoking is a crisis that is beyond partisanship. Responding to it should lift us up above everyday politics. That is why I am so proud to have the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, as a cosponsor of this bipartisan amendment. 
Unquestionably, Mr. President, a key factor in youth smoking is that it is far too easy for kids to buy tobacco. Not only is it far too easy, but we now know that the tobacco companies, through the use of slick advertising, through the use of Joe Camel, through the use of the Marlboro Man and Virginia Slims and all of the fancy advertising that they have done, have targeted kids with Marlboro gear, the Camel coupons you can redeem for Camel gear and for beach wear and radios and cassette players, jackets and all the things that teenagers like to accumulate. We know that the tobacco companies have targeted teenagers for smoking with their advertising. 
When you combine that targeting of the advertising with the easy access for kids to buy tobacco, that is why you have teenage smoking at a 17-year high. I believe that this recent rise is due to the tremendous amount of advertising targeted to our youth and the ease with which youth can buy tobacco. 
A review of numerous studies has shown that children and adolescents were able to buy tobacco products successfully 67 percent of the times that they tried. Over 60 percent of kids who smoke say they buy their own. One study showed that over 75 percent of underage high school students who had bought cigarettes in a store or a gas station in the past 30 days said they were not asked to show proof of age. 
It has been demonstrated that enforcement of youth access laws can successfully reduce tobacco sales to minors and reduce youth smoking rates. That just makes good common sense and that is exactly the basis on which the FDA acted. 
Let me describe the FDA initiative that our amendment funds. In August of 1996, FDA issued rules specifically designed to reduce the number of kids who start smoking. The most important of the rules set a national legal age of 18 for the purchase of tobacco products and require retailers to check photo ID's of consumers seeking to purchase tobacco who appear to be younger than 27 years of age. Those rules went into effect in February of this year. 
Now, some might say, is this necessary that we have this photo ID rule with a cutoff of 27 years of age? Well, I ask you, Mr. President, and other Senators to look at this picture. Which one is age 16? Is it Melissa here on the left or is it Amy here on your right, both coming up to the counter to buy cigarettes? Can you tell which one is 16? If they walked into a store, would the clerk know which one was under age 18? Well, to eliminate the guesswork, FDA requires retailers to card anyone, to have proof of ID for anyone who appears under 27. In case you are wondering, Melissa here is 16 and Amy here is 25. That is the problem we have. And that is why FDA acted. 
The public overwhelmingly supports putting a stop to illegal sales of tobacco to minors. A new poll shows that 92 percent of Americans agree that young people should be required to show a photo ID to buy tobacco products. Eighty-seven percent agree with the FDA rule setting a national minimum age of 18 for buying tobacco mandating ID checks of all tobacco purchasers appearing to be under the age of 27. 
FDA needs $34 million for enforcement and outreach that will help all 50 States carry out the minimum age and photo ID rules. There is no question that the States need help in the area of enforcement. Despite the fact that it is against the law in all 50 States to sell cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to minors, our young people purchase an estimated $1.26 billion--billion--worth of tobacco each year. The FDA initiative directly addresses these enforcement problems. It will keep tobacco out of the hands of children. 
Of the $34 million, $24 million will go to enforcement and evaluation, with the vast majority of that going out to the States through contracts. 
And $10 million of the $34 million will go to outreach efforts for educating retailers and the public about complying with the rules. 
The point of the initiative is to prevent our kids from buying tobacco illegally and to help our small businesses and our retailers to come into compliance with the law. The FDA initiative is not a new, big Federal regulatory program. The bulk of the money will go directly to support State and local efforts. Without this funding, the States will not have the resources they need for their efforts against illegal tobacco sales to kids. By the end of fiscal year 1997, FDA expects to have contracted with the first 10 States. The increased funding will allow a comprehensive national enforcement effort with contracts in all 50 States. 
Now, Mr. President, it is true that the tobacco industry has challenged FDA's tobacco regulation in court. Well, they went to court. They had their day in court. However, the authority of FDA to carry out the minimum age and photo ID rules was fully upheld in April by the Federal district court in Greensboro, NC. The $34 million request in FDA's budget, which our amendment would provide, would be used for activities that the Greensboro Federal court gave the green light to. That decision did not reduce the need for fully funding the FDA initiative.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the letter from Secretary Shalala makes clear, the full $34 million is needed to carry out the minimum age and photo ID rules. She states: 
Without these funds, FDA will not have the credible national enforcement program required to reduce significantly young people's access to tobacco. 
Again, the pending litigation has not reduced FDA's need for or its ability to utilize the $34 million. So our amendment provides the full funding for FDA to work with the States to carry out the minimum age and photo ID rules. 
Now, where do we get the money? We offset the full cost of the FDA youth smoking initiative by increasing the tobacco marketing assessment from the current 1 percent of the national price support level to 2.1 percent for the 1998 crop of flue-cured tobacco and for the 1997 crop of burley and other tobacco. The increase will apply to assessments expected to be collected in fiscal year 1998. That is because flue-cured tobacco is marketed in the summer, while burley and others are marketed almost entirely after October 1. 
The full cost of the increase would be borne by purchasers of tobacco, that is, the tobacco companies. In addition, for the tobacco covered by the amendment, half of the current 1 percent assessment now paid by producers would be shifted to purchasers, thus providing assessment relief to tobacco farmers. 
We have heard concerns expressed clearly and forcefully on the floor of the Senate about the consequences for our tobacco farmers of changes in tobacco policies. I am very sympathetic to the situation of any farmer, including tobacco farmers. They are just trying to make a living. I know how hard farmers work and what a struggle it is for them to make a living. So I am concerned, also, about the impacts on tobacco-farming families. 
For that reason, this amendment is crafted to relieve tobacco farmers of their obligation to pay a part of the marketing assessment on the tobacco covered by the amendment. Currently, the producer of domestic tobacco--that is the farmer --pays half of the assessment. That is one-half of 1 percent of the support price, with the purchaser paying the other one-half of 1 percent. What our amendment says is that the tobacco companies will pay the whole assessment, including the increase. So this amendment provides relief for our tobacco farmers because it will relieve them of the burden they have now of paying that one-half of 1 percent of the assessment. I might add, parenthetically, Mr. President, I believe if tobacco companies have to pay the full 2.1 percent, then they are going to pass costs along to the consumers--that is, those who smoke tobacco. On the one hand, we relieve the tobacco farmers of this burden and we have made those who use tobacco pay more. 
As a nation, we are in solid agreement that use of tobacco by minors must be reduced--or at least we say we are. When that happens, it also means that we eventually will have fewer adults smoking. So it is our national policy that there will be less of a market in this country for tobacco. Tobacco farmers need to recognize that change is coming. But I also know that when markets for agricultural commodities change, it is often the farmers who bear the brunt of that change. It is no different for tobacco than for corn or soybeans or hogs or wheat or cotton or any other commodity. I hope that we will find more ways to help tobacco farmers deal with this change. In the meantime, I am suggesting that at least we should require that tobacco companies pay the marketing assessment. It will ease the burden on tobacco farmers, who clearly are facing uncertainty. 
Mr. President, we simply cannot continue to postpone addressing the monumental costs to society of tobacco use on the grounds that doing so may have some negative impact on farmers. There are too many lives at stake--lives of people who are children today. 
Again, let me make it clear that this amendment does not give 
FDA any additional jurisdiction over tobacco farmers. It does not create any new authority for FDA to regulate tobacco farmers or become involved in the marketing by farmers of tobacco. The offset in the amendment involving an increase in the assessment involves only the Department of Agriculture, not the FDA. 
Now, Mr. President, there is some misinformation floating around to the effect that we do not need this FDA funding because of the proposed tobacco settlement that is now under review by the Congress and the administration. Well, Mr. President, this FDA initiative against youth smoking was begun long before the tobacco settlement talks even started. The minimum age and photo ID check rules are in place and are working. But there is a pressing need for more funding to allow all 50 States to carry out enforcement efforts aimed at preventing youth smoking. There plainly is no good reason for delaying full implementation of the FDA initiative. We should not await the uncertain fate of the tobacco settlement before putting the necessary resources into FDA's enforcement and outreach efforts to stop underage smoking. As a nation, we cannot afford to continue losing our kids to tobacco at the horrendous rates that we are now experiencing. So the proposed tobacco settlement and this FDA initiative are totally separate matters--there should be no confusion on this point--and there is no inconsistency between them either. 
Mr. President, I have here a letter from 33 attorneys general involved in the settlement activities, who write in support of full funding for the FDA initiative, what our amendment here provides. The 33 attorneys general who are involved in the settlement say they support full funding of this initiative. They would not have signed the letter if there were any reason to delay funding the FDA efforts pending possible legislation to carry out the settlement.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our amendment would in no way prejudice or in any way affect the outcome of any legislation designed to implement the settlement. Mr. President, I also have two additional letters here. One is from Secretary Shalala and one is from Michael Moore, the Mississippi attorney general who has led the attorneys general in the tobacco settlement negotiations. As you know, Mississippi already reached a settlement with the tobacco companies. Michael Moore led these efforts. I just want to read an excerpt from his letter dated July 21, 1997: 
Dear Senator Harkin: 
I am writing to express my strong support for your amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill to provide full funding for the Food and Drug Administration's initiative to protect kids from tobacco. This is a critical program that must be supported without delay. 
Attorney General Moore of Mississippi goes on to say: 
There has been some confusion regarding your amendment and whether it would interfere or conflict with the proposed settlement with the tobacco industry. Some Members of Congress have also stated that they believe funding FDA's tobacco program is unnecessary because money will be forthcoming from a settlement. No one is more anxious than I to have Congress promptly address the settlement; but let me be very clear: 
Again, I am reading from Attorney General Moore's letter. passage of your amendment is critical because we can't be certain that the tobacco settlement will be passed or implemented in time to provide the needed funds for the upcoming fiscal year. Congress should not jeopardize the current FDA tobacco initiative unless we are assured of the immediate passage of legislation regarding the settlement. 
Immediate full funding for the FDA rule is appropriate because the agency's initiative is already in place and has been implemented. 
Secretary Shalala, in her letter dated July 22, says: 
Let me emphasize that the funding requested by the administration is separate from any funds that might be available sometime in the future as a result of any settlement. Further, I do not believe it would prejudice or predetermine in any way future congressional action regarding the settlement. 
I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary Shalala and the one from Attorney General Mike Moore of Mississippi be printed at this point in the Record.

Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, both letters make it clear that the tobacco settlement does not obviate the need for the FDA funding that we provide in our amendment and that providing the funding would not interfere with the settlement. 
In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Byrd for his excellent addition to our amendment. Senator Byrd has been the leader in the Senate in focusing, also, on the horrendous problem of youth drinking and the need to clamp down on young people buying alcohol. Senator Byrd's addition requires that States be encouraged to coordinate their enforcement of the tobacco ID check with enforcement of laws that prohibit underage drinking. 
Mr. President, this is a significant improvement to our original proposal. I commend my distinguished senior colleague from West Virginia for providing this language. As I said to Senator Byrd, if we tighten down on these ID checks, if we provide the funding so that when Melissa--Melissa is 16 and she looks older than Amy who is age 25--goes in to buy tobacco we will also attack underage drinking. A lot of times they may be buying beer or wine along with tobacco. As long as an ID check is made, it will stop underage drinking as well as smoking. So I agree with Senator Byrd that the States should coordinate their enforcement of tobacco ID checks with enforcement of laws that prohibit underage drinking. 
Mr. President, again, I have an amendment here that incorporates that language from Senator Byrd. I thank my colleague, Senator Chafee, for his cosponsorship. 
Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. HARKIN. I just wanted to thank the Senator from West Virginia for his addition to this amendment. The Senator from West Virginia, as I mentioned earlier, is the leading voice in this Chamber about the dangers of alcohol and alcohol addiction, especially drinking under age. It has become, like tobacco, the scourge of our Nation, especially, as the Senator said, beer drinking among teenagers in college, and that is just a gateway to harder alcohol and other drugs. 
The Senator from West Virginia has done us a great service because most of the data that we have seen indicate that the teenagers who illegally buy tobacco also illegally buy alcohol. 
Sometimes we tend to get blinders on around here; we don't see other things, and I would admit freely and openly that I had been focusing on the teenage smoking and had not thought about the other aspects of the teenager who walks in to buy the tobacco. And you can bet your bottom dollar, I say to my friend from West Virginia, that if this girl here--as I said earlier, which one of these is underage--you really cannot tell--Melissa or Amy. This one looks the youngest. She has a pair of overalls on. This one looks older. But it turns out this one is 16 and this one is 25. 
And you bet your bottom dollar, I ask the Senator from West Virginia, if this one, who is 16, walks in and is successful in buying cigarettes, then the next thing might be, well, as long as she got by with that, how about a six-pack of beer, too.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I say to my friend from Mississippi that the amendment I offered is an entirely separate matter the proposed tobacco settlement that is being worked out with the attorneys general and the tobacco companies. In fact, I submitted for the Record earlier a copy of a letter from 33 attorneys general involved in the tobacco settlement supporting full funding for FDA's tobacco initiative. I have also a letter here from Michael Moore, who is the attorney general of the State of Mississippi who is the lead attorney general in the negotiations. He stated here, `I would like to express my strong support for your amendment.' Dated July 21. That would be 2 days ago. 
And he said, `There has been some confusion regarding your amendment and whether it would interfere or conflict with the proposed settlement with the tobacco industry.' He went on to say that he supported it. 
So this has nothing to do with the proposed tobacco settlement whatsoever. What this has to do with is the part of the proposed FDA rule that was upheld by the court in Greensboro, NC. The court upheld the authority of FDA to regulate tobacco sales to minors. The FDA promulgated the rule. It was upheld by the courts. 
Now, the administration has requested $34 million to implement the rule. It needs this amount to carry out the rules upheld by the court. However, in the Agriculture appropriations bill there is only $4.9 million to implement it. So we cannot reach out to all 50 States to get this rule implemented to cut down on sales of tobacco to young people. And due to the involvement, I might say the good involvement, of the Senator from West Virginia, a provision was added to our amendment that says that in carrying out the responsibilities under the Food and Drug Administration initiative, States are encouraged to coordinate enforcement efforts with the enforcement of laws that prohibit under-age drinking. That is, I might add, a very worthwhile addition to this amendment. So I hope Senators are not confused. This has nothing to do with the tobacco settlement whatsoever. This has everything to do with whether or not we are going to have enforcement of the FDA rule to prevent sales of tobacco to kids. 
I would also point out there is some talk that somehow this FDA initiative is duplicative of the SAMHSA regulations. I am informed that it is not. This is because SAMHSA is not an enforcement program but FDA is. SAMHSA provides no incentives for retailers to stop illegal sales to kids. FDA will educate retailers about their responsibility and penalize retailers if they repeatedly sell to kids. And so SAMHSA is a lot different than FDA's tobacco initiative. 
Now, why does the FDA need the full $34 million? Well, basically, the Court provided FDA with full authority to regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and with full authority to continue implementing provisions of the FDA initiative that sets a minimum age of 18 for buying tobacco and requires retailers to check the photo ID of consumers seeking to purchase tobacco. 
Given that there are more than a half a million retailers in this country, it will be a big task to educate retailers about their responsibilities. Funds are also needed to conduct periodic compliance checks. So the $34 million is not that much money given the task at hand. The Court did strike down parts of the FDA rule, 
but resources are needed to enforce the minimum age and ID check rules that were fully upheld by the Court. 
Mr. President, $34 million is a very small investment when you realize that tobacco use drains more than $50 billion from our health care system each year. So this is a very small amount of money. 
Now, Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Might I inquire of the Chair, what is the business before the Senate? I make a parliamentary inquiry.

Mr. HARKIN. Well, Mr. President, I think that we are all very clear on this. Now, I had in good faith with the Senator from North Carolina made an agreement earlier that I would be permitted the yeas and nays on my amendment, which required unanimous consent at that point, that the Senator would then be allowed to modify his amendment, which he did, and then we asked for the yeas and nays on the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina. 
We could then have a vote on his amendment and then have a vote on my underlying amendment--in other words, a vote first on the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina. If that prevailed, well, that would be the end of it. If it went down, then there would be an up-or-down vote on my amendment. And the Senator can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that was the agreement and we shook hands on it.

Mr. HARKIN. If I may respond again to the Senator, I think there is a bit of confusion here. It is my understanding that the FDA rule does not impose a mandate on States. It imposes an obligation on retailers who sell tobacco or tobacco products not to sell them to anyone under the age of 18. In fact, the rule says that anyone under the age of 27 must provide a valid photo ID to prove their age is over the age of 18. The money that we are seeking here is to go out to the States and local communities to help them, and to help retailers, enforce and comply with the FDA rule. 
The FDA rule does not apply to a State. It applies to retailers, and not to a State.

We are seeking, with this amount of money, $34 million, a way of implementing the rule through the use of State and local governments to help enforce this rule. But there is no mandate that they have to do so; absolutely none whatsoever.

Mr. HARKIN. I respond to the Senator this way, and we had this discussion earlier. The Synar regulation of SAMHSA is not an enforcement program. FDA is. SAMHSA provides no incentives for retailers to stop illegal sales to kids. Through its tobacco initiative, FDA will educate retailers about their responsibility, and can assess penalties and penalize retailers if they repeatedly sell to kids. SAMHSA does not provide enforcement power or enforcement money.

Mr. HARKIN. But here is the catch. The tobacco industry was successful in pulling the teeth from this provision. Synar has no teeth because there are no hard targets. It is discretionary whether any State will lose its block grant. That is why SAMHSA is not an enforcement program, no one is going to lose their block grants, because there are no teeth in the targets. If States miss their targets, they are not going to lose their block grants. To my knowledge, no State has.

Mr. HARKIN. I would reply to the Senator from Kentucky again in this way. SAMHSA does in fact provide that States should or must enforce this and reduce smoking by passing laws that would do that, to take action to do that. However, there are absolutely no teeth at all in this SAMHSA provision because, if States don't do it, there are essentially no effective penalties that apply.

Mr. HARKIN. The teeth have been pulled out of SAMHSA. But nonetheless, I say to the Senator from Kentucky, that SAMHSA applies to the States. The States do their thing. What the FDA initiative goes to are the retailers. The FDA rule goes directly to retailers. And what this money is used for is to go out and contract with State and local jurisdictions to enforce the rules to prevent teen smoking and to help retailers understand what they have to do. And the FDA can absolutely set up penalties for retailers who do not comply, who are repeat offenders in selling tobacco to underage kids. That is not the case under the SAMHSA rules. I am sorry.

<DOCNO>105-harkin-ia-37-19970723</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, let's be clear what we are talking about when we are talking about SAMHSA. SAMHSA and the States can pass a law and they can deal with retailers. But there are no hard targets in SAMHSA to say: Here is what you have to do or you will certainly lose your block grant. The State can pass all kinds of laws but, if the State laws don't meet a target, then SAMHSA has no way of going to the State and saying, `Look, you didn't meet the requirements of the law and therefore we will take away your mental health and substance abuse block grants.' 
If there were, in the Synar amendment, a provision that said that, if a State, for example, cannot show that by year one they have taken this step and this step and this step, and that they have met the target--if in that case they then would lose their block grants, I would then agree with the Senator from Kentucky. 
That is not the case in the Synar amendment. It is a lot of nice words, but it doesn't really get to the heart of it, because there are no effective penalties, there is no real trigger, there is no hard target that, if a State doesn't do something, they then will lose their block grant. 
On the other hand, the proposed FDA rule upheld by the courts goes to the retailers, and FDA can--not must--but can contract with States and contract with local jurisdictions for enforcement of the FDA rules. FDA will also provide information, resources, support and help through outreach. A lot of times the small businesses don't really know what they have to do, and outreach can help them carry out this rule requiring the photo ID under age 27. 
So I don't want to get this FDA initiative confused with SAMHSA at all. This is something entirely different. I don't know if the Senator from Alaska wanted me to yield for a question.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I was saying earlier before I yielded to the Senator from Arkansas, I was talking about the situation that we had agreed to, that I thought I agreed to. I might just also say that the Helms amendment provides no funds to reduce tobacco smoking in any way. It creates a 3-cent tax on each gallon of ethanol. It puts it in a trust fund to be used for programs within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, but it doesn't allow the money to be spent unless funding is included in some appropriations bill. So it really doesn't provide an alternative source of funding. It just sets up a trust fund that you take money out of ethanol and put in there. But it really doesn't do anything. 
As I understood it, I had agreed with the Senator from North Carolina that I would not object to a unanimous consent request to have the yeas and nays on my amendment, which was required at that point in time; then he would modify his amendment; and then we would have the yeas and nays on his amendment; and if we could have an up-or-down vote on his amendment, which I thought was fair, and if we could have an up-or-down vote on my amendment, which I thought would be fair. 
Now I understand that that may not be the case; that now there may be a motion made to table the underlying amendment without a vote happening on the Helms amendment. I think there should be a vote on the Helms amendment to see whether or not people want to take the money out of ethanol and put it into a trust fund which doesn't go anywhere, or whether Senators would rather raise the assessment, as the amendment by Senator Chafee and I, and others, does: to raise the marketing assessment now from 1 percent to 2.1 percent, remove the half a percent that farmers have to pay now, make tobacco companies pay the full 2.1 percent, in order to offset the $34 million needed to fund the FDA's youth tobacco initiative. 
That really is the essence of the two amendments, and I believe we ought to have a vote on the two amendments. So, therefore, Mr. President, I move to table the Helms amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

However, the amendment that Senator Chafee and I offered is on an assessment that was passed by the Agriculture Committee in 1990, not the Ways and Means Committee. The Ways and Means Committee never had any jurisdiction over this. 
I am somewhat perplexed as to why this would then go to the Ways and Means Committee, since it was the Agriculture Committee that passed the assessment in 1990.

Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority leader, because there is some, I think, misunderstanding here about going to the Ways and Means Committee, which I don't believe is correct, since customs fees are normally within the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee in any event. There are in this bill more provisions that deal with authorization in the agricultural area. I have a letter from Senator Lugar here saying that he supports our amendment, and he finds it fully consistent with his views. So this amendment would not be referred to the Ways and Means Committee of the House. There is other language in the bill that is in the authorizing level of the Agriculture Committee. This assessment was created in the reconciliation bill of 1990, under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. It is not a customs fee. I was wondering whether we could have a few more minutes to discuss this issue so we can clear it up.

Mr. HARKIN. I just listened to my friend from Kentucky--and he is my friend, I mean that in all sincerity--talking about this amendment not being fair. Madam President, what is not fair is this: Kids all over America walking into gas stations, small retail outlets, not being asked to show an ID, buying cigarettes and getting hooked, getting hooked on tobacco. That is what is not fair. That is what is not fair, and that is what this amendment seeks to prevent. 
The FDA promulgated a rule. The tobacco companies took them to court. The court in Greensboro, NC, upheld that part of the FDA rule that says FDA can set a minimum age for tobacco purchases and require that retail establishments have to card anyone who appears to be under 27. The Court said FDA can promulgate that rule. The rule is in place. 
What our amendment does is provide some money to the States and local jurisdictions to enforce the rules and also money to help the private establishments meet their obligations not to sell to minors and to have an ID check on young people so they do not buy tobacco when they are under the age of 18. That is what is fair. States need the funds. 
This funding for FDA's youth tobacco initiative is supported by 33 attorneys general from around the country who have been part of this tobacco settlement that they are working on. The attorney general of Mississippi, Mike Moore, wrote me a letter supporting this amendment saying it would not interfere or conflict with the proposed tobacco settlement. 
Lastly, this offset is totally within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. It is supported by both Chairman Lugar and by me, the ranking member. This amendment will not go to the Ways and Means Committee. It is under Agriculture's jurisdiction. It was in the 1990 reconciliation bill and it is today.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Warner, Senator Torricelli, Senator Santorum, and Senator Johnson. 
Put simply, this amendment will allow the resumption of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC, International Military and Education Training, IMET, Trade and Development Assistance, TDA, and democracy-building programs in Pakistan, such as the National Endowment for Democracy. 
This measure, I will say at the outset, is not anti-India and it is not pro-Pakistan, it is pro-American interests. This will not be a vote for or against India or Pakistan. India is, of course, a friend of longstanding and an ally to the United States and is the largest and oldest democracy in the region. It already receives the benefit of OPIC and IMET, and it has for some time over 35 years. Therefore, I am confident that we can restore these programs to Pakistan without upsetting any balance at all to the region. 
Trade between India and Pakistan is growing. OPIC assistance to Pakistan could actually help India because they are working with Pakistan in the energy sector. OPIC assistance would promote American investment in this sector. 
Mr. President, it is now clear that continuing the policy of restricting OPIC and IMET to Pakistan will do nothing to direct further U.S. nonproliferation efforts in South Asia. At the same time, these restrictions seriously hinder our ability to advance United States interests in trade and investment in Pakistan. Our influence in the Pakistani military leadership and our ability to strengthen democracy and economic institutions in Pakistan is also adversely affected by these restrictions. 
I understand the concerns of some of my colleagues in regard to Pakistan, and I share some of those concerns. The issue of nonproliferation in South Asia is, indeed, an extremely important issue, but U.S. interests in South Asia are important and increasing. 
The region contains one-fifth of the world's population and occupies a critical geostrategic position--surrounded by China, the surging economies of East Asia, the Indian Ocean, the huge oil and gas reserves in the Persian Gulf and the Caspian basin. 
Mr. President, I visited Pakistan and India earlier this year. I met in Pakistan with Prime Minister Sharif and other members of his government. I believe that Mr. Sharif has learned from past mistakes and is moving Pakistan in the right direction. He has a strong mandate in parliament and has already taken bold steps toward rooting out corruption, privatizing the economy and normalizing relations with India. These are positive steps, and the United States must send a strong signal of support and encouragement for Prime Minister Sharif's initiatives. 
I strongly believe that it has come to the point where our uneven policy toward Pakistan is hampering our interests in the region. Improved human rights, nonproliferation and greater trade and investment are being held hostage by this shortsighted policy. 
I am pleased that my amendment has the strong support of the administration in an effort to engage Pakistan on these important issues. Secretary Albright and Secretary Cohen both feel strongly about the need for these changes. 
Mr. President, I have a letter dated the 16th of July from Secretary of Defense Cohen. He said: 
I am writing to express my strong support for your legislation to restore IMET, OPIC, TDA and democracy-building programs in Pakistan . . . 
We believe it essential to pursue these programs--not as a reward to Pakistan--but as a means of furthering important U.S. interests. Pakistan is now, and long has been, a friendly, moderate Islamic democracy in a very difficult region. We believe that by enabling it to participate in IMET, OPIC, TDA and democracy-building programs we will strengthen democracy in Pakistan as an institution, strengthen Pakistan's troubled economy, and strengthen our relationship with the Pakistani military--all of which serve important U.S. interests in South Asia.

Mr. HARKIN. Let me read further from Secretary Cohen's letter. I want to get this last paragraph in. Secretary Cohen said: 
Opponents of your legislation will claim that Pakistan's performance with regard to proliferation should not be `rewarded' by making it eligible for these assistance programs. We would respond that our denying any of these programs will not cause the Pakistanis to forego strategic programs which they believe are essential for their national security. However, by making these assistance programs available, we will not only serve U.S. interests directly but will improve the climate of our overall relationship thus encouraging Pakistan to be more receptive to our point of view in other areas. 
Mr. President, I am also in receipt of a letter signed by Under Secretary Thomas Pickering. Again, I will just read a couple parts of that:  
Dear Senator Harkin: The Secretary has asked me to convey her strong support for your proposed amendment to restore OPIC, IMET, TDA and democracy-building programs for Pakistan. We firmly believe that allowing these programs to operate in Pakistan is in the U.S. interest, and that once restored they will be a key factor in strengthening our relationship with an important and friendly country in a vital part of the world. 
Mr. Pickering goes on: 
In the wake of the election of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan has adopted important political and constitutional reforms, which promise to strengthen both the quality and continuity of democratic rule. We want to bolster that effort by implementing programs to train Pakistan's elected representatives in democratic structures and legislative procedures. Your amendment would give us the requisite flexibility to proceed.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a number of prominent United States business leaders have asked the State Department to resume OPIC support for investment in Pakistan so that American business interests are promoted in that region. In no other country in South Asia is OPIC prohibited from providing support and assistance. I have examples, a number of letters of United States businesses urging the administration to resume OPIC's support of Pakistan.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Government of Pakistan is pursuing dramatic economic reforms, including liberalization, privatization, and deregulation in order to transition its economy into a fully market-oriented system. Once OPIC support is reinstated, the United States will be able to institute trade and development assistance programs as well. U.S. companies will be able to pursue business opportunities in a wide variety of sectors, such as power generation, telecommunications, highway construction, port development and operations, oil and gas, and banking and finance. 
I also point out, Mr. President, that the Government of Pakistan is in the process of privatizing its banking system. OPIC can be of great help and support in doing that. 
Further, the prohibition of IMET has meant an emerging generation of Pakistani military officers has not had access to training in the United States. Let me be clear that IMET does not mean the transfer or sale of any weapons. It only means valuable education assistance to other militaries which help foster valuable military-to-military contacts with the United States and the host country and allows the United States to impart its values to other militaries. 
Mr. President, according to the Department of Defense, the Chinese are currently the single largest provider of military training to Pakistani Forces. Cutting off Pakistan from IMET assistance over the last 7 years has therefore reduced our contacts among the military leadership in Pakistan and reduced their exposure to United States institutions and values. This 7-year vacuum has been filled by China--not in our best interests. In addition to providing American-style military training, IMET can be used to provide training in human rights, military justice, and civilian-military relations. 
The chief of the Army staff, General Karamat, for Pakistan, who attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, KS, has stated that he would rather send his officers to the United States to study rather than to China. I think we ought to take him up on that. 
The United States has an IMET Program with every country in South Asia except for Pakistan, including Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, even the Maldives. This policy does not make sense. IMET should be restored not as a favor to Pakistan but because it is clearly in the United States interests to do so. 
That is what this amendment is really all about, helping the Unites States. It is pro-American. Pakistan is not getting military training from the United States; it is getting it from China. Is that serving U.S. interests? I do not think so. 
This amendment is not for anyone else but the United States because it will be our interests that are best served by it. Mr. President, let me briefly outline the long history of friendship between Pakistan and the United States.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes here to describe my amendment and what it does. I appreciate the chairman's willingness to set aside his amendment to take up this one. 
Mr. President, this is an amendment similar to one that I offered a year ago to get the Government out of the business of paying defense contractors for exercising their own best business judgment in merging together to form larger corporations, because that is what we are doing right now. Even though defense contractors want to merge--it is in their own best business interest to do so--taxpayers are coming in and subsidizing it. 
This is new. We have never done this before. Prior to July 1993, the Department of Defense had a longstanding practice of not permitting defense contractors to charge restructuring costs to flexibly priced contracts that were transferred from one contractor to another as a result of a business combination. 
That was the longstanding policy of DOD. The rationale for this practice was that DOD should not have to pay increased costs merely because one contractor is combining with another contractor. That statement comes right out of a recent GAO report. 
But in July 1993, DOD changed its longstanding practice and uniformly began permitting defense contractors to charge restructuring costs to the taxpayers of this country. 
How did this come about? Did it come about because Congress passed a law permitting it? No. Was there ever any debate on the Senate floor about it? None whatsoever. Was there ever one hearing held on it? No, there was not one hearing held on it. 
What happened was that in 1993, then Undersecretary of Defense, Mr. John Deutch by name, was Undersecretary for Procurement. He decided, single-handedly, to change the longstanding policy and made this change. 
We raised the point at the time, I and others, that this was a change in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, [FAR]. To get a change like this in FAR, there was a process and procedure that one had to go through. It had to be published in the Federal Register. There had to be hearings on it. Congress had to act on it. None of that took place. 
When we raised the point that regulations were not followed in changing the FAR, Mr. Deutch testified that in fact this was not a change in FAR, this was simply an explanation of existing law, that indeed the Department of Defense or any Federal agency had the authority to pay for the costs of mergers and acquisitions. So to get out from underneath violating the law, which I believe is what Mr. Deutch did at that time in terms of not going through the normal process, he then said, well, this really was not a change in FAR, it was simply an explanation of what was existing law. 
That raised all kinds of questions, as I pointed out last year in the debate. 
If this had been existing law for all these years, then it does not just affect the Department of Defense. It affects every agency of Government. That means that if hospitals merge, if they have Government contracts, can now come in and say, we want help for our mergers and acquisitions. 
This could go back years and years. People could come back from 20 years ago and say, Oh, well, we didn't know that that was existing law, so now we need to be reimbursed for the mergers we made in the past. 
So we are hung up on the twin horns of this sort of dilemma. On the one hand, if it was indeed a change in FAR, then Mr. Deutch and the Department of Defense did not go through proper procedures to accomplish that. If, on the other hand, it was not a change in FAR, then we have opened a Pandora's box for providing for taxpayer funding for any merger or combination for any company that has any Government contract. 
But I want to point out this is the Department of Defense, DOD, funding bill. And, you know, some of my colleagues argue that 
we are tight for money in this bill. We tried last week to transfer some money out of DOD to pay for veterans. We were told we did not have enough money in DOD for that. Now we have a subsidy the likes of which we have never seen in this country. I call it the `money for nothing' subsidy because that is exactly what the taxpayers are getting. 
Let us look at the mergers and acquisitions that we have had. 
Just last week Lockheed Martin announced it would purchase Northrop Grumman for an estimated $11.6 billion. Well, besides a nice stock boost for Northrop Grumman, which closed up 21.12 cents on the stock market when the merger was announced, these merging companies are also eligible to receive millions of dollars from the American taxpayers just for doing what is in their own best business interest. So that is why I am offering this amendment, a commonsense amendment to prevent these large and profitable companies from receiving taxpayer subsidies simply for merging. 
I am not saying they cannot merge. I am simply saying that the taxpayer should not fund it. 
For the life of me, I cannot see the wisdom in paying these profitable companies for merging when they are doing it in their own best business interest, when they are making a lot of money on the stock market, and we are paying them with money that we just do not have. I thought we were trying to balance the budget. 
Again, this is not money for any goods that we are going to receive at all. I just think that if these companies want to merge, fine--I know the Department of Defense has been urging them to merge for savings to the taxpayers, possible savings to the taxpayers. I do not know whether that is true or not. There may be some savings, but I do not think that has all been documented in terms of real savings. But even if there are savings to the taxpayers, the fact is, these companies are making a lot of money by merging. These companies would not merge if it was not in their best business interests to do so. There is no one at the Defense Department holding a hammer over their heads saying, Lockheed, you must merge with Northrop Grumman. There is no one holding a hammer over the head of Boeing saying, You must merge with McDonnell Douglas. They are doing it because it is increasing their profits, increasing their bottom line for their stockholders. Otherwise they would never do it. 
These mergers, aside from making more money for the companies, are in fact decreasing the amount of competition that we have out there now for Government procurements. But now they say that, well, these mergers are going to save us money. 
Let me read a couple of passages from a recent DOD inspector general report, dated June 28, 1996. On page 9-- let me read it in its full context:  
Contractors' [meaning defense contractors] are submitting cost proposals for activities called concentration, transition, economic planning, and other terms that do not immediately suggest restructuring and make the cost issues difficult for the Government to review, administer, and resolve. 
On page 10 of the same IG's report--this is still the DOD inspector general's report--they said that: 
One contractor's restructuring proposal projected savings over 10 years. But the contractor's projections are highly speculative since the volume of Government business is not guaranteed. The same contractor also proposed savings based on `synergies in the work force'-- 
How about that one? a term that is not defined in the existing procurement regulations, and is difficult at best to substantiate and evaluate. 
Not my words, this is the DOD inspector general's words. 
On page 16 the same IG report: 
Amortization based on the projection of extended savings can almost make a marginal acquisition appear attractive by spreading costs over a long period, and comparing them to the projected savings to determine savings. In all cases, amorti- zation periods were selected for arbitrary reasons. . . . 
According to a GAO study of one business combination, they said: 
The net cost reduction certified by DOD represents less than 15 percent of the savings projected to the DOD 2 years earlier when they sought support for the proposed partnership. 
So DOD said, here is the proposed savings. GAO did the study of it and said the cost reduction was less than 15 percent of the proposed savings. 
So, I believe, Mr. President, this practice is clearly an abuse of taxpayers' money. We never passed it in the Congress. I believe that if this had ever come up for a vote in the Senate to say that we are now going to pay for mergers and acquisitions for these companies who are going to make these huge profits, I do not think it ever would have passed. 
If these companies are merging for business reasons, why do they need a handout from the taxpayers? If they are not being ordered to do so by the Government--and they certainly are not; encouraged, yes, not ordered to do so--but if they are good, the mergers will happen anyway, and the taxpayers will receive any savings without paying anything out. 
I know that is the point that is going to be made. 
We know that we can see some savings being made by these mergers. Fine. That is a great savings for the taxpayer if that is happening. But there is no reason we should have to pay for these mergers, because the companies are making much higher profits, much more money than they were before. 
So, therefore, we should not have to pay for them. Lawrence Korb, former Under Secretary of Defense, pointed out that defense contracting is still a profitable business. Over the past year, Lockheed Martin stock increased 48 percent in value, Northrop Grumman stock is up 50 percent, and McDonnell Douglas went up a whopping 80 percent last year. That is fine. That is good. But then why do we have to come in and give taxpayers' money to them to merge? 
You do not have to take it from me but from a very conservative think tank, the Cato Institute, which said, `The costs associated by mergers should not be absorbed by Federal taxpayers. This is an egregious example of unwarranted corporate welfare in our budget.' 
Taxpayers for Common Sense said, `It is time for the Pentagon to drop this ridiculous money-for-nothing policy.' 
The Project on Government Oversight said, `The new policy is unneeded, establishes inappropriate government intervention in the economy, promotes layoffs of high-wage jobs, pays for excessive CEO salaries, and is likely to cost the government billions of dollars.' 
Mr. President, it is time for the Pentagon to drop this ridiculous money-for-nothing policy. This policy is unneeded, it allows inappropriate Government intervention in the economy, and is likely to cost more because it will limit competition. 
Mr. President, the GAO recently pointed out that in the last round of mergers and acquisitions they found the following: One, GAO was unable to account for savings for the Federal Government due to DOD's subsidies for mergers; second, the GAO reported that the mergers have led to the layoff of 15,000 workers, with an additional 4,000 expected. GAO also offered no evidence that the subsidy had resulted in any savings that would not have been achieved without Federal payments. 
There is another effect that we have not factored in here: 15,000 hard-working blue-color Americans lost their jobs, most of them good union people, making pretty good wages--15,000 of them out of work. I suppose they belong to unions like the machinists and a lot of other good unions, making good money. Fifteen thousand laid off because of these mergers and acquisitions. How many went on food stamps? How many drew unemployment compensation? That is another cost to the taxpayers that was not picked up by these merger and acquisition costs or factored into the studies. 
Mr. John Deutch, in 1993, made a big mistake. We should not compound that mistake. Already, we have paid out $179 million to pay for mergers and acquisitions. There is pending right now on the books about $817 million that we can see. That is not counting the upcoming Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger. How many more hundreds of millions of dollars will that add? 
My amendment, Mr. President, says simply that all of those that we have--and I want to make sure the managers of the bill understand this--all of those with which we have contractual arrangements, obviously have to be paid. What my amendment says is that those that have not been contractually made, we will not pay for these mergers or acquisitions. So if we have made the contracts, I guess we have to live up to it. But my amendment says none in the future. 
It is time to stop this ridiculous policy of paying highly profitable companies to do what is in their own best interests and which they would do anyway even if there were no Government subsidy. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate my chairman's comments on this. I know that the law was changed last year; Commerce put these provisions in there. 
Let me respond by saying that I think the GAO report points out that these are ephemeral, at best. It does say that you have to, if I could just have the chairman's attention, have the savings, the restructuring savings for DOD just has to be projected by at least 2-to-1. 
Then here is what the GAO said about estimating these savings. It said: 
Restructuring savings, on the other hand, are not recorded in a contractor's accounting records. Therefore, neither the amount nor the nature of the savings can be determined by reviewing the accounting records. Consequently, savings have to be estimated. For example, Northrop-Grumman's estimated 5-year savings from closing the Grumman corporate headquarters of about $215 million, of which about $100 million represents the labor and fringe costs that would be avoided over the 5-year period by laying off approximately 250 workers. These savings are, therefore, an estimate of a cost avoidance over the 5 years, the cost of the additional people that would have been needed had the headquarters not been closed. 
The savings from restructuring activities we examined were generally in the form of such future cost avoidances. The initial estimate of restructuring savings is simple in concept because it makes the critical assumption that everything else, except for the restructuring, is the same after a business combination as before. Because things are never the same, it is difficult to precisely identify actual savings several years after the initial estimate is prepared. 
Basically, what they are saying is, all of this money is fungible. I know the chairman says that we put a provision in there saying they can't use any of this money to pay bonuses. Fine. But they can go ahead and pay big bonuses and they can shift the cost over somewhere else, and we pay for closing an office and laying off 250 workers, which is a cost avoidance. 
So this money is all fungible. The GAO says there is no accounting principle that they can look to to determine that. So these are projected savings, not actual. 
I say to my friend from Alaska, the distinguished chairman, projected savings, well, I can tell you, any defense industry that is going to merge is going to show you that the savings to the taxpayers is much more than 2-to-1 over the amount of money we are going to give them for merging. That is an absolute because they are going to be able to show those kinds of savings. That is not the point. The point is, they are going to merge because it is in their best business interest to do so. 
Last week, Northrop-Grumman stock went up $21.12 a share. That is a lot of money. The stockholders or shareholders are happy about this. They have the money to go ahead and merge. This is in their best business interest to do so. If the taxpayers get savings out of it, fine, I am all for it. We should get savings out of it. But why should we pay them to do something that they are going to do anyway? Let us get the savings. Let it be 2-to-1. I hope it is 3-to-1, or 4-to-1, or 5-to-1. But we don't have to give them this money to do it. 
So that is in response to what the chairman just said. Yes, they have to project that the savings will exceed the allowed costs--that is the money we give them--by a factor of 2-to-1. Believe me, they are going to show that without any problem whatsoever. But if they can't, there is another loophole because if the projected savings to DOD exceeded the costs allowed, the secretary can determine if the business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability. So there is another loophole if, in fact, they can't meet that test. Believe me they will meet that test. 
My bottom line is still this: These defense contractors are merging because it is in their best business interest to do so. It is not in our best interest, I don't think--not all the time--because I think we are destroying a lot of competition that was out there. But there is no reason for the taxpayers to subsidize it. That is what this amendment does. It simply stops it. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Disraeli once described the youth of a nation as, the trustees of posterity. I interpret that to mean that the future promise of any country can be directly measured by the present prospects of its young people. Whatever we invest today in promoting and protecting our youth will bring a high return in the future. 
For that reason, I am pleased that the Senate has taken some first steps to address the growing problem of uninsured children. 
I have to say I am still astounded by the fact that this great Nation could allow 10 million children to go without health insurance. Just think about it. At a time when the economy is sound and unemployment is at a 23-year low, one in seven of America's children lack a basic protection that every one of us enjoys. 
Uninsured children are less likely to be fully immunized against preventable illnesses, or to receive care for chronic conditions and injuries. And usually whatever care they receive takes place in a hospital emergency room--one of the most expensive settings possible. 
As we consider how best to extend health insurance coverage to this important segment of the population, I want to call my colleagues' attention to one aspect of this problem that is often overlooked. I am speaking about the oral health of children. 
For some reason, many of us often fail to realize that oral health is an integral part of a person's overall health. Tooth decay and serious infections are just some of the chronic health problems that can result when oral health is ignored. At the same time, there is a strong relationship between oral health and other medical conditions that manifest symptoms in the mouth. Regular dental check-ups, or example, provide an early warning system for diabetes, certain forms of cancer, and immune disorders like AIDS. 
According to the U.S. Public Health Service, dental and oral diseases may well be the most prevalent--and preventable--conditions affecting children. And while we have seen improvement overall, certain groups of children continue to suffer more than their share of oral health problems, primarily because of their limited access to oral health services. Poor children--usually minority, migrant, and many in rural communities--are the ones most seriously affected. 
You might ask `doesn't Medicaid help these children?' It should, if they happen to be eligible. But while Medicaid accounts for about 80 percent of public funds spent for oral health, only about 1 percent of Medicaid funds are spent on dental care. And as we have heard, many of the uninsured children are in working poor families that are just above the Medicaid cut-off for eligibility. These children have no protection whatsoever. 
The sad irony is that dental care embodies the very qualities that make for a good health care system. Unlike medical coverage, which is triggered by illness, dental coverage emphasizes prevention. How important is that? According to the National Institute of Dental Research, every dollar spent on preventive dental care saves $4 in treatment costs. 
And dental coverage favors primary care over more expensive specialized treatment. Regular checkups mean your local dentist can catch and treat problems before they require a specialist. 
One recent study found that persons with dental coverage are almost twice as likely to visit a dentist, and more than 70 percent of those covered by insurance have annual checkups and receive preventive care. 
All of which is to say, dental coverage for children is not only good social policy; it is good economic policy as well. 
If we truly want to extend basic health protection to our children, I urge my colleagues to include dental health coverage in any final legislation we send to the President.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague, my friend from Minnesota for offering this amendment. I join with him, as he said, in offering it. 
He has laid out the case for veterans. We have shortchanged them. I heard someone ask earlier: `This is the defense bill, this is defense authorization. Later on there will be a veterans bill we can deal with. We deal with veterans later. Why does it belong here?' 
It belongs here because, Mr. President, I submit you cannot defend this country unless we first defend our veterans, and that is what the Senator from Minnesota is saying in this amendment. He is right, we have given the Pentagon $2.6 billion more than they even asked for and, at the same time, turned around and cut our veterans health care program by $400 million. What kind of signal does that send to our young men and women in uniform today about their prospects in the future for having their health care needs taken care of if, in fact, they should find themselves in an enclave like those veterans found in Vietnam or the gulf war or Korea or World War II. 
Mr. President, there may be those who say if we take this $400 million out of defense, it is going to really hurt our readiness; we can't afford to cut our defense budget for something like this. I would like to take some time to refute that argument and to say, in fact, the military budget that we have today is far too bloated to meet the threats or potential threats that confront our country at this time. 
No one disputes that the cold war is over, but some in this body would like to continue funding the Department of Defense as if it never ended. I know the world is still a dangerous place, but we must ask ourselves, is our current defense budget justified by the dangers faced by the United States? I don't believe they are justified. 
The fact is, military spending is so high that it can be lowered without endangering national security. Even with the elimination of the Soviet Union, defense spending is still much larger than cold war spending levels. And what is all this money for? What enemy are we going to fight? Is it Cuba who spends less than 1 percent on its military budget? Or Libya, Iraq, Iran or North Korea or Syria? Or are we just going to spend $268 billion next year simply to have a large military? So let's look at some of the figures and take a comparison. 
U.S. military spending right now is three times--and look at this chart--our U.S. military spending. Here is the pie chart showing in billions of dollars the amount of money spent by various countries on defense. The United States spends three times more than China, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Vietnam all combined. It is more than double all of our NATO Allies combined. It is larger than the military budgets of the countries with the seven largest standing armies. Most important, the United States will spend nearly twice what all of our potential enemies spend on defense all combined. So if you add up all of our potential enemies, we will spend twice what they will spend on defense, all of them combined. 
Some have pointed out we should continue high levels of military spending because we don't know what our potential enemies are. A threat could come from anywhere. Let's assume this is true, for argument's sake. Let's break the world down by countries then, and see what we are talking about in terms of potential threats. 
Let us break it down by continents. What if every nation on the most powerful continent besides North America ganged up on the United States? By this, I mean all of Europe. Let us say that all of Europe--Germany and France and Spain and Great Britain and Italy and all these countries that are our friends--what if they all ganged up on us? Very remote, but if they did, we still outspend this potential threat by a great deal, by almost $60 billion. You might say that is ridiculous, in Europe we have our allies, they are in NATO. They are not going to attack us. OK. 
What if every power in Africa joined in? Here is Africa down here, remote possibility, but they are only spending about $14 billion a year. 
In fact, if you add up all the military expenses of all of Europe, Africa, and South America, combined--let us say that all of the countries of Europe, South America, and Africa all combined together to attack us--we still spend more in defense than all of those three continents all put together. 
So I ask again, why are we spending so much money? This is the world. We are spending more than all of these continents all put together. 
There is another aspect to our defense. As it stands right now, such a large portion of our discretionary budget goes for defense that we are actually endangering our national security. Our citizens are threatened, the life and health of our country is threatened. Every extra dollar we spend on defense that we do not need to is a dollar less for education, for putting police on the streets, for stopping the drug epidemic, and feeding hungry children. 
In fact, the amount of discretionary funding spent on defense totals over 50 percent of the discretionary budget. That means that the portion of the total budget that we actually decide on where it goes overwhelmingly goes for defense. For every dollar that we spend out of this body, over 50 cents goes to defense--not education, not health care, not breakfast feeding for kids in schools, not for flood victims, but for the military. 
Here again is a pie chart. Look at it. This is our discretionary dollar that we spend. So 51.5 cents for military; all the rest for everything else. Justice gets 4 cents; housing assistance gets 3 cents; health gets 4.8 cents, transportation 2.7 cents. You wonder why our highways are going to pot and with potholes? You wonder why our railroads are deficient? 
Here is energy, less than 1 penny; education, 6 cents; 51.5 cents for the military. Six cents on education. You wonder why our schools are crumbling? You wonder why we are not getting the best possible teachers? Well, we are only spending that much money in education. 
Natural resources and environment, 4 cents. 
So I think this really graphically shows where our money goes. Over half for defense; less than half for everything else that goes to make us a strong nation. 
Some who argue for increased defense spending point out the defense spending has gone down from 1985. I heard that argument early today. A Senator on the floor said, `Oh, my gosh, the defense budget has been cut by something like 30 percent since 1985.' OK. Why do you use 1985? Why do we start with 1985, when 1985 was the peak of military spending, the buildup during the Reagan years? So, yes, you can measure it from 1985. 
Why don't we measure it from 1980? Let us take the height of the cold war, 1980, when we faced the Soviet Union. Well, our spending today is just about the same, actually maybe just a little bit more than it was in 1980. Yes, we have come down from 1985. But I submit, Mr. President, those who say that we have cut our defense spending are using an arbitrary point. They are using the point at which we had the highest military spending since the war. I say what we ought to use is a baseline like 1980 or 1970. And if we look at those base years, we get a much different level. 
So why are we comparing today's spending levels to 1985? The world today is not the world of 1980 or 1985 or 1990. We should be discussing the defense budget in terms of today's threats, that is, unless we plan to take the United States Army and our defense back in time to 1985 and have them fight the Soviet Union. But we will not do that because there is no Soviet Union. 
Why does it matter so much what we spent in 1985 when the Soviet Union was a threat? We should look at today's threats and potential threats, match our spending to meet them, not the threats of 1985. 
Aside from all that, the Wellstone amendment seeks, as we know, to shift $400 million out of $268 billion. We are saying, take $400 million, shift it over to veterans health care. As the Senator pointed out, we have $2.6 billion more than what the Pentagon asked for. Will we really harm our readiness if we take $400 million out for veterans health? I submit not. Why are we giving the Defense Department more money when they cannot even keep track of the money they have already spent and they are wasting billions on buying equipment they do not need? 
Mr. President, in February of this year, I released a 
General Accounting Office report requested by myself, Congressman DeFazio, Senator Durbin, and Congresswoman Maloney. This study revealed that over half of the Department of Defense inventory of procured items is overstock; in other words, waste. Of the $67 billion of goods in DOD warehouses, the GAO estimates that $41 billion is unneeded. What do you mean by unneeded? By unneeded, this means the military would never need or use the items even during wartime. Let me repeat that. Of the $67 billion in goods in DOD warehouses, GAO estimated that $41 billion is unneeded even in wartime. 
That is not all. Again, here is the inventory. This is what this chart shows. Total inventory is $67 billion. About $41 billion, or 61 percent, of it is in excess of what is needed for operational requirements or for reserve requirements. The needed inventory is about $25.8 billion. So we have all this waste out there that we do not need, and yet you would think it would end. But, it never seems to end. It just continues going on and on and on. 
The GAO identified more than $1.1 billion worth of goods--11,000 different items--for which there is a 100-year supply. Imagine that. Do we expect our Army to fight with something 100 years from now that was built today? Bring back the horse cavalry. Maybe that is what today's Army needs, what we used 100 years ago. So 100 years, with 11,000 different items, totaling $1.1 billion. 
But that is not all. The GAO also uncovered millions of dollars in DOD inventory items for which there is more than a 20-year supply. Yet, the Pentagon continues to buy more. The justification by the Pentagon for not canceling many of these orders actually border on the bizarre. Some were not canceled because termination `was not cost-effective' for any purchase less than $10,000. 
Other items are automatically ordered without review or regard to need. The computer just keeps ordering them. As a result, we do not just have warehouses of waste, I call them arsenals of bureaucracy. What we have is Sergeant Bilko manning the warehouse, Beetle Bailey running procurement, and Gomer Pyle checking the list twice. 
This photo here shows just one item that was uncovered called a direct linear valve used on a hydraulic pump used on aircraft carriers. The Pentagon has more than a 20-year supply on this item. Although only 8 of those in stock were needed, an additional 66 were on order in 1995. Only 8 were needed, but an additional 66 were ordered. 
Again, we asked why the Navy did not cancel the order. Well, they said, termination was not `cost-effective for any purchase less than $10,000.' So if it costs less than $10,000, it is cheaper for the taxpayers to buy it. Please, someone, make sense of that for me. If it costs less than $10,000, keep buying it, keep stocking it because it costs more to cancel it. Try selling that to your constituents back home. 
Here is another one. This is a circuit board, aircraft circuit board. In 1995, 10 were on order. The only problem was that the Navy had 27 of these, but only 2 were needed for operational and wartime reserve. 
That is not the last of it. This is a 1972 state-of-the-art electronic item. So we asked, why did they keep ordering them? Well, according to the item manager, the Navy supply system computer automatically ordered the item and no one bothered to review the order. But not to worry. After the 10 new assemblies of these circuit boards--at more than $1,000 each--were delivered in May, they were automatically routed for disposal. What does that mean? They ordered them; they came in; someone stamped them, shoved them out the backdoor to throw away. 
So do not tell me that taking $400 million for veterans health care is going to somehow hurt our readiness or hurt our ability to defend this country from any threats that exist today or any potential threats in the foreseeable future. 
But what this $400 million will mean is that those veterans who put themselves in harm's way, who were there to sacrifice life and limb for their country, who were in the gulf war or in Haiti or in Bosnia, Vietnam, Korea, World War II, or even peacetime--I do not mean just to focus on our veterans who were in wartime. What is that saying? It is not just those who are in battle, but those who support those in battle, our peacetime army, our peacetime military. 
My brother was a SAC pilot in the Strategic Air Command for 5 years carrying nuclear weapons. None were ever dropped, but this was our front line of defense. This is what kept the Soviet bear in check. So these, too, these veterans also have to be responded to in terms of their health care needs. 
So I am talking about all veterans, not just those who have been in actual war but those who were willing, if the orders came, to fight and to perhaps die for their country. 
I believe we have an absolute obligation to support our troops not only in time of battle but also at home when the battle ends. I believe we have a special obligation to those in our Armed Forces who were disabled in the service of our country. Veterans programs too often suffer inadequate funding 
and misguided policies. 
As Senator Wellstone pointed out, our veterans population is aging rapidly, and the hospital system is stretched to its limits. The proposed cuts to the VA budget, which is already inadequate for the medical needs of veterans, is an unacceptable way to try to balance the budget. These cuts will have a drastic and severe effect on the health of our Nation's veterans, especially those veterans who were disabled in the service of our country. 
So what our amendment seeks to do is to alleviate these unfair cuts in the veterans discretionary funding by transferring $400 million from the Department of Defense budget to VA. We can do it. The money is there. If the Department of Defense will just cut down a little bit on their waste and inefficiencies, if we will begin to gear our thinking towards the threats of today and tomorrow instead of what the world was like 10 and 20 years ago, if we do that, there is plenty of money in the defense budget to make sure that we meet our obligation to our veterans. 
I do not think this Senate should do anything less than that. This amendment should be adopted overwhelmingly to send a strong signal not only to our veterans but to those who are serving today that when their time of need comes and they need health care through the veterans system, that this country will stand behind them when they are veterans just as it stands behind them when they are serving in active duty. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Wellstone amendment. This School Breakfast Program has been one of the best in this country. Already we have kids getting school lunches, but they don't get the school breakfast. 
I say that if you ever want to see a clean plate, you go to a school breakfast program. These kids come in, they are hungry, there is not a drop of food left when they put those trays back into the hopper. The school lunch may be a little different. 
If you really want to have an impact on early childhood education and getting these kids to learn, this is the place to put the money. It was wrong to take it out of welfare reform. I tried at that time to put the money in, and we could not do it. It was wrong for this to be taken out in the welfare reform to save that kind of money. It does not save money. It ruins lives because we are not providing the money for the outreach program for the school breakfast startups and for the summer feeding program. 
This is a small amount of money. I think out of this whole defense thing we could at least authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer a measly $5 million to get this job done.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment with Senator Richard Durbin regarding some much needed reforms in the way the Department of Defense manages its inventory of goods, as well as its financial management systems. Our amendment modifies some very useful language that is included in the Senate Armed Services Committee version of the Defense Authorization bill. 
I first would like to applaud the members of the Armed Services Committee for including provisions in the bill that moves the DOD toward better management of its finances and inventories. These provisions are important steps toward fixing some critical problems. We believe that our amendment adds a few simple improvements to the committee provisions. 
One element of our amendment requires that the DOD take actions to ensure that its comptrollers are adequately trained. Afterall, the comptroller is the key technical expert who overseas and manages the day-to-day financial operations. For example, the comptroller of the Pacific Fleet, billeted for a Navy captain, is responsible for the financial management and financial reporting of an annual budget of about $5 billion, comparable in size to a Fortune 500 corporation. 
Earlier this year, I released a General Accounting Office report, entitled `Financial Management: Opportunities to Improve Experience and Training of Key Navy Comptrollers.' The GAO report states that the Navy's financial and accounting systems have been substantially hampered by the fact that the Navy has no specific career path for financial officers, has inadequate financial management and accounting education standards for comptroller jobs, and has a policy of rotating officers too often through key accounting positions. In the report, GAO pointed to these personnel practices as one cause of GAO findings of misstatements in almost all of the Navy's major accounts. 
The GAO report recommended that the Secretary of Defense ensure that the following steps are taken by the Navy, all of which are applicable to the other Armed Services: 
Identify which key military comptroller positions can be converted to civilian status in order to gain greater continuity, technical competency, and cost savings. 
For those comptroller positions identified for conversion to civilian status, ensure that those positions are filled by individuals who possess both the proper education and experience. 
For those comptroller positions that should remain in military billets, establish a career path in the financial management and ensures that military officers are prepared, both in terms of education and experience, for comptrollership responsibilities. 
This year, I also released, along with Senator Durbin, Congressman Peter DeFazio and Congresswoman Maloney, a second GAO report that addressed some critical problems with the DOD's inventory practices. `Defense Logistics: Much of the Inventory Exceeds Current Needs' detailed billions of dollars in unneeded supplies and equipment within the DOD's inventory. Although DOD has made some progress in reducing the overstock in its inventory, much more needs to be done. This is especially true in its overstock of spare parts and hardware items. 
I agree with the committee's attempt to institutionalize best commercial practices in the management of DOD's inventory, especially for the inventory of spare parts. Our amendment simply requires the DOD to implement pilot programs when needed. It also clarifies the definition of best commercial practices to include the so-called prime vendor arrangements which have proven very successful.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to express support for the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program Act of 1997. The existing Small Business Administration [SBA] Microloan Program has enjoyed great success in moving people off welfare and helping them start their own business. The welfare-to-work initiative will not only continue this success, but it will also improve the services provided by the current Microloan Program. 
The existing Microloan Program has two components. First, it works to provide short-term loans of up to $25,000 to small businesses. SBA makes these loans through various nonprofit organizations that have close ties to their communities. Second, the Microloan Program also provides technical assistance to help clients learn important skills such as accounting, marketing, and advertising. 
It is important that we continue the Microloan Program, and we must also look to implement other services that will make it more effective. The welfare-to-work initiative does just that by establishing a 3-year program that will continue and expand upon the existing program. Like the current law, this bill will extend loans and technical assistance, but it will also allow for more business planning and training assistance prior to extending loans to welfare recipients. It will also allow intermediaries to use supplemental grants to help borrowers with transportation and child care expenses. Extending these services is essential in order to allow welfare recipients who don't have the money for transportation and child care to participate in the program. 
An example of the Microloan Program's success is the Institute for Social and Economic Development [ISED] in Iowa City, IA. ISED is different from most development corporations in the Microloan Program because it does not extend loans to its clients. Rather, it provides technical assistance and will act as an intermediary to set up a loan between their client and a bank. ISED's technical assistance program provides structured training in which clients develop plans for a profitable business. Due to this effort, ISED has enjoyed an extremely high success rate, with 70 percent of its client's businesses still operational. This statistic becomes even more impressive considering that of all the small businesses started across the Nation in the last 8 years over 70 percent no longer exist. 
We must recognize that the welfare-to-work initiative benefits both welfare recipients and our taxpayers. The Microloan Program presents welfare recipients with the preferable option of self-employment as a means to move off welfare. At the same time, it saves the State money and moves people from being welfare recipients to taxpayers. In Iowa, nearly 400 welfare recipients have started and maintained their own small business, and the total savings to the State have been $1 million in welfare benefits alone. 
The welfare-to-work initiative gives welfare recipients the opportunity to be self-sufficient. It provides the entrepreneur with the money to start a business, and the skills and services to maintain it.

Mr. HARKIN. Over the past several years I have met with a number of welfare recipients, caseworkers and others to discuss the issue of welfare reform in the State of Iowa. The discussions have also included a number of individuals who have successfully made the transition from welfare to self-sufficient employment. In many cases, the key to this successful transition was participation in post-secondary classroom training. I understand that the pending legislation prohibits use of the Welfare-To-Work Programs funds for this purpose but want to clarify that States may continue to use Federal funds received under the temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program or their own resources for post-secondary classroom training.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for making that clear. I have another question. 
The Welfare-To-Work Program provides formula grants to States and requires States to develop a formula for distribution of the funds within the State in consultation with sub-State areas. However, it is not clear what types of entities are eligible to provide the welfare-to-work services and that States have flexibility on this score. 
In 1989, Iowa established 11 Family Development and Self-Sufficiency Programs to work with welfare recipients with a history of long-term dependency on the program and those who were at risk of long term dependency. These projects, 10 at nonprofit organizations, have been evaluated and have demonstrated success in moving welfare recipients off of welfare and into self-sufficient employment. In addition, a number of community action agencies and community development corporations have also been working with welfare recipients on exactly the kind of activities envisioned by the pending legislation. 
I just want to make sure that a State may provide funding from the Welfare-To-Work Program to entities such as community action agencies, community development corporations and other nonprofit organizations.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record some of the many letters I have received in support of Senator D'Amato's and my amendment to S. 947, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to create a medical research fund. These letters show the widespread grassroots support for this amendment which would expand support for medical research above and beyond what is currently being done at the National Institutes of Health [NIH]. 
The people behind these letters understand what many recent studies have demonstrated--that investments in medical research can both save lives and lower Medicare costs through the development of more cost-effective treatments and by delaying the onset of illness. They understand that while health care spending devours nearly $1 trillion annually, the United States devotes less than 2 percent of its total health care budget to health research. These letters are from people that understand the importance of increased funding for biomedical research. I ask unanimous consent that these letters in support of the medical research amendment be submitted for the Record.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to echo what the Senator from Massachusetts just said. If anything, this provision is the ultimate anti-blue-collar provision that I have ever seen on the Senate floor. This strikes right at the heart of the Americans we ought to be here protecting today. There is a difference. There is a difference between a corporate executive for Xerox and someone who is out there working hard every day of their life on a construction job, in a factory, in a plant. There is a difference between a Senator sitting on this floor or a Member of the House and that worker who is out there on the line day after day, the women who suffer from carpel tunnel syndrome, the people who work in our packing plants. Try that on for size. Do that for 5 years, 10 years, 20, 30, 40 years of your life. There is a difference. 
Sure, if you are a corporate executive, you have nothing to worry about. If you are a Senator, you have nothing to worry about. But I will tell you, if you are a blue-collar worker out there and you have worked hard all your life, you have raised your kids, you have sent them to school, you are now 62, you are worn out, maybe you are not physically able to continue working. Have you ever thought of that? So they retire. They get Social Security. God bless them. But they can't get health care coverage. 
What this amendment does, it just sticks it right in their back one more time. You can say, oh, it's just 1 more month a year, 2 more months a year for 6 years. Then there is this gap and it takes all this time. But if this provision stays in there, the die will be cast. And we will have sent a strong message to our seniors: Sorry, when it comes to health care, you're out of luck; you're on the street some place. 
We have a commission, a national bipartisan commission looking at this. It is supposed to report next year. Why are we jumping the gun on it? 
Now, I would agree with Senators who are supporting this provision that, yes, we have to do things to ensure the viability of Medicare. There are a lot of things we can do to preserve the viability of Medicare. But this is not one of them. This will destroy Medicare because it destroys the compact we have had all these years. This is an antiworker provision. That is all it is. 
Now, if you want to vote for this provision, sure, fine, keep it in the bill, but I am telling you, for that working stiff who is out there who wants to retire, their physical health may not be the best; they have to retire at age 62, if anything, what we ought to be doing on this Senate floor is we ought to be closing the gap. We ought to provide medical care for elderly who have to retire early. But, no, we won't even do that. Now we are going to make it even a longer period of time. Well, I think this provision is really unconscionable, should have no place in this bill, and I hope that we will vote to strke it overwhelmingly.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will not even take 2 minutes. I listened to the impassioned argument of my friend from Pennsylvania. I just had two observations. No. 1, along the lines of what Senator Lautenberg said, No. 1, what retirement income will a Senator have when a Senator retires here? What is that retirement income going to be? A lot of money. When a Senator retires at age 65, you get a lot of money--big time money for retirement. It is not a blue collar worker retiring on Social Security, No. 1. 
No. 2, if you retire as a Federal Government employee or as a U.S. Senator, you can keep your Federal employee's health benefits. There is no gap for you. You can keep it. It costs you, what, $100-something a month, $110, $120 a month. So it is easy for a Senator to stand here and talk about saving his generation. But those in his generation are not all U.S. Senators. Those in his generation are not all people who can go on Federal Employee health benefits when they reach age 62. They need Medicare. That is where most of America is, not sitting in the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New York for his kind words, but also, more important, let me thank him for his stalwart, unwavering support through the years for medical research. 
I have been involved in this battle for a long time, and I have never found anyone who has fought harder to make sure we had adequate funding for all of the biomedical research we need 
done in this country than Senator D'Amato from New York. I thank him for that unwavering support down through the years and for his support on this amendment also. 
Mr. President, this amendment does have strong bipartisan support. Senator Specter and Senator Mack are cosponsors, as well as a number on our side--Senator Rockefeller, Senator Daschle, Senator Boxer, Senator Durbin, Senator Kerry. So it has strong bipartisan support. 
I want to pick up on what the Senator from New York said. We voted not long ago, the entire Senate, every one of us voted to double funding for NIH by 2002. We are all in favor of that. But it is very hard finding the money. I worked very hard with Senator Specter when I was chairman and he was ranking member. Now he is chairman and I am ranking member. We have worked very hard to get adequate funding for NIH every year. It is getting more and more difficult, and with this balanced budget which I am supporting strongly, which I have continued to support in the past and will continue to support, it is going to be even harder. 
If we wanted to double NIH funding by 2002 out of our discretionary account, if we zeroed out all the other accounts we have--maternal-child health care, the Centers for Disease Control, mental health block grants and a host of others--if we zeroed all those out and shifted it just to NIH, we would still be $2 billion short of doubling it. We are not going to zero out mental health block grants and the Centers for Disease Control and everything else. So we have to look for someplace else to find this money. 
Without our action, the investment in NIH research is only going to decline in real terms. The only way that we can get it is by going outside of the regular discretionary spending process. I guess what this amendment is, more than anything, is there was a book of `Thinking Outside the Box.' We get put in these boxes and sometimes we have to think outside of the box. 
What this amendment does, again, to repeat, to reemphasize what Senator D'Amato said, this research trust fund would work in the following way. Every year, CBO and the Secretary of Health and Human Services would look back to determine whether the annual Medicare and Medicaid savings actually achieved as a result of the changes made by the Balanced Budget Act exceeded the savings called for in the budget resolution. In other words, are there more savings than what was called for to balance the budget? If that is so, if there are excess savings, then that excess savings would be deposited each year into a health research fund to be distributed to NIH for the purposes of medical research. It is a very simple, a very elegant amendment, so offset is needed. 
As we consider long-term changes to the Medicare Program--and we will be--the creation of a medical research trust fund is only common sense. I know a point of order will be made against the amendment that it is not germane. I accept the fact that this amendment is not germane to the bill before us. But I submit to you, it is every bit germane to the issue of saving Medicare and how we are going to deal with Medicare. 
A number of recent studies have shown that investments in medical research can lower Medicare costs through the development of more cost-effective treatments and by delaying the onset of illnesses. Duke University recently did a study that said the financial crisis in Medicare can be resolved without raising taxes or cutting benefits by improving the health of older Americans through biomedical research. It is the key investment, it is the key to reducing health costs in the long run. If we can find cures for things like breast cancer, lung cancer, Alzheimer's, the savings would be enormous. 
Unfortunately, while health care spending devours nearly a trillion dollars annually, our medical research budget is dying of starvation. The United States devotes less than 2 percent of its total health care budget to health research. 
Look at it this way, the Defense Department spends 15 percent of its budget on research, and yet, in health care, we spend less than 2 percent. So we have smart bombs and smart missiles and everything that defends our country, and we are all happy about that, but look what they have done with research. 
If we want a smart bomb and a smart missile to knock out lung cancer or breast cancer or Alzheimer's, or to help us with mental illness, this is where we have to put the money. 
Take Alzheimer's alone: Funding for Alzheimer's research is about $300 million a year. Yet, it is estimated that the 4 million people in America who suffer from Alzheimer's is costing us about $100 billion a year. That is about $25,000 per person who has Alzheimer's on average. If we could just delay the onset of Alzheimer's for 5 years, that would go a long way toward solving our Medicare problems. 
Gene therapy, treatments for cystic fibrosis, Parkinson's--this is a time of great promise. Almost every day new stories are coming out about one advance or another. We are not suffering from a shortfall of ideas. We are suffering from a shortfall of revenues. 
Also, in the last several years the number of young people going into research is declining. The number of people under the age of 36 even applying for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent in the last 10 years. Why? Because when they submit their proposal, it gets peer reviewed. They say it is a good grant, and there is no money. And so young people who would want to pursue research look for other careers. 
Well, again, health research saves money. It saves lives. And the time is right. This fund will allow us to pursue the innovative cures, treatments and therapies that will help us solve the Medicare Program. 
Again, I want to thank my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, and Senator Mack, Senator Specter, with whom I work on the Appropriations Committee, and all the others who have worked so hard. 
This is a very simple and elegant amendment. I hope that Senators will take that step, sort of outside the box, to think newly, to think anew, to think about how we start getting more money into NIH, through a process that will still help us balance the budget as we all voted to do. 
So, Mr. President, again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and urge its adoption.

Mr. HARKIN. I just want to again thank my colleague from New York. 
And I want to say to the Senator from New Mexico, 
again, I know his strong feelings on medical research. We fought side by side in the past when I was privileged to chair the Appropriations Subcommittee in working with the Senator to increase funds for medical research. I know his strong feelings, and I appreciate that. 
Again, I just hope we can sort of think outside the box, as I said earlier, of looking at this and get this money into research. We have to do it, get more money into medical research. I mean, they are starving out there. And the young people who want to go into research--right now, less than 25 percent of the peer-reviewed grants at NIH are being funded. 
I always talk about medical research as sort of like you have doors that are closed. You want to look behind the closed doors. Well, if you only are looking behind one out of every four doors, the odds are four to one that you are not going to find the answer. If you look at two out of four, or three out of four, your odds are a lot better that you are going to find the answer. That is what we are attempting to do with this amendment. 
So, again, I hope that we can have a resolution of this and get on with getting the increased funding for NIH. 
Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator from New Mexico, before I leave, I have two amendments that I would just like to lay down. Should I do those now, send those up?

<TEXT>
Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for many years, I have been working hard to identify and combat fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicare Program. Starting in 1990, when I took over as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds and has jurisdiction over the administrative funding of Medicare, I began holding hearings, and I held several hearings through those years, released report after report, documenting the unnecessary losses to the Medicare Program. These losses are truly staggering. I have taken the floor many times over the last several years to document this for other Senators. The General Accounting Office estimates that up to 10 percent of Medicare payments could be lost to fraud, waste, and abuse. That adds up to about $18 billion a year. 
The HHS inspector general just concluded a comprehensive audit of Medicare claims paid last year. It is the most comprehensive review of claims ever made. They found that up to $23 billion of those payments, or about 14 percent, should not have been paid. This is last year, 1 year. The HHS inspector general said that up to $23 billion should not have been paid. So the problem may even be worse than we originally thought. 
There are many components to this problem. Mr. President, if you can dream up a scam or a ripoff, it has probably already been tried in Medicare. We have uncovered losses due to out-and-out fraud--billing for services that weren't administered, providers paying and receiving kickbacks, double billing. We now even have evidence that organized crime has entered the Medicare fraud business. Clearly, there is a lot of criminal activity that is going on out there which is costing us billions of dollars each year. 
However, we found, with help from the GAO and inspector general, that even greater losses are due to waste and abuse. That's right, waste and abuse is even bigger than fraud in the Medicare Program, and those losses are often directly due to or encouraged by wasteful Medicare payment policies and practices. 
At long last, it appears that the bill before us will address some of the most glaring problems. It would make changes that I have been advocating since the beginning of this decade, changes, I might add, that this body has previously defeated. I have offered amendments on the floor in the past to provide for competitive bidding for Medicare, just like the Veterans Administration has, and I was not successful. 
So now with the competitive bidding, plus a streamlining of Medicare's authority to pare back excessive payment rates, these two steps can cut waste and save taxpayers billions of dollars. I commend Senator Graham of Florida for offering the amendment in committee on competitive bidding. He had cosponsored my proposals in the past. Senator Graham has done us all a great service for his action, and I commend the full committee for adopting it and having it in the bill before us. 
The need for these reforms could not be clearer. Let me just give you an idea of what I am talking about. Last year, I released a report prepared by my staff on waste in Medicare payments for medical supplies. Remember the $500 toilet seats from the Pentagon of a decade or two decades ago? The good news is, the Pentagon isn't buying them anymore. The bad news is, Medicare is. 
Our analysis of Medicare payments for a sample of medical supplies and equipment from saline solution to hospital beds reveals that Medicare is paying up to six times more for these items than other Government or private-sector entities. For just 18 items reviewed, Medicare could save over 50 percent, or up to $236 million this year. Let me repeat that. We reviewed 18 items--just 18--out of the tens of thousands that Medicare pays for. In just those, we could save $236 million this year if we paid the same rates in Medicare as we paid in the Veterans' Administration. Same item. 
If Medicare were just to pay wholesale rates offered to others around the country, it could save $218 million this year. In fact, it was so bad, we found that if Medicare just went down to the local drugstore and paid retail rates, it could save $371 million over the next 7 years; $371 million over 7 years if they just paid retail rates for the 18 items that we looked at. 
For example, we found that Medicare pays up to $182.80 to rent an air mattress, more than six times the wholesale price of $29.95, three times the price of $53.88. 
Medicare is paying $99.35 for a simple commode chair that the VA is able to buy for $24.12. 
Medicare is paying $7.90 for a bottle of sterile saline solution; the VA buys it for $2.38. 
I have a chart here which just shows some of these items and the potential savings. Here is an irrigation syringe which Medicare is paying $2.93 for; the VA is paying $1.89. 
Here is a walker. This is one of those plain walkers that elderly people use. It has four legs on it. Medicare is paying $75.52 for them; the Veterans' Administration is paying $25.40 for the same one, the exact same walker made by the same company. 
A commode chair. You know what a commode chair is; if you can't get to the bathroom, you have it by your bed. Medicare is paying $99.35 for it; the same commode chair, identical, the Veterans' Administration is paying $24.12 for it. 
Here is the sterile saline solution I talked about. Medicare is paying $7.90 for it; the same item, the Veterans Administration is paying $2.38 for it. 
Why? Why would the Veterans' Administration pay $25.40 for a walker that Medicare is paying $75 for? Same item, same town. Why? Because the Veterans' Administration is engaging in good old-fashioned competitive bidding. If you want to sell it, put out a bid for what you are selling it for, we will take the lowest bid. That is why Medicare pays bloated prices based on historical charges and the VA, which has much less purchasing power than Medicare, puts it out for both quality and cost control. So the Veterans' Administration is able to save money, because they use competitive bidding to assure it is getting the best rate possible. 
Right now, under law, Medicare is prohibited--prohibited--from using this measure. Medicare is prohibited from engaging in competitive bidding. But the bill before us now gives them that much-needed authority. It doesn't mandate it. I think we ought to mandate it, but the bill at least gives HCFA the authority to engage in competitive bidding. 
In the hearings that I have held in the past, Mr. Vladeck, the Administrator of HCFA, has testified that if given the authority, they would use it. So I think this will be sufficient and will get the Health Care Financing Administration to start engaging in competitive bidding. 
Another important reform that is in this bill is the streamlining of Medicare's authority to reduce grossly excessive payment for items it purchases. It is called the inherent reasonableness authority. Under current law, the authority is tortuous to complete. As a result, it has only been used once. 
Three years ago, we found that Medicare was paying up to $211 for a home diabetes monitor. At that time, I sent a staff person of mine out to the local K-mart and bought the same item for $49.99 that Medicare was paying $211 for. 
After several hearings, we got Medicare to begin the process of using their authority, the authority that they call inherent reasonableness authority. We got them to use that to reduce this gross overpayment for these blood glucose monitors. It took them 2 full years to go through all of the hurdles set up in the law. They finally reduced the payment to around $50, and that alone is saving taxpayers $25 million over 5 years. But it took 2 years just to get that done. That delay cost taxpayers $10 million. 
The bill before us includes a streamlining of this process that I have been suggesting for years. It would allow Medicare to respond quickly when it finds that it is paying prices that are out of line with what everyone else pays. So I am pleased that this finally is before this body, and I hope it is agreed to. 
Mr. President, I have an amendment that I will be asking to send to the desk, after I give a brief explanation. They are changes that will help to reduce the massive losses due to waste, fraud, and abuse. All of these are based on reports and recommendations by the General Accounting Office and the inspector general of Health and Human Services. I don't believe it will be controversial to anyone, and I hope it will be accepted by the managers of the bill. 
First of all, Mr. President, the first part of the amendment has to do with improving information to beneficiaries. Under current law, beneficiaries are sent a statement, an explanation of charges and payments. They are brief summaries of the actual bills and payments. There are several shortcomings of these current statements that are sent to beneficiaries. The first thing that you will notice, if you look at a statement, it says in big bold letters: `This is not a bill.' 
So you are an elderly person, you get this, it says, `This is not a bill.' Hey, I get a lot of things in the mail that is not a bill. I'm not going to worry about it. So many beneficiaries don't take the time to examine them for the mistakes. In addition, the statements do not provide the number of the toll-free hot line operated by the Medicare contractor to receive reports of errors or fraud or abuse. Finally, there is no requirement that beneficiaries can get copies of complete itemized bills submitted by providers. 
So what my amendment does is it requires that each explanation of benefits sent to beneficiaries, including the statement, because billing errors do occur and there is significant waste, fraud, and abuse, that the beneficiary should carefully review the statement for errors or other questionable billings and report those to Medicare. 
It also requires that the statement include the toll-free hotline number to report the suspected problems. These toll-free lines already exist. I am not setting anything up that does not exist. They already exist, but many seniors do not know about it. All I am saying is, the phone number ought to be put on the statement of benefits. 
My amendment provides that a beneficiary may, if they request, be provided an itemized bill within 30 days of their request when the beneficiary suspects irregularities from having read the summary provided to them. 
My amendment also requires that any specific allegations of errors or other problems made by beneficiaries based on a review of the itemized bill be reviewed and any appropriate recoveries made for the trust fund. 
Second, Mr. President, Medicare payments are supposed to be limited to those that are reasonable, necessary, and related to patient care. That is the law, and those are the regulations. However, while most other Federal agencies specifically prohibit indirect cost allowances for gifts, entertainment expenses, education costs for spouses and dependents, Medicare does not prohibit this. 
In addition, Medicare does not explicitly prohibit indirect cost reimbursement for fines and other penalties imposed by Federal, State, or local governments on health care providers. As such, providers can escape a fine by simply charging them back to Medicare. Well, as documented by the General Accounting Office and the Office of Inspector General, this lack of clarity in Medicare policy invites confusion and abuse. 
For example, a report by the Office of Inspector General found that Medicare had been billed for a portion of the cost of a sailing regatta for hospital employees, reimbursement for ballet tickets, reimbursement for Tiffany crystal pitchers, reimbursement even for a trip to Italy to inspect a piece of art for an executive office. 
This amendment explicitly prohibits Medicare reimbursement for indirect costs related to entertainment, gifts, donations, personal use of motor vehicles, costs for fines and penalties, and tuition for spouses or dependents of health care providers. In other words, it brings it into line with other Federal law. 
The next part of my amendment goes to the losses due to frequently abused items. Currently under the law, the Secretary may--may; does not say `shall'--may make a list of medical supply and equipment items that she finds to be frequently subject to unnecessary utilization. In other words, you see something popping up all the time, it keeps being utilized, well, the Secretary may develop a list of suppliers found to have business practices that result in a pattern of utilization. 
So the Secretary's power is she may. The Secretary has failed to use this authority, thereby missing potential for significant savings. I do not mean to point at this Secretary. The Secretary before this one did not use it either. And therein lies the problem. 
My amendment simply changes the word `may' to `shall' and requires the Secretary to develop the list of overutilized medical supply items and questionable suppliers. 
Lastly, in OBRA 1993, it provided for certain medical supplies, including surgical dressings, to be reimbursed based on a fee schedule. As a result, providers must submit to fiscal intermediaries claims that itemize the specific supplies and quantities billed. However, this provision does not apply to items billed by home health care agencies. So since 1993, for certain medical supplies, like surgical dressings, reimbursed on a fee 
schedule, it does not apply to home health agencies. 
Now, in addition, current law prohibits the Secretary--prohibits the Secretary--from using her inherent reasonableness authority to reduce grossly excessive payment rates for surgical dressings. Why that was left out we do not know, but it was left out. 
The General Accounting Office has documented that these two exceptions to Medicare law result in considerable unnecessary losses. They found, for example, that items as diverse as pacemakers were being billed as medical supplies, and those claims were paid because Medicare does not know what specific items they are being billed for. 
In addition, the GAO found that payments for surgical dressings could be reduced by half if more reasonable prices were paid. For example, they found that Medicare pays $2.32 for a gauze pad whose wholesale price is 19 cents and that another Government agency buys for 4 cents, in this case the Veterans' Administration. Again, Medicare is paying $2.32 for a gauze pad; the VA is paying 4 cents for the same one. 
My amendment would say the home health agencies would be required to submit to fiscal intermediaries claims that itemize the specific supplies and the quantities billed for surgical dressings. All other providers are currently required to do the same, but not home health agencies. Mine would just bring the home health agencies in under this umbrella. 
Finally, the loophole that for some reason is there that excludes surgical dressings from the Secretary's inherent reasonableness authority would be closed. She would have that authority to pay on a reasonable basis, to get that down to the same level that the Veterans' Administration is paying. 
Mr. President, I am going to be asking unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and lay down my amendment. We are now discussing it with the Finance Committee. I am hopeful it can be cleared without the need for a vote in the next day or two.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, June 17, I was unable to vote. I would have voted `yes' on the Lugar amendment No. 382 to S. 903, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997. 
I believe that the United States should pay our debt to the United Nations. However, I also believe that change and reform in the United Nations are essential if the United Nations is to be revitalized. The U.S. dues for the regular U.N. budget and for international peacekeeping should be reduced. These cost-saving goals can be achieved but we will have to convince our allies and friends, who will have to bear a larger portion of the costs as our contributions decline, that we are serious about our leadership and our compliance with our obligations. That is why I believe that Senator Lugar offered a reasonable solution to wipe the slate clean of our arrears and clear the way to pursue the U.N. reforms that will make it a more viable institution. 
I am hopeful that when this bill emerges from the conference committee the 38 benchmarks mandated in title XXII of the bill as pre-conditions for our payment will be addressed and corrected.

The need for child care continues to grow, 60 percent of women in the workforce have children under 6 years of age. Moreover, hard working families throughout Iowa and across America are struggling to meet the escalating costs of child care. A family with a preschool-age child spent an average of $15 more per week on child care in 1993 than in 1986. Currently, average child care costs for a working family in Iowa run about $3,000 to $6,000 per year. 
Today, there is a child care tax credit available for many working families--but that credit hasn't been increased since 1982--and it wasn't even adequate then. Inflation has reduced the value of the credit by about 60 percent since it was last adjusted in 1982. Under current law, families with $10,000 in adjusted gross income are eligible for a 30-percent credit on the first $2,400 in child care expenses for one child or $4,800 for two children. The credit phases down to 20 percent at $28,000 and all incomes above that level. Because the child care tax credit is not refundable, few families actually qualify for the full 30 percent credit under current law. Families with an income of less than $10,000 do not have a tax liability against which they can apply the credit. 
This legislation would expand the child care tax credit and make it available for more working families. The amount of child care expenses eligible for the credit would be increased to $4,000 for one child or other dependent and $8,000 for two or more dependents. For example, my proposal would provide a 30-percent refundable credit for working couples with an adjusted gross income of up to $50,000 on the first $8,000 in child care expenses for two or more children or other dependents. For families earning between $50,000 and $80,000, the credit gradually phases down to current level. Families earning more than $80,000 would be eligible for the same level of benefits they receive under current law. 
Although we must continue our efforts to reach a balanced budget, we must also realize that American families with child or dependent care expenses deserve a tax break. But I am not talking about doling out huge new tax breaks for those on top who don't need it. This legislation is targeted directly to families in the middle--they are not on welfare and they are not rich. They work hard, they care about their families and their jobs, and they deserve a break.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. Today, I am introducing, on behalf of myself, Senators Hutchinson, Reid, Bryan, and Rockefeller, the Social Security Consumer Protection Act. This is a simple, commonsense legislation that will arm consumers with the information they need to protect themselves from a growing type of consumer scam. 
Several years ago Congress took an important step toward stamping out frauds against older Americans. We passed a law making it illegal for companies to prey upon senior citizens and others by misrepresenting an affiliation with Social Security or Medicare. After some delay, the Social Security inspector general has begun to enforce this important new consumer protection law. However, we are finding that many scam artists are squirming through a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unwitting consumers for services that are available free of charge from Social Security or Medicare. 
A recent investigation by my staff found that unsuspecting consumers--from new parents to senior citizens--are falling prey to con artists charging them for services that are available free of charge from the Social Security Administration. Many of the schemes involve use of materials and names which mislead consumers into believing that the scam artists are affiliated with the federal government. 
Companies operating under official sounding names like Federal Document Services, Federal Record Service Corp., National Records Service, and U.S. Document Services are mailing information to thousands of unsuspecting Americans, including many Iowans. These companies are scaring people into remitting a fee to receive basic Social Security benefits and eligibility information such as a new Social Security number and card for a baby and changing names upon marriage or divorce. 
We began to look into this problem based on a number of complaints from Iowans who had received these deceptive mailings. One example was sent to me by Deb Conlee of Fort Dodge. She received a mailing from a company called Document Service. The official looking letter starts: `Read Carefully: Important Facts about your Social Security Card. The response envelope is stamped `SSA-7701' giving the impression that it is connected with the Social Security Administration. The solicitation goes on to say that she is required to provide Social Security with any name change associated with her recent marriage and get a new Social Security card. It then urges her to send them $14.75 to do this. It says, `We urge you to do this immediately to help avoid possible problems where your Social Security benefits or joint income taxes might be questioned.' 
Ms. Conlee paid $60 to this company and was furious when she learned that she could have gotten the same services free of charge from Social Security. 
Last year I asked Social Security Commissioner Shirley Chater to investigate the complaints of Iowans and those of consumers like her. She responded that the services provided by Document Service `are completely unnecessary. Not only do they fail to produce any savings of time or effort for the customer, they also tend to delay issuance of the new Social Security card.' While it is now illegal for a company to imply any direct connection with Social Security or Medicare in mailings, it is not illegal to charge for the very same services that are available at no cost from the government. 
So while Congress has acted to try and stop scam artists from trying to fool people into thinking their business is somehow affiliated with Social Security, Medicare, or some other government agency, many are skirting around the edges of this law and are conning consumers into paying for services that they can get free of charge. Nowhere in any of the mailings from these outfits that I have reviewed is there any mention that the services they offer are in fact available to consumers at no cost from the government. 
The Social Security Consumer Protection Act would require that any such solicitation prominently display the following consumer alert: `IMPORTANT PUBLIC DISCLOSURE: The product or service described here and assistance to obtain the product or service is available free of charge from the Social Security Administration or the Department of Health and Human Services.' Armed with this information, consumers would be able to make informed decisions about where to obtain the service they need or want. Companies found to be in violation of this simple requirement would face fines. 
Our legislation would not stop the provision of services by private companies. Rather, it would simply make sure that consumers are fully informed, so that they can make an informed choice about where and how they prefer to receive certain services. 
These scams must be put to an end. A simple change in the law would go a long way toward stopping them. The bill we are introducing today would make such a change without imposing an undue burden on legitimate businesses or restricting consumer freedom of choice.

Mr. President, first, I rise on another topic, but I want to say to the Senator from North Dakota that I fully empathize and sympathize with him on his position. The flood about which my colleague from Illinois spoke a few minutes ago is the same flood that devastated Iowa in 1993. This Congress and the President came to the assistance of the people of Iowa in a very rapid measure. To this day, the people of Iowa talk about how rapidly the funds got out there, the Government was there to help. 
And the same thing should apply to any disaster anywhere. And it should apply in North Dakota also. 
I want to say to my colleague from North Dakota, he is right on the mark. This legislation ought to get through. The money ought to be sent out without all these other political ramifications. So I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota. Again, his position is the correct one. We ought to get the money through here. And we should not be loading it down with political considerations.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take the floor today with a couple of my colleagues to note a very important anniversary. 
Mr. President, 34 years ago today, on June 10, 1963, President John F. Kennedy delivered a historic address at American University here in Washington, DC, regarding the need for the vigorous pursuit of peace. He declared that the United States has a critical interest in limiting the testing of nuclear weapons. We wanted to mark that occasion today by talking about the need to continue that progress and to bring to completion President Kennedy's dream and goal of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
I yield at this time to my colleague from Illinois for his unanimous-consent request and for any comments he wants to make. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague from Illinois for his very eloquent remarks and for reminding us of just how much we are spending. Even yet today, to maintain this nuclear stockpile, the United States spends roughly $30 billion a year. That is just about three times the amount that we are spending on all medical research at the National Institutes of Health, to find the causes and cures of things like heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's disease. Three times what we are spending on this arsenal than all medical research. We are trying to come up with money for NIH. 
We had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution last week--98 to 0--to support a doubling of funding for NIH. That would bring it up to about $25 billion a year, not even up to this level. Yet we do not have the money to even get about a 4 or 5 percent increase at NIH. 
I thank the Senator from Illinois for his eloquent comments. 
I want to also yield to the Senator from Rhode Island for his comments on this topic and thank him for being involved in this discussion on the floor of the Senate. This is an important anniversary. It must be noted. And we must mark it as hopefully the last anniversary in this long journey to get a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
I just say to my friend from Rhode Island and my friend from Illinois, that President Kennedy during that famous speech, 34 years ago today, at American University, called for an end to nuclear testing, and then proceeded to negotiate with the then-Soviet Union and others for a ban on atmospheric testing. Four months later this Senate ratified a ban on all atmospheric testing--4 months. And then here we have been 34 years to get to a comprehensive test ban. 
So if they could do that in 4 months, I would think now, certainly before the end of this year, we could bring this to a closure. 
I yield to my friend and my colleague from Rhode Island.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. 
I thank my colleague from Rhode Island again for continuing to be involved in this discussion, for his leadership in the House and now in the Senate on the total issue of arms control and especially on the issue of the test ban treaty. 
Mr. President, let me continue for a little bit to talk some more about the aspects of this treaty and why it is so important that we ratify it this year. 
Again, to recap, 34 years ago today, on June 10, 1963, President Kennedy made a historic speech at American University here in Washington, DC. He talked about the need for a test ban treaty to limit the number of nuclear weapons tests. Four months after that, President Kennedy negotiated with the Soviet Union, signed and secured ratification from the United States Senate for the limited test ban treaty that banned all atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons. So, since October 1963, the two nations have had no atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons. 
But President Kennedy's goal was not just atmospheric tests. His goal was to ban all nuclear weapons tests. As President Kennedy said on June 10, a comprehensive test ban treaty `would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards * * * the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security; it would decrease the prospects of war.' That is a quote from President Kennedy's speech at American University 34 years ago. 
Mr. President, completion of a global nuclear test ban treaty negotiations has been a central nuclear arms control objective for more than 40 years. This long-awaited goal was finally won just last September, September 24, 1996, when the United States and other countries signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the CTBT as it is called, a treaty consistently supported by more than 80 percent of the American public. 
Now, we in the Senate must ensure that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is ratified here in the Senate and by 43 other nuclear-capable countries so that it formally enters into force. 
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a major milestone in the effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It would establish a permanent ban on all nuclear explosions in all environments for any purpose. It's zero-yield prohibition on nuclear tests would help to halt the development and deployment of new nuclear weapons. The treaty would also establish a far-reaching verification program that includes a global network of sophisticated seismic, hydro-acoustic, radionuclide monitoring stations, as well as on-site inspection of test sites to deter and detect violations. 
I might just add here, Mr. President, one of the important reasons for getting this treaty ratified as soon as possible is that under this regime, newly emerging nations that may be wanting to develop a nuclear weapon will find it thousands of times more difficult to do so. I will not put myself in a position of saying it will be absolutely impossible, nothing is 100 percent perfect, but many of these smaller nations that may want to have a nuclear weapon are going to need a small nuclear weapon. They will need some of the latest technology in order to have it delivered in a vehicle that they have in their possession or that they might soon acquire. To do that would require testing. If they cannot do the testing, then they cannot acquire the latest technology in nuclear weapon design and construction. 
Mr. President, in 1991, the Soviet Union announced a unilateral nuclear weapons test moratorium. In 1992, the House and Senate passed legislation establishing a 9-month U.S. moratorium with restrictions on the number and purpose of any further U.S. tests and a prohibition on U.S. tests after September 30, 1996, unless another nation conducts a test. 
In 1993, President Clinton, with advice from the armed services, the nuclear weapons laboratories, and the Energy Department, determined that the U.S. nuclear arsenal was safe and reliable without further testing. On July 3 of that year, he announced he would extend the test moratorium and agree to begin multilateral test ban negotiations in January of 1994. 
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was negotiated over more than 2 years at the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. A key turning point occurred in 1995, when our Nation's leading nuclear weapons scientific advisors concluded that our nuclear 
weapons stockpile is safe and reliable and that even low-yield weapons tests are unnecessary, even the so-called safety tests intended to guard against defects that could lead to accidental warhead detonations. 
Spurred by the independent JASON scientific group's report that the United States nuclear arsenal is safe and reliable without testing, and spurred further by the international outcry when the French resumed nuclear testing after a 3-year hiatus, the United States and France then adopted a zero-yield test ban position in the nuclear weapons test ban talks. 
So, by August 1996, the negotiations produced a final nuclear weapons test ban treaty text supported by all countries except one, all countries except India, and India sought to include in the treaty a timetable for eliminating all nuclear weapons and, again, India would find its own nuclear weapons development program limited by a ban on testing. So, to overcome one nation's opposition, Australia proposed--and more than 100 other countries supported--a resolution endorsing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a zero-yield test ban, which was submitted to the U.N. General Assembly and passed by the overwhelming margin of 158-3 on September 10, 1996. 
Now, for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to formally enter into force, it must be ratified by 44 named signatory nations, including the five declared nuclear weapons states and the three undeclared nuclear weapons states--India, Israel, and Pakistan. The U.S. ratification requires, of course, a two-thirds vote by the U.S. Senate. However, until the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty does enter into force, all signatories, including the United States, are bound by article XVIII of the Vienna Convention on Treaties not to undertake any action that violates the purpose or intent of the treaty. In other words, the signatory nations shall not test nuclear weapons. 
That is sort of the recent history. Now, what is the next step? Well, several key steps must now be taken. Before the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty can be considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the full Senate, the Clinton administration must submit the articles of ratification and must reach agreement with the Senate leadership to begin formal consideration of the treaty. The treaty must also become a priority for the administration and for the U.S. Senate. The Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and the Senate in its whole must then proceed with a thorough examination of the treaty and to vote on it. In the end, I believe the Senate will agree that ratification of the treaty is in our country's national security interests just as President Kennedy said 34 years ago today. 
The Senator from Illinois mentioned that conservatively we are spending about $30 billion a year now to maintain our nuclear stockpile. I wondered how much we had spent over the intervening years. It turns out that from right after the end of World War II until now, the United States has spent more than $300 billion --that is billion with a `b'--$300 billion, about a third of a trillion dollars, for nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons materials. That does not include the cost of all the delivery vehicles--that is, all of the missiles, the silos we build, the Minutemans and the Titans--and it does not include the cost of all the B-52 bombers, the B-47 bombers, the B-2 bombers, and the B-1 bombers. It does not include that. It does not include the cost of all the submarines, all the Polaris and later the Trident submarines. That probably would come to hundreds of billions more. I am talking just about nuclear weapons material alone, and the weapons themselves--$300 billion approximately that we have spent, and now about $30 billion a year. As I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, that is 2 1/2 times what we are spending on all medical research in the National Institutes of Health. We are spending 2 1/2 times every year to maintain the nuclear stockpile than we are spending on all biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health. That is not right, and that is why 
it is time to conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
President Kennedy said 34 years ago today that the negotiations for a ban on above-ground nuclear tests were in sight, and he implored the Nation and the international community to bring that treaty to a conclusion. As I said, 4 months later, the agreement was reached and the atmospheric test ban treaty became a reality--in just 4 months at the height of the cold war. 
The Soviet Union no longer exists. We have relations with Russia, open relations. We visit their military establishments; they visit ours. We now have an agreement where they will be an adviser to NATO. Well, now it is time for us to conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It has been around a long time. Now we are at the point where we can bring it to its final conclusion. 
President Clinton must adopt the same attitude that President Kennedy adopted in 1963. He must insist on a quick closure, to make it a top priority of his administration to get the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ratified by the Senate this year. It is in our best interests. It would help secure our planet from nuclear threats. It would go a long way toward ensuring that newly emerging nations do not get their hands on the nuclear trigger and would begin the process of getting rid of, over a period of time, the nuclear stockpiles that we have and saving all of that money that we are now spending and, hopefully, putting that money into important endevors such as medical research. 
Well, the end is in sight. We soon can have in hand a comprehensive ban on all nuclear weapons tests. 
Mr. President, sometimes it boggles the mind to think of how many nuclear tests we have had in the past. Nuclear tests worldwide, underground tests, 1,517, with the United States doing 815, the old Soviet Union doing 496, France doing 160, Britain 24, China 22, and India 1. 
Atmospheric testing: 528 atmospheric tests prior to 1963, with the United States doing 215, the Soviet Union doing 219, France doing 50, Britain, 21, and China, 23. Total, all tests: 2,046. 
A sad, sad chapter in the history of humankind; a terrible toll that it has taken not only economically from America and other countries by what we have spent, but I think it has taken a terrible toll environmentally. 
Much of the money that we spend now through the Department of Energy for our nuclear weapons stockpile is spent on cleaning up the mess that was made, first, through the production of nuclear materials; second, through the refining of these nuclear materials, and the processing; third, through the storage; and, of course, fourth, through the underground testing. 
So we are spending today, and we will continue to spend in our lifetimes, billions of dollars just to clean up the mess that has been made. 
There is another mess that has been made that we are paying for dearly. All those atmospheric tests that I mentioned--528 of them--each and every one of those produced in the atmosphere large amounts of plutonium and other toxic materials. I have seen estimates that tons of plutonium were released during all of these tests into the atmosphere, in the food chain, and in sea life. The half-life of plutonium is tens of thousands of years. And, yet, we know it is one of the most carcinogenic materials known to mankind. One microscopic piece of plutonium can cause cancer. 
Who knows how much plutonium is embedded into the ground and into the soils from the underground tests, how much of that plutonium may find itself to underground aquifers later on in the evolution of our planet? 
We are paying a terrible price for this sad chapter of our history. We shouldn't pay the price any longer. Now is the time to end testing once and for all and close the books on it. 
I call upon President Clinton to make this a priority of his administration this year. I call upon the majority leader of the Senate and the minority leader of the Senate to make it a priority for the U.S. Senate this year that we debate and vote on the comprehensive test ban treaty. I call upon the chairman and the vice chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as soon as the President sends this down, to take it up, to investigate it, to debate it fully, and to vote on it and report it to the floor of the Senate. 
This must be a priority. We must do it this year. Let's make this 34th anniversary of President Kennedy's speech at American University the last anniversary before we have a completion of what he called a ban on all nuclear testing.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Health Care Protection and Improvement Act of 1997. This legislation is critical to the survival of the fragile health care systems and infrastructure in rural areas and small towns across America. 
Rural Americans are more often poor, more often uninsured, and more often without access to health care than other Americans. The health care system in many small towns in Iowa is on the critical list--we have too few doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals and many of our rural hospitals are barely making it. 
Iowa ranks first in the percentage of citizens over age 85 and third nationally in the percentage of the population over age 65. Because of our demographics our health care providers in Iowa depend heavily on Medicare payments. And many of them are struggling. One reason they are struggling is because of the gross inequities between rural and urban Medicare payment rates. In fact, the House Ways and Means Committee recently published a report estimating that Iowa loses $0.7 billion a year because of current Medicare payment policies. The higher cost of living in areas such as New York City and Miami in no way justifies the huge disparity in payment rates. The current system rewards waste and inefficiency and penalizes States like Iowa whose health care providers practice a conservative, cost-effective approach to health care. 
The legislation I am introducing today would correct this wrong-headed system. This bill would make Medicare payments to managed care plans fairer for rural areas by readjusting the AAPCC so that rates are more equitable between rural and urban areas. 
But even more importantly, this bill corrects the inequities in the regular fee-for-service Medicare Program. AAPCC rates are unfair because they are tied directly to Medicare fee-for-service payments, and fee-for-service payments are very low in rural areas. 
Even with a correction in managed care payments, over two-thirds of Iowa seniors will likely continue to receive care under the standard fee-for-service system. This bill corrects fee-for-service rates, so that seniors in rural areas will at last be able to receive the quality and access to health care they deserve. 
Mr. President, my legislation would also reauthorize and extend the Rural Health Transition Grant Program. This grant program helps small rural hospitals and their communities adapt to the changing health care marketplace. Specifically, the grants help hospitals adjust to reductions in the need for inpatient services and increased demand for outpatient and emergency services and help rural hospitals meet the increasingly difficult task of recruiting staff. 
Rural hospitals use these funds for a variety of programs. For example, Marengo Memorial Hospital, Mitchell County Hospital, Franklin General in Hampton, and Kossuth County Hospital as well as other hospitals used funds to help develop rural health care networks. Pochahontas Community Hospital and Community Memorial Hospital in Sumner used funds to recruit health professionals and Holy Family Hospital in Estherville used funds to improve emergency services. 
These grants are provided over 3 years. They represent a small but vital source of revenue for hospitals struggling to adjust to a new health care environment. Unfortunately, these grants were not reauthorized last year, and there are many hospitals that were promised transition grant funds but for whom the money is no longer available. This legislation would help ensure that these few hospitals are able to finish out their grants and meet the changing needs of their patients and communities. 
Mr. President, the health care system is undergoing tremendous change and our rural hospitals must adjust to this new environment. The Transition Grant Program helps hospitals modify the type and extent of services so they can better serve rural communities. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing will help improve access and enhance the quality of health care in rural areas. And it will help shore up the fragile health care infrastructure in our rural communities and small towns.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in introducing an important women's health initiative. The DES Research and Education Amendments of 1997 would extend and expand our effort to assist the over 5 million Americans who have been exposed to the drug, DES. Representative Louise Slaughter, a long-time leader on this issue, is introducing companion legislation today in the other body. 
Between 1938 and 1971, some 5 million American women were given the synthetic drug, diethylstilbestrol, commonly known as DES. Women were given the drug during pregnancy in the mistaken belief it would help prevent miscarriage. The drug was pulled from the market based on studies that found that it was ineffective and might result in damage to children born to the women who had been given it. 
Since the 1970's, studies have shown that DES does damage the reproductive systems of those exposed in utero and increases these individuals' risk for cancer, infertility, and a wide range of other serious reproductive tract disorders. The women exposed in utero to DES are five times more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy and three times more likely to miscarry when they in turn try to have children. Studies also show that one of every thousand women exposed to DES in utero will develop clear cell cancer. Women who took DES have also been found to face a higher risk for breast cancer. 
In 1992, while there had been a number of research studies on DES exposure and its effects, much more research was necessary. That year, President Bush signed legislation introduced by myself and Representative Slaughter, that mandated a significant increase in DES research supported by the National Institutes of Health [NIH]. Our legislation also required NIH to support long-term studies of Americans impacted by this drug. Those studies are now underway and must be continued. The legislation we are introducing today will ensure that this critical medical research continues. In addition, there is now preliminary evidence that the grandkids of women who took DES may also be at higher risk for certain health problems, and this legislation would help ensure that further research into this is supported. 
Another major problem in this area is that millions of Americans don't know the risks they face because of their exposure to DES. Many health professionals who see these people also lack sufficient information about DES exposure and the appropriate steps that should be taken to identify and assist their patients. As a result, many people do not seek or get the appropriate preventive care or take appropriate preventive measures to reduce their risks of adverse affects. For example, women exposed to DES in utero and therefore at higher risk of miscarriage may be able to reduce their risks with appropriate precautionary steps. 
In an initial attempt to address this need for better information, our 1992 legislation required NIH to test ways to educate the public and health professionals about how to deal with DES exposure. The legislation we are introducing today would give people across the Nation access to the information developed through these pilot programs by requiring a national consumer and health professional education effort.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to speak today in behalf of Robert Pratt, to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. 
I have known Bob and his wonderful family for almost 25 years. I met him when we were both fresh out of law school. We landed jobs at the Polk County Legal Aid Society. And it was this experience that made a permanent impression on me. 
Since that time, Bob has dedicated his life to using the law to improve people's lives, their communities and their future. He is currently in private practice in Des Moines and continues to devote his practice to the legal needs of lower income and economically disadvantaged Iowans. 
Bob Pratt is, quite simply, one of the best public interest lawyers in the country. And his respect for the rule of the law and his faith in our country's system of justice is truly inspiring. 
I believe that Bob possesses all of the qualifications necessary to assume the very serious responsibilities carried out by any Federal judge. He has the temperament, the intellectual rigor, the compassion, and the ability to be fair and impartial. 
I am also proud to say that Bob enjoys bipartisan support from the Iowa legal community. Robert Downer, former President of the Iowa State Bar Association, and a Republican, states: `It has been my privilege to be acquainted with Mr. Pratt for some time, and I regard him very highly both personally and professionally. With the heavy caseload in the Southern District of Iowa it will be of great benefit to litigants in that court if he can be confirmed without delay.' 
Mr. President, I am proud to continue Iowa's fine tradition of judicial selection based upon merit. I believe Bob Pratt reflects very proudly on all of us who have chosen to be public servants. And I have no doubt that he will make an excellent U.S. District judge for the Southern District of Iowa.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the Bible says, `To every thing there is a season, a time to break down and a time to build up.' 
The unfortunate truth is that too many of our Nation's schools have broken down. It is long past the time for us to build our schools back up--literally. 
You have heard my colleague from Illinois cite some of the details--$112 billion is needed across this country to rebuild, repair and renovate schools. Some 14 million children attend school daily in facilities that are unsafe and inadequate. To put this in some perspective, this is almost five times the population of the entire State of Iowa. 
This as a national problem and needs a national response. A Federal program to assist needy communities in rebuilding schools will not and should not circumvent the primary local and State control of education. However, I firmly believe the Federal Government needs to become a better partner for States and local communities with respect to education, in general, and construction of school facilities, in particular. 
Senator Mosely-Braun has done a good job talking about the need nationally. I want to take a few moments to talk about the state of school facilities in my State. 
Iowans take great pride in education. Our State has a long tradition of placing a high value on education. In fact, Iowa students often lead the Nation in performance on national and even international assessments. This is a tribute to the teachers, families, school boards, administrators, and State policymakers who have made education a top priority for decades. I applaud the commitment that Iowa has made to education. However, we still have much to do. 
The General Accounting Office report found that 79 percent of Iowa schools report a need to repair or upgrade buildings to bring them up to overall good condition. 
Like many of my colleagues, I frequently visit schools in my State. I am often struck by the fact that many schools have not changed much since I was a student. We won't talk about how long ago that was. 
However, our homes, offices, shopping centers, cars and just about every thing else has changed radically. However, reinvestment and renovations have not been made to our Nation's schools. As a result, we are trying to prepare our children for the 21st century in facilities that hardly make the grade in the last one. We can certainly do better than that. 
In 1994, Senator Mosely-Braun secured legislation to authorize funding for school infrastructure. At that time, I served as chairman of the education appropriations subcommittee and provided $100 million for new school infrastructure. I was very disappointed when that modest downpayment was rescinded the following year. 
A problem that was a critical need then, has gotten even worse. In 1995, Iowa State University conducted a comprehensive survey about the condition of school buildings in the state and estimated that $3.4 billion is needed to repair and rebuild these facilities. This survey was updated a few months ago and the tab has risen to $4 billion. 
This is a problem that gets worse by the day and the impact on high quality learning is significant. It is long past time for the Federal Government to step up to the plate and help remedy this problem. 
The amendment I am offering with the Senator from Illinois is a very important response to this urgent national concern. We believe that children in a nation as rich as ours should not have to attend schools that look more like they belong in the third world. We implore our colleagues to help us provide a modest sum to rebuild our crumbling schools. 
Mr. President, I am fully aware that many of my colleagues will say that this problem is just too big for the Federal Government to handle. Our critics will point out that the need is enormous--$112 billion and we are proposing a $5 billion solution. However, this plan will generate $20 billion in newschool construction. To provide this additional funding we simply call for closing additional tax loopholes. 
Our amendment continues to build on the positive aspects of this budget. The underlying legislation increases funding for activities related to education and training by 13 percent over the next 5 years by calling for expanded access to Head Start and increased funding for Pell grants. In addition, the budget makes changes to the Tax Code to help Americans pay for college by providing tuition tax credits and deductions for postsecondary education. These investments are vital to the future of the United States and our ability to remain competitive in the international marketplace. 
The problems facing school facilities across our Nation are enormous and will not be solved overnight. However, as they say, Rome wasn't built in a day. Further, if we had that attitude in the 1950's we would not have built the Interstate Highway system or put a man on the Moon in 1969. As we know, every journey begins with one step. 
This is a very important step for us to take. One that will help provide safe, sound learning environments for millions of children. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, the chairman, Senator Specter, to support this important amendment. Yesterday the Senate went on record in support of doubling research at NIH with the adoption of the Mack sense-of-the-Senate amendment, a unanimous vote last time. This amendment that Senator Spector is offering is a modest first step toward making good on that commitment. 
Senator Specter said the amendment would add $1.1 billion to the health account to restore, first of all, the $100 million cut 
contained in the resolution and additional moneys to enable our subcommittee to provide adequate funding for NIH and other health programs. Without our amendment, it will be virtually impossible to provide even an inflation adjustment for medical research in the year 1998. 
Mr. President, the resolution before us, despite the other merits, is, to put it kindly, extremely shortsighted when it comes to support for finding cures and more cost-effective treatment and prevention for the many diseases and disabilities that affect us. In so doing, it shortchanges our future, shortchanges Americans' health, and shortchanges efforts to control health care costs and keep Medicare solvent in the long run. At the same time we are shortchanging basic investments in health care, the Pentagon gets another multibillion-dollar increase. Here is a chart right here that will show you. Here is the shifting priorities. This is our budget agreement versus last year's spending. 
Defense gets $3.2 billion more; health gets $100 million cut. Wrong priorities. 
Another way of looking at it is to see what is happening with our spending on discretionary health funding. The President's budget had $25.3 billion; the 1997 budget was $25 billion; the budget agreement is $24.9 billion. That is where that missing $100 million is. We are going in the wrong direction in spending for basic research in this country. 
Let me just give a couple of examples to show the folly of what we are doing. Last year, the federally supported research on Alzheimer's disease totaled about $300 million. Yet it is estimated that we spend about $90 billion annually caring for people with Alzheimer's. In other words, for every $100 we spend caring for people with Alzheimer's we are spending about 3 pennies on research for Alzheimer's. Supported research on diabetes is about $290 million a year, yet it is estimated we spend over $25 billion on diabetes care. Mental health, research is about $613 million a year, estimated $130 billion a year spent annually on mental health care. 
So, these penny-wise and pound-foolish statistics are even more illogical today. We are at a time of great promise. Just about every day we read about new discoveries and new breakthroughs, new therapies and new treatment strategies. We are making progress. But, while we aren't suffering from a shortfall of ideas, we are suffering from a shortfall of resources. I have often made this analogy, when it comes to medical research. It is like we have 10 doors and they are all closed. We want to find out what is behind those doors. If you look behind one door, the odds are 10 to 1 you are not going to find what you are looking for. Right now, we are funding less than 25 percent of the peer reviewed, accepted grant proposals at NIH. That means we may be looking behind door No. 1, but doors 2, 3, and 4 are still closed. 
That is the odds. They are not good odds we are going to find the right treatments, strategies, cures, interventions. `Let's Make A Deal' had better odds than that. Maybe there is a cure for breast cancer behind door 3, or Alzheimer's behind door No. 4, or Parkinson's behind door No. 2, but we don't know because we aren't committing the resources to unlock those doors. 
There is another impact that lack of medical research funding has. Young people, maybe looking ahead, thinking about pursuing a career in medical research, yet they see the resources are not there to let them do long-term research. So the doors are locked to the cures but so are the doors to careers. 
Our lack of investment in research is discouraging people from pursuing careers in medical research. Here is a figure. The number of people under the age of 36 applying for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993. 
I know there are a lot of factors, but we believe that the lower success rate among all applicants is making biomedical research less and less attractive to young people. This amendment, by Senator Specter, provides a very modest downpayment on what is needed. It begins to put us on the right path, the path that we 
committed to last night unanimously by adopting the Mack amendment. This amendment today will have a real impact on efforts to support medical research. But let me be clear, even with adoption of this amendment we can't get the job done. The budget resolution before us makes it clear that the only way we can devote the resources we need to help research, to help health research and stop robbing Peter to pay Paul is by going outside of the regular discretionary spending process. 
This resolution calls for $24.2 billion in discretionary health spending by the year 2002. That includes NIH, CDC, Community Health Centers, Older Americans Act, health professional training, maternal and child health care, and on and on. To double funding for NIH, as this body committed to do last night, would cost over $26 billion by the year 2002. That is $2 billion more than the entire health function is allotted by the year 2002. 
So even if you eliminated all funding for breast cancer screening, Meals on Wheels for seniors, drug treatment, Older Americans Act, community health centers, and on and on, if you eliminated all of that, this budget resolution would still not enable us to meet the goal that we said last night by a vote of 98 to 0 that we wanted to meet by the year 2002, which is to double NIH funding. 
The only way we are going to get this is through another mechanism. I believe the best other mechanism is called for in S. 441, National Fund for Health Research Act, that Senator Specter and I introduced. Basically, what this trust fund says is, look, we spend about $650 billion a year in health plans--Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, HMO's, on and on. All we are asking is that 1 percent, 1 penny out of every dollar that we spend on health care in this country, be remitted to a trust fund, just like a highway trust fund. Every time you buy a gallon of gas, you put money into the highway trust fund. It is like an airline ticket tax; you put money in to keep the airports going. 
What we are saying is, it is unconscionable that we spend all this money in health care in America and we put nothing from that health care budget into research. 
The bill Senator Specter and I have introduced, S. 441, will do that. It will take 1 penny out of $1 to put into a research trust fund, because if we do not do it, then all we did last night were just words, so much hot air. Ninety-eight Senators last night said they want to double funding for NIH by the year 2002. Let's put our resources where our mouths are. 
The first step toward that is adopting the Specter amendment to at least meet the needs next year to make sure that we do not have this $100 million cut in health spending, and to make sure that we have higher-than-inflation-spending resources for the National Institutes of Health. 
Mr. President, expanding our commitment to research will promote health care, control health costs, create jobs and strengthen our economy and competitive position in the global marketplace. This amendment is an investment in our future. 
I urge the adoption of the Specter amendment so that we can meet--start to meet--what we said we were going to do last night when we adopted the Mack resolution. 
I yield back whatever time I have remaining.

Mr. HARKIN. I ask if the Senator from Texas would amend his statement in the Record and provide us with a table. If the Senator from Texas says we can quadruple spending for NIH, please tell us how. Please put in the Record for all to see what the Senator from Texas would like to cut in order to increase that kind of funding for NIH. If he does not, well, then the words are just words; they do not mean anything. 
So I challenge the Senator from Texas to back up his words with examples of where we are going to get the money to quadruple in 1 year funding for NIH. 
Lastly, let me just say, again for the record, there has been some talk we put the money there, but we don't know where it is 
going to go. We offer the amendment as chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee as cosponsors. We have the votes on his side and our side to make sure that is where the money goes, to NIH. There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that that is where this money is going to go. 
I thank the chairman for taking the lead on this.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Lewis and Clark Water System Act of 1997. This legislation will authorize the construction of Lewis and Clark, along with a federal commitment of assistance for construction. Lewis and Clark is designed to be a treated, bulk water delivery system for 22 communities and rural water systems located in northwest Iowa, southeast South Dakota, and southwest Minnesota. Within this tri-state area, over 200,000 persons will be assured of clean and safe drinking water from Lewis and Clark. 
Lewis and Clark is necessary to address poor water quality sources, inadequate water supplies, population growth, and increasing federal regulations that the member water systems are trying to deal with. In many cases the drinking water currently delivered by Lewis and Clark's membership exceeds secondary drinking water standards for iron, manganese, sulfate, and total dissolved solids. Water of this quality is very difficult and expensive to treat. In Iowa, most of the involved drinking water systems are at, or near, their capacity, and have serious water quality problems. An engineering feasibility study completed by the Bureau of Reclamation in September 1993 concluded the project is technically feasible. 
However, this project will not be economically viable without federal assistance. Because many rural areas and small communities are involved with the project, the necessary financial resources do not exist to bring Lewis and Clark to completion. Through the Bureau of Reclamation study, each utility member determined that Lewis and Clark was the most feasible and least costly alternative for meeting future drinking water needs. It is estimated that this project will provide quality water at a reasonable cost, an estimated 75 cents per 1,000 gallons. 
Mr. President, this project represents a unique opportunity to bring safe, clean, and affordable drinking water to hundreds of thousands of persons in a tri-state area. It is not often Congress has the opportunity to assist in a project that has the joint cooperation of persons from three states, and twenty-two communities and local water systems. In an era when we see states and communities fighting for water resources, Lewis and Clark represents a grass-roots effort of concerned citizens, businesses, and government officials. 
Lastly, I would like to add that this is a project that clearly fits the characteristics of projects traditionally funded by the Bureau of Reclamation. Given its broad support, critical needs, and clear merits, I urge the passage of this important legislation.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is no issue of greater importance to our country than the education of our citizens. The budget before us calls for modest new investments in education over the next 5 years by increasing resources for education and training programs. In addition, the budget provides tax credits and deductions to middle income families to help pay for post-secondary education as outlined in the budget resolution. I fully support those initiatives. However, I believe we can and must do better. 
Several years ago I read a report by the Committee on Economic Development. This is a group of CEO's from some of our Nation's largest companies and they called on us to fundamentally change how we think about education. They said education is a process that begins at birth and that preparation must begin before birth. They called on the Federal Government to make additional investments in early intervention activities such as Head Start. I believe we should heed their words. 
The pending amendment makes these investments to ensure the readiness of all children and I want to commend Senator Dodd for his leadership. 
Last month, at my request, the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee held a hearing focusing on the importance of early childhood education. That hearing was on the eve of the White House conference on early learning and the brain which highlighted this most significant issue of the education of our youngest children. 
Over the past several months we have been reading a great deal about research on the brain and the implications for the education and development of young children. 
The research provides the scientific evidence which validates what many parents and children's advocates have been saying for years--the greatest potential for learning happens during the first years of a child's life. Therefore, we need to make sure that all children have rich learning experiences during that critical time. 
The first National Education Goal states that by the year 2000, all children will start school ready to learn. I strongly support all of the goals, but believe that the first goal is essential for achieving the rest of our national goals. Without a strong foundation in the early years, children, particularly children from low-income families, start school behind their peers school and often find it very difficult to catch up. 
Early intervention also makes good economic sense. Studies tell us that each dollar invested in high quality early childhood education programs such as Head Start saves $7 in future costs by increasing the likelihood that children will be literate and employed rather than dependent on welfare or engaged in criminal activities. However, less than half of the 2.1 million children eligible for Head Start participate. With the additional resources provided by the Dodd amendment, Head Start will be fully funded in 2002. That's a goal that is long overdue. 
The most perplexing problem for working families is the availability and affordability of high-quality child care. In Iowa, 67 percent of children under the age of 6 have all parents in the labor force. The cost of child care overwhelms the modest budgets of most working families since the care for one young child can cost as much as $4,000 per year. Availability of subsidies for working families are vital to helping many of these families stay off of welfare and the pending amendment provides an additional $7.5 billion over the next 5 years for this purpose. 
Finally the amendment increases funding for the Healthy Start Program. This initiative provides grants to areas with high rates of infant mortality to decrease the incidence of infant deaths. The additional will help sustain the gains made in those places and help disseminate information on successful interventions for other areas. 
Mr. President, we must not lose sight of the importance of investments in the education of young children. After all, high quality educational activities during a child's first years often alleviates the need for more expensive interventions later in life. I hope that we will be able to work together to create the infrastructure which truly redefines how we view education--as a process that begins at birth, with preparations beginning before birth. 
This amendment significantly increases investments for these vital early intervention initiatives and pays for these investments by closing several tax loopholes. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Dodd amendment and yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership and I thank Senator Frist for his eloquent comments. 
I rise in strong opposition to the amendment proposed by my colleague Senator Gorton. 
The amendment drives a stake through the heart of the bipartisan, bicameral, fair, and balanced provisions in the bill relating to disciplining children with disabilities. 
The amendment states plain and simple that local school districts can totally ignore every word of the bill if they so choose. In other words, the amendment effectively repeals every protection in the law for disabled children. 
Last night, this extreme position was rejected by 420 of my colleagues in the House in favor of the commonsense approach included in the bill. 
The bill specifies procedures for the immediate removal to an alternative setting of disabled children who bring weapons to school or who knowingly use, possess, or sell illegal drugs. 
The bill also authorizes: The removal to an alternative setting of truly dangerous children; proper referrals to police and appropriate authorities when disabled children commit crimes, so long as the referrals, do not circumvent the school's responsibilities under IDEA. 
And, the transfer of student disciplinary records. 
Under the amendment, local school districts could cease educational services for any disabled child regardless of whether or not the child's behavior was related to his or her disability. Cessation of services is not only opposed by all disability organizations, but is opposed by the major groups representing general education and the police and prosecutors. That is why the bipartisan bill rejects cessation. 
My colleague raised a number of other points in the course of the debate which I would like to respond to at this point. 
My colleague constantly refers to IDEA as an unfunded Federal mandate. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service, and the U.S. Supreme Court, IDEA is not an unfunded mandate. 
IDEA is a civil rights statute that implements the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. IDEA helps States and local school districts pay for the costs of implementing their constitutional obligation to disabled children. 
My colleague also talks about the high costs of educating disabled children but fails to talk about the savings to society, not to mention the enhanced quality of life for disabled children and their families. 
Prior to the enactment of IDEA, 70,655 children were in institutions. Because of IDEA, that number is down to 4,001. The average cost of serving a child in a State institution is $82,256 per person. With 66,654 fewer children institutionalized, the savings to States is $5.46 billion per year. 
Danny Piper from Ankey IA, was born with Down's syndrome. He has an IQ of 39. At birth, his parents were told to institutionalize him because he would be a burden and would not benefit from education. The cost to the taxpayers of Iowa over the course of his life would have been $5 million. His parents said no and instead placed him in early intervention and then in an intergrated program at Ankeny High School where he was a manager of the wrestling team. 
The cost of special education over his 18 years was $63,000. Was it a good investment? You decide. Today, Danny works, he pays taxes, and he has his own apartment. 
My colleague also quotes a parent of a nondisabled child who was told by a lawyer that she has no rights when her child's class is disrupted by a disabled child. I say to that parent she better get a new lawyer. 
They have a right to a class environment that is safe and conducive to learning. 
That parent has a right to insist that the schools develop positive behavioral approaches and train teachers and provide them with the necessary supports. 
What they don't have is the right to kick that disabled kid out of the class just as school systems cannot kick out African-American children when a white child or his parents are uncomfortable around African-Americans. 
Can we have school environments that are safe and conducive to learning without kicking disabled kids out? Yes we can. Just ask Dr. Mike McTaggart of West Middle School in Sioux City, IA. In just 1 year, the number of suspensions of nondisabled children went from 692 to 156 of which 7 were out-of-school suspensions. The number of suspensions of disabled children went from 220 to zero. Attendance has gone from 72 percent to 98.5 percent. Juvenile court referrals went from 267 to 3. 
His philosophy of discipline for all students is to use discipline as a tool to teach rather than to punish. 
In closing, let's reject the Gorton amendment and send a message that we can ensure school environments that are safe and conducive to learning without gutting the rights and protections of disabled children.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Smith amendment which adds limitations on the awarding of attorneys fees to parents of disabled children that are unprecedented in any other fees provision. 
The provisions in current law relating to attorneys fees were added by our colleague Senator Orrin Hatch. He modeled the IDEA fees provisions on provisions in other civil rights laws. On final passage of these provisions he explained that they reflected a carefully crafted compromise that provides for reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing parent while at the same time protecting against excessive reimbursement. 
Let's not upset that carefully crafted compromise. Let's retain the parity between the fees provisions in the IDEA with the fees provisions in other civil rights statutes. It is inappropriate to establish a double standard for parents with disabled children. 
Listening to Senator Smith, one might get the impression that there is a proliferation of litigation under IDEA. The data does not bear out such an assertion. The number of court cases under IDEA is actually declining from 199 in 1992 to 120 last year. This is out of 5.3 million disabled children. The number of due process hearings in New Hampshire last year was 10. In my State of Iowa, the number was four. In the entire State of California, with almost 600,000 disabled children in the IDEA program, the number of due process hearings was 57--1,289 requests for hearings but the overwhelming majority were resolved in mediation. 
Let's reject the Smith amendment.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his kind remarks, for his leadership in this area. I thank Senator Jeffords and especially Senator Frist, who had the first hearing on this 2 years ago, May 9, 1995. It has been a long process. We have worked with all groups. 
We worked with all groups, and we have a very balanced, fair, and forward looking bill. 
To sum it up, Mr. President, what this bill says is that prior to 1974, almost 1 million kids were totally excluded from not receiving education only because they were disabled. Now they are in school, they are learning, they are becoming productive citizens, they are working. They are taxpayers, not tax consumers. They are not in institutions any longer. 
Are there problems out there? Yes, but we are meeting those problems, and we are a better and stronger country because of what we did 22 years ago. This bill moves us into the 21st century by saying that we are going to strengthen this law and we are going to provide that this country meets its obligations to all of our children, including children with disabilities. 
Again, this is a bill that reaches out and lifts up everyone in this country. I urge its passage.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take a couple minutes to thank a lot of people because this has been indeed a long journey and a tough journey. 
It started, as I said, 2 years ago, on May 9, 1995, when Senator Frist had the first hearing on the reauthorization of the bill. And it has taken us 2 long years of working literally, if not every day, every week on this, and lately every day on it for the last several months. 
So I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to the people who have made it possible to reach this passage of S. 717. There are many people with a deep commitment to improving educational results for disabled children who stayed the course throughout this very long, tough journey. And today we can now point with satisfaction to a well-balanced, bipartisan bill that makes the kinds of improvements we are seeking in reauthorizing IDEA. 
Twenty-two years ago, as we have all said, with the enactment of Public Law 94-142, Congress took steps to ensure children with disabilities would no longer be excluded from school and would be guaranteed access to a free appropriate public education. 
Today, we have taken another major step by ensuring that the disabled children will now have the opportunity to enjoy the same expectations in the general curriculum as enjoyed by their nondisabled peers. And that success will be judged by the same high standards applicable to others. 
So first I would like to thank Judy Heumann, the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. Ms. Heumann, who has polio and herself was excluded from school, has successfully overcome diversity and discrimination. She sued the New York City Board of Education for the right to teach from her wheelchair in that city. She won. And she taught. And she has devoted her adult life to advocating for the rights of disabled persons. 
I think it is especially significant to point out in 1975, Judy worked for Senator Harrison Williams, who was one of the sponsors of Public Law 94-142. In her role with the Department of Education, she and Dr. Tom Hehir, Director of the Office of Special Education Programs, together with Secretary Riley, and their respective staffs crafted a reauthorization bill that has served as the framework and foundation for what we have just passed. 
So I express my appreciation to Secretary Riley, Ms. Heumann, and Tom Hehir. I want to give special thanks to their respective staffs who continuously provided crucial technical assistance and leadership throughout this entire reauthorization process. 
I would especially, Mr. President, like to commend our majority leader, Senator Lott, for his deep commitment to ensuring passage of the IDEA reauthorization bill as soon as possible in this legislative session. The majority leader demonstrated the extent of his commitment by arranging for his own chief of staff, David Hoppe, to facilitate the bipartisan, bicameral working group that has worked so hard over the last 10 weeks to develop this final bill. 
I simply cannot say enough to express my appreciation to Senator Lott's chief of staff, David Hoppe, for his enormous contribution to this reauthorization process. We would not have had a bill today without his involvement. Mr. Hoppe brought to this process a strong sense of integrity, superb negotiating skills, a sense of humor, and a stick-to-itiveness. It was a continuous exercise of all of these attributes in facilitating the working group that resulted in the bill we passed today. 
As I said, Mr. President, it was 2 years ago this week that Senator Frist, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy brought to order the 20th anniversary joint House-Senate informational hearing on IDEA. And following that hearing, Senator Frist worked diligently to secure passage of the bill before the end of the 104th Congress. Well, although it was not possible to fully meet that goal, the groundwork laid by Senator Frist, and his unending devotion to making sure we passed it, was of significant help to the working group this year in crafting again the bill we just passed. 
It was a pleasure and a privilege for me to work as the ranking minority member on the Disability Policy Subcommittee with Senator Frist in this effort. I want to thank Senator Frist for his tireless leadership and contribution to this bill. 
Let me pay tribute to a friend of longstanding from House days, and now in the Senate, who now stands across the aisle from me as the chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, for his commitment over a lifetime, for developing quality education for all of our children--for all of our children. Senator Jeffords has always been in the forefront of the fight. I thank him especially for his leadership in supporting passage of this bill. 
Senator Jeffords' long commitment, not only to education of all kinds, but especially for kids with disabilities, also played a key role in the enactment of 94-142 in 1975. And I thank him publicly for that lifetime of work and dedication. 
I also especially want to thank Senator Kennedy for the tremendous contribution he made to this. Throughout his tenure with this body, Senator Kennedy has continually provided the leadership we have needed in championing all civil rights issues. He has consistently worked with me to support various laws ensuring the rights of individuals with disabilities. 
Through Senator Kennedy's diligence, he ensured that stronger enforcement requirements would be added to S. 717 to help ensure that States and local school districts would be in full compliance with IDEA. 
Let me pay tribute also to Senator Coats and Senator Dodd for their contribution to the successful passage of this bill, and all of my colleagues in the House who worked with us in a very unique arrangement. 
I say to my friend from Vermont, it was so successful. We had to spin this off from other bills. We pulled together not only bipartisanship here in the Senate, but it was bicameral. And we worked together with the House Republicans and Democrats, jointly, day after day in developing this bill. 
And I would just mention--hopefully without excluding too many people--Representatives Goodling, of course, and Martinez, Representatives Riggs and Miller, Castle and Scott. So this bill has truly been a bipartisan, bicameral effort. And I am proud to have been a part of that effort. 
But now let me also thank all of the staff members of the working group. As I said, they were here every day, all week, weekends, late Fridays, Saturdays. I would get phone calls on Saturday night and Sunday afternoons, and they were still working. I hate to admit it, I was home. They were working. 
But I have to first thank Bobby Silverstein for his leadership on this bill, and going back for many, many years, first when he worked for Congressman Williams in the House and then saw the light and came over to the Senate to work on my staff on the Disability Policy Subcommittee in the mid-1980's. And it was through Bobby Silverstein's lifetime, long and deep commitment to ensuring the rights of people with disabilities that we got through the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990. And it was through his efforts that we were able to finally pull together all of the working people on this bill and the reauthorization of Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. So to Bobby Silverstein, I thank him for many years of service on this committee and for his service for making this country more fair and just for all people. 
I thank Tom Irvin of my own staff, on detail from the Department of Education. I thank Pat Morrissey, who took over the leadership on the staff in the subcommittee 2 years ago with Senator Frist. Again, Pat has been a stalwart, always there, always working, no matter what hour, no matter what day. I want to thank Pat again for all of her work in ensuring the passage of this bill. Also, Jim Downing, Senator Jeffords' staff, again, Jim, I thank you again for everything you have done. You have always been there. Thank you to Townsend Lang of Senator Coats' staff, Dave Larsen of Senator Frist's staff, and Kate Powers, Connie Garner, and Danica Petroshius of Senator Kennedy's staff. I also commend the hard work of the House staff, including Sally Lovejoy and Todd Jones of the House committee majority staff, Alex Nock of the House subcommittee minority staff, Theresa Thompson of Representative Scott's staff and Charlie Barone of Representative Miller's staff. 
Finally, Mr. President, most importantly--most importantly --I want to thank all of the members of the disability community and the general education community who stuck with this process through 2 long years. It was up and it was down, up and down, all the time. We thought we had agreements, then it would fall back. We kept bringing them together, bringing them together. It was a deep commitment by those who understand the need for a balance. 
I am sympathetic, as I said many times, with teachers who find themselves in a classroom and perhaps they have children there that they do not know how to handle. They are at their wits' end, and principals maybe get to their wits' end. I have a lot of sympathy for them. That is why we have to meet more of our obligations in providing more funds to the States for teacher training and supportive services for those teachers so they can do what is right and proper and meet their obligations. 
Well, what those who wanted a bill in the education community did and the disability community did over the last couple of years, they said, `We will forget all the anecdotes. Everyone has a horror story.' You can always find a horror story someplace no matter which side you are on. If you are on the disability side, you can find horror stories about teachers or principals who did bad things to kids with disabilities. If you are on the education side, you can find horrible things--maybe somebody claimed they had a disability and they did not. But we cannot legislate by anecdote. We cannot legislate by one, two, or three horror stories. We have to do what is right for the entire Nation. We have to cut through the fog and the haze and the one or two stories that keep cropping up. We have to cut through the misconceptions. 
I do not know how many times I keep hearing this is an unfunded mandate when we all know it is not an unfunded mandate. So we have to keep cutting through, cutting through, all the time. That is what some of the leaders in the general education community and the disability community did for the last couple of years. 
I thank them, not those who wanted to throw a hand grenade in periodically because they had a horror story, but those who understood that we had to reach a consensus, we had to strike a balance. That is what this bill is. 
In closing, I hope and believe the bill we passed today, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, will clearly enhance equal educational opportunities for all children with disabilities as we enter the 21st century. We promised that in 1975. We have met a lot of those promises--not all of them. We have a lot of promises to keep. 
I thank the Senator for yielding me this time.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. I should not take more than 15 minutes. Mr. President, listening to my friend from Missouri expound on the wonders and benefits of this bill, once again, reminds me of what I have often said about the U.S. Senate and the 100 Members that comprise this body. There are no bad people in the U.S. Senate. I can honestly say that I like each and every individual here in the Senate. There are no bad people here. 
There are just a lot of bad ideas. Listening to this explanation of this bill reminds me once again of that truth. The Senator from Missouri is a friend, and he is a good guy, but this happens to be a very bad idea. I think it is terribly mistaken--what this bill would do in the force and effect of this bill. I am going to get into some of those in my remarks, especially on whether or not this really is a paycheck reduction act, because it really is. Of the three options that people have, it actually would reduce their paychecks. 
Mr. President, as our workplace has changed the number of two-parent families has increased. Workers deserve relief to meet the demands of everyday life. That is why, for example, I support, like a number of people here, the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow workers to take time off to care for newborn children, or ailing relatives, without fear of losing their jobs. 
Mr. President, millions of Americans have been helped by this landmark law. Now I believe it is time that we expand this profamily protection to provide parents with a little time off from work to attend a parent-teacher conference, or a doctor's appointment for their child. 
I have worked my entire career in the House and the Senate to try to improve the lives of working families, and that includes comptime. I support giving families more flexibility to balance their work and family lives, and I am hopeful that we can pass such a bill. However, this bill before us, designated S. 4, is truly a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is a sham. This bill offers the appearance of employee choice but it is not the reality. The appearance but not the reality. In the Labor Committee markup of this bill several amendments were offered to improve this bill to provide real choice and protection for workers. All were rejected on party-line votes. I am going to go through some of them. 
I am deeply concerned that this legislation will actually take families in the wrong direction. It gives the employers more flexibility to get out of their overtime obligations rather than giving employees more flexibility to spend time with their families. It will leave workers with less money, not more flexibility, and should be really titled `Paycheck Reduction Act.' A genuine comptime bill must provide employees with choice, protection, and flexibility. It has to be commonsense and profamily, and S. 4 falls short on all of those counts. 
Supporters claim that S. 4 allows employees to make the choice between overtime pay and comptime, but it doesn't contain the protections that are necessary to ensure that employees have free choice and are free from reprisal. Under this legislation, the employer holds all the cards. The employer chooses what options to provide the flexible work options to, and when the employees can exercise the options. It is also seriously lacking in other important employee protection measures which would ensure flexibility and not a reduction in benefits.

Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator is correct. That is the bottom line at stake. Are we really going to give the employee--are we going to empower the employee to make those decisions? This bill does not do that. This bill actually just gives more power to the employer. It gives more power to the employer to take away from the employee the benefits they have right now for overtime pay and the benefits they would have from, really, accruing comptime. 
As I said earlier, again, this is another one of the very bad ideas that periodically come up through the Senate. It sounds good. What's it called? The Family Friendly Workplace Act? Ridiculous. I don't know who thinks up all these titles and these names. Nothing could be farther from the truth. 
This is a bill--the intent may be good. I do not question the intent or motivation of my friend from Missouri at all. I just think it is going in the wrong direction. There are ways we can improve this bill. We offered these amendments to the committee. Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Murray offered amendments to really make this more like what Federal employees have now. The Senator from Missouri is right. Federal employees do have this--with good protection, good comptime. As I point out in my statement, there is a lot of difference between the private sector employer and the public sector. If the Senator from Missouri wants to amend this bill to give private sector employees the same protections as civil service laws give Federal employees, maybe he can make a case for this bill. But that is not the case right now. So you cannot compare Federal employees with employees in the private sector. 
This is just an example of good intentions gone awry. Good intentions, I think, messed up by other special interest groups that have come in, as Senator Kennedy pointed out. Who is for the bill? As I pointed out, every group representing low-income workers is opposed to this bill. If this was such a good bill, they would be for it. I think that is the proof of what this bill is all about. It is a bad bill. It ought to be defeated. I am sure we will have some amendments, and I am sure the Senate in its wisdom will defeat this bill and put it back in the files where it belongs. I yield the floor.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on April 17, 1997, a momentous occasion took place at the White House when a group of apparel manufacturers, importers, labor officials, and President Clinton announced their actions to reduce the incidence of abusive child labor in the manufacturing of imported articles into the United States. As one who has been working on this issue for many years, I am pleased with the progress that is being made, although I recognize we have a long way to go. Most importantly, we need leaders in the apparel industry who are willing to take that step forward and work to include all manufacturers and importers in this effort to ban abusive and exploitative child labor. In the recent past, many apparel manufacturers have resisted this effort, supposedly in the name of `free trade,' but I suspect there was probably another reason. On the other hand, there have been manufacturers and importers, who have stepped forward to courageously take the different course and that is to do everything they can to ensure that their products are not made with exploitative child labor. 
One such person is Mr. Paul Charron, the chief executive officer of the Liz Claiborne Corp. He has been in the forefront of the fight to ban the use of exploitative child labor in the manufacturing of wearing apparel. Mr. Charron gave remarks at the White House that day, which I found to be most encouraging. His comments, indeed, echo my feelings, and I know the feelings of President Clinton when he said that ensuring human rights is the right thing to do, and it is the smart thing to do. Good working conditions are productive working conditions. He is absolutely right, and I want to applaud Mr. Charron and thank him for his courageous stance and leadership on this issue. I would also like to encourage the participants of the White House Apparel Industry Partnership to take the next step and adopt a labeling system giving consumers the information they need and companies the recognition they deserve. 
At this point, I submit Mr. Charron's remarks into the Record, and I urge my colleagues and their staffs to review his remarks.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President I thank Senator Jeffords. 
First of all, I thank Senator Coats for his recent statement that he just made on the floor. He hit all the right points. He talked about how long this bill had been in the making and the delicate balance that we reached. I thank Senator Coats for his efforts over a long period of time in this area to reach this very delicate balance. 
I also see my colleague, Senator Frist, on the floor. I want to publicly thank Senator Frist again for his great leadership in this area. 
I was just looking up today, and it was on May 9, 1995, that Senator Frist held the first hearing on this bill--2 years ago. It has taken us 2 years to get to this point. He has worked day and night on this to try to get it through. Last year we had a lot of problems, and Senator Frist hung in there every step of the way making sure that we got this bill through. It took 2 years. But we no have a well-balanced bill. I want to publicly thank Senator Frist for hanging in there and not giving up. I appreciate that very much. 
Of course, I thank Senator Jeffords, our leader on the committee, again for leading us in this area. Again, Senator Jeffords was one of the few around here who was there when Public Law 94-142 was passed. He was a leader at that time 22 years ago. He is still here to lead the charge on this landmark legislation. 
I want to talk for a couple of minutes with regard to some of the things that Senator Gorton brought up. 
First, Senator Gorton said there are two main objections he had to the bill. The first was that it was an unfunded mandate. 
This is, of course, not an unfunded mandate at all. No matter how many times someone may say it or how strongly they may say it, this is not an unfunded mandate. The Congressional Budget Office, the American Law Division of the Library of Congress, and the Supreme Court, have all said this does not fall under the unfunded mandate legislation. So it is not an unfunded mandate. It is a civil rights bill, it is a law implementing the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It is not an unfunded mandate. 
In other words, Mr. President, let me put it this way. The State of Idaho does not have to provide a free public education to its kids. If the State of Idaho decided to stop that, they can do it. But as long as the State of Idaho decides that they will provide a free public education to all their kids, then the State of Idaho can then not discriminate against kids because they are black or they are brown or they are female or they are disabled. That free education must be available to all kids. The Supreme Court has decided that. 
So it is a constitutional mandate, not an unfunded mandate. 
What we have said with IDEA--Public Law 94-142--is, `Look, we will try to help the States meet that obligation because it will cost some money, and we will help them meet that.' That is why Senator Gregg moved in this area to get the Federal Government to pick up more of that obligation. We should. But I do not want to go into that anymore. Senator Jeffords responded to that. 
But this is a civil rights bill. 
What Senator Gorton's amendment basically says is, if you just read the first words, `Notwithstanding any other provision of this act,' each State educational agency, et cetera, can decide for themselves what they want to do. Notwithstanding anything else, they can do whatever they want to do. 
Would Senator Gorton apply that same reasoning to the Civil Rights Act of 1964--notwithstanding any other provision of the law, if a jurisdiction wants to discriminate against African-Americans, they can do so, they can fashion whatever framework they want? Would Senator Gorton apply that to title IX and say, `Well, with regard to women, each jurisdiction can decide whatever they want and how it applies to women'? We can do that with the civil rights bill? Of course not. Civil rights applies to all in this country. 
The second thing he brought up was the cost. He mentioned something about the cost of this in terms of the mandate. There are a lot of ways to look at the cost. But what is the marginal cost of this? We have some figures here. You have to look at the savings. The average per student in America for those in special education the average cost is $6,100. 
So it costs about 14 percent more marginally to educate a kid with disabilities than a child without disabilities. 
Well, is it worth it? We have to ask: Is it worth it to spend that 14 percent? 
Look at it this way. Mr. President, in 1974, before the enactment of this bill, 70,655 children were living in State institutions. By 1994, 20 years later, as a direct result of this bill, that number went to 4,001--less than 6 percent of what it had been 20 years before. 
What is the cost? What is the savings? The average State institution cost was $82,256 per person in 1994. 
So, if you take the difference of $66,654 for kids that are not institutionalized but are in school learning, that is a savings to the State of $5.46 billion each and every year. That doesn't include the savings later on in welfare costs. 
For example, my friend, Danny Piper, who got special education, went to school. We figured up for Danny Piper that the total cost of his special education was $63,000. That is what it cost. Danny Piper today is living on his own in an apartment and takes the bus to work. He is employed. He is a taxpayer. He is not in an institution. But when he was born with Down's syndrome, the doctors told his parents, `Put him in an institution.' They 
refused to do so. Because of IDEA, they got him in school in special education. He did well in high school. Now he is working and making money. The cost to the taxpayers of the State of Iowa to institutionalize Danny Piper would have been $5 million. Do you know what it cost us? $63,000 to get him his education. 
So you can look at it from the cost, but you have to look at it from the other side--the savings side, not to mention lifestyles, quality of life, and what it means to the Danny Pipers and others not to be institutionalized. 
Lastly, Senator Gorton talks about the double standard. I am sorry. That is just not so. There is no double standard here at all. 
I guess what we have to ask is, What do we want at the end of the day? At the end of the day, we want a safe classroom with an environment that is conducive to learning for all students. That is what we are all about. What we want to do is teach children behavior that will lead to that safe, quiet classroom that is conducive to learning. Under IDEA, we want to use discipline as a tool to learn and not just as a punishment and to ensure that each child receives the supportive services necessary to function appropriately in a classroom environment. 
For example, we have some examples of kids. Here is one. I have hundreds of these examples. Here is one, Nick Evans in Wisconsin. I have a letter here dated January 24, 1997. He was in school. He was fighting. We are told that they did not know what to do with him. We are told by the school that they felt Nick was emotionally disturbed, mentally retarded, and did not belong in the school. They did not know what to do. But they sought an evaluation at the clinic in La Crosse, WI. They met with the child's specialist. He had a superior IQ of over 130. His behavior problem stemmed from tremendous frustration of an unidentified, profound learning disability. Once that was recognized, once he got the supportive services, his behavior problems literally disappeared overnight. Now he is an A, honor roll, student. The kids want to work with him. When he is doing a class work science project, the classmates choose to work with him. This is a kid who the school said, `Kick him out. Get rid of him. He is disturbing everybody. He is dangerous.' But he got the supportive services and the proper kind of discipline--the discipline to teach him how to act within that environment. 
I can go through a lot of them. Here is Molly, who was very abusive to others, hitting and pushing them; teachers wanting the child removed. A speech language pathologist was called in. They commenced a program and found out that she had a communications problem. Within 12 weeks her ability to talk to her peers grew. Her behavior problems faded away. 
Here is a family of three. The children engaged in fighting, aggressive outbursts, name calling. Frustrated by lack of support by the school system, they moved to a neighboring district where they found the support, and now all three of their kids are honor roll students and doing well. 
Let me talk about Mike McTaggart of Sioux City, something closer to my home. I visited the school last year. Mike McTaggart is the principal of West Middle School in Sioux City. Listen to this. There are 650 students in the middle school. Student population is 28 percent minority, 32 percent are children with disabilities, and one out of three have IDP. One year prior to Dr. McTaggart coming there and taking over this school, there were 692 suspensions, and of those suspended, 220 were disabled children. The absenteeism rate was 25 percent, and there were 267 referrals to juvenile authorities in 1 year. 
In 1 year. Dr. McTaggart came in, and 1 year later the number of suspensions of nondisabled children went from 692 to 156. The number of suspensions of disabled children went from 220 to zero. Attendance has gone from 72 percent to 98.5 percent. Juvenile court referrals went from 267 to 3. 
What happened in that 1 year? We had a principal who came in--who brought a different philosophy, a philosophy of using discipline as a tool to teach rather than to punish, and turned that school around by involving kids and involving their parents. That school is very successful today. But if you had looked at that school before he got there, there was a lot of blame on the kids--blame the kids, blame their parents. They shouldn't be there. They are dangerous. Get them out of there. There were 267 referrals to juvenile authorities--from that to 3 in 1 year--and 220 disabled kids were suspended. It went to zero the next year. 
I am just saying that is again bringing in someone who understands a different philosophy, that you use discipline as a method of teaching and enabling--not just as a method of punishment. 
Lastly, the Senator from Washington State kept asking the question. He had a letter that he was reading from a parent in Washington who basically said that I asked my attorney--and I am paraphrasing here. But the letter the Senator read into the Record was, what rights do I have for my child to be free from all this commotion, and dangerous activity in school. And the attorney said, `You have no rights.' Well, first of all, I would suggest that parent get a different attorney because you do have rights. 
That parent has the right to demand of that school a safe and conducive learning environment. They have a right to demand that. They ought to demand it. What they don't have the right to do is to demand that a disabled kid gets kicked out of school. They don't have that right. 
It would be like this. Let's say, Mr. President, that a caucasian kid came to school and had to sit next to an African-American. They said, `Well, I don't like that. I don't like this integration.' I am conjuring up memories of a few years ago. `Oh, no. Those kids cause all kinds of problems in school. They couldn't be conducive to a learning environment.' Well, we found out that wasn't so, as long as teachers and principals and parents got together, and in sort of an atmosphere of working together, it was fine; no problems. 
Let's say that a child went to school, and all of a sudden sitting next to him was a physically disabled child who made them nervous because they didn't look the same, they didn't act the same, they had a physical disability that, well, maybe they weren't like the rest of the kids. Would a parent who said, hey, wait a minute. My kid has to sit there and it's disturbing; it confuses him; it is not a good, conducive atmosphere for him to learn--would that parent have the right to say, kick that disabled kid out of school? No. But what the parent has the right to do is demand of the school that they provide a safe and conducive learning environment. 
That means at least to this Senator that the school has to develop strategies to make the classroom safe and quiet and conducive to learning. If kids are disturbed by someone who is in the classroom, by their appearance or by their actions, that means you develop a strategy to deal with it and bring the parents in and provide for an atmosphere where kids can learn, not just a knee-jerk reaction and say, well, the easiest course of action is to expel them, kick them out, get rid of them, segregate them, exclude them. 
We have been down that road before. The whole theory of IDEA, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, is to mainstream, is to bring people together, not to segregate people. 
So I would say to the person who wrote that letter to Senator Gorton, yes, you have that right; go to that school and demand the safe, conducive learning environment. You have that right. But 
you do not have the right to demand the kid gets kicked out because he or she is disabled. You do not have that right. So I would suggest that perhaps they ought to get a different attorney. I just wanted to make those comments. I did not have the time before. 
There was one other thing. Again, showing how things can happen if people really do want to make it work, will work together, on January 29 of this year Elizabeth Healy, a member of the Pittsburgh School Board, testified before our committee. She said she thought IDEA was a good law; it is working. She said the Pittsburgh School District has adopted a family centered inclusive approach to provide special education. Because of what they did in Pittsburgh, because of this family centered approach, the number of due process hearings has plummeted. 
Unlike reports from other urban school districts regarding the due process hearings, last year there was only one due process hearing and one special education mediation in the entire school district in Pittsburgh. I do not know a lot about Pittsburgh, but it is a pretty urban city. One due process hearing, one special education mediation in the entire school district. 
I might suggest to the Senator from Washington that he might want to take the principal of this school that he keeps talking about with all these problems and maybe send him to Pittsburgh and have him look at what they did there or send him to Sioux City, IA, and we will have him look at what Principal Mike McTaggart did there. And maybe, and I say this in all candor and seriousness, they could pick up some pointers on how to structure the school environment, how to involve the families, so that they will have the same results as Sioux City or the same results as Pittsburgh. 
So I am saying it is not impossible. It is very possible to have a safe and conducive learning environment and to meet at the same time the requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. What it really takes is a commitment by the school boards, teachers and principals, parents and the community to work together in an atmosphere of mutual accommodation and understanding and support. If they do that, there won't be that many problems. Oh, you will always have some problems, but, my gosh, Pittsburgh went down to one due process hearing. That is the kind of goals we ought to be looking for. 
That is what this bill does. That is what this bill does. I have to tell you, Mr. President, a lot of times my heart goes out to teachers who are in the classroom and they are confronted with situations where they have emotionally disturbed kids, physically disabled kids, mentally disabled kids, and that teacher does not have the proper support and learning and training to know how to deal with it. Teachers need that support. They need that kind of training and that kind of educational support that will help them. That is what we are talking about here. If they do that, IDEA will work, but it will not work if our reaction is, first of all, notwithstanding any other provision of this act, let each school district decide for themselves. 
That is what the Gorton amendment does. That is not conducive to an inclusionary-type of principle where we are going to bring kids together. We are a much better society today because we have included people with disabilities. We are a stronger society. As President Clinton says so often, as we enter the next century, we cannot leave one person behind, and we certainly should not leave people behind just because they have a physical or mental disability. 
That is what this bill does. It provides those kids with that support and those opportunities the kind of education that allows kids to dream and allows kids with disabilities to know that they can fulfill their potential. We all have different potentials. Kids with disabilities are no different. They have potential, too, to achieve, to dream, and to do wonderful things. We have seen it happen because of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. 
This bill that we have before us, this reauthorization, as I said, is carefully crafted, very balanced. I think it meets all of 
the needs of parents and school administrators and, most importantly, meets the needs of the kids themselves not to be segregated out but to be included, to make sure they have the support they need so that they can become fully self-sufficient, productive, loyal American citizens in their adulthood. That is what this bill is all about. 
Mr. President, are there situations where a school officials must take immmediate action to remove a disabled child from his or her current placement? The answer is yes, and this bill provides for two limited exceptions to the stay put provision under which children with disabilities are entitled to stay in their current placement pending appeals. 
Under the first exception to the stay put provision, school officials are provided authority to remove a child from his or her current placement into an interim alternative educational setting for the same amount of time they could remove a nondisabled child, but for not more than 45 days, if the child carries a weapon or knowingly possesses, uses, or sells illegal drugs or controlled substances. 
Under the second exception to the stay put provision, local authorities can secure authority from an impartial hearing officer--in addition to a court--to remove a child from his or her current educational placement into an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if the school officials can demonstrate by substantial evidence--that is, beyond a preponderance of the evidence--that maintaining the child in the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others. 
Some of my colleagues have raised concerns about allowing impartial hearing officers to make these critical decisions. I support this provision for several reasons. 
First, this standard codifies the holding in Honig versus Doe. In that case, the burden was clearly placed on the school officials to rebut the presumption in favor of maintaining the child in the current placement. Thus, the case does not deal with perceptions or stereotypes about disabled children but provides authority to remove a child who truly is dangerous. 
Second, in giving the authority to make these determinations to impartial hearing officers, the proposal not only includes the `substantial likelihood of injury' standard, but also specifies that the hearing officer must consider the appropriateness of the child's current placement and whether reasonable efforts have been made by the local school officials to minimize the risk of harm, including the use of supplementary aids and services, and if the child is moved, the hearing officer must determine that the new placement will allow the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum and to meet the goals of the IMP and that the child will receive services that are designed to address the behavior that led to the removal. 
Third, in placing this additional authority with hearing officers, the bill recognizes the important role already assigned to these individuals in guaranteeing the rights of disabled children. It is because of the importance of this role that the act requires that hearing officers be impartial. This means, for example, that a hearing officer could not be an employee of the child's school district. It is my expectation that the Department will re-examine current policies concerning impartiality in order to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the integrity of these persons, and thus the system, is ensured. 
It is also my expectation that hearing officers will be provided appropriate training to carry out this new responsibility in an informed and impartial manner and that both SEA's and the Secretary will closely monitor the implementation of this provision. 
In sum, Mr. President, we do not have to choose between school chaos and denying education to children with disabilities in order to maintain schools that are safe and conducive to learning. If anything, parents with disabled children want schools that are safe and conducive to learning more than other parents because their 
children are frequently more distractible and more likely to be the brunt of attacks and abuse. 
Parents who have disabled children are not asking that they be excused from learning responsibility and discipline. What they are asking for is that the approaches used be individually tailored to accomplish the objectives of maintaining a school environment that truly is safe and conducive to learning for all children, including children with disabilities. 
Mr. President, this bill provides a fair-balanced approach to ensuring school environments that are safe and conducive to learning. I urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill and reject the Gorton amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I don't intend to take a long period of time. I wanted to respond to my friend from New Hampshire. Let me, first of all, recap a little history on the provisions in the bill which provide for reasonable attorney's fees--again, keeping in mind you have to prevail in this case. 
The provision here, what is in the bill, is nothing new. This has been in the bill for a long time. In fact, I did a little bit of research and found out that this first came under S. 415, the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986. And the person who was in charge of this provision was none other than our own Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. I just thought I would read into the Record, again, what he said at that time on July 17, 1986. 
He says that the agreement we are now considering is a compromise which I feel accomplishes two major objectives. 
First, it provides the reward of reasonable attorneys' fees to prevailing parents in Education of Handicapped Act proceedings. 
Second, it includes the application provisions from some court cases, which he mentioned, which I don't have to go through. 
In order to protect against excessive reimbursements. Senator Hatch goes on to say, `Let me again emphasis that the conference agreement developed was a compromise. Without the passage of this carefully crafted document, handicapped children and their parents cannot be fully protected since they have no recourse under current law, if their rights are violated.' 
Again, that law now provides that a court may award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the cost of the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party in a due process proceeding, or court action. 
In other words, if a parent prevails at an administrative hearing, they are entitled to fees. What fees? Reasonable? They must be based on rates prevailing in the community for that time, and quality of services performed. Unlike other civil rights statutes, no bonus or multiplier may be used to increase the amount of fee awards. No award of fees may be made for services performed subsequent to the time a written statement offer is made to the parents, if, among other things, the relief finally obtained by the parent is not more favorable to the parents than the offer of settlement. 
I think this is really a critical point. Again, I apologize to the Senator from New Hampshire. I do not know if he covered this or not. 
Let's say they have a written statement of offer to settle. The parents decide not to do that, and they go on. From that point on, if the final judgment is not more favorable than the written statement offer, they get nothing beyond that point. They go at their own peril. 
So, again, how can that be unreasonable attorneys' fees? 
And the court must reduce the amount of the fee award whenever the court finds the following: 
First, the parent unreasonably protracted the final resolution; 
Second, the amount of fees unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate prevailing in the community; 
Third, the time spent on the legal services furnished were excessive considering the failure of the action or proceeding. 
So this is all in current law--adequate protections to make sure that there are not unreasonable attorney fees in these cases. 
So really this amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire really undermines the rationale for having attorney's fees. 
Again, let's keep in mind one other very important fact that I think keeps being ignored here when we are talking about IDEA. The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act is a civil rights statute. It talks about civil rights for kids with disabilities. I already went through that earlier today talking about not discriminating on the basis of race, sex, creed, or national origin. Well, the courts have now said disability too. You can't discriminate on that basis. 
I have here a copy of all of the statutes under which attorneys' fees may be awarded by Federal courts and agencies in other civil rights cases. The Civil Rights Act of 1964; Public Facilities; Equal Opportunities; Fair Housing Act; title 8; Employment Act of 1967; Fair Labor Standards; Voting Rights Act of 1965; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act; the Age Discrimination Act; the Rehab Act of 1973. And all of those we get reasonable attorneys' fees. 
So now are we going to say, `But, for the civil rights of kids with disabilities and their parents, no, that is different'? Why 
don't we carve out the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or public accommodations on the basis of race or color? Why don't we say, `Well, if you have a civil rights case and it is based on race, you don't get attorneys' fees, if you prevail?' Why not? The Senator from New Hampshire says we will carve it out for kids with disabilities. Why don't we carve it out on the basis of race? 
How about religion? What if you got a complaint based upon violations of civil rights based on religion, and you prevail? You say you don't get attorneys' fees? No. We say in the law you get attorneys' fees, if you prevail. 
Equal employment I mentioned. 
Title IX dealing with discrimination based upon sex, we say, `Oh. Well, in this case, however, if you are female, your civil rights have been violated under title IX, and you bring action. No. We are not going to give you attorney's fees.' 
Why don't we have those amendments offered around here? It is only the kid with disabilities. It doesn't make any sense at all. 
So let's keep all of our civil rights laws the same. If your civil right is violated on the basis of race, I submit to you it is no more onerous than if your civil rights is violated based upon disabilities. And we shouldn't discriminate under the Civil Rights Act, and we shouldn't here either. 
So I oppose the amendment because it undermines the rationale. It subjects the parents of children to a double standard compared to other civil rights bills. We have to keep these things the same. 
Last, the data doesn't support the assertions that the fee is a result of proliferation of litigation. I looked up New Hampshire. For 1 year--1995-1996--New Hampshire had 10 complaints that went through due process. Do you know how many become court cases? Zero. This is an amendment looking for a problem. 
There is no problem out there. Vermont has zero. Arkansas has zero. 
Again, it is just not a big problem out there at all. 
In my State--I might as well talk about Iowa--we had four due process hearings, and we had three cases go to court. 
Out of the thousands--this is what is interesting. In California, one of the largest States, we had 1,289 requests for due process hearings. Out of that, 1,114 were disposed in mediation. We had 57 hearing decisions rendered out of 1,289 requests. That is just not much of a problem. That is out of 550,000 students in California receiving special education. Out of 550,000 students, only 57 had a hearing decision rendered. 
So, again, the number of due process hearings per year averages about one-hundredth of 1 percent of the number of children served. The law specifically provides for reasonable attorney's fees, and I just outlined what that means when Senator Hatch put this in the bill 11 years ago. 
And, third, we would not--no one here, I would think--would want to discriminate on the basis of civil rights that in one civil rights case you get attorneys' fees but in another civil rights case you don't. No. We don't want any of that around here. For those reasons, while I have every respect for the Senator from New Hampshire--and he is a good friend of mine--this is just a bad idea, quite frankly. And I hope Senators will reject this approach of trying to divide out kids with disabilities and their families away from everybody else under the purview of civil rights laws. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. If a State makes such a transfer and if the Secretary finds that the public agency is in noncompliance, the Secretary must limit any withholding action to that agency. Furthermore, any reduction or withholding of payments must be proportionate to the number of disabled children in adult prisons under the supervision of that agency compared to the number served by local school districts. For example, if 1 percent of the disabled students were in adult prisons, the Secretary could only withhold 1 percent of the funds.

Mr. HARKIN. Public agencies may modify an IEP for bona fide security or compelling penological reasons. For example, the public agency would not be required to develop an IEP for a person convicted as an adult and incarcerated in an adult prison who is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole or is sentenced to death. 
This exception applies to those inmates for whom special education will have no rehabilitative function for life after prison. Our aim in assuring that prisoners receive special education is to make them better able to cope after prison, resulting in a safer environment for all of us. This goal does not apply for those who will not return to society. 
In addition, the provisions requiring participation of students with disabilities in statewide assessments will not apply. Further, the transition services requirements will not apply to students whose eligibility will terminate before their release from prison. 
Finally, the obligation to make a free appropriate public education available to all disabled children does not apply with respect to children and 18 to 21 to the extent that State law does not require that special education and related services under this part be provided to children with disability, who, in the education placement prior to their incarceration in an adult correction facilities, were not identified as being a student with a disability, or did not have an IEP.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 717, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. 
On February 20, 1997, a bipartisan, bicameral working group was established to develop a bill reauthorizing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA]. The working group included a representative from the Department of Education, Judy Heumann, Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, and congressional staff representing Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Coats, Harkin, Frist, and Dodd; and Representatives Goodling, Martinez, Riggs, Miller, Castle, and Scott. The facilitator of the group was David Hoppe, the majority leader's chief of staff. 
The mission of the working group was to review, strengthen, and improve IDEA to better educate children with disabilities, and enable them to receive a quality education. With this mission in mind, the group agreed to start with current law and build on the actions, experiences, information, and research gathered over the life of the law, particularly over the past 3 years. The group further agreed that it must distinguish between problems of implementation and problems with the law, and respond appropriately, according to the issue raised. 
After 10 weeks of marathon negotiations, an agreement was reached on all outstanding issues. S. 717 is the outcome of this effort. 
Mr. President, IDEA is a powerful civil rights law with a long and successful history. More than 20 years ago, Congress passed Public Law 94-142, a law that gave new promises, and new guarantees, to disabled children and their parents under part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, now known as IDEA. 
Prior to the enactment of Public Law 94-142, 1 million children with disabilities were excluded entirely from the public school system, and more than half of all disabled children in the United States did not receive appropriate educational services that would enable them to enjoy full equality of opportunity. 
On that day in 1975, when Public Law 94-142 was enacted, we lit a beacon of hope for millions of children with disabilities and their families, we exclaimed that the days of exclusion, segregation, and denial of educational opportunity were over in this country. 
We recognized that the right of disabled children to a free appropriate public education is a constitutional right established in the early 1970's by two landmark Federal district 
court cases--Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children versus Commonwealth in 1971 and Mills versus Board of Education of the District of Columbia in 1972. 
Thus, IDEA was enacted for two reasons: First, to establish a consistent policy of what constitutes compliance with the equal protection clause so that there would be no need to continue pursuing separate court challenges around the country. Second, to help States meet their constitutional obligations. 
IDEA is landmark legislation that has literally changed the lives of millions of children with disabilities and their families. 
IDEA has been a very successful law that has made significant progress in addressing the problems that existed in 1975. Today, every State in the Nation has laws in effect assuring the provision of a free appropriate public education for all children with disabilities. Over 5,000,000 children with disabilities are now receiving special education and related services. 
The number of young adults enrolled in postsecondary education has tripled, and the unemployment rate for individuals with disabilities in their twenties is almost half that of their older counterparts. 
And, because of a promise made in 1986, all States now provide early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families. 
For many parents who have disabled children, IDEA is a lifeline of hope. As one parent recently told me:  
Thank God for IDEA. IDEA gives us the strength to face the challenges of bringing up a child with a disability. It has kept our family together. Because of IDEA our child is achieving academic success. He is also treated by his nondisabled peers as `one of the guys.' I am now confident that he will graduate high school prepared to hold down a job and lead an independent life.' 
IDEA helps preserve and strengthen the family unit. Because of IDEA, disabled children will grow up with their siblings and parents, and worship and play with neighbors and friends. 
IDEA teaches personal responsibility by tailoring education to meet each child's unique needs. 
IDEA empowers disabled children to grow up to lead productive lives in the mainstream of society. 
Because of IDEA, we hear less anger and frustration from parents than in the past. We now hear a greater sense of optimism, as I heard from a parent in Iowa writing about her 7-year-old daughter with autism. She said, `I have no doubt that my daughter will live nearly independently as an adult, will work, and will be a very positive contributor to society. That is very much her dream, and it is my dream for her. IDEA has made this dream capable of becoming a reality.' 
Mr. President, these are not isolated statements from a few parents in Iowa. They are reflective of the general feeling about the law across the country. 
But despite the tremendous progress that has been made since 1975, we know that our work is not over, and significant challenges still remain. The unfortunate truth is that, for far too many disabled children, the promise of IDEA is not yet a reality. 
For example, too many students with disabilities are still failing courses and dropping out of school. Almost twice as many disabled students drop out of school, as compared to nondisabled students. And when disabled students drop out, they are less likely to ever return to school and are more likely to be unemployed or have problems with the law. 
Enrollment of disabled students in postsecondary education is still too low. And too many of these students are leaving school ill-prepared for employment and independent living. 
Of further concern is the continued inappropriate placement of children from minority backgrounds and children with limited English proficiency in special education classrooms with low expectation for these children. In addition, school officials and others complain that current law is unclear and focuses too much on paperwork and process rather than on improving results for children. 
And it is distressing to observe that the law is not being consistently implemented across the Nation, or even within individual States. Why is it that in one school district, the number of suspensions and drop outs is very high, whereas in a neighboring district within the same State, these problems do not exist? Unfortunately, this is not an isolated situation. 
In February, just after the working group began its effort to improve IDEA, I received a copy of a letter to David Hoppe from the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund relating to implementation problems with IDEA in the city of Los Angeles. The letter states, `We implore you to read the enclosed report prepared by well qualified, unbiased, independent consultants hired by the Los Angeles Unified School District in California and parents of children with disabilities in their efforts to 
resolve a lawsuit in Los Angeles for violations of IDEA.' The letter adds: 
The findings of the consultants/experts are astounding. Twenty years after the passage of IDEA, the consultants were `compelled to conclude that the District suffers from a pervasive, substantial, and systematic inability to deliver special education and related services in compliance with special education laws.'. . . The harm suffered by children with disabilities, their parents and their communities is incalculable, tragic and unacceptable. 
As a result of IDEA, most children are now in school. But it is clear that we must ensure that IDEA is fully and consistently implemented. And we need to place greater emphasis on improving educational results for these children. Careful strengthening and refocusing of the law is necessary in order to build upon 20 years of success while ensuring resolution of existing problems. 
In addressing these challenges, the bipartisan, bicameral working group established a set of principles to guide its efforts, including adopting the following three goals: 
The first goal was to review, strengthen, and improve IDEA to better educate children with disabilities and enable them to receive a quality education by: 
First, ensuring access to the general education curriculum and reforms; 
Second, strengthening the role of parents; 
Third, focusing on teaching and learning while reducing unnecessary paperwork requirements; 
Fourth, giving increased attention to racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity to prevent inappropriate identification and mislabeling; 
Fifth, ensuring that schools are safe and conducive to learning; 
Sixth, encouraging parents and educators to work out their differences by using nonadversarial means; and 
Seventh, assisting educational agencies in addressing the costs of improving special education and related services to children with disabilities. 
The second goal was to encourage exemplary practices that lead to improved teaching and learning experiences, and which in turn result in productive independent adult lives. 
The third goal was to assist States in the implementation of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families and support the smooth and effective transition of these young children to preschool. 
The bill that we are considering today, S. 717--the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997--has been developed with these three goals in mind. 
A basic framework used by the working group was developed by the Clinton administration during the 104th Congress. Without this framework provided by the administration, we would not have been able to achieve such a successful outcome. I was proud to have introduced, along with Senator Kennedy, the administration's proposed amendments to improve IDEA (S. 1075). In submitting the bill to Congress, Secretary Riley said: 
The IDEA has helped millions of disabled Americans to finish school, get a job, and make their civic contribution like other working americans. These amendments build on two decades of research and experience to meet the needs of the classrooms of today. They aim to ensure that students with disabilities are offered challenging materials in classrooms with well-prepared teachers. We want the focus of the IDEA today to be on better teaching and learning--and not on unnecessary paperwork. 
Much of the work of the administration in proposing improvements to IDEA has been because of the vision and leadership Judy Heumann, the Assistant Secretary of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. Ms. Heumann testified at the January 29, 1997, hearing on IDEA conducted by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. In her testimony, she explained how important this legislation is to children with disabilities and their families:  
Through IDEA programs, millions of children with disabilities have received the education they need to become fully participating, fully contributing members of our society. The IDEA is not just a law on paper. To most families with disabled children, it is the bedrock foundation upon which the future of their children depend . . . Disabled students and their families do not want to be shut away from the rest of society or given a watered-down curriculum; they want an opportunity to study and to work so that they can contribute to society. The IDEA has changed the role of government from one of caretaker of dependent individuals to one that opens the door to education and empowers people with disabilities to fully participate in their community. 
This IDEA reauthorization bill that we are considering today has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Last Wednesday, May 7, 1997, the Committee on Labor and Human Resources unanimously approved the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997 as an original bill. And the House Committee on Education and the Workforce voted out an identical bill. On the next day, S. 717 was formally introduced by Senator Jeffords and Senator Harkin, along with Senators Lott, Kennedy, Coats, Dodd, Gregg, Mikulski, Frist, DeWine, Enzi, Hutchinson, Murray, Collins, Warner, McConnell and Reed.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to join with our committee Chair, Senator Jeffords, in reluctantly perhaps opposing the amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire. As I said in 
my opening remarks, Senator Gregg has been a leader on the issue ensuring that we had adequate funding to help the States and local school districts meet their constitutional obligations. 
However, again, as Chairman Jeffords said, this bill was a compromise worked out after long negotiations, and certainly there is nothing in the bill that would restrict us in any way from reaching the levels that Senator Gregg wants to reach in the future. So that the door is open. 
Hopefully we will find those resources that would enable us to help the States meet their obligations. So I join with the chairman in opposing the amendment. 
Mr. President, there was something else that was said. Again, my colleague, Senator Jeffords, responded adequately to it. But I would like to just add my remarks to buttress what Senator Jeffords said regarding the statement made by my friend, Senator Gregg, about this being some kind of unfunded mandate and falling under the unfunded mandate law of the Congress. Quite frankly, Mr. President, many people still have this concept that IDEA is an unfunded mandate. It is simply not correct. Again I want to set the record straight. Part B of IDEA is not an unfunded mandate. 
The notion that Congress imposed a mandate on the States and school districts to educate children with disabilities and then refused to pay for it is simply not the case. 
The truth is that the right of children with disabilities for free appropriate public education is a constitutional right. It is not something that we mandated here in Congress. It was established in the early 1970's, as I said earlier, by two landmark court cases--Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children versus Commonwealth, in 1971, and Mills versus Board of Education of the District of Columbia, in 1972. 
Again, these established the right. Basically, in my own view, what they said is, `Look, if a State guarantees to its children a free public education, it can then not discriminate against other children because of disabilities.' 
Again, the Constitution certainly wouldn't allow a State to say we are going to provide free public education to all children but only if they are caucasian. Obviously, the Supreme Court would strike that down in a minute; or, we are going to provide a free public education to all males but not females. They will strike that down in a minute, too. You can think of all kinds of scenarios. 
What has been happening in the past is we were providing a free public education to kids but not to kids with disabilities. And the courts said, `Wait a minute. That falls under the same equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the Constitution.' So the courts struck it down. They said if the States provide that public education it can then not discriminate on the basis of disability. 
So it is not a mandate of Congress. It is a constitutional mandate. What Congress said was OK in 1974. Senator Jeffords was the leader at that time on the bill. But the Congress said it is OK. We understand that local school districts have a responsibility to provide a free and appropriate public education to disabled children. The Federal Government should help States meet their constitutional responsibility. And we set up the basic provisions of part B to make sure that the States meet the court judgments. 
As the Senate report stated, passage of the act, `It is the intent of the Committee to establish and protect the right to education for all handicapped children and to provide assistance to the States in carrying out their responsibilities under State law and the Constitution of the United States to provide equal protection under the law.' 
So again there is not an unfunded mandate of the Federal Government. Of course, again when the law was passed it was stated that the goal was for the Federal Government to eventually fund 40 percent of the cost. We are still down around 7 percent. So we have a long way to go to get to 40 percent. 
But again, that was never a requirement in law. It was a goal we set up. Again, I agree with Senator Gregg. It is a goal that we ought to be working toward. The Federal Government ought to provide greater assistance to local school districts to help them meet their constitutional responsibilities. We have a national goal. We have a national commitment to this. We ought to help solve that problem on a national basis. 
So, while I agree with Senator Gregg and his comments regarding trying to get the Federal role up, I do not agree with him that this is an unfunded mandate at all. The law and the record is clear on that. 
Also, IDEA is a program exempted from coverage under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. That was also introduced I believe by Senator Gregg. That would fall under that act that we passed a couple of years ago. 
The Congressional Budget Office explicitly recognized this fact in the House and Senate report accompanying the bill. 
I will read this. This is from page 45 of the report.  
Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes from consideration under that Act any bill that would `establish or enforce statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of . . . handicap, or disability.' S. 717 fits within that exclusion because it would ensure that the rights of children with disabilities are protected in the public education system. 
So clearly it does not fall under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. 
So, again, Mr. President, it is a good goal. There is nothing in this bill that prohibits us from meeting that goal. Hopefully those on the Appropriations Committee, of which I am one, will in the coming years ensure that the Federal Government meets more of the needs out there. I will not say `obligation' but `meet' more of the needs of what the Federal Government ought to be providing the States and local governments. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HARKIN. I do want to thank my colleague from Missouri for his long efforts to make sure that the law works and works well, not only on behalf of disabled students, but on behalf of all students. Certainly there is always room for discussion, debate, and trying to get a meeting of the minds and get people together on this. That is what I think we have done in this bill. 
As my friend from Missouri pointed out at the closure of his remarks, this does have a broad base of support, from the National School Boards Association, Parent-Teacher Association, school officers, disability rights groups. It has a broad base of support, cutting across all these lines, which I think indicates we have, indeed, through the leadership of Senator Jeffords, met our obligation to ensure that our constitutional requirements are fulfilled and at the same time to ensure that our schools are safe and conducive to learning for all students. 
I might just say to my friend from Missouri, about the case of which he spoke, about the tragic case of the young woman who was murdered, we had looked into that case in great detail. The American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service looked into the facts of the case whether IDEA had any relevance at all to the case. 
I will, just for the record, read the last paragraph of their analysis of the tragic death of Christine Smetzer. It said: 
Although IDEA's provisions did not appear to be directly implicated by the factual pattern involved in Christine Smetzer's death, questions were raised concerning other laws, namely those involving the confidentiality of juvenile records. The youth charged in the case apparently had a juvenile police record which was unavailable to the school officials. This situation apparently led to the amendment of state statutes regarding juvenile crime. The new statute provides in part that the juvenile court can give school administrators information about past histories of delinquents upon request, and schools may suspend a student who has been charged or convicted of a felony in adult court. 
Just for my friend's knowledge, in our bill we address that. We said here--I want to read for the Record, and I am told Senator Ashcroft was responsible on our committee for putting this on the committee level. It says: 
Disciplinary Information. 
This is right on the point with this case I think. 
The State may require that a local educational agency include in the records of a child with a disability a statement of any current or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child and transmit such statement to the same extent that such disciplinary information is included in, and transmitted with, the student records of nondisabled children. The statement may include a description of any behavior engaged in by the child that required disciplinary action, a description of the disciplinary action taken, and any other information that is relevant to the safety of the child and other individuals involved with the child. If the State adopts such a policy, and the child transfers from one school to another, the transmission of any of the child's records must include [must include] both the child's current individualized education program and any such statement of current or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child. 
So I hope that reaches this tragic case. I hope that would settle it. 
I yield to my friend.

Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague from Missouri. I know he has been on this issue for some time. 
I remember last year when we were working on the bill, it came to light, after we finished working on the bill at the committee level but before we went to the floor. I was informed by my staff that this amendment was part of the managers' amendment. We just did not get the bill up last year. I know the occupant of the chair was the leader of our subcommittee, and we had the bill ready to go last year. He worked his heart out to get the darned thing through, but for whatever reason it did not happen. 
I thank the Senator from Missouri for his long-time interest in this area and for working with us. I know sometimes the bills seem to get through exceedingly slow, but we finally got it accomplished, and hopefully it will be through in a couple of days. 
I also wanted to respond--and this is something I always like to point out when we talk about the high cost of educating kids with disabilities--I know it seems like it is a high cost, but then you have to look at the other side of the ledger. What is happening to these kids later on, what is society spending or saving later on during the lifetime of these young people as they go through school? 
I have some data here showing in 1974, the year before enactment of the 94-142, there were 70,655 children and youth with disabilities living in State institutions. By 1994, 20 years later, as a result of IDEA, the number had fallen to 4,001, less than 6 percent of what it was 20 years earlier. In 1994, the average State institution cost was $82,256 per person in an institution, with 66,654 fewer children institutionalized than in 1974. Because the States were footing the bill, the savings to the States is $5.46 billion per year that the States do not have to come up with for institutionalized care. The savings do not include the savings in welfare, social services and other costs for people with disabilities who are now able to live independently and be employed and pay taxes as a result of the special education they have received. 
A young friend of mine, Danny Piper, from Iowa, who I have followed for years, came and testified once before our Disabilities Policy Subcommittee. He is 26 years old, with an IQ of 39. When he was born, his parents were told to institutionalize him. They did not do it. They put him through school with IDEA, and he went through regular high school. He acted in a school play. He was a manager of the football team. 
To make a long story short, since graduating he has become a taxpayer. He has recently moved into his own apartment. He takes his own bus to work and is paying his own way. 
We figured out once with his folks what the total cost to taxpayers for his special education over this 18-year period was. He received early intervention, special education. The best they could come up with was a total additional cost of $63,000 for him for special education. The cost to taxpayers if he had been institutionalized would have been $5 million over his lifetime. 
Again, I know people think, gosh, it costs a lot of money, but we have to think where we were before and how much we were spending before for institutionalization, for a lot of people that did not need to be in institutions. Certainly Danny is one. He is out working and buying color TV's and things like that. 
I wanted to make that point because I know it is an expense and we have to think of the other side of the ledger.

Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, Mr. President, we just had a report from the Census Bureau which did a study that showed the employment population ratio for persons with severe disabilities increased from 23.3 percent in 1991, when ADA went into effect, to 26.1 in 1994, meaning there are 800,000 more severely disabled working in 1994 than in 1991, which is a 27-percent increase. 
So, again, I think what this Congress did with Public Law 94-142 in 1975, with the addition of part H in 1986, and then capped with the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990, have not only made us a more decent and caring society, a more inclusive society, but in the long run it will save us money because we are putting the money in at the front end, getting these kids early intervention programs, good education, integrating them with people they will live with all their lives. 
I remember some years ago when my daughter was in public school, coming home and talking about how they had a couple of kids with disabilities in the classrooms, just like it was normal. They are there every day. These are people we live with all our lives. Rather than segregating them out, we bring them in and include them. 
Even though it may cost some upfront, the savings, if you look in hard economic terms, the savings are tremendous later on. Of course, that is not counting the quality of life, the independence, the ability of people to have a better life for themselves even though they may have disabilities. 
All in all, it is a great bill, and the reauthorization and the amendments we have added, I believe, meet a lot of the concerns people have, legitimate concerns. I hope and trust this will provide for a more cooperative framework for parents, teachers, school administrators, and local law enforcement officials to work together in a very cooperative spirit to ensure that all kids with disabilities have that right to a free and appropriate public education. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to section 314 of S. 672, the supplemental appropriations bill. Section 314 was added to the bill in committee and would prohibit the Health Care Financing Administration from continuing with a Medicare competitive pricing demonstration project. I believe this provision does not belong on this emergency supplemental bill and if need be would more appropriately be addressed in the upcoming Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. In addition, I believe this provision would hurt our ability to reform Medicare and make certain that it gets the best deal possible for Medicare beneficiaries and other taxpayers. 
For many years, I have been working to identify and reform wasteful payment policies and practices in the administration of Medicare. The General Accounting Office estimates that up to 10 percent of Medicare funds are lost each year to waste, fraud and abuse. And my experience is that a large percentage of that is due to wasteful payment policies and practices. Clearly, the current Medicare payment scheme for managed care falls into this category and needs reform. Current policy grossly overpays in some areas and underpays in many rural areas. 
While there may be issues that need to be resolved with beneficiaries and providers in the area in which this managed care competitive pricing demonstration is to occur, that does not justify a complete cutoff of funds for the test. Officials at HCFA should promptly work with the community to address these issues. If there are legitimate issues that cannot be resolved over the next month or two, we could consider options for action on the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill. 
Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, we need to test ways in which we can achieve Medicare savings to ensure this critically important program's long-term solvency while preserving access and quality for beneficiaries. Enacting section 314 of this bill would be a setback to this important effort. Because of this I'm hopeful that this matter will be reconsidered and that any problems associated with this particular demonstration project can be promptly worked out administratively without the need for legislative action. 
I also want to express my concern with section 323 of the bill. This section is a legislative rider that is unrelated to the substance of S. 672. It repeals section 1555 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 which was intended to save taxpayers millions of dollars by giving State and local governments to take advantage of the purchasing power of the Federal Government. Implementation of this provision was delayed for 18 months last year to give time for the General Accounting Office to study the issue and report back recommendations to Congress. We should allow time to get the GAO's report and recommendations before taking action on this important issue.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the National Guard has a history of superb performance in supporting the needs of law enforcement agencies and community antidrug coalitions. Every day the National Guard has nearly 4,000 soldiers and airmen on full-time counter drug duty. Three-hundred and seventy-three in support of the Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA], 625 in support of U.S. Customs, and 3,000 more in support of local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies in every State in the Nation. 
Unfortunately, for the last 5 years, this successful program has been on a budget rollercoaster. For example, funding for the fiscal year 1998 National Guard Counterdrug State plans program will result in a 42-percent cut in the amount actually available to State plans from the fiscal year 1997 level. It is tough to maintain program consistency when the funding level fluctuates each year. Legislation I am introducing today, along with Senator Ford, the co-chairman of the National Guard Caucus, will stabilize funding for the National Guard Counterdrug State plans program at no less than $200 million each fiscal year. 
Iowa law enforcement, as well as law enforcement across the United States, relies heavily on the help of the National Guard in their drug fighting efforts. The National Guard provides personnel and equipment to local law enforcement agencies. Guard men and women assist with analytical and technical support so that criminal investigators can be out on the street. The Iowa High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area [HIDTA] task force plans to utilize National Guard support as part of their efforts to fight methamphetamine trafficking in Iowa. Guard men and women also work in partnership with the Community Anti-drug Coalition of America and expect to reach 10 million young people in the country to help educate and motivate them to reject the use of illegal drugs. 
As we face unprecedented drug problems in Iowa and across the Nation, it is necessary to maintain consistent funding for the drug fighting efforts of the National Guard. Not only does the National Guard Counterdrug Program free up criminal investigators to fight crime on the streets, it provides an avenue for cooperation that makes enforcement more efficient as well. This program traditionally enjoys bipartisan support and affects law enforcement all across the United States. I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my good friend and colleague Senator Inouye in introducing legislation submitted by the Clinton administration to require the addition of a statue portraying FDR and his disability. This is an important measure that I hope will be quickly approved. 
I have always said that it took a disabled President to lead a disabled nation. President Clinton has taken the right step in improving the FDR Memorial by allowing Americans to view a more complete picture of one of our Nation's greatest Presidents. 
I look forward to the long-awaited dedication of the FDR Memorial this Friday. I have long thought this very important new memorial should include a statue depicting FDR in a wheelchair. Contrary to popular belief, President Roosevelt did at times purposely display his disability to inspire wounded veterans, persons with polio, and other groups of Americans. A statue portraying his disability will stand as a reminder to current and future generations of Americans that disability is a natural part of the human experience that in no way diminishes the ability of a person to fully participate in all aspects of American life. 
As the author of the Americans With Disabilities Act, I was proud to be joined by leaders of the disability community, former Presidents Bush, Carter, and Ford, a number of Roosevelt's descendants, and many other Americans in calling for a permanent depiction of FDR with his disability at the memorial. Our challenge now is to take the necessary steps to make this additional statue part of the FDR Memorial as soon as possible.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a brief comment about Alexis Herman. Recall that Ms. Herman was unanimously reported out of this committee. We should not be holding her hostage over an unrelated policy dispute--a disagreement with the President over project labor agreements. I hope that whatever one's views are on project labor agreements that her nomination can move forward. 
The Secretary of Labor serves as the spokesperson for working families in this country. We are considering several pieces of legislation that will affect working families and it is important that the Secretary of Labor be at the table as these changes in our work places are being considered. Ms. Herman must be allowed to assume her responsibilities as Secretary of Labor without further delay. I think it is unfortunate that our colleagues continue to deny the Senate even a vote on this important member of the President's Cabinet. 
Now, let us be clear on the proposed Executive order regarding project labor agreements [PLA's]. The Executive order only directs Federal agencies to consider using PLA's, it does not require them to do so. The Federal Government's interest in PLA's is to help ensure that public sector projects are completed efficiently, economically, and safely. 
PLA's set wages, working conditions, and dispute-resolution procedures for the duration of the project. This makes it easier for agencies to avoid cost-overruns and delays, while ensuring high quality work and safety at the worksite. They guarantee that the project will be completed on time, without strikes or lockouts. I find it incredible that the majority is so offended by this commonsense initiative. 
There is nothing new about project labor agreements--the Federal Government has used them on Federal projects since the 1930's. Examples include the Grand Coulee Dam, the Cape Canaveral Space Center, and the Nevada test site. Project labor agreements have been a very effective tool for Federal, State and local governments when faced with a major public works projects. PLA's have helped bring management and labor together to work out arrangements in terms of things like wages, benefits, and working conditions in return for a promise of no work stoppages or strikes. 
Contrary to what has been said about project labor agreements, non-union contractors and nonunion workers would not be prohibited from working on Federal projects--they simply would have to abide by the terms of the project labor agreement for that particular project. 
Republican Governors Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and George Pataki of New York issued similar executive orders authorizing state agencies to use project labor agreements. Also, State and local governments regularly use PLA's. 
One notable example is the giant sewage treatment system now being built for metropolitan Boston as part of a court ordered clean up of Boston Harbor. Forty percent of the contractors on the Boston Harbor project are non-union. Furthermore, the projected cost of the project was $6.1 billion, the present estimate for completion is $3.4 billion. The Boston Harbor project is on schedule for completion by the year 2000 and safety, measured in lost time due to workplace injuries is below the industry average. During the 7 years of work on this project, there have been approximately 20 million hours worked without lost time due to strike or lock-out. This is quite a record of success. 
Lastly, contrary to the claim that President Clinton's proposed Executive order (EO) exceeds his constitutional authority, this action is legitimate and typical of actions taken by other Presidents with clear constitutional and statutory authority. For decades, presidents of both political parties have exercised their authority to issue executive orders to implement changes in Government contracting policies. Furthermore, when President Bush issued an Executive order in 1992 to prohibit Federal agencies and Federal contractors from entering into project labor agreements, there was no similar outcry. 
The Executive order on PLA's and the upcoming regulations on procurement reform are not a pay off to labor. They are sound policies that will make government operate more efficiently. The Federal Government should consider using project labor agreements when they increase efficiency, stability, and save taxpayer money.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will inform and empower consumers in the United States through a voluntary labeling system for wearing apparel and sporting goods made without the use of abusive and exploitative child labor. Congressman George Miller is introducing companion legislation in the other body. 
This is the second time I have come to the floor of the Senate to introduce this bill, and I will continue to introduce it until it becomes law. 
I'd like to ask my colleagues to take a moment to look around. Maybe it's the shirt you have on right now. Or the silk tie or blouse. Or the soccer ball you kick around with your kids in the backyard. Or the tennis shoes you wear on weekends. 
Chances are that you have purchased something--perhaps many things--made with abusive and exploitative child labor. And chances are you were completely unaware that was the case. You will find a label that tells you what size it is, how to take care for it and what it costs. But it doesn't tell you about the person who made it. 
Mr. President, recently, the International Labor Organization [ILO] released a very grim report about the number of children who toil away in abhorrent conditions. The ILO estimates that over 250 million children worldwide under the age of 15 are working instead of receiving a basic education. Many of these children begin working in factories at the age of 6 or 7, some even younger. They are poor, malnourished, and often forced to work 60-hour weeks for little or no pay. 
Now when I speak about child labor, I am not talking about 17-year-olds helping out on the family farm or running errands after school. I am speaking about children, often under 12 years old, who are forced to work long hours in hazardous and dangerous conditions, many as slaves, instead of going to school. 
On September 23, 1993, the Senate appropriately put itself on record as expressing its principled opposition to the abhorrent practice of exploiting children for commercial gain and asserting that it should be the policy of the United States to prohibit the importation of products made through the use of abusive and exploitative child labor by passing a sense of the Senate Resolution I introduced. In my view, this was the first step toward ending child labor. 
Mr. President, never has the issue of child labor in the garment industry been more prominent than today. Last year, talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford learned that some of the garments with her name on them were being produced by children. She did not bury her head in the sand. Instead, she reacted quickly and decisively to heighten awareness about the issue of abusive and exploitative child labor. 
Americans in Des Moines or Dallas or Detroit may say, `What does this have to do with us?' It is quite simple. By protecting the rights of workers everywhere, we will be protecting jobs and opportunities here at home. A U.S. worker cannot compete with a 12-year-old working 12 hours a day for 12 cents. 
Last year, the United States imported almost 50 percent of the wearing apparel sold in this country and the garment industry netted $34 billion. According to the Department of Commerce, last year, the United States imported 494.1 million pairs of athletic footwear and produced only 65.3 million here at home. That means that we imported enough shoes to encircle the earth five and a half times. 
As I have traveled around the country and spoken with people about the issue of abusive and exploitative child labor, I have found that consumers--ordinary Americans--want to get involved. They want information. They want to know if the products they are buying are made by children. 
According to a survey sponsored by Marymount University, more than three out of four Americans said they would avoid shopping at stores if they were aware that the goods sold there were made by exploitative and abusive child labor. They also said that they would be willing to pay an extra $1 on a $20 garment if it were guaranteed to be made under legitimate circumstances. I ask unanimous consent to enter this study into the Record. 
Mr. President, it is obvious that consumers don't want to reward companies with their hard-earned dollars by buying products made with abusive and exploitative child labor. 
This issue demands our attention. My legislation, the Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act 1997, will inform and empower consumers in the United States through a voluntary labeling system for wearing apparel and sporting goods made without abusive and exploitative child labor. In my view, a system of voluntary labeling holds the best promise of giving consumers the information they want--and giving the companies that manufacture these products the recognition they deserve. 
The crux of this legislation is to provide the framework for members of the wearing apparel and sporting goods industry, labor organizations, consumer advocacy and human rights groups along with the Secretaries of Commerce, Treasury, and Labor to establish the labeling standard and develop a system to assure compliance that items were not made with abusive and exploitative child labor. Thus, ensuring consumers that the garment or pair of tennis shoes they purchase was made without abusive and exploitative child labor. 
In my view, Congress can't do it alone through legislation. The Department of Labor can't do it alone through enforcement. It takes all of us from the private sector to labor and human rights groups to take responsibility, to come together to end abusive and exploitative child labor. And I am pleased to say there has recently been promising action to that end. 
Yesterday, an article in the New York Times appeared announcing a tentative agreement between human rights and labor leaders and some members of the apparel industry to adopt a code of conduct and a promise to form an association to provide consumers with information 
on the items they purchase. This is a praise worthy initiative and I am glad that my discussions with President Clinton on the issue of child labor have helped lead to this development. Now, we must take the logical next step to inform and assure consumers that the goods they purchase are not made with abusive and exploitative child labor. My bill has provisions for a labeling system that will inform consumers that the wearing apparel and sporting goods they purchase are not made by the sweat and toil of children, as well as enforcement provisions to assure consumers that the label has integrity. Until an effective and reliable labeling and monitoring system is in place, consumers can never truly be sure that the goods they purchase were not made by an exploited child. I look forward to continuing my work with my colleagues and the White House on strengthening this initiative to inform and empower consumers. That is what the American consumer demands and deserves. 
Mr. President, when the private sector decides to take speak up--it certainly can make a difference. Recently, in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has agreed to work with the International Labor Organization to take children out of the garment factories and put them into school--where they belong. As of July 1996, more than 110 schools for former child workers have opened, serving nearly 2,000 children. So, if we can do it in Bangladesh, then we can do it elsewhere. 
Mr. President, let me be clear, companies can choose to use the label or not to. This bill is not about the big government telling the private sector what to do. This bill is centered around this fundamental principle: Let the Buyer Be Aware. This `Truth in Labeling' initiative is based on the principle that a fully informed American consumer will make the right, and moral, choice and vote against abusive and exploitative child labor with their pocketbook. 
We have seen such an approach work effectively with the Rugmark label for hand-knotted carpets from India. It is operating in some European countries. Consumers who want to buy child labor-free carpets can just look for the Rugmark label. I visited the Rugmark headquarters in New Delhi, India last week. Mr. President, this initiative is working. It has succeeded in taking children out of the factories and putting them into schools while providing consumers with the information they need. 
By the end of April, half a million carpets will have received the Rugmark label and been shipped to stores in Germany. Rugmark licenses already provide 30 percent of German carpet imports from India. And I am pleased to say that there are two wholesalers in New York that offer carpets with the Rugmark label. I am hopeful that by the end of the year there will be at least 20 importers in the United States. 
Mr. President, the progress that has been made on eradicating abusive and exploitative child labor is irreversible. Therefore we must continue to move forward. And I believe my bill allows us to do just that. It allows the consumer to know more about the products they buy and give companies that use the label the recognition they deserve. 
Our nation began this century by working to end abusive and exploitative child labor in America, let us close this century by ending child labor around the world. I urge my colleagues to support my bill. 
I hope that we will be able to vote on this piece of legislation in the near future so that we can give consumers the information they deserve to make informed decisions.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on March 13, 1997, along with Senator Arlen Specter, I introduced bipartisan legislation, S. 441, the National Fund for Health Research Act. This important bill would provide additional resources for health research over and above those provided to the National Institutes of Health in the annual appropriations process. The fund will help eradicate some of the illnesses that now strike millions of Americans.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Specter to introduce the National Fund for Health Research Act. This legislation is similar to legislation I introduced with Senator Hatfield during the last Congress which gained broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. 
Our proposal would establish a national fund for health research to provide additional resources for health research over and above those provided to the National Institutes of Health [NIH] in the annual appropriations process. The fund would greatly enhance the quality of health care by investing more in finding preventive measures, cures, and cost-effective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions that strike Americans. 
To finance the fund, health plans would set aside approximately 1 percent of all health premiums and transfer the funds to the Department of the Treasury. The Department of the Treasury would then transfer the money to the national fund for health research. 
Each year under our proposal amounts within the national fund for health research would automatically be allocated to each of the NIH Institutes and Centers. Each Institute and Center would receive the same percentage as they received of the total NIH appropriation for that fiscal year. The set aside should generate sufficient funds to provide for a nearly 50-percent increase in funding for the NIH. 
In 1994, I argued that any health care reform plan should include additional funding for health research. Health care reform has been taken off the front burner but the need to increase our Nation's commitment to health research has not diminished. 
While health care spending devours nearly $1 trillion annually our medical research budget is dying of starvation. The United States devotes less than 2 percent of its total health care budget to health research. The Defense Department spends 15 percent of its budget on research. Does this make sense? The cold war is over but the war against disease and disability continues. 
Increased investment in health research is key to reducing health costs in the long run. If we can find the cure for a disease like Alzheimer's the savings would be enormous. Today, federally supported funding for research on Alzheimer's disease totals $300 million yet it is estimated that nearly $100 billion is expended annually on caring for people with Alzheimer's. 
Gene therapy and treatments for cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's could eliminate years of chronic care costs, while saving lives and improving patients' quality of life. 
Mr. President, Senator Specter and I do everything we can to increase funding for NIH through the appropriations process. But, given the current budget situation and freeze in discretionary spending what we can do is limited. Without action, our investment in medical research through the NIH is likely to continue to decline in real terms. 
The NIH is not able to fund even 25 percent of competing research projects or grant applications deemed worthy of funding. This is compared to rates of 30 percent or more just a decade ago. Science and cutting edge medical research is being put on hold. We may be giving up possible cures for diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and countless other diseases. 
Our lack of investment in research may also be discouraging our young people from pursuing careers in medical research. The number of people under the age of 36 even applying for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993. This is due to a host of factors but I'm afraid that the lower success rates among applicants is making biomedical research less and less attractive to young people. If the perception is that funding for research is impossible to obtain, young people that may have chosen medical research 10 years ago will choose other career paths. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that over 130 groups representing patients, hospitals, medical schools, researchers, and millions of Americans have already endorsed our proposal. 
Mr. President, health research is an investment in our future--it is an investment in our children and grandchildren. It holds the promise of cure or treatment for millions of Americans.

The bill I'm introducing today prohibits the importation of any product made, whole or in part, by children under the age of 15 who are employed in manufacturing or mining. This is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate to introduce this bill, and I will continue to introduce it until it becomes law. 
Mr. President, recently, the International Labor Organization [ILO] released a very grim report about the number of children who toil away in abhorrent conditions. The ILO estimates that over 200 million children worldwide under the age of 15 are working instead of receiving a basic education. Many of these children begin working in factories at the age of 6 or 7, some even younger. They are poor, malnourished, and often forced to work 60-hour weeks for little or no pay. 
Child labor is most prevalent in countries with high unemployment rates. According to the ILO, some 61 percent of child workers, nearly 153 million children, are found in Asia; 32 percent, or 80 million, are in Africa and 7 percent, or 17.5 million, live in Latin America. Adult unemployment rates in some nations runs over 20 percent. In Latin America, for example, about 1 in every 10 children are workers. Furthermore, in many nations where child labor is prevalent, more money is spent and allocated for military expenditures than for education and health services. 
The situation is as deplorable as it is enormous. In many developing countries children represent a substantial part of the work force and can be found in such industries as rugs, toys, textiles, mining, and sports equipment manufacturing. 
For instance, it is estimated that 65 percent of the wearing apparel that Americans purchase is assembled or manufactured abroad, therefore, increasing the chance that these items were made by abusive and exploitative child labor. In the rug industry, Indian and Pakistan produce 95 percent of their rugs for export. Some of the worst abuses of child labor have been documented in these countries, including bonded and slave labor. 
Venezuela and Colombia exported $6,084,705 and $1,385,669 worth of mined products respectively to the United States in 1995. Both were documented by the Department of Labor as using child labor in mining. Mining hazards for children include exposure to harmful dusts, gases, and fumes that cause respiratory diseases that can develop into silicosis, pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis, and emphysema after some years of exposure. Child miners also suffer from physical strain, fatigue, and musculoskeletal disorders, as well as serious injuries from falling objects. 
Children may also be crippled physically by being forced to work too early in life. For example, a large-scale ILO survey in the Philippines found that more than 60 percent of working children were exposed to chemical and biological hazards, and that 40 percent experienced serious injuries or illnesses. 
These practices are often underground, but the ILO report points out that children are still being sold outright for a sum of money. Other times, landlords buy child workers from their tenants, or labor contractors pay rural families in advance in order to take their children away to work in carpet weaving, glass manufacturing, or prostitution. Child slavery of this type has long been reported in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Africa, despite vigorous official denial of its existence. 
Additionally, children are increasingly being bought and sold across national borders by organized networks. The ILO report states that at least five such international networks trafficking in children exist: from Latin America to Europe and the Middle East; from South and Southeast Asia to Northern Europe and the Middle East; a European regional market; an associated Arab regional market; and, a West Africa export market in girls. 
In Pakistan, the ILO reported in 1991 that an estimated half of the 50,000 children working as bonded labor in Pakistan's carpet-weaving industry will never reach the age of 12--victims of disease and malnutrition. 
I have press reports from India of children freed from virtual slavery in the carpet factories of Northern India. Twelve-year-old Charitra Chowdhary recounted his story--he said, `If we moved slowly we were beaten on our backs with a stick. We wanted to run away but the doors were always locked.' 
Mr. President, that's what this bill is about, children, whose dreams and childhood are being sold for a pittance to factory owners and in markets around the globe. 
It's about protecting children around the globe and their future. It's about eliminating a major form of child abuse in our world. It's about breaking the cycle of poverty by getting these kids out of factories and into schools. It's about raising the standard of living in the Third World so we can compete on the quality of goods instead of the misery and suffering of those who make them. It's about assisting Third World governments to enforce their laws by ending the role of the United States in providing a lucrative market for goods made by abusive and exploitative child labor and encouraging other nations to do the same. 
Mr. President, unless the economic exploitation of children is eliminated, the potential and creative capacity of future 
generations will forever be lost to the factory floor. 
Mr. President, the Child Labor Deterrence Act of 1997 is intended to strengthen existing U.S. trade laws and help Third World countries enforce their child labor laws. The bill directs the U.S. Secretary of Labor to compile and maintain a list of foreign industries and their respective host countries that use child labor in the production of exports to the United States. Once the Secretary of Labor identifies a foreign industry, the Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to prohibit the importation of a product from an identified industry. The entry ban would not apply if a U.S. importer signs a certificate of origin affirming that they took reasonable steps to ensure that products imported from identified industries are not made by child labor. In addition, the President is urged to seek an agreement with other governments to secure an international ban on trade in the products of child labor. Further, any company or individual who would intentionally violate the law would face both civil and criminal penalties. 
This legislation is not about imposing our standards on the developing world. It's about preventing those manufacturers in the developing world who exploit child labor from imposing their standards on the United States. They are forewarned. If manufacturers and importers insist on investing in child labor, instead of investing in the future of children, I will work to assure that their products are barred from entering the United States. 
Mr. President, as I said when I first introduced this bill 4 years ago, it is time to end this human tragedy and our participation in it. It is time for greater government and corporate responsibility. No longer can officials in the Third World or U.S. importers turn a blind eye to the suffering and misery of the world's children. No longer do American consumers want to provide a market for goods produced by the sweat and toil of children. By providing a market for goods produced by child labor, U.S. importers have become part of the problem by perpetuating the impoverishment of poor families. Through this legislation, importers now have the opportunity to become part of the solution by ending this abominable practice. 
Mr. President, countries do not have to wait until poverty is eradicated or they are fully developed before eliminating the economic exploitation of children. In fact, the path to development is to eliminate child labor and increase expenditures on children such as primary education. In far too many countries, governments spend millions on military expenditures and fail to provide basic educational opportunities to its citizens. As a result, over 130 million children are not in primary school. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, my bill places no undue burden on U.S. importers. I know of no importer, company, or department store that would willingly promote the exploitation of children. I know of no importer, company, or department store that would want their products and image tainted by having their products produced by child labor. And I know that no American consumer would knowingly purchase something made with abusive and exploitative child labor. These entities take reasonable steps to ensure the quality of their goods; they should also be willing to take reasonable steps to ensure that their goods are not produced by child labor. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there's a story that's told about the film actor and comedian W.C. Fields. He was hardly religious, but on his deathbed a friend discovered him reading the Bible. So he asked Fields what we he was doing--and the actor responded with characteristic dry wit, `I'm looking for loopholes.' 
For too long, many multinational firms and foreign corporations operating in this country have done the same thing with the United States Tax Code. They have searched our tax laws for loopholes--and carved out special-interest breaks to avoid paying their fair share. And they've done it with great success. Today, for example, over seventy percent of foreign-based corporations in the United States pay no Federal income tax. Meanwhile working families who play by the rules struggle just to make ends meet. This is simply wrong and as a matter of basic fairness, it must end. 
So today, Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Corporate Welfare Reduction Act of 1997 which will save taxpayers over $20 billion over the next 6 years. Companion legislation has been introduced in the other body by my friend and colleague Representative Lane Evans. Now is the time to act on this measure. 
In the coming days, we will take up a constitutional amendment to balance the Government's budget. I will vote for it. I believe we must get our financial house in order if we are to pass on to future generations a legacy of hope, and not a legacy of debt. 
But if we are going to balance our Government's budget--and keep it balanced in the years to come--every taxpayer will have to do their part. There's no doubt that working families and small businesses on Main Street already are contributing significantly. But foreign-based and multinational corporations simply have not paid their fair share. 
One of the central goals of Government policy--particularly tax policy--ought to be promoting investment in our people and in our businesses here at home. For too long, though, our tax policies have had it backwards--rewarding U.S. companies that move overseas and granting unfair tax giveaways to foreign subsidiaries in this country. 
American businesses shouldn't be forced to compete against foreign subsidiaries here that don't pay their fair share of taxes. And American workers shouldn't be left out in the cold because our tax laws encouraged companies to ship jobs away and ship products back. 
That is why I am introducing the Corporate Welfare Reduction Act. This legislation contains six main provisions. 
First, it ends the use of transfer pricing rules by multinational corporations to lower their U.S. tax liability. Multinational companies often sell a product to their subsidiaries at a discounted price--effectively increasing a company's income while decreasing its U.S. tax liability. This bill would restrict a company's interagency pricing policies and, instead, tax the sale of products at their fair market value. 
Second, the bill disallows the practice of `sourcing' income from the sale of inventory property. In many cases, multinational corporations pass the title of sale to a foreign-owned subsidiary in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes even though the sale is completed in the United States. 
Third, it limits the excessive use of tax credits taken by multinational corporations on foreign oil and gas extraction income [FOGEI] and foreign oil related income [FORI]. U.S. tax credits should only be applied against foreign taxes, not the fees and royalties assessed by foreign nations. 
Fourth, it narrows section 911 of the tax code that exempts the first $70,000 of earned income from U.S. taxes for American citizens living and working abroad. However, this bill would allow those persons who work for non-profit organizations to still claim this exemption and would allow all U.S. citizens working abroad to deduct their children's education expenses up through high school. 
Fifth, it ends the tax-exempt status of foreign investors who buy private-issued debt by requiring these persons to pay a 30-percent withholding tax on the interest they earned on the bonds. 
Finally, this legislation would end the exemption of foreign individuals from capital gains taxes on the sale of stock in a U.S. corporation--unless they spend more than half the year in the United States. 
The revenue raised in this legislation from closing these loopholes will go solely to deficit reduction. As I said, in a time when we are trying to reach a balanced budget, everyone must pay their fair share. 
Mr. President, this is a common sense bill that will provide some fairness to working families and integrity to our Tax Code. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this common sense measure.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it was with great sadness that my wife and I learned this morning of the death of a dear friend of over two and one-half decades, Pamela Harriman, our country's Ambassador to France. 
As I said, for the better part of about 25 years, Pamela and Averell, first of all, were friends and two people who encouraged me early on in my political life when I first ran for office. Later, after her husband Averell passed away, Pamela continued to extend that hand of friendship to me, my wife, and our family. 
I remember when I first came to Washington as a freshman Congressman in 1975, I was amazed at how Pamela Harriman and Averell at that time opened up their home to younger Members. I know a lot has been made about how the movers and shakers of the world were always at Pamela Harriman's house. But it was not just them; she always made sure her home and house was open to the new people who came to Washington. She was constantly promoting and encouraging young people, young Members of Congress, new people who were here, to showcase their ideas, to encourage them, to push harder and to climb up the ladder. So I remember her very fondly for the encouragement and support that she gave this Senator in my early years of seeking public office. 
During the last decade, the 1980's, Pamela Harriman was always there in our party, the Democratic Party, trying to rebuild and to encourage people to seek public office. As I said, she was always encouraging the formulation of new ideas and approaches. I think our party owes her a great debt for all that she did to encourage these younger people and to keep us pulled together during the decade of the 1980's. During the Presidential election of 1992, she was very active in helping then Governor Clinton gain the White House. 
For the last 3 1/2 years, Pamela Harriman served this country honorably and well and I think with great distinction as our Ambassador to France. As I have had occasion to travel overseas, I have heard, on many occasions, from individuals in different parts of Europe about what a great representative of America Pamela Harriman was. She was indeed that. 
Pamela Harriman was always proud of her British ancestry and heritage. She was even more proud of the fact that she was an American. She was always undeniably gracious to all who came within her reach. She was always open to new ideas, as I said, of the younger people coming into Government and politics. She always found time to give encouragement, help, and support. 
So it is a sad day for our country, for all of her friends, and for all of those of us in the Democratic Party who looked to her for help and support for so many years. Ruth, my wife, and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Harriman family. I just want to say that Pamela Harriman indeed left a very indelible mark, not only in the city of Washington, not only on the Democratic Party, but indeed on the United States of America. She will be greatly missed. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Lugar and Senator Leahy in introducing legislation to amend the Commodity Exchange Act. This bill updates and streamlines U.S. futures trading law, and provides needed clarification to several critical issues facing today's vast derivative markets. 
After reviewing the committee testimony taken last year, and meeting informally with industry, regulators, and academics, Chairman Lugar, Senator Leahy, and I are convinced that these changes are appropriate and necessary if the United States is to maintain its dynamic, world-class futures trading industry. 
There is a strong public interest in maintaining a competitive and sound futures market in the United States. These markets are critical because they allow farmers, ranchers, and other businesses to manage risk and maximize their investment opportunities. At the same time, the committee has an obligation to protect the public trust through effective enforcement and regulatory measures that prevent and punish fraud and other abuses that may, and have, occurred in the international financial markets--including the futures market. 
This bill is a bipartisan effort to find the balance between the need for prudent regulation with industry's need for changes so that the U.S. futures market continues to be the driving force in today's competitive global financial markets. 
Introduction of this legislation is timely. President Clinton's 1998 budget, due for release later this week, challenges Federal agencies to do more with less. It will ask Federal agencies to improve programs and services and streamline procedures. 
This legislation provides legislative backing to accomplish this crucial goal. The bill proposes specific changes that will further assist the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the primary regulator of the futures industry, to continue its on-going effort to focus scarce resources where they are most effective--in enforcement--preventing consumer fraud and manipulation of market prices. 
The legislation allows industry to focus on product innovation and marketing so that the end users--farmers, ranchers, and other businesses--have available to them, free of fraud and at a competitive price, the most state-of-the-art financial products. 
The bill also provides the CFTC with additional authority to require U.S. delivery points for overseas futures markets to provide information similar to that currently demanded of American market participants. This provision may help prevent a repeat of last summer's 1996 London/Tokyo copper market crisis where billions of dollars were lost due, in part, to lack of sufficient information and Government oversight by the CFTC's foreign counterparts. 
I am pleased that this legislation addresses the uncertainty that currently exists in the so-called `Treasury amendment', a 1974 provision of the Commodity Exchange Act that excludes certain financial products from its regulatory coverage. This provision has long been controversial and our proposal suggests one solution. 
It is unfortunate that the Treasury Department and the CFTC were unable to negotiate a resolution of this issue in time for this bill's reintroduction. But I remain open to alternative proposals, and look forward to hearing the views of all interested regulators, industry participants, and users of these products at next week's hearings. 
Two other important aspects of this legislation are a provision that provides greater legal certainty for the over-the-counter financial tools such as swaps and hybrids, and a provision that codifies a 1992 provision to allow on-exchange products to be traded solely among professional investors. Both of these provisions are important to the ability of private enterprises to manage business risk. 
I am very pleased to join my colleagues in offering this bill. Chairman Lugar, Senator Leahy, and I have worked together on futures issues for many years. We did the same on this bill--working to ensure that these markets remain competitive while maintaining effective provisions on customer protection and market integrity. 
Introducing this bill early in the 105th Congress offers ample time to continue last year's public discussion and debate over what changes are appropriate and necessary to maintaining a viable U.S. futures market. 
It is my experience that such a dialogue helps develop solid bipartisan legislation. As with most issues, there are many interests that must be balanced, and this bill strives to find that balance. I am certainly open to further input as we hold hearings next week. 
I look forward to continuing the process.

 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is perhaps no other form of discrimination that has as direct an impact on the day-to-day lives of workers as wage discrimination. When women aren't paid what they are worth, we all get cheated. 
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits sex-based discrimination in compensation for doing the same job. However, this statute fails to address other components of the pay equity problem such as job segregation. Current law has not reached far enough to combat wage discrimination when employers routinely pay lower wages to jobs that are dominated by women. More than 30 years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women's wages still lag behind their male counterparts' wages. This important issue demands our attention. 
In the last Congress, I introduced the Fair Pay Act so we could close the wage gap once and for all. I am reintroducing this legislation in the 105th Congress so we can continue to fight for fairness on behalf of working families. 
The Fair Pay Act is designed to pick up where the Equal Pay Act left off. The heart of the bill seeks to eliminate wage discrimination based upon sex, race, or national origin. This important legislation would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to require employers to provide equal pay for work in jobs that are comparable in skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. The Fair Pay Act would apply to each company individually and would prohibit companies from reducing employees' wages to achieve pay equity. 
Wage gaps can result from differences in education, experience, or time in the work force and the Fair Pay Act does not interfere with that. But just as there is a glass ceiling in the American workplace, there is also what I call a glass wall--where women are on the exact same level as their male coworkers. They have the same skills, they have the same responsibilities, but they are still obstructed from receiving the same pay. It's a hidden barrier, but a barrier all the same. The Fair Pay Act is about knocking down the glass wall. It's a fundamental issue of fairness to provide equal pay for work of equal value to an employer. 
Fair pay is a commonsense business issue. Women make up almost half of the work force and fair pay is essential to attract and keep good workers. 
Fair pay is an economic issue. Working women, after all, don't get special discounts when they buy food and clothing for their families. They don't pay less for a ticket to the movies or gasoline for their cars. 
And fair pay is a family issue. When women aren't paid what they are worth, families get cheated too. Over a lifetime the average woman loses $420,000 due to unequal pay practices. Such gaps in income are life changing for women and their families. The income gap can mean the difference between welfare and self-sufficiency, owning a home or renting, sending kids to college or to a minimum wage job, or having a secure retirement tomorrow instead of scrimping to survive today. 
The Fair Pay Act has already been endorsed by a wide variety of groups and organizations. In addition, polling data consistently shows that over 70 percent of the American people support a law requiring the same pay for men and women in jobs requiring skills and responsibilities. The American people want fair pay legislation. Their elected representatives ought to want it too. 
I would ask my colleagues to review this important legislation and come to me or my staff with any questions you may have. I welcome your comments and suggestions and urge your support. It's a simple issue of fairness for women to earn equal pay for work of equal value to an employer.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination of Madeleine Albright to become our Nation's 64th Secretary of State. I have been privileged to know and work with Ambassador Albright for nearly two decades and I am confident that she will be a determined, effective voice for American interests as we face the foreign policy challenges of the 21st century. 
This is a historic nomination. With this vote, Madeleine Albright will become the Nation's first woman to hold the office of Secretary of State. But it's clear that this nomination was not based on gender--but on qualifications. Madeleine Albright has been an outstanding leader for America and an outspoken advocate for freedom. 
Today Madeleine Albright steps out in front and breaks a longstanding barrier. But that's no surprise because she has made a life of doing just that. From the time her family broke from the barriers of totalitarianism in Czechoslovakia and the brutal grip of Hitler and Stalin, Madeleine Albright has dedicated her life to spreading freedom and promoting international understanding. 
She did it as a member of President Carter's National Security Council, as a noted scholar and professor at Georgetown University, as the president of the Center for National Policy, and--most recently--as America's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. 
As in all her other work, Madeleine Albright brought energy and vitality to the job of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. And her plain spoken determination helped restore democracy in Haiti, prosecute war criminals in the former Yugoslavia, and make headway in achieving a comprehensive nuclear test ban. She also led the charge to achieve much needed reforms in the United Nations--by advocating lower budgets, more accountability, and a streamlined bureaucracy. 
Madeleine Albright has rightly observed that the United States is the world's indispensable nation. But I would add that she herself has been an indispensable part of the foreign policy achievements of the Clinton administration over the past 4 years and she will continue to be in the years to come. 
Finally, Mr. President, I look forward to working with Secretary Albright on an issue that I have long championed--ending abusive and exploitative child labor around the world. I hope that she will use the office of the Secretary of State to focus attention on this deplorable practice as she meets with leaders in government and commerce around the world. Working together, I know that we can finally end the curse of child labor. 
Mr. President, I believe that Madeleine Albright is an excellent choice to become our Nation's top diplomat and I am proud to cast my vote in support of her nomination.
