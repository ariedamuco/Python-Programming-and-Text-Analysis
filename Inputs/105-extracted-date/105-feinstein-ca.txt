 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Quincy Library Group bill has been included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill. This legislation embodies the consensus proposal of the Quincy Library Group, a coalition of environmentalists, timber industry representatives, and local elected officials in Northern California, who came together to resolve their long-standing conflicts over timber management on the national forest lands in their area. 
The Quincy Library Group legislation is a real victory for local consensus decision making. It proves that even some of the most intractable environmental issues can be resolved if people work together toward a common goal. 
I first met the Quincy Library Group back in 1992 when I was running for the Senate, and was then very impressed with what they were trying to do. 
The members of the Quincy Library Group had seen first hand the conflict between timber harvesting and jobs, environmental laws and protection of their communities and forests, and the devastation of massive forest fires. Their overriding concern was that a catastrophic fire could destroy both the natural environment and the potential for jobs and economic stability in their community. They were also concerned the ongoing stalemate over forest management was ultimately harming both the environment and their local economy. 
The group got together and talked things out. They decided to meet in a quiet, non-confrontational environment--the main room of the Quincy Public Library. They began their dialogue in the recognition that they shared the common goal of fostering forest health, keeping ecological integrity, assuring an adequate timber supply for area mills, and providing economic stability for their community.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, after dozens of meetings and a year and a half of negotiation, the Quincy Library Group developed an alternative management plan for the Lassen National Forest, Plumas National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest. 
In the last five years, the group has tried to persuade the U.S. Forest Service to administratively implement the plan they developed. While the Forest Service was interested in the plan developed, they were unwilling to fully implement it. Negotiations and discussions began in Congress. This legislation is the result.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Susy Smith, who has served as my Legislative Director for nearly my entire Senate career. Her contributions to my legislative efforts have been without parallel, and she leaves with an impressive record of achievement and the profound respect of all who have been fortunate enough to work with her. 
Susy is one of those unique people who knows how to make government work for its people. Her work in the Carter administration, along with her more than ten years as a top level congressional aide to Congressman Norm Mineta, Senator Barbara Mikulski, and myself, have been a testament to both her talent and commitment to public service. Her quiet leadership, innate sense of judgment, and uncanny ability to stay on top of dozens of issues pending before the Senate made her an enormously valuable asset to my office. 
Susy also possesses a deep and abiding faith in the American political process, and the role that Congress plays in our constitutional system of government. She has helped me imbue my staff with a sense of their duty to serve the people of California, together with the knowledge that the work we do here truly makes a difference in people's lives back home. 
Susy has played a vital role in helping to pass some of my most important legislative initiatives such as the Desert Protection Act, the Assault Weapons Ban, and the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act. In fact, over the past 5 years, Susy has put her indelible stamp on every piece of legislation that came out of my office. Her hard work has paid off not just for the people of California, but for the entire Nation--in safer streets, in more money for cancer research, in better health care for America's women, and in national parks that all of us can enjoy, to name just a few. 
What stands out most about Susy is her wonderful ability to bring out the best of everyone. Her good judgement, great sense of humor, and supportive nature carried the staff through many tough battles, long days, and stressful times. She is not only a sharp political strategist and astute policy analyst, but a terrific manager and steadying presence in the office. I have appreciated her professional spirit and have placed much confidence in her decision making and perspective. 
So it is with a deep sense of admiration, some sadness, and heartfelt good wishes that my staff and I say goodbye to Susy, secure in the knowledge that she will be just as successful in all her future endeavors as she has been working in the U.S. Senate.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I voted for H.R. 4328, the omnibus appropriations bill. I believe that on balance, this legislation will benefit California. 
This bill is 4,000 pages, 38 pounds, and stands a foot tall. It appropriates $500 billion, funds a third of the federal government for fiscal year 1999, and includes many pieces of authorizing legislation. My staff reviewed the entire bill yesterday. It includes properly written legislative bill language as well as many hand written changes and amendments. Congressional negotiators, the administration, and many staff members have worked for weeks to finalize this legislation today, but that work was often done behind closed doors without the full review of the Senate. 
I do not believe that this is the way the Congress should do its work. Our choice today was to shut down the government or pass this bill. 
I want, however, to note that the omnibus bill provides many benefits for Californians. 
EDUCATION 
This bill funds several education initiatives. It includes $1.2 billion to hire teachers and reduce elementary class sizes, an effort already underway in California. This will mean 3,500 new teachers in California. This bill also includes increased funding for Head Start, for Education Reform, for bilingual education, for charter schools, for educational technology and for student financial assistance. 
California school enrollment is growing at 3 times the national rate. We need to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the growth in student population. We have students in closets, in cafeterias, in portables. We have some of the largest class sizes in the nation. We have 22,000 teachers on emergency credentials. California ranks last in the nation in the percentage of young adults with a high school diploma. Our students rank 37th in the country in SAT scores. 
The California public school system has gone from one of the best, to one of the worse. Mr. President, quite simply, we welcome this assistance for the California education system. 
I am disappointed that the bill includes a `hold harmless' provision for ESEA Title I. 
Title I is the largest federal elementary and secondary education program, providing funds to virtually every school district in the country to educate disadvantaged children. Title I has often been called the `anchor' of all elementary and secondary education programs since its enactment in 1965. The bill includes $7.8 billion for Title I grants to school districts. California received $830 million last year. 
Unfortunately, the bill includes a 100 percent `hold harmless' provision under which no school district would receive an allocation that is less than its allocation of the previous year. But the effect of the hold harmless provision for California, that has had an increase in the number of poor children, is not to receive all of the increase in funding to which we are entitled, entitled by law. Thankfully, the bill does include an `extra' $301 million that would provide some funds for high-growth states like mine. California could receive as much as $60 million out of the $301 million. I believe the dollars should go equally to all children in the country based on need. 
I call on my colleagues to join me in working to join in an effort to make sure the dollars follow the children. 
This Senator pledges to devote every ounce of energy I can muster to help our schools deliver on the promise of opportunity and achievement that America's public schools have always represented and I call on my colleagues to join me today in this campaign.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the 105th Congress draws to a close, I rise to express my disappointment over something we did not do. The Senate, despite strong support from both sides of the aisle, has not brought the nomination of James C. Hormel to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg to the floor, has not had a debate on the nomination, and has not had a vote on it. 
This failure is really quite incomprehensible. 
The President nominated James Hormel for this post on October 6, 1997. After a thorough review by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the committee approved the nomination by a vote of 16-2 and reported it to the full Senate with the recommendation that it be confirmed. And yet here it is, October 14, 1998, in the final hours of this Congress, and the nomination has not budged from the Executive Calendar. 
Mr. Hormel is eminently qualified for the job of U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. He has had a diverse and distinguished career as a lawyer, businessman, educator, and philanthropist, and he gained diplomatic experience as a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva in 1995 and as a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly in 1997. He was even confirmed unanimously by this very Senate for the latter post on May 23, 1997. 
He has been an upstanding civic leader in San Francisco, and he has been honored for his work by organizations too numerous to mention. He is a man who is kind to all he meets, generous beyond measure, and deeply committed to making the world and his community a better place to live for all people. He is a devoted father of five grown children, and grandfather of 13. Anyone who knows him, as I have been privileged to do for over two decades, knows that he is a man of decency and honor, and the type of person who should be encouraged to be in public service. 
So this is the situation we face: we have a nominee with outstanding talents and credentials; he was previously confirmed by this Senate for another post; he was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee by a 16-2 vote nearly a year ago; and over 60 Senators support bringing his nomination to a vote. And yet, we have never had the opportunity to vote on it. 
Why? Because several Senators on the other side of the aisle have placed holds on the nomination, preventing a debate and a vote they knew they would lose. And the Majority Leader has refused to call up the nomination, effectively allowing the passage of time to kill it. 
Why has Mr. Hormel been denied the Constitutionally delineated due process of a Senate debate and vote? The answer is simple: Mr. Hormel is gay. With no other reasonable grounds to block this nomination, one can come to no other conclusion than that some Senators are simply opposed to a gay man serving our country as a U.S. Ambassador. I believe the Senate does not want to allow this type of discrimination to prevail, and I think the vast majority of my colleagues agree. But so far, it appears that discrimination has prevailed. 
I believe the majority of Americans agree with this position as well. To cite just one measure, newspaper editorials have appeared in support of Mr. Hormel's nomination across the country, including in the: Albany Times Union, Albuquerque Journal, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Atlanta Journal & Constitution, Boston Globe, Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette, Chicago Tribune, Cincinnati Post, Cleveland Plain Dealer, Detroit Free Press, Evansville Courier, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Hartford Courant, Houston Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Louisville (Ky.) Courier-Journal, Minneapolis-St. Paul Star-Tribune, Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger, New Orleans Times Picayune, New York Daily News, New York Times, Peoria Journal-Star, Philadelphia Inquirer, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Portland Press Herald, Providence Journal, Riverside (Ca.) Press-Enterprise, Rocky Mountain News, San Diego Union-Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner, Santa Rosa (Ca.) Press Democrat, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Springfield (Ill.) Journal-Register, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Petersburg Times, Syracuse Post-Standard, Tulsa World, Washington Post, and York (Pa.) Daily Record. 
Many of these newspapers have also run op-ed columns which call for a vote on the nomination, as have the: Arizona Republic, Buffalo News, Columbus Dispatch, Dallas Morning News, Denver Post, Des Moines Register, Detroit News, Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, Greensboro News & Record, Madison Capital Times, Memphis Commercial Appeal, Northern New Jersey Record, Raleigh News & Observer, Salt Lake City Tribune, and USA Today. 
I deeply regret that the Senate has not been permitted to have its say on this eminently qualified nominee solely because he is gay. But the Senate's failure to act need not prevent Mr. Hormel from assuming his post. In a case such as this, where the Senate has so clearly failed to fulfill its Constitutional obligation with respect to a nomination, even though a clear majority of the Senate supports that nomination, I believe it is entirely appropriate for the President to use his Constitutional authority to make a recess appointment. 
Luxembourg is a NATO ally, and we need an ambassador there. Mr. Hormel has every qualification necessary to be an outstanding ambassador, and he would have been overwhelmingly confirmed if the Senate had been allowed to vote. But we were not. I, therefore, urge President Clinton, after Congress adjourns, to make a recess appointment of James Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. It is the right thing to do, and it will give the country the benefit of the service of James Hormel, which the Senate has failed to do. 
Mr. President, because the Senate has not had the opportunity to debate this nomination, I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record some of the materials I would have used in the course of that debate, including some of the notable editorials, op-ed pieces, and letters of support that have come to my attention.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for the nomination of Professor William Alan Fletcher to the Ninth Circuit Court. I very much appreciate the views of the chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from Utah, on this, and his considered judgment that Mr. Fletcher deserves approval by this body. And I hope, indeed, that will be the case. 
Mr. Fletcher has been before this body for over 3 years now. He has had two Judiciary Committee hearings. I had the pleasure of attending both and listening to him. His responses at these hearings were crisp, to the point, direct, and showed a depth and breadth of knowledge of the law that I think is among the top one percent of those nominees who came before the committee. 
His credentials are impeccable. As the chairman pointed out, they include: magna cum laude graduate of Harvard; Rhodes scholar; law degree from Yale; service in the Navy; law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan; and a clerkship for District Court Judge Stanley Weigel. 
Since 1977, he has been a distinguished professor at the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, where he won the 1993 Distinguished Teacher Award and has come to be regarded as one of the most foremost experts on the Federal court and the Constitution. 
Mr. President, since the distinguished Senator from Alabama raised some concerns about this nominee, I would like to respond to some of those concerns. We asked Mr. Fletcher to respond, and, in fact, he provided us with a response on a number of items that have been raised by Mr. Thomas Jipping, of the Judicial Selection Monitoring Project, and subsequently repeated. 
The first allegation is what was called the `discretionary Constitution.' Mr. Jipping attributes to Professor Fletcher the conclusion: 
When judges think that the political branches are not doing what they should, judges have the discretionary power to do it for them. 
And he states: 
Mr. Fletcher writes that this virtually unlimited judicial discretion is a `legitimate substitute for political discretion' when the political branches are `in default.' 
I would like to give you directly the statement from Mr. Fletcher. 
The article says quite the opposite of what Mr. Jipping wrote. I do not believe in a `discretionary Constitution.' As the article makes plain, I view judicial discretion as a problem rather than a solution. Further, I did not write that judicial discretion is legitimate when political branches are `in default.' Rather, I wrote that the exercise of judicial discretion in curing constitutional violations in institutional suits is `presumptively illegitimate' unless the political bodies that should cure those violations are in `serious and chronic default.' 
I would like to put all of this in the Record. 
On the second point that has been raised critically, on standing, Mr. Fletcher writes: 
Contrary to what Mr. Jipping wrote, I do not believe Congress can write statutes that allow anyone or anything to sue. Indeed, in some cases I take a narrower view of standing than the Supreme Court. For example, I argued that the Court should not have granted standing in Buckley v. Valeo. My position on standing would not drastically expand caseloads. Further, rather than inviting judges to legislate from the bench, I am particularly anxious that the Federal courts not perform as a `super-legislature.' 
The third point that he has been criticized for is the unconstitutionality of statutes. The critic writes: 
Mr. Fletcher believes that judges can declare unconstitutional legislation they believe was inadequately considered by Congress. He argues that a statute effectively terminating lawsuits against defense contractors by substituting the United States as the defendant was passed without hearings and based on what he believes are misrepresentations about its operation. That alone would be sufficient to strike down the statute. 
Now, this is Mr. Fletcher's response: 
I believe no such thing. I argued that the presumption of constitutionality normally accorded to a statute should not be accorded to the Warner Amendment, based on the following factors: (1) The only body in Congress that considered the amendment was a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, which held hearings and concluded that it was unconstitutional; (2) When the amendment was later attached as a rider to an unrelated defense appropriations bill, it was consistently described as doing the opposite of what it actually did.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, University of California law professor Charles Alan Wright, one of the Nation's leading conservative constitutional scholars, had this to say about Dr. Fletcher: 
Too many scholars approach a new issue with preconceptions of how it should come out and they force the data that their research uncovers to support the conclusion that they had formed before they did the research. I think that is reprehensible for a scholar and it is dangerous for a judge. 
I am completely confident that when Fletcher finishes his service on the ninth circuit we will say not that he has been a liberal judge or a conservative judge but that he has been an excellent judge, one who has brought a brilliant mind, greater powers of analysis, and total objectivity to the cases that came before him. 
I believe that the nomination of William Fletcher will add strength to the ninth circuit and I hope very much that he is confirmed. 
I would like to also quote Stephen Burbank of the University of Pennsylvania Law School: 
His work is both analytically acute and painstaking in its regard for history. Indeed, love of and respect for history shine through all his work, as the history itself illuminates the various corners of the law he enters. 
Interestingly enough, the New Republic wrote in an editorial in 1995: 
Fletcher is the most impressive scholar of Federal jurisdiction in the country. His path-breaking articles on sovereign immunity and Federal common law have transformed the debates in these fields; and his work is marked by the kind of careful historical and textual analysis that should serve as a model for liberals and conservatives alike. If confirmed, Fletcher will join his mother-- 
And as we know now his mother is going to take senior status -- but his judicial philosophy is more constrained than hers. We hope he is confirmed as swiftly as possible. 
That was back in 1995 when he was nominated. It is now almost the end of 1998, and as this man has gone through the scrutiny of 3 years of delay, I must say I very much hope that this body will confirm him this afternoon. I believe, as another has said, that he will, in fact, be an excellent, thoughtful and commonsense judge. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which is the substitute amendment to H.R. 2431 being offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. 
At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation and respect for the distinguished Assistant Majority Leader, Senator Nickles, and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. I want to salute their deeply held commitment to religious freedom for all people. I am aware that they and their staffs have been negotiating this bill for many months. They have been through draft after draft, talking with the Administration, a large number of Senators with different interests, and a wide range of concerned outside organizations. 
Their mission has been to produce a bill that would make a meaningful contribution to combating the problem of religious persecution in foreign countries, one that would pass with broad support in the Senate, and a bill that the President would sign. I know how long and hard they have been working on this effort. 
Earlier this week, they had hoped to move the bill forward. There were still a number of provisions which I was concerned about, and I felt that since the bill had not come through the Foreign Relations Committee, on which I sit, and would not be open to amendment on the floor, I wanted a chance to address those concerns. 
Despite the marathon talks the Assistant Majority Leader and the Senator from Connecticut had already engaged in on this bill with so many others, and despite my late entry into the fray, they graciously and without hesitation agreed to sit down with me to see if we could come to common agreement. We were also joined by Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat. 
I am happy to report that, as a result of these discussions, with good will by all sides, we were able to reach agreement on each of the provisions that was of concern to me, and I think the bill is better for it. Let me explain what we agreed upon. 
First, I have come to the conclusion that when the Congress legislates sanctions, we need to provide the President with a reasonable amount of flexibility in the implementation, both to respond to changing conditions, and to protect other American interests. 
Normally, we provide the President with a waiver authority for sanctions, but the standard of that waiver is critical. The State Department believes, and I agree, that the `national security' waiver standard in the most recent draft was too high--it would be difficult for the President to waive the sanctions required under this act except in extraordinary circumstances. A waiver of `national interest' was deemed by the sponsors to be too low. So we compromised: the President can now waive the sanctions in this bill if the `important national interest' requires it. 
Second, the definition of what constitutes a `particularly severe violation' of religious freedom was originally drafted in such a way that it could have inadvertently triggered other sanctions--those required for gross violations of human rights --under sections 116 and 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act. There was no intent on the part of the sponsors to trigger two sets of sanctions, so it was simply a matter of ensuring that a different standard was required for each trigger. 
The standard we agreed upon was proposed by Senator Lieberman. Particularly severe violations of religious freedom are now defined as `systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom.' To my mind, this is neither a higher nor lower standard than the `consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights' that requires a separate set of sanctions under the Foreign Assistance Act, but it is a sufficiently different standard that it a finding under one act should not automatically trigger sanctions under both acts. I think this is an important improvement in the bill. 
Third, we were concerned that there could be situations in which the President has already taken significant action against a country, in large part to respond to human rights abuses, and then a finding of particularly severe violations of religious freedom would require additional actions under this act. In the case of a country like Sudan, where we have already imposed extensive sanctions, it makes sense for the President to be able to cite an existing sanction as fulfilling the requirements of the International Religious Freedom Act. 
Again, to the best of my knowledge, the sponsors of the bill had no desire to force the President to impose redundant sanctions on a country. So, in section 402(C)(4) we have developed language that allows the President to cite an existing sanction as fulfilling the requirements of this act. I think this change also makes the bill better. 
We are all aware that there are people of faith who are suffering for their beliefs in many parts of the world. As a nation founded on the precious principle of religious freedom, a principle which is enshrined in the Bill of Rights, we cannot and must not turn a deaf ear to the cries of the oppressed. Making the protection of religious freedom a high priority in our foreign policy is the right thing to do. 
The challenge is to create mechanisms to promote religious freedom and protect persecuted believers that: provide enough flexibility to respond to different conditions at different times and places; avoid unintentionally making life harder for those we seek to help; and, make a meaningful contribution to the cause of religious freedom without unduly jeopardizing other important national interests. 
That is why I have so much respect for what the distinguished Assistant Majority Leader and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut have been trying to do these many months. They have worked hard to listen to the concerns of the Administration, other Senators, religious organizations of every denomination, the business community, and other interested parties. They have tried to develop a bill that will help the United States protect those in danger of persecution for their faith, while taking into account the broad and deep requirements of U.S. foreign policy interests. I think they have succeeded. 
Evidence of their success is in the broad and diverse coalition of religious organizations and human rights groups who have worked tirelessly to support the bill. Further evidence of this success, I believe, will be evident by the overwhelming support I expect the Senate will demonstrate when it votes shortly. And perhaps the most impressive evidence of their success is that earlier today, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger informed the Minority Leader that the Administration now supports the bill as drafted. After so many months, we know that the President will sign this bill, and it will become law. 
I yield the floor.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks about the distinguished service of United States veterans. As Veterans Day approaches, we look forward to honoring the men and women who have served this country with bravery, honor, and valor. I am submitting, for my colleagues, a May 28, 1998 article from the Los Angeles Times written by Patty Andrews, one of the Andrews Sisters. The Andrews Sisters spent much of World War II entertaining the young men who fought so courageously in Europe, the Pacific, Africa, and other parts of the world. In this stirring piece, Ms. Andrews details the service and sacrifices of all of those who contributed to the war effort, and describes how she and her sisters helped to build morale and comforted the wounded.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Salvage Motor Vehicle legislation as it has been amended by the Levin/Feinstein amendment. 
The sale of rebuilt vehicles that have been wrecked in accidents has become a major national problem. According to the National Association of Independent Insurers, about 2.5 million vehicles are involved in accidents so severe that they are declared a total loss. Yet, more than a million of these vehicles are rebuilt and put back on the road. 
In many cases, `totaled' cars are sold at auction, refurbished to conceal prior damage, and resold to consumers without disclosure of the previous condition of the car. The structural integrity of these vehicles has been so severely weakened that the potential for serious injury in an accident is greatly increased. 
This bill seeks to address the problem by requiring vehicle owners to disclose that the car has been salvaged if it has sustained damage valued at more than 75% of its retail value. The problem with this approach is that it sets a ceiling rather than a floor for consumer protection. States who may already have stronger definitions of salvage vehicles would be preempted. 
The amendment that I have offered with the senior Senator from Michigan will eliminate this flaw in the bill. Our amendment says specifically that nothing in this bill will effect a state law that provides more stringent consumer protection relating to the inspection, titling or any other action dealing with salvage vehicles. We believe that this is the best possible outcome. A minimum level of consumer protection will be set at the federal level, but the bill now authorizes states to provide greater or more comprehensive protection if they wish. 
Protection for consumers in my state of California will be greatly enhanced by the Levin/Feinstein amendment. California law does not set a percentage value for salvage vehicles. Instead it says that a vehicle is salvaged when the owners determines that repairing the vehicle is `uneconomical'. Our amendment will allow California to maintain that definition as well as states with other protections. California law is also more comprehensive in terms of what vehicles are covered. California's law covers all vehicles including large trucks, motorcycles, and motor homes which would not be covered under the federal law. 
I believe we now have a good bill. By setting a federal level of consumer protection that is a floor rather than a ceiling, we will achieve the goal of protecting consumers from fraud while at the same time giving states the flexibility to implement a stricter definition for salvage vehicles. 
I want to thank the Senator from Michigan. Together we have crafted an amendment that will protect the residents of our states and many others. I also want to thank the Majority Leader for his willingness to work with us to improve the bill.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in memory of Mayor Tom Bradley, who is being laid to rest in Los Angeles today. I join with all Angelenos, and indeed all Californians, in mourning this kind, gentle, and wonderful man who led one of the world's great cities with such skill for so many years. 
For nine years during my tenure as Mayor of San Francisco, I had the pleasure of working with Mayor Bradley on state and national issues and together we offered a loud drumbeat that the cities of our nation need attention. As cities go, so goes the nation, we often said. Through and through, I saw Tom Bradley as mayor who earned the respect of his peers while he demanded attention for his city. 
First elected Mayor in 1973, Mayor Bradley paved the way for many other leaders on the local and national level. Although he made history as the first African-American mayor of a major city, Tom Bradley ran and won a campaign where he pledged to be a mayor who represented the entire city. He was true to his word, and for a record-setting five terms, he served all the millions of people who call Los Angeles home--from every racial, cultural, and religious group. 
Born into a sharecropper's family, Tom Bradley was seven years old when he and his family headed to California to start a new life. When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1924, Tom Bradley remembered that `reaching California was like reaching the promised land.' 
A product of the Los Angeles public school system, his academic abilities enabled him to parlay his high school athletic prowess into a university education. Bradley received a scholarship to attend UCLA, where he soon distinguished himself as a track star. 
Prompted by a desire to serve the city, Tom Bradley joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1940. In May 1941, he married the former Ethel Arnold. They had two daughters, Lorraine and Phyllis. 
As an early example of his enormous capacity for hard work that marked his years as mayor, Tom Bradley worked full-time as a police officer and went to law school at night. he graduated from Southwestern University in 1956 and passed the California Bar Exam. 
After 21 years of service, he retired from the LAPD with the rank of Lieutenant in 1961 and began to practice law. Urged by community leaders, he decided in 1963 to run for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council. He became one of the first African-Americans ever to serve on the Council, and held his seat for 10 years before becoming the city's 37th Mayor in 1973. He ran for Governor of California twice, in 1982 and 1986, and nearly became the first African-American governor of the largest state in the Union. I think he would have made an outstanding governor. 
Mayor Bradley once said, `My guiding philosophy as mayor has been and will continue to be, to paraphrase the Athenian Oath, to transmit this city * * * not as a lesser * * * but as a greater, better and more beautiful city than it was transmitted to me. This philosophy continues to be my inspiration.' 
Mayor Bradley did so much for the city he loved so well. He attracted businesses to the city and established policies that resulted in the dramatic resurgence of the downtown Los Angeles economic center. The impressive skyline that graces Los Angeles' downtown is the realization of his vision. He turned the city's Harbor and Airports into top-of-the-line businesses, expanding the number of people employed and the city's ability to compete in the world market. Today, when people fly into the Los Angeles airport from abroad, they land at the Tom Bradley International Terminal: a fitting tribute to the man who expanded the airport into the second-busiest in the country. 
Mayor Bradley secured the 1984 Summer Olympic Games during a time when many predicted economic gloom. Instead, his signature approach of uniting the private and public sectors behind a common goal produced the most successful Olympic Games in modern history. The Games boosted economic activity in Southern California by $3.3 billion, created 68,000 jobs, and ended with a $215 million surplus. Just as important, the Games made all of us proud to be Americans. When we think of Carl Lewis winning his four gold medals, or Mary Lou Retton vaulting her way into the country's heart, we have Mayor Bradley to thank. 
Mayor Bradley focused economic opportunities both on the inner city, with such community revitalization projects as the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw and Vermont-Slauson shopping centers, and on the entire city, where he put forward affordable housing and fair planning policies. 
Mayor Bradley also led a long and hard battle to bring rail transportation to the city of Los Angeles. There were many times it would have been easy to give up, to say the will simply was not there. Yet he was determined, came to the halls in Washington, D.C. often to appeal for funding, and never gave up. Today the Metro Blue Line carries passengers from Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles, and the Metro Red Line carries passengers from downtown to MacArthur Park. Construction is now underway to extend the Red Line to North Hollywood. 
Finally, to reinforce his strong emphasis on education and to shield Los Angeles youth from drug peddlers and street gangs, Mayor Bradley initiated an ambitious plan, called L.A's BEST (Better Educated Students for Tomorrow), to provide computer training, tutorial assistance, and other enrichment activities to students in Los Angeles' low income neighborhoods. Under the program, parents are able to voluntarily keep their children at school from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. each school day to learn and play. Today L.A.'s Best serves over 5,000 children each day, and has shown dramatic results in boosting students' academic achievement and self-esteem. 
Mayor Tom Bradley shaped Los Angeles. He guided the City through enormous growth and change. His 20 years were marked by too many triumphs to count, and even in the bad times, during the devastating civil unrest that took place after the Rodney King verdict, his strong leadership and gentle demeanor brought Angelenos together to work for the common good. For many Angelenos, Mayor Bradley was a father figure: physically imposing at six-foot-four, and intellectually imposing as the sharp-minded, politically astute big city mayor, but always so warm and gentle that you instantly felt at ease when you talked with him. He was a great leader, but more than that, he was a great person. There are simply not enough people like him in politics. 
Mr. President, I know that Tom Bradley will be remembered as one of the city's greatest and most beloved mayors. His loss is a blow to the City of Los Angeles. I know that I join all Angelenos today in sending my thoughts and prayers to his wife and daughters.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the 40th anniversary of NASA is historic. It does have an impact on my State of California. I want to take a moment and wish NASA a happy birthday. I want to salute the fact that they have captured the world's imagination with missions such as the Mars Pathfinder and the Hubbell Space Telescope. Experiments and technological feats performed on Space Shuttle missions are paving the way for a permanent presence in space. 
Mr. President, as I said, I join my colleagues in recognizing the many historic achievements that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has made in its forty years of service. 
This is a particularly exciting period for our space program, not simply because NASA is celebrating its 40th Anniversary but more importantly because of the major advances being made in the exploration of our solar system. 
As I said, in recent years, NASA has captured the world's imagination with missions such as the Mars Pathfinder and the Hubble Space Telescope. Experiments and technological feats performed on Space Shuttle missions are paving the way for a permanent presence in space. 
One of the most telling signs of our changing world is that, NASA, whose original mission was national defense in the cold war with the Soviet Union, is now working with Russia to develop the first International Space Station. 
I am very proud to say that some of NASA's most valuable research has been accomplished in my home State of California. In 1958, the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena built and controlled the first United States satellite sent into orbit. In the four decades that have followed, JPL has contributed to the exploration of most of the known planets in our solar system. 
The full list of JPL's role in planetary exploration is far too long to address here. But I want to mention one recent accomplishment. In December of 1996, NASA launched the Mars Pathfinder, another JPL built and controlled spacecraft. 
The Pathfinder successfully placed a rover on the surface of the red planet that beamed-back pictures that were viewed around the world with awe. I actually had the unique pleasure to visit JPL last year and was actually able to send commands up to the rover and then watch and see the rover move based on the command. It was rather amazing because the computer I was on actually went to a station in the desert which then beamed it directly to Mars, and so a few minutes after I pressed the command into the computer, I actually watched the rover move on the planet Mars. It was an amazing experience. 
California is also home to one of NASA's premier research laboratories, the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. NASA Ames provides research in the fields of supercomputing, software development, and automated reasoning. As the lead center for Aviation Operations Systems, Ames manages the research effort in air traffic control and has the major responsibility for wind tunnel testing and simulation. 
As California has been a major partner in NASA's success in the past, we will continue to lead as we move into the 21st century. NASA has developed a strategic plan that will build on its accomplishments with a renewed focus on scientific research and the application of a new cutting-edge technology. I am confident that California will continue to provide the backbone for this program. 
I want to take a few moments to talk about what I believe is one of the most remarkable feats in the history of a space program filled with remarkable feats. Later this month, the Space Shuttle Discovery will be embarking on Mission STS-95. As we know, our colleague, Senator John Glenn will be making his second trip into space on this flight. While his presence will certainly be missed here in the Senate, I know my colleagues share my pride in his achievements and wish him the best on his historic return to space. 
On February 20, 1962, John Glenn piloted the `Friendship 7' spacecraft on the U.S.'s first manned obtial mission. During the almost 5 hour flight, Senator Glenn worked on some of the first technical and medical experiments ever performed while orbiting the Earth. 
Now, more than 35 years after that first flight, Senator Glenn will soon be returning to space. It is interesting to note some of the advancements that have been made since that first ground breaking flight. 
The shuttle's flight will last 9 days instead of 5 hours, it will orbit the planet at 345 miles an hour rather than 16, and it will circle the Earth 144 times rather than 3. The comparison between these two flights capsulizes the advancements that have been made in the space program and it is remarkable that one man will experience both. 
Senator Glenn has done more to promote our space program than perhaps any other person. Millions of people held their collective breath as he led the country into orbit of the Earth in 1962 and the world will again watch as he leads NASA into the next century. 
Mr. President, it is with great pride and respect that I pay tribute to the many achievements NASA has made in its first 40 years. I know that I stand with the rest of the nation in anticipation of what will be accomplished in the next 40.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support the conference agreement on H.R. 6, the Higher Education Act bill. 
The bill has a number of provisions that will be helpful to my state: 
It authorizes $300 million in new initiatives to strengthen teacher training for elementary and secondary. 
It continues student loans and increases the maximum authorized Pell grant from $4,500 to $5,800 by 2003 to help low-income students get a college education. 
It continues federal support for colleges and universities, such as science and engineering programs and graduate fellowships. 
The opportunity to pursue an education, particularly a college education, has long been a hallmark of American society. In California, shifts in the economy make higher education more important than ever. Service-related jobs, such as those in high tech industries, have displaced many traditional manufacturing jobs. These new jobs require a level of knowledge and skill that can for the most part only be gained by a college education. 
California has long been a leader in providing a strong higher education system. The University of California (UC) has nine campuses that serve 132,000 students. Total enrollment at UC is projected to grow by about 36,500 students by fall 2006. 
The California State University System (CSU) consists of 22 regional campuses with 286,000 students. Enrollment is expected to grow by 31.4 percent or 105,809 students by year 2006. 
Another important element of higher education in California is the California community college system, the largest community college system in the world. Its 106 campuses provided vocational, academic, and community service programs to over 1.5 million students of varying ages, income levels and educational backgrounds in 1997. Roughly three of four public postsecondary students were in enrolled in community colleges. The system is expected to increase by 28.9 percent as its attendance is projected to be over 1.8 million by fall 2006. 
California faces huge challenges in higher education in the coming years: 
First, enrollment in California's public schools, the college generation of the future, is growing at three times the national rate. Enrollment in the three major segments of higher education will increase by 28.9 percent, or by 549,144 students, between 1996 and 2006, according to the state's Department of Finance. 
California will have this surge in college applicants because (1) the number of high school graduates has increased by 22 percent since 1993; (2) many adult workers are changing careers by choice because of organization restructuring, or to enhance their employment skills; (3) migration to California from other states and countries is continuing; and (4) more Californians over 40 are pursuing lifelong learning. 
Second, California has 21,000 teachers on emergency credentials and will need up to 300,000 new teachers in the next decade. 
Third, California has many first generation, bilingual and `nontraditional' students. California State University, for example, has a large number of `nontraditional' students, students who are older than the usual college age. This is because many community college graduates transfer to CSU and many CSU students are working people seeking to progress professionally or maintain technical proficiency. Similarly, approximately 41 percent of community college students are in the 20-29 age group. 
I am pleased that the House-Senate conferees accepted several provisions that I authored to help students and institutions in my state: 
First, the 5th year Pell grant: That authorizes the Secretary of Education to award on a case-by-case basis Pell grants for disadvantaged students for the fifth year of teacher education required in California to get a teaching credential. This could enable 12,000 disadvantaged students to become teachers in California, according to the Congressional Budget Office, at a time when we are facing a severe teacher shortage and have 21,000 teachers in the classroom on emergency credentials. 
Second, distance learning: The bill also includes two of my amendments to the distance learning demonstration (teaching away from the traditional campus via a computer, teleconferencing or other technologies). The first, clarifies that university `systems' (e.g., UC system, CSU system) would be eligible and the bill increases the number of demonstration sites from five to fifteen. 
Third, school districts with high numbers of limited English proficient students: The bill authorizes state grants for innovative ways to reduce teacher shortages in high poverty areas. At my suggestion, the bill includes as eligible or target areas, school districts with disproportionate numbers of limited English speaking children. In California, 1.3 million students have limited English proficiency, a tripling since 1986 and at least 87 languages are spoken. 
Fourth, study of few borrowers: The bill provides that schools whose student loan default rate exceeds 25% for three years will be ineligible to participate in the student loan program. For schools like California's community colleges, that have just a few borrowers, this method gives the appearance of having a very high default rate. For example, if the school has only four borrowers but two defaulters, they would have a 50 percent default rate. The manager's amendment includes my suggestion of a study of the effectiveness of this measurement method by September 30, 1999. 
Student financial aid is essential to enabling millions of students to get a higher education. The California Postsecondary Education Commission estimates that 50-55 percent of students at California's public and private institutions are receiving some form of state, federal or institutional financial assistance. Expenses for tuition and supplies at California's postsecondary institutions, public and private, averaged $19,500 during the 1997-98 school year. Most families have a hard time saving that kind of money. 
By continuing federal student grant and loan programs, this bill will continue to open doors to education for many Californians. 
The higher education bill is a bipartisan and constructive bill that will help our nation provide a college education to millions of Americans. I hope my colleagues and the President to join me in enacting this important bill.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, for me, this is a sad day. Someone in politics whom I have very much respected passed away this morning, and that was Tom Bradley, former mayor of Los Angeles. Tom was one of America's finest mayors, a tireless advocate on behalf of the cities of America. I had an opportunity to work closely with him during the 1980s when we were both mayors. 
I saw firsthand how he would go about solving a problem. He was kind and gentle, but he was tenacious about promoting the city of Los Angeles that he so deeply loved. 
He leaves a rich legacy for Los Angeles and for the entire State of California. No Californian--and particularly no Los Angeleno--will ever forget the pride of hosting the 1984 Olympics. Tom Bradley showed that an American city could host a profitable and spirited Olympic ceremony. 
His other accomplishments are many: Bringing public rail transportation to his city; building an international airport--Tom Bradley Airport--and a port that generated hundreds of thousands of jobs for the region; opening the doors of city government so that city workers reflected the rich cultural diversity of Los Angeles. 
One particular vision I have of Tom Bradley which I will never forget is when we met, of all places, on the Great Wall of China as mayors in June of 1979. I was there to secure a sister city relationship between San Francisco and the city of Shanghai. While San Francisco got that relationship, Tom Bradley went right out and secured a similar relationship between Los Angeles and Guangzhou. 
Tom knew the importance that the Pacific Rim would play in his city's future and he would literally travel anywhere in the world to help promote the city. He was a forceful and successful advocate for the cities of America every time cities needed a strong voice. His presence was matched by a wonderful and soft gentleness that I, personally, will never forget. 
My deepest sorrow goes to his family and to his many friends. Mr. President, I know we all will do our part to see that Tom Bradley's vision for Los Angeles lives on and on for generations to come.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Arizona. 
I want Senator Kyl to know that it has really been a very great pleasure for me to work with the Senator over these past 2 years. I think it has been for me one of the best experiences I have had in the time I have been in the Senate, and that is two Senators from different political parties sitting down to try to work out something which is enormously difficult to do, and that is the drafting of a new constitutional amendment. 
The Senator mentioned that we have done 60-plus drafts, and that we have met with the Attorney General, the White House, met members of victims' groups. The Senator brought in the counsel for victims. Larry Tribe, from Harvard University, worked with us, and we believe, I think, that we have an amendment that will now stand the test of public scrutiny and stand the test of time. 
I want to share, Madam President, with the Senate how I first became involved in victims' rights. It was in the mid-1970s in San Francisco when a man broke into a home on Portrero Hill. He tied the man in the home to a chair and murdered him by beating him with a hammer, a chopping block and a ceramic vase. He then repeatedly raped his 24-year-old wife, breaking several of her bones. He slit her wrist and tried to strangle her with a telephone cord before setting their home on fire and leaving them to go up in flames. 
Miraculously, this young woman, whose name I purposely left out of this, is still alive. She testified against him. He is still in State prison, to the best of my knowledge. But when I became mayor she used to call me every year and say, `I'm terrified that he might get out. I don't know if and when he will get out. His parole is coming up. Could you help me?' 
I recognized then that there really were no rights that victims had. In 1982, California became the first State in the Union to apply some victims' rights. It was a bill of rights. It passed the electorate overwhelmingly. That is the reason when people saw the family of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in court it wasn't because they had Federal rights or constitutional rights; it was because the constitution of the State of California provided that right in 1982. Some 28 other States have followed. 
So you might say, `Well, what's the problem?' The problem is each State is different, and there is no basic floor of rights guaranteed to every victim. Therefore, if rights come in conflict, obviously, the rights provided in the Constitution prevail. 
Now, what rights are in the Constitution? These are the constitutional rights today. You will see the rights of the accused, 15 specific rights guaranteed in the Constitution: the right to counsel, the right to due process, to a speedy trial, to a prohibition against double jeopardy, self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures, to have warrants issued only on probable cause, a jury of your peers, to be informed of accusations, and so on. You will then on the other side see the rights granted to victims are `none.' 
Well, one has to look back and say, how did this happen? I have looked back, and how it happened is very interesting. Our Founding Fathers, when they included the rights of the accused in the Constitution, did not think to include the rights of crime victims. Then again in 1789 there were not 9 million victims of violent crimes every year. As a matter of fact, there were not much more than 4 million people in all of our colonies. In fact, there are more victims of violent crime each year, by far, than there were people in the country when the Constitution was written. 
Additionally, the way the criminal justice system worked then, victims did not need a guarantee of these rights. In America, up to the late 18th century and well into the 19th century, the concept of the public prosecutor did not exist. Victims could and did commence criminal cases themselves, by hiring a sheriff to arrest the defendant and then initiating a private prosecution. The core rights in our amendment--to notice, to attend, to be heard--were inherently made available to the victim. 
As Juan Cardenas, writing in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, observed: 
At trial, generally, there were no lawyers for either the prosecution or the defense. Victims of crime simply acted as their own counsel, although wealthier crime victims often hired a prosecutor. 
Gradually, public prosecution replaced the system of private prosecution. With the explosive growth of crime in this country in recent years--the rate of violent crime has more than quadrupled in the last 35 years--it became easier and easier for the victim to be left out of the process. 
Another scholar noted: 
With the establishment of the prosecutor, the conditions for the general alienation of the victim from the legal process further increase. The victim is deprived of his ability to determine the course of a case and is deprived of the ability to gain restitution from the proceedings. Under such conditions, the incentives to report crime and to cooperate with the prosecution diminish. As the importance of the prosecution increases, the role of the victim is transformed from principal actor to a resource that may be used at the prosecutor's discretion. 
So there was no need to guarantee those rights in 1789, and, as we all know, the Constitution protects people from government rather than providing most people with certain basic rights. But the criminal justice system has changed dramatically since then and the prevalence of crime has changed dramatically. So we believe that the need and circumstances both combine to restore balance to the criminal justice system by guaranteeing the rights of violent crime victims in the United States. 
I am very proud to have 12 coauthors on the Democratic side for this constitutional amendment, and I am particularly proud to have the support of Senator Biden of Delaware. Senator Biden of Delaware was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I say to the Senator from Arizona, when I came on that committee back in 1992 and was very helpful to me in learning the ropes of the committee. I have great respect for him. So it was very significant to me when we worked with him, made certain compromises in the amendment, and gained his support.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is right. And I am delighted the Senator is in the Chamber, because many people have said about this amendment, `Well, why isn't Federal law enough?' And if the Senator will recall, we both voted for the Federal clarification law in the case of Oklahoma City that would give victims the right to be notified, to be present in the courtroom, and to make a statement. And even after we clarified the law, the Federal judge held that if a victim was present, that victim could not make a statement. So this again is, I think, an additional rationale for this constitutional amendment. 
I do want to point out the valuable support of Professor Laurence Tribe of the Harvard Law School, and I would like to just briefly quote portions of his testimony last year before the House hearing on the amendment. 
The rights in question--rights of crime victims not to be victimized yet again, through the processes by which Government bodies and officials prosecute, punish, and release the accused or convicted offender--are indisputably basic human rights against government, rights that any civilized society of justice would aspire to protect and strive never to violate. 
Our Constitution's central concerns involve protecting the rights of individuals to participate in all those governmental processes that directly and immediately involve those individuals and affect their lives in some focused and particular way . . . The parallel rights of victims to participate in these proceedings are no less basic, even though they find no parallel recognition in the explicit text of the Constitution of the United States. 
The fact that the States and Congress, within their respective jurisdictions, already have ample affirmative authority to enact rules protecting these rights is . . . not a reason for opposing the amendment altogether . . . The problem, rather, is that such rules are likely, as experience to date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, sheer inertia, or any mention of an accused's rights regardless of whether those rights are genuinely threatened. 
So, in a sense, this is all the heart of our argument. Today, the accused, the defendant, has 15 specific rights in the Constitution. 
The victim of a violent crime, or any other crime, has no rights in the Constitution. Consequently, there is no protected, no basic floor of rights across this Nation. Each State varies. And when one of these rights conflicts with a right guaranteed to a victim by a State constitutional amendment, the Federal Constitution will always prevail. We believe very strongly that 15 rights should be balanced by the 7 rights that we would provide to victims under this constitutional amendment. 
`The right to receive notice of the proceedings.' What could be more basic? Somebody assaults you, somebody has raped you, somebody has robbed you--at least you receive a notice to the hearing. 
`The right to attend the trial, and any other public proceeding at which the defendant is present.' 
`The right to be heard at certain stages in the proceeding: The release of the offender; acceptance of a plea bargain; and sentencing. 
`The right to be notified of the offender's release or escape.' 
This is something for me which goes back to the 1974 case of a woman having to call to plead to know when her husband's murderer and her own attacker would be released, and because she does not have that information to this day guaranteed to her, to this day she lives in anonymity. She has changed her name and she has changed her place of residence because she believes one day he will get out and one day he will come after her. No American should have to live that way. That is a basic right we provide in this constitutional amendment. 
`The right to an order of restitution, albeit $1, presented by a judge,' which is significant to every victim. We had interested victims testify to this. Senator Kyl, I am sure, will remember how meaningful and important just the simple act of restitution was to them. 
`To have the safety of the victim considered in determining a release from custody.' These are, in essence, the basic rights that we would provide to begin to balance this scale of justice throughout time. The only way it can be done is by adding a constitutional amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
I, once again, thank Senator Kyl. It has been a great pleasure for me. I hope we will have the time to debate this fully on the floor and have a vote. I yield the floor.

I would like to add Roberta Roper of the National Victims Constitutional Amendment Network, who worked with Steve Twist so actively; David Beatty of the National Victims Center; and John Stein and Marlene Young of the National Organization for Victim Assistance. 
If I might say this: Some people have pooh-poohed--maybe pooh-poohed is not a good senatorial word--let me say denigrated this concept. As one who sat on 5,000 cases, sentencing them, setting sentences and granting paroles for 6 years of my life, I can tell you that I believe this constitutional amendment will make more of a difference in the criminal justice system than virtually anything else that could be done. I think it is extraordinarily important. I know the Senator joins me in this, and I hope we will be able to have that full debate early on in the next Congress.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to take note of the first signs of progess in the Middle East peace process in many months. This morning, Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu of Israel, and Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority met with President Clinton at the White House to try to move the implementation of the stalled Oslo peace ageeements forward. 
While no agreement was reached, these talks produced enough progress for the President to decide to send Secretary of State Albright and Special Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross to the Middle East next week to try to bring the parties to an agreement. Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat are expecting to return to Washington in mid-October, with the hope that they will be able put the finishing touches on a deal at that time. 
The progress representated by today's meeting is significant, I believe, for several reasons. First, it reminds us of the essential need for there to be strong American leadership if there is to be progress on the Middle East. No Middle East peace agreement has ever been concluded without high-level U.S. involvement, and this time is no differnt. The personal attention of the President of the United States and the Secretary of State are crucial to advancing this process, especially at a time when the parties have reached an impasse. 
Among supporters of Israel, who long for it to live at peace with its neighbors, there is broad recognition of the centrality of the American role in Middle East peacemaking. That certainly is the view expressed by a group of over 100 senior Jewish community leaders from California, in a letter they sent to Presdient Clinton last week. 
This letter is signed by 105 prominent Jewish leaders (rabbis, community activists, academics, and philanthropists). It expresses what I believe to be the widespread feeling of the American Jewish community. In clear language, they appeal to the President not to lose sight of the essential American role in helping Israel reach the peace it is longing for. They write: 
We have been strongly supportive of your Administration's efforts to narrow the gaps between the two parties and help them to reach an agreement. As in past Arab-Israeli negotiations, the American role in getting both sides to say yes is indispensable. Although mediating this complex dispute can be a thankless task, and some naysayers may urge you to put the peace process on the back burner, now is not the time to stop searching for ways to help both peoples resolve their differences. 
Today's meeting shows that the President shares their sense of urgency and is taking it to heart.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Today's meeting is also important, not just because of what it says about the process and the U.S. role, but also for what the prospect is that it can yield an agreement in just a few more days or a few weeks. Far too much time has been lost. 
Israel and the Palestinians have been stuck for months on how to complete the interim agreements launched by the Oslo process, so that they can move on to the critical final status talks. These interim talks deal with hard and important questions: How much of the West Bank Israel will redeploy from, what steps the Palestinian Authority will take to ensure a sustained crackdown on terrorist groups, how the security services of the two sides will work together to prevent acts of terrorism, and the understanding that both sides must refrain from unilateral actions that undermine the other side's confidence in the peace process. 
Nothing about these talks is easy, but the time has long since come for both sides to take politically difficult, but fundamentally necessary, decisions that will allow this process to move forward. Israel's security and Palestinian dreams of self-determination can only be realized through a mutually agreed permanent peace agreement. 
To the extent that today's meeting and the talks set for upcoming days represent a chance to complete the interim agreements and begin final status talks, there is reason for hope. The final status talks--which are supposed to be completed by May 4, 1999, but will probably take much longer--are going to be difficult enough. They will deal with the hardest questions of all: sovereignty, settlements, refugees, water, and Jerusalem. 
Every day these final status talks are delayed, they only become more difficult. Every day they are delayed, the temptation on each side to take unilateral measures only increases. Every day they are delayed is another opportunity for extremists on each side to use violence to try to destroy the chances for peace altogether. 
If the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority are truly committed to peace, as I believe they are, they cannot let that happen. They must work hard in the next several days to complete the interim agreement, and then move quickly to make progress in the final status talks. 
At this season of renewal in the Jewish calendar, when a new year and new beginnings are at hand, it is my hope and prayer that a new day may at last be dawning in the lives of Israelis and Palestinians. For that to happen, their leaders, with the strong support of the United States, must act to now to seize the opportunities that are before them. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Exhibit 1 September 24, 1998. 
Hon. William Jefferson Clinton, The White House, Washington, DC. 
Dear Mr. President: As American Jews dedicated to Israel's security and to a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, we want to express our appreciation for your steadfast commitment to the Jewish state and its quest for a secure peace. 
As you face the many formidable challenges confronting your Administration and our country, we urge you to reestablish the Middle East peace process as an urgent American priority. We believe it is important for the U.S. to encourage Israel and the Palestinian Authority to redouble their efforts to achieve an agreement on further Israeli redeployment and enhanced security measures as soon as possible. The longer this process drags on inconclusively, the greater the danger of a total collapse of the entire peace process, which inevitably will lead to more violence and bloodshed. 
We have been strongly supportive of your Administration's efforts to narrow the gaps between the two parties and help them to reach an agreement. As in past Arab-Israeli negotiations, the American role in getting both sides to say yes is indispensable. Although mediating this complex dispute can be a thankless task, and some naysayers may urge you to put the peace process on the back burner, now is not the time to stop searching for ways to help both peoples resolve their differences. 
The success of the peace process is, in our view, crucial to Israel's long-term security and the strategic interests of the United States. Polls consistently show that this position reflects the widespread feeling in the American Jewish community. We hope that, buoyed by this support, you will keep striving to remove obstacles from the road to a secure Arab-Israeli peace. 
Sincerely,

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The FAA reauthorization bill will provide important and necessary funding to our nation's aviation system. It is crucial that we work to pass this legislation before the end of this session. But, there is one provision in this bill that we must resolve before we can go forward. The exemptions to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Perimeter Rule has come to our attention as a section of this bill which opens the door to an array of concerns. The change in the Perimeter Rule will allow for six new daily round trip flights between Reagan National Airport and airports beyond the 1,250-mile perimeter. 
We have some questions as to who will be served if these exemptions are enacted by Congress. We would like to see the highest level of service provided to the most number of passengers. Do you believe that this Perimeter Rule exemption would prevent airlines from competing to provide the greatest amount of service to the most number of passengers?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I note that both Senator McCain and Senator Smith came to the floor to present their thoughts on Kosovo. I would really like to join them and second their remarks. 
Mr. President, it is estimated that at least 250,000 Kosovar Albanians have been displaced by the violence and bloodshed of the past several months, and that many are currently living in the forests, without access to adequate food, shelter or medical care. With winter soon approaching, we are on the verge of a major humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo, which is the direct result of a cruel and intentional policy directed by President Milosevic and carried out by Serbian security forces in Kosovo. 
The time has come--indeed, it is my belief that the time came long ago--for the United States, our NATO allies, and the entire international community, to back with resolve that what happened in Bosnia must not be allowed to happen again in Kosovo. For too long, we have stood by passively while Milosevic has acted in bad faith. He has made numerous commitments to halt the violence, such as that contained in his joint statement with President Yeltsin on June 16, and he has honored none of them. 
In July, the Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution which called on the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal to indict President Milosevic for his crimes in Bosnia. That resolution has not yet been carried out. In my mind, the time has come for the United States to call an end to the charade of taking at face value the word of a man the U.S. Senate believes should be indicted as a war criminal. 
If thousands, or tens of thousands, of people in Kosovo now die because they have been systematically forced from their homes, forced into the forests, denied access to food, warmth, shelter and medical care, it is a crime worthy of the world's condemnation. 
With winter imminent in the Balkans, the U.N. Security Council is prepared to vote on a resolution threatening force under article 7 of the U.N. Charter unless Milosevic calls a cease-fire and negotiates with Kosovo's Albanian separatists. 
At the end of this week, Secretary Cohen will be meeting with other NATO defense ministers. According to press reports, the Clinton administration has already asked the North Atlantic Council to seek commitments of arms, material and troops from NATO members to complete plans for a multinational force. 
I hope and trust that this means that a plan of action to halt the violence and bloodshed in Kosovo--a plan with clear benchmarks for success and a clear exit strategy--will be at the top of the NATO defense minister's agenda. 
I trust that Secretary Cohen will take a strong leadership position at this meeting, and that Secretary Albright is taking an equal stand on this issue in discussions with her counterparts. 
Although I wish it were not the case, we have seen all too often that when Washington hesitates, our Europe allies become paralyzed. 
And, lastly, I hope and trust that this time NATO, acting in coordination with the United Nations, will develop a plan consistent with this pressing humanitarian need, which will be quickly implemented, and not just talked about. 
Mr. President, it took us 4 years to develop the courage to join and urge NATO to intervene in Bosnia at the cost of 200,000 dead and 2 million displaced. Hundreds, if not thousands have already been killed in Kosovo, and hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes. What more needs to happen before the international community acts? 
There is no doubt that the search for peace in Kosovo has thus far proved elusive, and that finding a solution which provides Kosovar Albanians with full political rights and civil liberties will be difficult. 
But the time has come for the international community to take action: We must keep our promise not to allow Kosovo to become another Bosnia, and, unless Milosevic halts the violence immediately and unambiguously, to commit ourselves to the course of a much-needed humanitarian intervention in Kosovo. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support S. 1301, and intend to vote for its passage. It gives bankruptcy judges the tools they need to require that capable debtors take responsibility for their debts. Furthermore, it does so in a manner that empowers bankruptcy judges to seek solutions to consumer insolvency, rather than straitjacketing them with a strict formula. Finally, S. 1301 contains strengthened provisions to protect the priority of child support and spousal support, which I supported in the Judiciary Committee. 
Responsibility cannot be a one-way street, however. The blame for the current record number of consumer bankruptcies lies not only with unsound consumer spending habits, but often with unwise and irresponsible lending practices that facilitate and even foster such recklessness. This amendment aims to deter such recklessness in credit practices. 
It authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to conduct a study of industry practices of soliciting and extending credit indiscriminately, without taking steps to ensure that consumers are capable of repaying their debt, or in a manner that encourages consumers to accumulate additional debt. The Federal Reserve Board is further authorized to study the effects of such practices on consumer debt and insolvency. 
Within two years of enactment, the Federal Reserve Board will make public a report on its findings, regarding the credit industry's indiscriminate solicitation and extension of credit. 
The amendment allows the Federal Reserve Board to issue regulations that would require additional disclosures to consumers, and to take any other actions, consistent with its statutory authority, that the board finds necessary to ensure responsible industrywide practices and to prevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency. 
This amendment directly addresses one of the major causes of personal bankruptcies: bad consumer debt. 
It's a simple matter of arithmetic. The typical family filing bankruptcy in 1997 owed more than one-and-a-half times its annual income in short-term, high interest debt. This means that the average family in bankruptcy, with a median income of just over $17,500, had $26,500 in credit card and other short-term, high interest debt. 
Studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the FDIC, and independent economists all link the rise in personal bankruptcies directly to the rise in consumer debt. 
Last year, the credit card industry sent out a record 3.1 billion unsolicited offers. That's 30 solicitations to every household in America. The number of solicitations jumped 20% last year alone. Based on industry estimates, between 1992 and 1996, credit card companies offered about a million dollars of credit to every household in the United States. 
There are well over a billion cards in circulation--a dozen credit cards for every household in the country. Three-quarters of all households have a least one credit card, and three out of four of them also carry credit card debt from month to month. 
Not surprisingly, credit card debt has increased accordingly. Credit card debt doubled between 1993 and 1997: The amount of credit card debt outstanding at the end of 1997 was $422 billion, twice as much as the amount in 1993. 
Credit card usage has grown fastest in recent years among debtors with the lowest incomes. Since the early 1990's, Americans with incomes below the poverty level nearly doubled their credit card usage, and those in the $10,000-25,000 income bracket came in a close second in the rise in debt. The result is not surprising: 27% of the under-$10,000 families have consumer debt that is more than 40% of their income. Nearly one in ten has at least one debt that is more than sixty days past due. These are the families for whom real income has actually declined since 1989. 
Credit card issuers earn about 75% of their revenues from the interest paid by borrowers who do not pay in full each month. Several companies have instituted charges or even canceled credit cards for customers who pay in full each month, preferring customers with large credit balances who pay minimum monthly payments. 
As bankruptcy levels have risen, total credit card profitability has grown--credit card lending is now twice as profitable as all other lending activities. In the third quarter of 1997, credit card banks showed a 2.59% return on assets, compared to a 1.22% return on assets reported by all commercial banks. 
This amendment most likely would not affect the vast majority of the credit card industry, who responsibly check consumer credit history before issuing or `pre-approving' credit cards. Representatives of large credit card issuers such as Bank of America have assured me and my staff that they do not provide credit cards to consumers without a thorough credit history check. 
However, I should note that every credit card issuer that I and my staff spoke with said that one thing they do not check is income. In other words, credit card issuers have no idea whether persons to whom they issue credit cards have the means to pay their bills each month. 
Furthermore, major credit cards such as Visa and Mastercard do not require banks who issue their cards to check credit history. 
This bill would affect lenders who fail to even inquire into a consumer's ability to pay, or those who specifically target consumers who can't or won't repay balances. 
A growing segment of the credit industry known as `sub-prime' lenders increasingly searches for risky borrowers, who they know will make inappropriately low minimum monthly payments, carry large monthly balances from month to month, and pay high interest rates. Such lending has become the fastest growing, most-profitable subset of consumer lending. Although losses are substantial, interest rates of 18 to 40% on credit card debt make this lending profitable. 
Many of these often relatively unsophisticated borrowers don't realize that minimum monthly payments just put them deeper in a hole, which in many cases leads to bankruptcy. For example, industry analysts estimate that, using a typical minimum monthly payment rate on a credit card, in order to pay off a $2,500 balance--assuming the consumer never used the card to charge anything else ever again--it would take 34 years to pay off the balance, and total payments would exceed 300% of the original principal. 
The FDIC observes that by marketing high-risk debt to customers who are at substantial risk for non-payment, credit card issuers have contributed to the rise in consumer bankruptcies. 
On May 2, 1997, the FDIC issued warnings to banks about the risks posed by increased subprime lending. Some industry analysts predict that overall loan default rates will double by the year 2001 and thus warn that `by lowering their credit standards and saturating the market with loans, many banks will be unable to avoid potentially enormous delinquencies and write-offs.' 
Subprime lending is growing even among reputable lenders. Senator Lauch Faircloth, who notes that he `abhors . . . constraints on the private sector,' recently stated about the subprime market: `We have very reputable, very fine institutions, spinning off subsidiaries to get into what I would consider very precarious, reckless, bordering on sleazebag lending.' 
Since the Senate Judiciary Committee considered this bill in June, I have received examples from constituents of credit card companies who offer credit cards to persons who are wholly unable to afford them. I have also had my staff review solicitations they have received. 
I want to give you some examples of the sort of inappropriate credit card solicitations my constituents and my staff have received. 
A constituent from San Ramon, CA, wrote that her 7-year old son received a `charter membership offer' for a Visa Signature Card. The constituent writes:  
If banks are offering bankcards to small children, who else (or what else) are they offering them to. This kind of unsolicited mail is ridiculous. 
This is not an isolated occurrence. Both sons of a staff member who works in my San Francisco office received credit card offers--and they're 12 and 15 years old. The 12-year-old is an eighth grader, with no income other than a $25 a month allowance and gifts from his grandmother and holiday and birthday gifts. He is a Star Trek fan, and he was offered a `Star Trek Platinum Plus MasterCard,' with up to $100,000 in credit. The card features discounts on Star Trek merchandise and entertainment events. The solicitation noted an introductory 3.9 percent annual percentage rate in large, bold print. The small print on the back explains that the rate applies only to initial balance transfers and cash advance checks. The actual annual percentage rate is 14.99 percent. 
The 12-year-old's 15-year-old brother was also offered a credit line of up to $100,000 on the `First USA Platinum MasterCard for Science Fiction Enthusiasts.' This card offered a free space pen and a 9.99 percent `fixed' annual percentage rate. The small print explained that if payment is received `late' twice in any 6-month period, the annual percentage rate balloons to 19.99 percent. If payment is not received for 2 consecutive months, the rate balloons further to 22.99 percent. 
It's not just children. A constituent from Lakewood, CA, wrote to me last month: 
I am sending to you [a solicitation] which I received in the mail yesterday. It was addressed to my mother and was offering her a platinum credit card with a $100,000 credit line. What's wrong with this? My mother's been dead for seven years! 
The constituent continues: 
What really bugs me about this is that credit card companies send out these solicitations for their plastic cards and then when they get burned, they start crying foul. They want all kinds of laws passed to protect them from taking hits when it's their own practices that caused the problem. 
A 22-year-old constituent from Pacifica, CA, who makes $25,000 a year, was offered 3 platinum cards with a credit limit of up to $100,000 on each card. Two of the cards advertised in large, bold print, `introductory' annual percentage rates of 3.9 percent for cash advance checks and balance transfers. The fine print on both cards disclosed the actual annual percentage rates on purchases of 14.99 percent. The other card offered free mileage on US Airways. The fine print disclosed its annual percentage rate as 18.4 percent; 21.9 percent if the account is in default. 
Another constituent, also from Pacifica, CA, who is unemployed, was offered a platinum card with an up to $50,000 credit line. As with a number of these offers, the solicitation boldly advertised an `introductory' annual percentage rate of 3.9 percent for cash advance checks and balance transfers, but the fine print on both cards disclosed the actual annual percentage rate on purchases of 14.99 percent. The other card offered free mileage on US Airways. 
Besides low introductory interest rates, which inevitably balloon, and frequent flier miles, the range of gifts offered to induce people to take on new credit cards is incredible. In the past couple of months that I have been asking my staff to save solicitations, `free' gifts offered to them--and to me--to take on new credit cards, have included everything from: free telephone calling cards, to transistor radios, attache cases, Godiva chocolates, Waterford crystal, and electronic organizers. 
And the credit card companies are anything if not persistent. Over the past couple months, one of my staff members has received 4 offers for second mortgages, totaling $75,000 in credit, one of which was sent twice; $230,000 in credit, with free gifts as incentives; and a `college alumni' card, offering a `third opportunity' to apply. 
These sort of come-on's, targeting people who oftentimes are simply incapable of affording the credit card, are by no means unique to Californians. 
Bankruptcy Judge John Akard of the Northern District of Texas wrote that the attorneys for one couple who filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy asked them to record solicitations received after filing for bankruptcy. The received over 50 solicitations over the next 24 months, offering cumulatively over $2 million in credit; 25 of these were `pre-approved.' 
Consumer bankruptcy attorneys tell my staff that some companies send credit cards to bankruptcy filers courtesy of their bankruptcy attorneys. 
In fact, a staff member informed me that when he did pro bono work for indigent people filing bankruptcy, the pro bono attorneys had to constantly tell the bankruptcy filers not to take on new credit cards, which credit card companies targeted to them, knowing that they could not disavow their debt for a period of six years following bankruptcy. 
In many cases, credit cards offered to consumers who have no ability to repay them and no reason having them is a direct cause of personal bankruptcy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee for the Southern District of California provided my office with some examples, taken directly from the rolls of recent bankruptcy filers in San Diego: One bankruptcy filer had $41,989 in debt, run up on 25 retail and credit cards--but only $17,520 in yearly income; another bankruptcy filer, had $23,826 in debt, run up on 6 credit cards and 7 retail cards--and only $4,320 in yearly income; still another bankruptcy filer had $28,054 in debt, run up on 6 credit cards and 9 retail cards, but only $11,520 in yearly income; and in the most egregious case, one filer had $97,372 in debt, run up on a total of 26 cards--13 credit cards and 13 retail cards--and had no yearly income. Another filer had over $50,000 in debt run up on 7 credit cards--and no yearly income. 
Similarly, the United States Trustee for the Northern District of California provided my office with a case study of some of the recent bankruptcy cases filed in San Francisco; a `naturopath' with an annual income of $8,100, accumulated $44,690 in credit card debt, on 13 credit cards before declaring bankruptcy; a truck driver with $22,368 in annual income, accumulated $102,645 in credit card debt on 14 credit cards before declaring bankruptcy; an unemployed person with no annual income, accumulated $50,927 in debt on 14 different credit cards before declaring bankruptcy; and the list goes on. 
U.S. bankruptcy trustees have also provided my office with letter after letter, originally sent by U.S. bankruptcy panel trustees to creditors, alleging `bad faith' on behalf of consumers, because the debtor accumulated credit card debts they could have had no realistic expectation of repaying. For example, one letter notes that the debtor accumulated over $110,635 in credit card debt, but had $500 in monthly income, and had incurred a net loss in income in 1996 and 1997. 
If the consumer acted in bad faith, one wonders about the faith of the credit card companies that issued the credit cards in the first place and allowed the consumer to continue to accumulate debt. 
Obviously, in each of these cases, banks kept on issuing credit cards, and kept on allowing consumers to rack up still more debt on the cards, despite clear evidence that the consumer would never be able to repay the debt. 
During the debate on this bill, we have heard much about the financial burden that consumer bankruptcies levy on each of us as consumers. Clearly, part of the responsibility for that financial burden rests with the credit card companies and retailers who irresponsibly continue to issue credit in such cases. Indeed, industry consultants have estimated that credit card companies could cut their bankruptcy losses by more than 50% if they would institute minimal credit screening. 
As I mentioned at the outset, I support S. 1301, which gives bankruptcy judges effective tools to require responsible behavior from debtors once bankruptcies occur. This amendment is necessary to promote the responsible behavior needed to prevent such bankruptcies from occurring in the first place, by preventing the runaway consumer debt that is one of the principal causes of the rise in personal bankruptcies. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for the adoption of this amendment. 
I end my comments with one statement: Responsibility is a two-way street. And what is sauce for the gander is also sauce for the credit card company. 
Mr. President, it is my understanding that the amendment has been accepted by both sides. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will vote to table this amendment to S. 1301, the Bankruptcy Reform bill, which expresses the sense of the Congress `that the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee should promptly reduce the Federal Funds rate.' My vote to table this amendment should not be construed as opposition to lower interest rates. Rather, I do not believe it is the duty of this body, nor do I believe that it is appropriate for this body, to tell the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee what to do.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I opposed the override of the veto of H.R. 1122, a bill banning emergency late-term abortions. There are several reasons why this is a flawed bill. This bill attempts to ban a specific medical procedure, called by opponents, partial-birth abortion, but there is no medical definition of partial-birth abortion. The language in this bill is so vague that it could affect far more than the one particular procedure it seeks to ban, procedures used during the second and possibly the first trimester of a pregnancy. There is no exception to protect the health of the woman. This bill would ban a type of medical procedure regardless of whether it is the medically safest procedure under a particular set of circumstances. States are legislating prohibitions on abortions. 
H.R. 1122 would criminalize the use of a medical procedure called, by the bill, partial-birth abortion. This term does not appear in medical textbooks or training. Doctors do not know what it means. The doctors who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee could not identify, with any degree of certainty or consistency, what medical procedure this legislation refers to. For example, when asked to describe in medical terms what a partial-birth abortion is Dr. Pamela Smith, Director of OB/GYN Medical Education at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago called it `a perversion of a breech extraction.' (page 127) Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing OB/GYN and Assistant Professor at Wright State University School of Medicine, who said the doctors at her hospital had never performed the procedure, had to quote another doctor in describing it as `a dilation and extraction, distinguished from dismemberment D and Es.' (page 182) 
When the same question was posed to legal experts in Judiciary Committee hearings--to define exactly what medical procedure would be outlawed by this legislation--the responses were equally vague. This vagueness means that every doctor that performs even a second trimester abortion could be vulnerable and could face possible prosecution under this law. 
The language in this bill is so vague that, far from outlawing just one abortion procedure, the way this bill is written virtually any legal procedure could fall within its scope. I asked the legal and medical experts who testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing if this legislation could affect abortion-not just late-term abortion-but earlier abortions as well. Dr. Lewis Seidman, Professor of Law at Georgetown University, gave the following answer. `As I read the language in a second trimester pre-viability abortion where the fetus in any event will die, if any portion of the fetus enters the birth canal prior to the technical death of the fetus, then the physician is guilty of a crime and goes to prison for two years.' Dr. Seidman continued his testimony, concluding that `if I were a lawyer advising a physician who performed abortions, I would tell him to stop because there is just no way to tell whether the procedure would eventuate in some portion of the fetus entering the birth canal before the fetus is technically dead, much less being able to demonstrate that after the fact.' (223) 
Dr. Cortland Richardson, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at John Hopkins University School of Medicine, in testimony before a House committee, said that the language `partially vaginally delivers' is vague, not medically oriented, and just not correct. `In any normal second trimester abortion procedure by any method, you may have a point at which a part, a one inch of umbilical cord, for example, of the fetus passes out of the cervical opening before fetal demise has occurred.' (H.R. Rep No. 267, September 27, 1995 testimony) So this bill could affect far more than just the few abortions performed in the third trimester, and far more than just the one procedure being described. 
This bill has no exemption to protect the health of the mother and as such, would directly eliminate that protection provided by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood V. Casey. 
If this bill were law, a pregnant woman seriously ill with diabetes, cardiovascular problems, cancer, stroke, or other health-threatening illnesses would be forced to carry the pregnancy to term or run the risk that the physician could be challenged and have to prove in court what procedure he or she used, and whether or not the doctor `partially vaginally-delivered' a living fetus before death of that fetus. 
Here are some examples, provided to me by gynecologists, of rare maternal medical conditions that could necessitate a post-viability procedure to protect a woman's health. The health of these women would be endangered in these situations. 
A fetus has a huge hydrocephalic head (or other greatly enlarged organ) three times the normal size and a cranium is filled with fluid. The head is so large the woman physically cannot deliver it. Labor is impossible, because the fetus cannot get down the birth canal and out. A caesarian is impossible because it would require a huge, up-and-down incision, which would rupture in future pregnancies or labor. Thus, a woman could not have future children and this procedure affects her ability to have future pregnancies. 
A condition called arthrogryposis, or a rigid fetus, the fetus cannot move down and out in labor, and labor risks rupturing the woman's cervix. With prolonged intense pushing the mother's heart is put at risk. If this stiff fetus cannot be delivered by a caesarian, a large vertical incision would be required, thus risking future pregnancies. 
Women with certain health conditions cannot tolerate the stress of labor or surgery. They include cardiac problems like congestive heart failure; severe kidney disease (e.g. renal shutdown); severe hypertension, diathesphesis, and Von Willibrand's Disease (bleeding, clotting disorder). 
Pre-eclampsia (toxemia) is a serious complication of pregnancy and a leading cause of maternal and fetal death that affects the placenta. The placenta does not attach to the wall of the uterus and thus limits the amount of blood and nutrients reaching the fetus, causing it to be underweight and prone to complications. This condition can progress to eclampsia, which can lead to convulsions, kidney failure, and death. The only treatment is to deliver the fetus. The woman cannot withstand labor or surgery. 
A woman with diabetes might have a decline in renal function. She might not be able to tolerate the physical stress of labor or surgery. 
Why is this legislation even necessary? Roe v. Wade unequivocally allows States to ban all post-viability abortions unless they are necessary to protect a woman's life or health. Forty-one States have done so. Surely, anyone who believes in States' rights must question the logic of imposing new, Federal regulations on States in a case such as this in area where States have legislated. 
Medical decisionmaking should be made by medically trained people, not Congress. Congress cannot anticipate every medical situation and explicitly delineate them in law. During pregnancy, labor, and delivery, complicated conditions can develop that are often last minute, life-threatening, and complex for the mother and fetus. No legislator can ever anticipate, craft into law, every conceivable medical emergency that a physician caring for a pregnant woman will face. 
We have entrusted and trained physicians to make safe and ethical medical decisions based on scientific and medical data on the benefits and risks to the patient. They do so based on their extensive training, their best medical judgment, proven medical techniques, and therapeutic assessment of the patient. 
Physicians are sworn to protect the health of their patients. Congress should not pass legislation that would deny a physician the ability to provide care that in their professional judgment is medically necessary. 
Medical decisionmaking or choosing the most appropriate therapy is based on the risk benefit for the mother and fetus, medical training, multiple decisional building blocks by medical experts, often a team. It is highly individualized. Every case is different. The medical history of patients varies tremendously. There are no absolutes. It is based on medical knowledge and training on a wide array of choices. 
Only the attending physicians in consultation with the woman, with all the facts of the medical case and the medical history assembled, can make the decision. Physicians are bound by ethics, licensing, practice guidelines, and liability. Decisions are often team decisions, not made by one isolated physician and always in consultation with the patient or family. We hire trained professionals because we want their expertise. 
In the words of the California Medical Association, `We believe that this bill would create an unwarranted intrusion into the physician-patient relationship by preventing physicians from providing necessary medical care to their patients . . . political concerns and religious beliefs should not be permitted to take precedence over the health and safety of patients.' The American Women's Medical Association wrote, `We do not believe that the federal government should dictate the decisions of physicians . . .' 
Let me make this clear: I oppose post-viability abortions. They are wrong, except to save the mother's life and health. Late-term abortions are rare and they should be rare. When the Senate considered this bill last year, on May 14, 1997, I offered a substitute to the bill before us. My substitute had 3 provisions. it would have prohibited all abortion procedures after a fetus is viable, not prohibited abortions if in the medical judgment of the physician, an abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the woman or to avert serious adverse health consequences to the woman, and imposed civil penalties. I continue to believe that my substitute would accomplish the goals of the bill before us while protecting women's health and constitutional rights. 
Mr. President, these are tragic situations, situations that most of us could never imagine. We had couples come to us and tell us heartbreaking stories about babies they dearly wanted, but babies they could not have because to go through labor and delivery the mother would have died, been seriously injured or prevented from having future pregnancies. These were people who explored every available option, who consulted experts, to save the baby that they very much wanted. These are rare and difficult circumstances. 
The Federal Government has no place interfering, making this tragic situation any more difficult or complicated for these families. This is a vague, poorly constructed bill. It attempts to ban a medical procedure without properly identifying that procedure in medical terms. It is so vague that it could affect far more than the procedure it seeks to ban. It fails to protect women's health at a time when they face tragic complications in their pregnancies. I urge my colleagues to vote to sustain the President's veto.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to bring this body's attention to a number of very serious problems that have now been documented in the U.S. Customs Service's drug enforcement efforts at ports of entry on the Southwest Border. 
Back in March 1996, I asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the continuing influx of drugs entering our country across the border with Mexico, and the inability or unwillingness of the Customs Service to effectively address the problem. I was especially concerned about reports that trucks loaded with drugs were coming into the country without inspection by Customs. 
The investigation by the GAO over the past 18 months has now confirmed my long-standing concerns that there are major weaknesses in several Customs' programs that were supposed to help separate so-called `low-risk' Mexican cargo shipments from those that are of higher drug smuggling risk. 
These programs were intended to help expedite the processing of cargo by companies with no previous involvement in narcotics smuggling, which had been thoroughly checked so authorities could focus on other shipments considered to be of significant risk of drug smuggling. 
The problems uncovered by the GAO's 18-month investigation are, by themselves, cause of serious concern. But what is also disturbing, is that the flow of large amounts of drugs through our ports of entry has apparently continued even while the GAO was conducting its research. 
Four reports in all have been issued by the GAO: 
Customs Service: Information on Southwest Border Drug Enforcement Operations (GAO/GGD-97-173R, Sept. 30, 1997). 
Customs Service: Process for Estimating and Allocating Inspectional Personnel (GAO/GGD-98-107, April 30, 1998). 
Customs Service: Drug Interdiction: Internal Control Weaknesses and Other Concerns With Low-Risk Cargo Entry Programs (GAO/GGD-98-175, July 31, 1998). 
Customs Service: Internal Control Weaknesses Over Deletion of Certain Law Enforcement Records (GAO/GGD-98-187, August 21, 1998) 
The August 1998 report was particularly troubling and I sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on August 17, 1998, asking for his response. To date, I have not heard back from him. I am also including a copy of this letter in the record. 
The problems identified in Customs' drug enforcement efforts at three cargo inspection facilities (Loredo, Texas; Nogales, Arizona; and Otay Mesa, California) have been occurring during a time when the North American Free Trade Agreement has stimulated significant increases in commercial trade. 
The increased trade generated by NAFTA has resulted in significant expansion of opportunities for drug trafficking organizations. This is largely because of the excellent `cover' commercial trade activity provides, according to a report issued by Operation Alliance, a federally sponsored drug enforcement coordinating agency in El Paso. 
The Operation Alliance Report clearly describes the ways in which drug smugglers are exploiting increased trade. Let me cite just a few examples of how drug traffickers are taking advantage of the increased trade generated by NAFTA: 
Traffickers are making extensive use of `legitimate' systems for moving drugs into the United States by becoming thoroughly familiar with Customs documents, procedures and processes. 
Traffickers are also becoming involved with well-known legitimate trucking firms that would be less likely targets of law enforcement scrutiny. 
Known drug traffickers are also involved as owners or controlling parties in other commercial trade-related businesses to assist in the storage and transportation of drugs, such as semi-trailer manufacturing companies, railroad systems, factories, distributing companies and warehouses. 
Some traffickers have sought trade consultants to determine what merchandise moves most quickly across the border under NAFTA rules. 
Against this backdrop of traffickers exploiting legitimate means of transporting cargo across the border for their own illicit smuggling operations, we now have the GAO finding disturbing evidence of problems in Customs' drug enforcement efforts. 
Problems found by the GAO include: 
Internal control weaknesses in a program known as `Line Release,' intended to identify and separate `low-risk' shipments from those with apparently higher smuggling risk. These flaws at all three of the above-mentioned border crossings are seriously jeopardizing the security of the program. 
Incomplete documentation of screening and review of applicants at Otay Mesa, as well as Nogales. 
Lost or misplaced Line Release application files and background checklists that served as support for approving applications. Otay Mesa officials were unable to locate 15 of 46 background checklists in the Line Release program. 
No recertification requirement for companies already approved for the Line Release Program to ensure that the participants remained a low risk for drug smuggling. (The Otay Mesa Port did recertify participants on the basis of their shipping volume criteria, but does not recheck those same companies for their compliance or perform follow-up background checks, the GAO said.) 
A lack of documentation of supervisory reviews and approval of decisions. 
Mr. President, given these problems in a program whose intent was to expedite crossing of low-risk shipments so more enforcement attention could be focused on high-risk shipments, the effectiveness of the Line Release program is called into question. 
Moreover, the GAO found that Customs officials themselves have little confidence in the `Three Tier Targets' concept, another enforcement initiative implemented in 1992, which was supposed to help identify low- and high-risk shipments so inspectors could focus their attention on suspect shipments. 
Under the program, Customs headquarters identified how cargo shipments would be divided into three-tier categories, but allowed the ports of entry to develop their own procedures for assigning risk. 
The GAO found that this program does not work because there is insufficient information in the Customs' database for researching foreign manufacturers. What this means is that the reliability of the risk designations, which range from `little risk' for narcotics smuggling to a `significant risk,' are questionable and therefore unreliable. 
The GAO report noted that some inspectors (at Laredo) were `more suspicious of shipments classified as low risk because they had doubts about the reliability of the tier designations.' Such doubts could lead to a self-defeating exercise in which inspectors checked more low-risk shipments instead of focusing their attention on high-risk shipments, the GAO said. 
Although I have cited only a few of the numerous problems and concerns identified in the GAO reports dealing with low-risk cargo entry programs, they are sufficient to raise serious doubts about the effectiveness of Customs' drug enforcement efforts at our Southwestern Border Ports of Entry. 
But, unfortunately, there is more. 
The GAO also found significant internal control problems with a Treasury Enforcement Communications System, which is used to compile lookout data for law enforcement purposes, including identification of persons and vehicles suspected of drug smuggling. 
The system is used by more than 20 federal agencies, including 
the INS, DEA, IRS and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. However, Customs did not have adequate controls over deletion of records from the system and Customs' guidance for its use does not follow standards set by the Comptroller General, and which renders it vulnerable to deletion of data without checks and balances by management. 
The bottom line: this could result in cargo shipments being expedited when they in fact should be stopped and searched. 
In addition to communications problems, and the previously cited weaknesses in the Line Release and Three-Tier Targeting program, the GAO also found problems with the processes for estimating and allocating inspection personnel at the ports. 
For example, under the current Customs' employees union contracts, inspectors can only be moved to new sites if they volunteer, which I find quite surprising. 
The GAO report also found that inconsistent practices in the agency's personnel decision-making processes could prevent Customs from accurately estimating the need for inspector personnel and allocating them to ports. This inability to quickly allocate resources to where they are needed most is just another hindrance in our drug interdiction efforts at the border. 
Mr. President, the problems go on and on. It's an alarming situation that demonstrates the Southwest Border is still, without question, ground zero in U.S. drug interdiction efforts. 
More than 70% of the cocaine and other narcotics entering this country come across our Southwest border. In fact, narcotics intelligence officials continue to warn that an estimated 5 to 7 tons of cocaine enters this country every single day of the year. 
In the last two years, Congress has authorized more than $100 million for 650 additional inspectors and state-of-the-art technologies along the Southwest border. The President's budget in FY1999 calls for an additional $104 million for Southwest Border drug interdiction efforts. 
Despite our best efforts and constant drum beat by Members of Congress, including myself, to try to tighten Customs' drug enforcement efforts, little progress has been made. 
Trucks are still getting through our ports of entry with their loads of illicit drugs concealed in cargo ranging from electronics components to vegetables, or in false compartments built into the trucks. 
For example, one of the largest cocaine seizures ever made in California's Imperial County occurred last November when Border Patrol agents found 835 pounds of the drug concealed in a tractor trailer rig of Mexican registry at a highway checkpoint about 50 miles north of the border. (Source: U.S. Border Patrol.) 
The next month Border Patrol agents seized 474 pounds of marijuana in another truck of Mexican registry in Calexico, CA., across the border from Mexicali, Mexico. (Source: U.S. Border Patrol) 
At the Otay Mesa Cargo Inspection facility, there have been 24 seizures within the last year of drugs found concealed in trucks and trailers, including those of two Line Release participants. (Source: information provided San Diego District Office by a Customs inspector.) 
And, in August of 1997, the New York Times News Service reported the following:  
For nearly a year, 18-wheel trailer trucks, driven by experienced truckers recruited in Michigan, have been rolling north from the Mexican border to New York, delivering tons of concealed cocaine and marijuana and carrying back millions of dollars in illegal drug profits. 
Authorities said the trucks were dispatched by Mexico's most powerful drug-trafficking syndicate, once headed by the late Amado Carillo Fuentes. 
A parallel investigation discovered the smuggling of at least 1.5 tons of cocaine a month in crates of fruits and vegetables from Mexico, according to the New York Times Service article. 
One wonders if these cocaine-laden vegetable shipments were routinely passed through by border inspectors month after month because they were part of the Line Release or other Customs' programs that had classified the shipments as low-risk for drug smuggling. 
More than once, officials at Customs have told me that not only is it impossible to increase inspection of trucks and cars entering our borders, but that it is not really necessary. Customs is relying on its sophisticated technology, including electronic technology, random searches, and Customs' vast intelligence operations, to stop the drug smugglers. 
But the fact is, while Customs is having internal control problems, the drug traffickers have developed detailed knowledge and profiles of our port operations, and are using the `cover' that legitimate commercial trade activity provides to penetrate our borders and smuggle drugs. 
Additionally, the `random' searches that I have heard so much about are supposed to keep traffickers trembling in their `big-rigs.' But they have become so predictable that, as Customs has previously told my staff: `traffickers know what cargo, conveyances, or passengers we inspect, how many of those conveyances are checked on an average day, what lanes we work harder, and what lanes are more accessible for smuggling.' 
Mr. President, I know how difficult this task is, and I want to commend the extremely hard working men and women of the United States Customs Service, but the impact of Customs' internal control problems have dire consequences in our fight against drugs in our cities and in our rural areas. 
But without effective internal controls over the Line Release program, the Three-tier risk program and other enforcement initiatives cited by the GAO, Customs' ability to detect drug smugglers and to interdict drugs at the border is seriously jeopardized. 
Mr. President, we must address the Customs' internal control problems now. We need to fix the problems before authorizing any additional programs that would further complicate our drug interdiction efforts at the border. 
As the ranking member of the Technology Terrorism Subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee, I hope to work with the Chairman of the Subcommittee to hold hearings on the issues raised by the GAO reports so that we can fully understand the problem and identify a long-term solution. 
I will work with the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee to identify a way for such hearings to be held without delay.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the golden anniversary of the Emmy Awards telecast from Los Angeles. For fifty years, hundreds of the nation's brightest and most popular personalities have attended this prestigious event to honor television excellence. 
Beyond the captivating glow of the Hollywood spotlight, the yearly awards presentation is a celebration of California's thriving entertainment industry. Television arts and production contribute billions of dollars to the California economy, generating rapid job growth, higher income, and greater tax revenues. Entertainment's significant financial impact can be attributed to the rising television and commercial production within the state. Recent studies confirm that payrolls and payments for goods and services within the entertainment industry currently contribute over $27 billion to California's economy. The Emmy Awards confer annual awards of merit to creative arts people in the television industry, as incentive to continue supporting the economic growth in California. 
Now celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, the Emmy Awards was not always so celebrated and grand. The first awards banquet in 1949 was held at the old Hollywood Athletic Club, with tickets costing a mere five dollars. With few stars in attendance, the program was not even televised nationally. The ceremony was broadcast on local station KTSL beginning at 9:30 p.m. Despite the American public's unfamiliarity with the obscure, new medium, Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Brown declared the day of the first telecast TV Day on January 25, 1949. 
Sponsor of the annual awards program, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has a long and venerated history. Since its early days, membership to the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has flourished to more than 9,000, making it the single largest television professional association in the world. The Academy not only presents the Emmy Awards, but also hosts a program for college educators and has underwritten the Archive of American Television in an effort to preserve television's rich and detailed past. 
As the Emmy's golden anniversary approaches, let us pay tribute to the award show's support of the entertainment industry and recognition of quality television programming. With 50 years of telecasts to its credit, the Emmy's have become a genuine part of American history.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to convey my strong support for the $3,000,000 this bill contains for land acquisition at Lake Tahoe. This funding is crucial if we are to control the erosion problem that is robbing Lake Tahoe of its striking water clarity. 
Lake Tahoe is the crown jewel of the Sierra Nevada. The clarity of its blue waters, and the beauty of its surrounding forests and high mountains, inspired Mark Twain to call it `the fairest view the whole earth affords.' 
Mark Twain would still recognize the Lake Tahoe Basin today, but it is no longer a pristine wilderness surrounding a perfectly clear lake. Today Lake Tahoe is a year-round recreational mecca, drawing millions annually to its ski slopes, hiking trails, and crystal clear waters. Lake Tahoe is a major economic force in both California and Nevada, contributing $1.6 billion annually to the economy from tourism alone. 
The environment and the economy are inextricably linked at Lake Tahoe. The famous azure lake and its surrounding pristine forests are the primary reasons that people visit the region. Protecting environmental quality at Lake Tahoe is key to preserving the economy of the Sierra region. 
Scientists agree that the Lake is in the midst of an environmental crisis. Lake Tahoe is one of the largest, deepest, and clearest lakes in the world, but that remarkable clarity is disappearing at the rate of over a foot a year. 
In the 1960s, you could drop a white plate into Lake Tahoe and watch it fall 105 feet before it disappeared. Now you can watch the same plate fall only 70 feet. As the Lake's water clarity decreases, algae is taking over. In 10 years, the effects could be irreversible. 
Why the troubling decline? The answers are quite simple: air pollution and erosion. Algae is fed by nitrogen, a key component in car exhaust, and phosphorous, a key component of run-off that flows into Lake Tahoe from streams, paved roads, old logging roads, golf courses, and even private homes. 
Lake Tahoe was once ringed by wetlands that filtered out most of this harmful sediment and debris. But most of the wetlands have been filled in to provide more lakefront property. The lake's clarity continues to deteriorate. 
For nearly 20 years, the Forest Service has been slowing this deterioration by acquiring environmentally sensitive land at Lake Tahoe--land especially prone to the erosion that is slowly strangling the Lake--and protecting it from development. Since 1980, the Forest Service has purchased 11,000 acres at Lake Tahoe. This acquisition program has the wholehearted support of Lake Tahoe's elected officials, as well as both environmental and business groups. 
The $3 million for land acquisition contained in this bill will help buy parcels like the Wells property, an 18.5 acre site adjacent to a County park that includes some of the few remaining wetlands surrounding Lake Tahoe, as well as a stretch of Burke Creek that provides a vital wildlife corridor. If the Forest Service is not able to buy this property, it may end up being developed into 50 condominium units. 
Land acquisition funds may also be used for a phased-in purchase of High Meadows, a 2300-acre parcel that remains the largest private inholding in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The meadows include the headwaters for Cold Creek, one of Lake Tahoe's most sensitive watersheds. Protecting the property could dramatically reduce the amount of sediment and debris that flows currently flow into Lake Tahoe from Cold Creek. 
I commend the Committee for including these land acquisition funds for Lake Tahoe in this bill. I am disappointed that the House did not include any funds in its version of the bill. I intend to urge the Senate conferees on this legislation to protect the full $3 million in conference. 
Unfortunately, this $3 million barely scratches the surface of what is needed to restore the environment at Lake Tahoe. The region's environmental problems extend well beyond its famous azure lake. 
Insect infestations have killed over 25 percent of the trees in the forests surrounding Lake Tahoe, creating a severe risk of catastrophic wildfire that could destroy communities and have a devastating impact on water quality at the Lake. The millions of cars that visit the Lake Tahoe Basin each year worsen erosion problems from roads and produce nitrogen that ends up feeding algae in the Lake. 
The Federally-chartered Tahoe Regional Planning Agency estimates that preserving the Lake's water quality, restoring its fragile forest ecosystem, and establishing a public transportation system that would reduce air pollution and road run-off could cost $900 million in Federal, State, local, and private funds. 
The Federal government, through the United States Forest Service, owns nearly 80 percent of the land in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Therefore, we have a unique responsibility for protecting Lake Tahoe. Two important Federal reports that are currently pending will help determine what steps the Forest Service must take to stop the environmental decline at the Lake. 
One report is the Watershed Assessment, a study being conducted by an independent team of scientists, that will create a model of Lake Tahoe's ecosystem to help us determine the impact of proposed environmental restoration projects. Lake Tahoe is so fragile that we need to be sure prescribed burning to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire at one end of the lake does not cause too much erosion or air pollution in another part of the Lake. The Watershed Assessment will provide the Forest Service with the tools to make those tough judgment calls. 
The other Federal effort underway is an interagency review of the Environmental Improvement Program, a list of more than 500 environmental improvement projects that the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency proposes to implement at Lake Tahoe. The Environmental Improvement Program has the full support of Lake Tahoe's local governments, business leaders, and environmental groups. Now the Federal government is assessing which of the environmental projects on this list should have high priority for Federal funding, and whether new programs are needed to provide that funding. 
I plan to act upon the results of these studies as soon as they are complete in December 1998. I am hoping to offer legislation in the next session that would authorize a new Federal initiative, led by the U.S. Forest Service, to address Lake Tahoe's erosion and forest health problems. I am working with a bi-partisan group of Tahoe's business, environmental, and community leaders to develop a proposal, and I hope that the Forest Service will become an active player in the process as well. 
In 1997, President Clinton and Vice President Gore visited Lake Tahoe. I attended the Forum they sponsored, as did Senators Boxer, Reid and Bryan. We applauded the President as he announced an ambitious Tahoe initiative that included $50 million over two years for land acquisition, prescribed burning, watershed restoration, public transportation, upgrades to wastewater pipelines, erosion control, and scientific research at the Lake. 
Unfortunately, since then, Lake Tahoe seems to have dropped off the Administration's radar screen. The Administration never even fulfilled the $50 million in commitments the President made at Tahoe, let alone extend those commitments to fiscal year 1999. 
In his 1999 budget request, President Clinton did not make any specific requests for Tahoe, and the Forest Service will be lucky if they receive $5 million from the Administration next year for forest health and erosion control projects. 
Forest Service officials at Lake Tahoe are doing a heroic job of reducing fire risk in the forest while simultaneously protecting Lake Tahoe's water quality. They need more resources if they are going to reverse declining environmental quality at the Lake and its surrounding forests. 
Time is running out for Lake Tahoe. If we do not act quickly with a full commitment of Federal resources, the crown jewel of the Sierra could become permanently tarnished. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in preserving this national treasure for generations to come. Let's look at this $3 million for land acquisition as a down payment, not the last word.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Elizabeth Snyder, a longtime civic leader who helped pave the way for women to assume positions of leadership in California. She died in Los Angeles on August 26, 1998. 
Elizabeth first came to national attention in 1954, when she was elected Chair of the California Democratic Party, becoming the first woman in the United States to be elected chair of a major political party in any state. In a career that spanned more than half a century, Elizabeth worked prominently in the California presidential campaigns of Harry Truman, Adlai Stevenson, and Lyndon Johnson and served as the California Co-Chair of President Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign. 
Born on April 8, 1914, in Minnesota of immigrant parents, Elizabeth and her family moved to San Diego in the early 1920s. Following the collapse of her father's business at the outset of the Great Depression, Elizabeth, her mother and two brothers relocated to East Los Angeles where life was, in her words, `lean, precarious and hard.' Elizabeth graduated with honors from Garfield High School in 1931. She studied at Los Angeles City College and graduated as a political science major from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1933. She went on to become one of the first two doctoral candidates in UCLA's political science department. 
After World War II, Elizabeth became involved in the first of many Congressional campaigns on behalf of her lifelong friend and mentor, Congressman Chet Holifield. In 1959, she co-founded one of California's first political campaign management firms, Snyder-Smith. Although she remained committed to what she believed were the true ideals and principles of the Democratic Party, Elizabeth never hesitated in non-partisan races to support Republicans whom she believed to be best qualified to serve in office. 
None of her political activities was more important to Elizabeth than her lifelong effort to bring about greater participation by women in the political arena. During the 1970s, Elizabeth devoted herself to the mentoring of Los Angeles women in politics, holding weekly luncheon meetings of The Thursday Group at her Bunker Hill apartment. 
Her dedication to improving our society extended beyond the realm of politics. She was especially proud of her work on the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome which culminated in ordinances requiring the restaurants and bars to post warnings to women regarding the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In addition to all her varied civic activities, Elizabeth will be remembered fondly by the literally thousands of men and women to whom she provided comfort and assistance in overcoming the adversities of alcoholism and substance abuse. 
In 1994, she received the prestigious CORO Public Affairs Award in recognition of her lifelong commitment to the reform of the American system of government in which she so deeply believed. As Elizabeth herself once wrote, In the last analysis, the most significant single political activity is not winning elections and defeating opponents, it is improving, expanding and correcting government structure, so that democracy works. 
On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate, I extend my heartfelt condolences to her husband, Nathan, and her daughter, United States District Judge, Christina A. Snyder.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee and myself to address the two amendments that I have just sent to the desk. The first amendment addresses the political, economic, and social turmoil now facing Indonesia, one of our most important allies, and calls for a more active U.S. role in supporting a peaceful economic and political transition in Indonesia. 
The second amendment expresses my concern and condemnation over the allegations regarding the brutal treatment and rape of ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia during the riots that occurred this past May, a situation that, if left unaddressed, threatens to undermine the other progress that Indonesia is making. 
Taken together, I believe that these two amendments provide a solid framework for U.S. policy towards this vital country. 
Indonesia is a country of great significance for the United States, and we have a great deal riding on the outcome of the current period of economic and political transition. 
Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous nation, and its ethnic and religious diversity boasts the world's largest Muslim population; 
Indonesia is comprised of over 13,000 islands which span important sea lanes, including 50 percent of volume of all international shipping and every major route between the Indian and Pacific Oceans; 
Indonesia has served as a vital engine of East Asian economic growth. It possesses vast natural resources, including oil and gas. Before the disruption caused by the current global financial crisis, the World Bank in 1997 estimated that Indonesia would possess the world's 6th largest economy by early in the new century, and Indonesia has been an active proponent of more liberal trade measures in the Asia-Pacific region; 
As the largest member of ASEAN, and a founder of the Asian Regional Forum, Indonesia has been a linchpin of regional security, and has worked with the United States on many key regional security concerns; 
In short, the United States has a profound national interest in the emergence of a stable, prosperous and democratic Indonesia from its current period of instability. 
Let me briefly recap some of the issues currently facing Indonesia and the developments which underscore, I believe, the need for these two Amendments. 
First, in response to public pressure to step down, earlier this year President Suharto resigned after thirty-two years in office. Following an orderly transfer of power, the new President, B.J. Habibie, assembled a cabinet, took some initial steps towards political reform, and pledged new elections. 
Several dangers still lie ahead. Indonesia lacks a system with strong and capable democratic institutions and has a long history of regional, religious and ethnic tensions. The road to a more open and democratic political system will be long and hazardous. 
Second, at the same time as Indonesia must make progress in this political transition, it is imperative that the Habibie government also take action to address the economic crisis that continues to buffet Indonesia. 
In other words, it is in the national interest of the United States that there be a stable, prosperous and democratic Indonesia and that it come out of its current period of instability. 
The first amendment before this body addresses the political, economic, and the social turmoil now facing Indonesia, and it calls for a more active U.S. role in supporting a peaceful economic and political transition and for America to lead a major humanitarian effort. Mr. President, today, at least 7 1/2 million people are facing starvation in that country. 
The second amendment is a sense of the Senate that expresses the concern and condemnation regarding allegations for the brutal mistreatment of the ethnic Chinese community within that country. That community totals about 6 percent of Indonesia's population. It is an entrepreneurial mercantile class. Once before, in the 1960s, during a pro-Communist revolution, the Chinese ethnic community was made a scapegoat, and literally tens of thousands of people were killed. This time, once again, there was a brutal outbreak against this community, and this resolution condemns it in no uncertain terms. 
Mr. President, I believe that Indonesia is extraordinarily important economically. As I said, the rupiah has fallen by over 70 percent in value in the past year. The country is saddled with about $80 billion in private debt and the prospect of a fall of 10 percent in its gross domestic product and a drop of over 25 percent of its manufacturing output. The economy is at a standstill. Inflation is threatening to reach triple digits and unemployment is rising rapidly. 
While I believe that Indonesia has the long-term capacity to work its way back to prosperity, in the short term the pain will likely get worse as the full effect of the financial crisis works its way through the economy. 
Finally, Indonesia is on the brink of a profound humanitarian crisis. 
In the past year Indonesia has faced severe droughts and massive fires, with the end result being that Indonesia is now unable to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of its people--food shortages which have been exacerbated by the current economic crisis. 
In a somewhat limited assessment earlier this year, the World Food Program estimated that more than 7.5 million Indonesians in the Eastern areas faced severe food shortages, malnutrition, and starvation as a result of the drought and fires. Others have estimated that with the effects of the economic crisis compounding the natural disasters, upwards of 100 million people across all of Indonesia may soon face acute food shortages. 
The Administration, I believe, is to be commended for its handling of the situation thus far. President Clinton's meeting with Suharto at APEC last fall, Special Presidential Envoy Mondale's session with Suharto in March, Secretary Albright's numerous discussions with Foreign Minister Alatas, and Assistant Secretary Roth's many trips to Jakarta have provided the United States an opportunity to encourage and support Indonesian political and economic reform. 
The Administration has also made important pledges of food aid--more than 230,000 tons this year through grants and `soft' loans, with much more promised if and as the crisis deepens. 
In assessing the challenges facing Indonesia, however, I believe that the United States must do more to assist the people of Indonesia to take advantage of the challenges and opportunities of a post-Suharto era. 
Indeed, beyond the `macro' questions of political and economic reform, hard-won gains made over the past thirty years in such areas as nutrition, sanitation and public health are all under threat, while, crime, child labor, and poverty are on the rise. Ordinary Indonesians are suffering as a result of this crisis. 
First, in recognition of the need to help alleviate that suffering, this Amendment supports the Administration's pledges of humanitarian food assistance. Moreover, it calls on the United States to take a leading role in the international community in developing and implementing efforts to meet Indonesia's humanitarian and food needs, with the goal of assuring that programs are put in place which will prevent famine and which will meet the basic needs of Indonesia's people. 
I believe it is extraordinarily important that the United States lead a major international effort at humanitarian relief to see that the people of Indonesia avoid starvation. And this sense of the Senate, the first resolution, puts this body in support of the administration's actions and urges the administration to go a step further and lead a major international humanitarian relief effort. 
Second, this amendment supports Indonesia's efforts to move forward with economic reforms. As I have already said, while I am encouraged by some of the positive signs we have seen thus far, the key question is whether the Habibie government will be more successful than its predecessor in carrying through on its economic reform commitments. 
To that end this amendment calls on the United States to adopt a more aggressive approach to working with Indonesia to implement serious and far reaching economic and fiscal reform: To restructure corporate debt, reform bankrupt and corrupt economic structures, implement transparent legal and banking systems, and open its economy to greater international trade. 
At the same time, this amendment recognizes that such economic reform can not come without considerable disruption to the lives of many Indonesians, and it thus supports efforts by the Government of Indonesia to cast a wide social safety net to provide relief to those in need. 
Finally, given President Habibie's public affirmation of the importance of moving on political reform and economic recovery in tandem--an approach I agree with--this amendment also calls on the Administration to take a more activist approach to working to develop democratic institutions and processes in Indonesia, to see that the human rights of all Indonesians are respected and protected, and for the Government of Indonesia to adhere to its commitment to hold elections. 
In sum, this amendment seeks to encourage the development of more active and engaged U.S. approach to Indonesia, and a U.S. policy which will work the Indonesian government to develop and lead a reform process that is deep and wide, reaches out to all Indonesians, and lays the groundwork for restored confidence in Indonesia's political and economic future. 
The second amendment which I have offered today speaks to a specific situation in Indonesia which I fear, if left unaddressed, runs the risk of undermining the progress which Indonesia has made and the goals articulated by my first amendment: The question is the treatment of its ethnic Chinese minority during the riots of this May, and specifically what appears to be systematic rape against the female population as an instrument of terror. 
Mr. President, in all too many places and in all too many conflicts in recent years we have witnessed the use of rape and sexual torture as an instrument of war and ethnic cleansing. Although, I am sad to say, some incidents of rape have always accompanied war and turmoil in human history, the record of the past few years, with the use of organized, systematic campaigns of rape as a tool of terror, is almost as though a new chapter in the barbarity of human history has been opened. 
I was therefore deeply troubled when I learned that there are serious and credible allegations that rape was used as an instrument of terror in targeted attacks on the ethnic Chinese community in Indonesia during the riots this past May. 
According to credible reports, at least 168 cases of rape occurred in Jakarta alone during the riots of May 13-15, 1998 as part of a pattern of political violence targeted against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. 
An investigative report published in Asiaweek on July 24, 1998 describes incidents documented by Rosita Noer, an Indonesian physician and human rights activist. For example, `In three Chinese areas of west Jakarta, between 5 and 8 pm, dozens of men dragged a hundred or so girls on to the streets, stripped them and forced them to dance before a crowd. Twenty were raped, then some burned alive, says Noer. She examined six other victims attacked in their homes in different areas of Jakarta. The girls were between the ages of 14 and 20; four of them had been raped by seven men.' 
In light of such reports, I was encouraged by President Habibie's decision two months ago to set up a national committee of inquiry to investigate the rapes, and his branding these rapes as criminal, inhumane actions. 
I have been troubled, however, by the lack of clear and decisive action taken by the Government of Indonesia over the past three months to investigate these rapes and bring the perpetrators to justice. 
Just this past weekend, for example, Indonesian Women's Affairs Minister Tutty Alawiah, one of the leaders of the government investigation, was reported in the press to have stated that `The team has been conducting an investigation for 1 1/2 months now but has found no women who fell victim to gang rape or who claimed to have been raped during the May riots.' 
Minister Tutty Alawiah's statement, and those of other leading Indonesian political figures have also been quoted in the press as doubting the veracity of the rapes, fly in the face of the voluminous credible findings of independent groups, such as the Indonesian Human Rights Commission, as well as numerous reports in the media, which have found considerable evidence of the these criminal, inhuman, rapes. 
For example, in an August 3, 1998 story Business Week reported that `On May 14, trucks loaded with muscular men raced to shopping centers and housing projects owned by ethnic Chinese. The men doused the shops and houses with gasoline and set off devastating fires. At least 182 women were raped or sexually tortured, some of them repeatedly, by men with crewcuts whom the victims believed to be soldiers. At least 20 women are confirmed to have died as a result.' 
`Confirmed to have died.' I do not want to cast aspersions on the government's official investigation, but I can not help but find it curious that a journalist can find evidence of the rapes and the aftermath yet one of the leaders of the government's investigation can not. 
I find this particularly troubling in light of an August 1, 1998 Agence France-Presse news story which reported that `At least 22 victims and witnesses of rapes during the widespread rioting in Indonesia in May have talked to a team set up by the government to probe violence during the unrest.' 
What has become of the evidence provided by these 22 victims and witnesses, that Minister Tutty Alawiah claims that no evidence of the rapes can be found and that no victims have come forward? 
The Chicago Tribune, on July 29, 1998, carried a story featuring `Aileen', a still-hospitalized 24 year old ethnic Chinese women raped by a group of men and left in a pool of blood. 
Are the government investigators unwilling or unable to find this women, and the many others like her, so easily found and interviewed by an American journalist? 
Perhaps most telling, a July 13, 1998 report by the Volunteers Team for Humanity, headed by Father Sandyawan, a respected Indonesian human rights activist, found ample documentation of systematic and organized rapes targeted at Indonesia's ethnic Chinese community. 
The report contains locations of rapes, the modus operandi of the perpetrators, dates of the rapes, and quotes from victims and witnesses, among other documentary evidence. 
Indeed, it is ironic to note that the authors of this July 13 report undertook their documentary efforts precisely because they feared that there would be efforts to `cover the case up as if it never happened.' 
What has become of this credible volume of documentation gathered by a respected independent group in the context of the government investigation? 
In short, there appears to be ample evidence that these rapes occurred, and that the director of the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women was well-founded in her belief when she stated that these rapes occurred as part of an `organized reaction to crisis.' 
I realize that the Indonesian government investigation is not yet complete. But I find it deeply troubling that there are signs that the official government investigation of these incidents may be guided more by political considerations then by a commitment to the truth and to justice. 
We all know that there are numerous problems that arise with efforts to investigate and document rape. Many women are afraid to speak to investigators. There is embarrassment and great social stigma. 
And, in a case like Indonesia, where there are allegations that members of the armed forces may have been involved in the riots and rapes, there is a special need to assure that any victims who cooperate with the investigation receive protection. 
But given the ability of others--independent groups and the media--to compile significant and credible evidence of the rapes which appeared to have occurred during the May riots, it is unsettling, to say the least, to be faced with the prospect that the government may try to deny that the rapes occurred at all, let alone to bring to justice those responsible. 
Thus, the second Amendment which I have offered here today condemns in no uncertain terms the rapes and mistreatment of the ethnic Chinese community during the May riots. 
Moreover, it urges a full, fair, and complete investigation of the rape allegations and calls for those responsible to be brought to justice. 
It calls on the Government of Indonesia to assure that the human rights of the ethnic Chinese community--indeed of all Indonesians--should be respected and protected; that the reparations the government has pledged to those who lost property in the May riots should be expedited, and that rape victims should receive just compensation as well, including medical care where still-needed. 
The Amendment also calls on the Administration to provide support and assistance to the Indonesian government and the independent human rights groups investigating these allegations, in the interest of assuring full, fair, and complete investigations. 
Lastly, it calls for the administration to provide Congress with a report evaluating the allegations surrounding these rapes, the actions taken by the Government of Indonesia, and the implications for U.S.-Indonesian relations. 
Essentially what the resolution does is condemn these acts, calls on the administration to work with the Indonesian government committee investigating these acts in hopes that the investigation will be forthcoming and straightforward and will take adequate measures to bring to justice those responsible for these riots and these rapes. 
To those in Indonesia who may misinterpret my intent with this Amendment let me be clear: I do not offer this Amendment as an attack on the Government of Indonesia. Just the opposite. I offer it because I understand how difficult it can be to face up to misdeeds and take necessary and responsible action to rectify the situation, and I want the people of Indonesia to know that as they move forward and deal with this difficult issue that if they do the right thing their friends will be there to offer support and assistance. 
It is my belief that if Indonesia does not take adequate measures to bring to justice those responsible for the May riots and rapes, it may well set itself down a course in which political and economic reform, democratization, respect for human rights--in short, many of the measures which Indonesia so desperately needs to undertake to work itself out of the present crisis--become all but impossible. That would be a great tragedy for the people of Indonesia, and a great disappointment to those of us here in the Senate who consider ourselves friends of the Indonesian people. 
Mr. President, Indonesia is undergoing a dramatic transformation. The transition to a more pluralistic system will likely be lengthy and difficult. The United States has long sought to promote a more open and tolerant Indonesia. I believe that the United States must continue to work closely with Indonesia during this critical transition period, while acknowledging that only the Indonesian people can determine their future. It is my hope that the two amendments which I have offered today can contribute to this process. 
I thank the chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, for his support of these two amendments to the bill.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to answer the questions of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. 
Yes, I oppose a measure which would oppose the granting of visas. The normal diplomatic and pragmatic efforts of a government-to-government effort to engage and discuss, to bring to light of day, to continue to persuade and develop a better sense of values would be truncated and cut off. 
I believe, I say to the Senator, as one who has watched China for some 35 years now, that this is a country which has been humiliated by the West in the past. This is a country that has 5,000 years of dictatorship by one individual, generally an emperor, an emperor who could cast aside people, who could kill people at will--then revolutionary war heroes, basically people who were uneducated. 
This is the first post-revolutionary war leadership that has had some Western education, that has some Western understanding. 
China closed itself off from the West after the Boxer Rebellion and because of what happened in the opium trade, never wanting any kind of interaction with the West. 
Now, for the first time, China is open, I believe, to Western values, to Western ideas. I happen to believe it is to our interest. We didn't settle the enormous intellectual property and piracy problems by saying, if you commit a piracy act, you won't have a visa to the United States. We settled it by sending over delegation after delegation of officials to let the Chinese Government know what this was all about, to identify and help identify those factories that were producing illegal goods, and to follow up and see, in fact, that the Chinese Government was willing to take action to shut them down. It has worked. It will be a bumpy road. But cutting off visas of officials isn't the way to handle problems, whether they relate to IPR, whether they relate to technology transfer, whether they relate to other military endeavors or trade matters, I believe. 
I must say, I believe this is the first time in the last year that the administration has really made up their mind that what they are going to do is engage China fully and completely at the top level. I believe it is having enormous dividends and that we will see in the years to come a much more open country, a country that has taken steps to make greater reforms. 
You have to realize that to those of us who sit on the west coast, the Pacific rim is our world of trade. The Pacific rim has by far exceeded the Atlantic Ocean as the major theater of trade. In my State, approximately over a third of the jobs depend on trade with Asia. We want to have positive relations with Asia, positive relations with the Philippines, with Taiwan, with South Korea, with China, with all of the ASEAN countries as well. Increasingly, we have an opportunity, we believe, on the Pacific, to form a Pacific rim community that is peaceful, where trade can take place, where like values can be shared. I must tell you, I buy into that dream. I want to see it happen.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I don't think it is all going to be smooth and all going in one direction. I find the arrest of dissidents in the wake of the President's visit or prior to the President's visit as 100 percent wrong. 
Senator, if there is one thing I have learned about the Chinese, they can be ham-handed in how they function. They can be their own worst enemies in how they handle, because they function under a different, I think, value system in this regard. Sometimes, I believe, it is overreaction. I have read things, and I sit back and say, why did this have to happen? 
Now, let's talk for a moment about forced abortion. I think it is an abysmal practice, it is a barbaric practice. China says they do not countenance and they do not want to permit it. That is the official government policy. Are there occasions where, in this vast country, forced abortion is committed, do I believe? I believe there are instances where forced abortions are, in fact, committed. I also believe, though, that by pointing this out continually, we will see some changes. 
I think it has to be understood that China still has over 100 million people way under the poverty line, some living in caves, some living in the most impoverished circumstances, particularly in western China. It has to be understood that China is a nation of 1.2 billion people, growing rapidly. 
When I first went to China in 1979, what I was told was, what we have for one person must be extended to five people. I have seen since that time the quality of life improving for people. I have seen the easing of restrictions. I have seen the improvement in the dialog. I have seen the stress on education. I have seen the opening of the society. I have to think that is healthy for the society. I think if we engage that society, if we talk with people on equal levels, if we treat China without humiliating China but treat China with equality, that we will see major positive changes in the future. 
So I appreciate the opportunity to have this dialog. I respect your values. I respect what you are trying to do in this regard. I just happen to believe, based on my knowledge, my understanding, and my experience with China and the Chinese people, I believe it would be highly unproductive. 
I just wanted an opportunity to come to the floor and have that opportunity to state my views. I thank the distinguished Senator.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the substitute version of S. 512, The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, which the Senate is considering today. 
On May 20, the Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information, on which I serve as Ranking Member, heard from victims of identity theft from both Subcommittee Chairman Kyl's and my home states. The victims told cautionary tales of lives suddenly, and without warning, turned upside down by the crime of identity theft. 
Theirs are not isolated stories. The Secret Service last year made nearly 9,500 identity theft-related arrests, totaling three-quarters of a billion dollars in losses to individual victims and financial institutions. Such losses have nearly doubled in the last two years, and no end to the trend is in sight. In one out of every ten of these cases, identity theft is used to violate immigration laws, to illegally enter the country or to flee across international borders. 
It used to be that identity theft required wading through dumpsters for discarded credit card receipts. Today, with a few keystrokes, a computer-savvy criminal can hack into databases and lift credit card numbers, social security numbers, and a myriad of personal information. 
The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act does two critical things in the war on identity theft: it gives prosecutors the tools they need, and it recognizes that identity theft victimizes individuals. 
Prosecutors tell us that they lack effective tools to prosecute identity theft and to make victims whole. S. 512 has been drafted in consultation with prosecutors to give them the tools they need. S. 512 does so in a number of important ways: 
It updates pre-computer age laws to criminalize electronic identity theft; 
It stiffens penalties and adds sentencing enhancements that prosecutors tell us they need to effectively prosecute crimes; and 
It allows law enforcement agents to seize equipment used to facilitate identity theft crimes. 
Earlier this month, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the Victim's Rights Amendment to the Constitution, of which I was also proud to be an original cosponsor. Similarly, S. 512 for the first time recognizes that individuals, and not just credit card companies, are victims of identity theft, and it provides them with proper restitution. It protects victims rights, fully recognizing individuals as victims of identity theft, establishing remedies and procedures for such victims, and requiring restitution for the individual victim. 
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge my Senate colleagues to pass it.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, S. 1360, the `Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1998' sponsored by Senator Abraham requires an entry-exit system at air ports by the year 2000 and requires a feasibility study of an entry-exit system for land and sea ports within a year. However, it does not address all the problems for which Section 110 of the 1996 Act was intended. I hope that during conference, we can improve the bill by mandating a workable deadline for creating an entry-exit system at all land and sea ports. 
Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act requires an automated entry-exit system by October 1, 1998. It also requires the Attorney General to identify visa overstays, making the system an integrated part of data collection by the INS. 
The purpose of Section 110 in current law is to fix the problem which exists now. INS says that in FY96, over 24 million non-immigrants came into the U.S. INS also says that they are `unable to calculate overstay rates on nonimmigrants in general or for particular nationalities.' INS also told my staff that they `do not have an estimate' of the average length of overstay for nonimmigrants or know the `destinations of nonimmigrants'. 
The purpose of Section 110 is to make sure INS has the ability, by building an integrated data system at all ports of entry--including air, sea and land ports of entry, in order to know who is coming into the country and who is leaving and more importantly, who is breaking the law by overstaying. 
INS estimates that there are over 5 million illegal aliens in this country and 41% of the illegal alien population is due to visa overstays--that these aliens failed to depart. (source: 1996 Statistical Yearbook of INS). 
In the 1997 report, the INS Inspector General concluded that currently, INS has no real ability to identify the characteristics of the visa overstays which could be used in developing an enforcement strategy that effectively targets visa overstays. It also found that capturing entry-exit information only at airports reveals information about 10% of the nonimmigrants in this country who come through airports. The other 90% come and leave through sea and land ports and therefore, are unknown if there is no entry-exist system at those ports. 
INS' inability to identify visa overstays has greater significance when we add the fact that there are over 4- 5-million border crossing cards which have been issued since 1940's. 
Having an integrated entry-exit system at the land borders is critical in keeping track of all nonimmigrants, those with visas and border crossing cards, providing valuable information for law enforcements, not only to deport visa overstays but in prosecuting those drug runners who provide a critical link into the heartland of America. 
Time has come to fully implement the 1996 Immigration Act. I hope that during conference, we can find a workable deadline for INS to create an entry-exit system at both sea and land ports. Doing a feasibility study is helpful in planning the implementation but without tough mandates to install entry-exit systems--while drug runners go back and forth freely at the Southwest border without law enforcement's knowledge, and while potential terrorists slip in easily through the Canadian border--is not the intent of Section 110 when Congress passed the 1996 Immigration Act last year.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, following my remarks, it will be my intention to offer an amendment to close a gaping loophole in legislation which we passed 4 years ago to make the streets of this country safe. 
That specific legislation was legislation that prohibited the manufacture and sale of 19 commonly used assault weapons, semiautomatic assault weapons, that have been used to kill police, used by grievance killers, used by gangs, used by cartels, used by drive-by shooters. 
The legislation also contained provisions that sought to eliminate the sale and transfer of the high-capacity clips and magazines that would hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. And, in fact, today it is illegal in this country to domestically manufacture and sell a new clip, drum or strip that was made in this country, except to the military, police, or for nuclear power plant protection. It has become evident that though this legislation has been successful in reducing the criminal use of the 19 banned assault weapons, the provisions in this law aimed at reducing the availability of these large-capacity ammunition feeding devices have been rendered ineffective. 
At the request of the distinguished Senator from Idaho, who was on the floor a moment ago, the 1994 law grandfathered existing high-capacity clips which were manufactured before the effective date of the ban to allow those clips which had a bill of lading on them to enter the country and to allow dealers to recover their expenses by selling off their existing stocks. The same thing existed for assault weapons themselves. 
The President and Secretary of the Treasury closed this loophole through his executive decision which used the 1968 law, which said that any weapon imported into this country must meet a sporting use test. And 1.6 million of these semiautomatic assault weapons were essentially cut off from importation. The thrust of the legislation was to eliminate the supply over time --not to prohibit possession, but over time, because there are so many of these weapons and clips in this country now, to cut down on their supply. 
I will never forget, because the distinguished Senator from Idaho did approach me on the floor--we were standing right down in the well; I remember it as clear as if it was yesterday, although it was almost 5 years ago--and indicated that he was concerned about weapons that had a bill of lading on them which had been manufactured pre-assault weapons ban and which were in the process of transit into this country. 
My point, Mr. President, is that now, 4 or 5 years later, the existing supply of these clips surely has been used up. However, foreign clips have continued to pour into the United States. 
From July of 1996 to March of 1998, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms approved 2,500,000 large-capacity clips for importation into this country. 
Recently, that number has skyrocketed even further. In just the last 5 months, BATF has approved permits for 8.1 million large-capacity clips for importation into America. That represents a 314-percent increase in one-fourth of the time. 
These clips have been approved to come through at least 20 different countries. It is difficult to know the place of manufacture, but they come through 20 different countries into this country. 
I would like to just quickly go through the countries that they come through. And there are some interesting things. Austria, Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, England--and clips manufactured somewhere abroad come through Great Britain; there are actually 250-round magazines--250-round magazines--for sale in this country and 177-round magazines for sale in this country--Germany, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Nicaragua, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Zimbabwe. 
So the total is 8.8 million in two years approved to come in. 
Unfortunately, there is virtually no reliable method to determine the date of manufacture on the millions of clips that the BATF has estimated are in circulation now in the United States. The inability to determine the date of manufacture is particularly true regarding the foreign importation of large-capacity magazines because BATF has no ability to independently determine whether such clips imported into the country are legal or illegal. It has allowed the continued importation of clips represented to be manufactured before the assault weapons ban took place. 
Let me show you how this happened. Here is a clip from Shotgun News, dated February 1998: `Banned semiautomatics, Bulgarian SLR 95. 1 free 40-rd magazine with each purchase.' 
Here is another one: `Quality replacements, 30 rounds, the choice of the Canadian military. Will not bend or rust, $8.99 a clip.' 
Here is where you see the impact of, now, the foreign rounds: `30-rd East German'--East German-made--`Ribbed back, AK-47 magazines, $7.99.' 
Here is one: An `AK magazine special,' coming with the pouch, `including 4 Chinese AK-47 30-rd magazines with pouch, 
$27.50.' It also includes `four East German AK-47, 20 rd magazines with a pouch, $29.95.' 
Now, my staff called a shotgun store and asked to buy some of these magazines. The only question he was asked, `Is it legal to buy this stuff where you are'--he was in Washington, DC, where it is not legal to own a gun, and he said, `I don t know, as far as I know it is,' and they said, `We will send it to you.' 
My point is, you can get these big clips very easily--on the phone, by mail order. And because now the supply of the domestic clips is running out, most of the clips being sold in this country are of foreign manufacture. So we have two sets. We have the domestic manufacturers prohibited. We have the sale and transfer of new clips prohibited. And you have the grandfather clause creating this gigantic loophole which allows these big clips to continue to come into the country. 
In April of this year, President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Rubin closed one loophole created by this grandfather clause by blocking further importation of modified semiautomatic assault weapons. About 30 of us sent him a letter. We pointed out there were 1.6 million of these which received approval that were coming in from all over the world. The Treasury Department looked at the 1968 law, which requires all imported weapons to meet a sporting test, and decided that they don't meet this sporting test, and therefore the Executive order is in place and this importation has been prohibited. The remaining loophole to close is this loophole for the big clips. The amendment that we will shortly offer will do just that. 
So the change to the law that I have proposed is simple: It would bar further imports of large-capacity clips and magazines, just as U.S. domestic manufacturers have been stopped from producing these magazines. This amendment would not--I repeat, not--ban further domestic sales and possession of large-capacity clips which are already legally in the United States. There are tens of millions of these already. 
Now, let's talk about who uses these high-capacity clips. I pointed out, coming through Great Britain, there were ammunition-feeding devices carrying 250 rounds. You can expel 250 rounds before you have to reload. Do hunters use them? Do marksmen use them? Do skeet shooters use them? Do Olympic team members use them? 
Let's take hunters. The answer is no, hunters don't use them. Most States limit the magazine capacity allowed for hunting, usually eight rounds or less. Federal law clearly outlines the ammunition magazine size limits for bird shooting. Federal law does not allow the use of a shotgun that has a capacity of more than three shells--one in the chamber and two in the magazine--when hunting migratory game birds. 
How about the Olympic team and other competitive shooters? No. 
So who really uses these large-capacity clips? Let me read a list of events that have taken place fairly recently. July, 1998, earlier this month, Rio Hondo, TX, a killing spree leaves five dead, including two Border Patrol officers. In one day, 24-year-old Ernest Moore killed four people in what police called a planned situation. He killed two people and wounded another in a private residence. Police at the scene recovered an MK-70 assault rifle and a 30-round clip. Approximately 30 minutes later, Moore fired as many as 100 rounds at law enforcement officers from a .223-caliber assault rifle. Two Border Patrol agents were killed at the scene and a sheriff's deputy was wounded. 
That is who uses these big clips. 
June 17, Coeur d'Alene, ID: A State trooper ambushed by merciless assassin. State trooper Linda Huff was ambushed and killed by a man wielding a 9-millimeter pistol with a 15-round clip. Police were not immediately certain why 34-year-old Scott David Yeager bicycled to the police station and fired 17 rounds at Huff in the rear parking lot. Investigators say Yeager fired all 15 rounds from one 15-round clip, disposed of it, reloaded, and continued to fire. 
In May of this year, Springfield, OR: A 50-round clip. High school student kills four, injures dozens. After killing his parents, went on a shooting spree at his high school--most of us are familiar with this. To carry out his fatal assault, he used a Ruger 10.22 hunting rifle, a Ruger .22 caliber handgun and a Glock model 19. Found attached to the rifle, a traditional hunting gun, was an empty 50-round clip and found on the student were four 30-round clips and two 20-round clips. During the attack, he fired from the rifle indiscriminately, and it was not until he emptied the 50-round clip that several of his classmates were able to tackle and subdue him. 
In March of this year, Jonesboro, AR: 15-round clips. Two middle school students ambush classmates. Two students, age 11 and age 13, pulled the fire alarm in their school in order to draw their classmates outside. The boys lay in wait and ambushed the other students when they got outside. They fired 24 shots into the crowd, 15 of which came from a Universal carbine rifle with a 15-round clip. The shots from the rifle were fired as fast as the shooter could pull the trigger. 
February of this year, New Orleans, LA: A 30-round clip. Police recover 30-round clip after chase. After a routine traffic stop, a man led police on a 3-mile chase during which he pointed a 9-millimeter assault pistol with a 30-round clip. 
And then it goes on and on and on. Elmhurst, NY, 30-round clip. Indianapolis, 30-round clip; traffic stop pulls the weapon. Orange, CA, 30-round clip; disgruntled employee kills five with 30-round clip; five people were killed, and a police officer was seriously wounded when a disgruntled Caltrans employee began randomly firing from an AK-47S with a 30-round clip. Denver, CO, last November, police officer killed by SKS with a 30-round clip; Denver police officer Bruce VanderJagt was killed by a barrage of gunfire from an SKS assault rifle as he chased a burglary suspect; police later recovered the rifle and the 30-round clip. Magna, UT, police officers shot by SKS with 20-round clip. 
It goes on and on and on. The point is, there are so many of these big clips available in this Nation that they become the ammunition-feeding device of choice for the grievance killer, the person going up against police, the gang that wants to engage in intimidation, drive-by shootings, the cartels--these are the weapons of choice, and the weapons of choice are useless if you don't have that big-round clip. 
What are we seeing? Five months and 8.1 million of these receiving approval to come into this country because BATF could not assert when they were manufactured. BATF can't go to another country to check a factory supply. Therefore, an understanding that I have with the distinguished Senator from Idaho--and I am pleased he is on the floor now; these would apply to clips or weapons that had bills of lading attached to them--is clearly not the case today. Bills of lading that preexisted a 4-year-old piece of legislation now. The time has come to close this grandfather clause. 
Now, a number of the tragedies that I have just indicated probably would have occurred without the availability of killer clips. Some are fond of saying, `Guns don't kill, people do.' Yes, that is true. But I don't think ever before in the history of this Nation we have ever had a time when more weapons of destruction were falling into the hands of children. 
The case that really struck me was a case in Memphis, TN, when a 5-year-old took a loaded weapon to school to kill a teacher who had given that youngster a `time out' the day before. 
All we are trying to do is close the grandfather clause, say all of the clips that were in transit on the day we passed this legislation, 4 years ago, have been used up, and now is the time to close the loophole. 
Interestingly enough, some have told me, and Members of this body have told me, `Well, we know people who like to use them plinking.' They told me, `Yes, I like to use them plinking.' Well, we are not taking away anybody's right to possess or to plink. There are plenty of clips around for plinking. What we are trying to do is stop what is now a massive flood of clips, even those that now carry 250 rounds in these magazines, from coming into this country. 
I don't like to do this amendment, frankly, this day, because this is a solemn day and I don't like to mix the two. Unfortunately, the Treasury-Postal bill is on the floor at this time, and this is an opportunity to move the amendment. 
I hope that those who know the intent of the grandfather clause to only affect those guns and clips that were in transit at the time of the enactment of the legislation--something that I agreed to because I thought it was fair--will agree to let this legislation go into place. It will not take a clip out of anyone's hands; it will not prohibit possession. Domestic manufacturers of ammunition feeding devices, today, cannot manufacture clips for general sale that are in excess of 10 bullets. We know they are not used in hunting, but we do know that in case after case they are used to kill police officers, they are used to kill employees, used by grievance killers, drive-by shooters, drug gangs, cartels, etc. The real question in my mind is: Do the rights of the majority outweigh the rights of those few who would like to plink, who would like to continue the flood of weapons coming into this country? There is no civilized, industrialized power on Earth in which there are more weapons or in which there are more of these big clips floating around. 
The instant case that really jettisoned me into the assault weapons legislation was the 1994 case of Luigi Ferri, who had Tec-9 copycats and a 9 millimeter pistol. When he went into 101 California Street, this was his array of ammunition-feeding devices that he brought with him. He carried with him 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25--25 different ammunition feeding devices, with enough rounds that exceeded 500 rounds. I think it was actually over a thousand rounds of ammunition used to do his dastardly deed. Indeed, he left 8 people dead and about 14 people wounded. And no one could get to him to disarm him. In this case, I don't know whether these are domestic or foreign made clips. 
The point I want to make is that the large number, the incredible fire power and the lack of sanity seemed to prevail.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, my heart goes out to the families of the two officers slain in Friday's brutal shooting. These two men will be forever known for their bravery, courage and heroism in laying down their lives to protect all of us who pass through the halls of the United States Capitol. 
The Capitol police officers, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, made the ultimate sacrifice that any person can give in laying down their lives so that others would be spared. Their actions demonstrated the highest form of bravery, selflessness, and professionalism. 
We must all remember that the price of democracy is indeed, a high one. At times, the openness of our government is sometimes challenged by events like those that took place this past Friday. But even though our democracy sometimes seems fragile when challenged by senseless violence, we must all do our part to ensure that this type of violence never happens again. I am confident we will take those steps as a nation. 
I had just landed in Colorado when I learned what had happened in the Capitol building. When my plane arrived, I received an emergency call from my office informing me of the tragic events. In an instant, my mind fell back to November 28th, 1978 when in City Hall in San Francisco the double assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk took place. I knew the terrible anguish--even anger--that accompanies events like this one. 
This event also shows the depth to which America's infatuation with weapons can lead to tragedy. Not only do we now see youngsters shooting other youngsters, but also the unthinkable slayings in what should be one of the safest places in our nation, the United States Capitol. In this very difficult time, I am proud to say that Officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson will always be remembered as American heroes.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. President, I am really disappointed that this program is being ramrodded through on an appropriations bill. This program represents a huge new immigration program and no one should think to the contrary. 
Fifty percent of all the people that are going to come in from other countries under this program will go to one State--California. California has not been afforded the time to do the analysis to see how this program would affect it. This program is a Trojan horse. 
When I heard the testimony on a registry program on the Judiciary Committee I thought, `Great idea; I want to support it.' When the Senators made the announcement, I was a cosponsor. Then I saw that attached to the concept of the registry program was also a huge immigration program with no controls whatever, no way of asserting whether individuals go back, and as a matter of fact--and I will explain that shortly--setting up incentives for these people to remain in the country in a legal status. In California, this will mean literally tens of thousands of additional immigrants coming into the State. We currently have 2 million people in California in illegal status. This will only add to the number of illegal status. 
Let me say how this will happen. Under the amendment, if the Department of Labor cannot find American workers--and there is no registry in place in California--this bill will go into play. The large agricultural associations will apply for 20,000, 30,000 permits at a time. The Department of Labor has 7 days to respond to that. If they don't respond to that huge number in that period of time, the permits are authorized and the foreign workers come in. There is no way of knowing who they are, whether they have any bona fide documents. 
Additionally, once a worker is in this country for 10 months, they can apply for a 3-year extension. Therefore, you effectively are granting a stay of 3 years to someone who comes in. They then should return, and if they come back for one more year, they are here for all time. They gain legal status under this program. There are no caps on any numbers being brought in. 
The major part of concern in this bill--and I want this in the Record, is section 6(b)1, the application to the Secretary of State that sets up this 7-day period when the employer submits the application for alien workers directly to the Secretary of State with a copy of the application provided to the Attorney General seeking the issuance of visas and the admission of aliens for employment in the job opportunities for which the employer has not received referral of registered workers. 
Then there is an expedited consideration by the Secretary of 5 days. 
It is physically impossible to consider 20 or 30,000 applications in 5 days. It is set up to permit the entry of large numbers of people about whom nothing will be known--whether they really will go home, whether they really will stay at the job, work at the job. I think this is going to make the Bracero Program look good in retrospect. 
Now, what I object to is I would like to vote for something that would help what is becoming an increasing problem. That increasing problem is that increasingly farmers cannot find adequate labor to harvest their crops. In our State, you have these counties with 20 percent and 30 percent unemployment rates. It is amazing, but it is true. Unemployment rate is high, but the farmer cannot find the help. This is where the registry was supposed to help. But the registry and the importation program go into effect simultaneously. Consequently, if there is nobody on the registry, you have the opening to import 20, 30, 50, 75,000 workers with no limit. That is what I had hoped we would have the time to work out. We don't know whether the housing allowance will work in California. California isn't Oregon. Costs are much higher. Housing is unavailable.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What this does, and I quote from the amendment: 
Independent contractors, agricultural associations and such similar entities shall be subject to a cap on the number of H2-A visas that they may sponsor at the discretion of the Secretary of Labor. 
This would give the Secretary of Labor the opportunity to see that there is a reasonable number attached to this limited processing time because with the limited processing time, if you apply for 50,000 people, as could well be the case in California, you would not be able to meet the processing deadline.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
I compliment both Senators for this legislation. I think it is common sense. I think it is long overdue. 
I most profoundly disagree with the Senator from Idaho. If the gun is under lock and key, the owner is exempt from criminal liability. Let me repeat that. If the gun is under lock and key, the owner is exempt from criminal liability. 
On Monday, a 4-year-old boy in Maryland was shot with his grandfather's .22 caliber handgun. The gun was loaded. It was not equipped with a trigger lock. The children were playing with the gun. The gun discharged and struck the 4-year-old in the face. 
Fortunately, the boy was not seriously injured and is expected to recover. 
On Tuesday, unfortunately, 61 Senators voted against a common-sense requirement to require handgun manufacturers to include childproof trigger locks with every handgun they sell. A simply safety requirement that would help to stop the growing number of accidental gun-related injuries and deaths that involve children every year. 
In my view, the sharp contrast between these two events is striking. One day, a child is shot in the face because the gun he and his playmates find does not have a trigger lock. The next day, the Senate votes against requiring all guns to be sold with trigger locks. 
What is the matter when we cannot fulfill our basic responsibility to keep children safe from the dangers of irresponsible gun ownership? 
I believe that the legislation currently before us authored by Senators Durbin and Chafee, offers an excellent avenue for ensuring that gun owners who allow children access to their guns are held liable when their negligence leads to death or injury. 
The bipartisan Child Firearm Access Prevention Act will keep kids from taking guns owned by adults and, either purposely or accidentally, killing or injuring themselves or another person. 
The legislation puts the burden on the adults who own the guns to store their guns in a safe and secure manner--with a trigger lock, a combination lock, in a gun safe, or in a lock box. 
If an adult who owns a gun chooses to store the firearm in a loaded condition--unlocked and unsafe--and a child uses that gun to kill or injure someone or exhibits that 
firearm in a public place, then that adult can be imprisoned for 1 year and fined as much as $10,000. 
The need for this legislation should be entirely obvious. I would wager that there is not a single Senator who hasn't heard of the parade of senseless violence that has plagued our nation's schools. 
Some recent incidents include: 
Barry Loukaitas, 14, February 2, 1996, Moses Lake, Washington: Allegedly shot and killed two students and a teacher at his school. In his confession Barry said he got two of his guns from an unlocked cabinet in his house and one from the family car. 
Evan Ramsey, 17, February 19, 1997, Bethel, Alaska: Shot and killed a student and a principal, and wounded two other students, at his high school. According to police, the gun Evan used was kept unlocked at the foot of the stairs in his house. 
Luke Woodham, 16, October 1, 1997, Pearl, Mississippi: Allegedly stabbed his mother and then shot nine students, killing two, at his high school. 
Michael Carneal, 14, December 1, 1997, West Paducah, Kentucky: Accused of killing three students and wounding five students who were participating in a high school prayer circle. 
Andrew Golden, 11, and Mitchell Johnson, 13, March 24, 1998, Jonesboro, Arkansas: Accused of shooting to death four girls and a teacher, and wounding ten, at his school. The boys took the guns they used in the crime from Andrew's grandfather who said he usually kept his guns unlocked in the house. 
Andrew Wurst, 14, April 24, 1998, Edinboro, Pennsylvania: Shot a teacher to death at a school dance. 
Jacob Davis, 18, Fayetteville, Tennessee, May 19, 1998: Allegedly shot and killed a high school classmate. 
Kipland `Kip' Kinkel, 15, Springfield, Oregon, May 21, 1998: Shooting spree at both home and school which left four dead and twenty-two injured. 
In all, these tragedies total 20 deaths and 48 injuries. 
Other non-fatal incidents include: 
A 5-year-old kindergarten student in Memphis who took a loaded .25-caliber pistol to school because he wanted to kill his teacher for putting him in a `timeout', 
A police officer's 10-year-old son who was arrested when he took an unloaded, semiautomatic pistol to school in his bookbag, 
A 15-year-old high school student who was arrested when authorities confiscated 20 pistols, rifles, and shotguns from his home after the boy threatened his 9th grade teacher, 
And a 16-year-old boy, suspended from school for vandalism, who was caught by authorities on campus with a .22-caliber revolver in his front pocket. 
Indeed, the scope of this problem is reaching epic proportions. 
The National School Safety Center indicates that, during the 1997-1998 school year, there were 41 school-associated violent deaths in the United States. That's nearly a 61 percent increase from the year before when there were 25 such incidents. 
And it's no wonder the incidents of school violence are increasing. A 1998 study by the National Center for Education Statistics and the Bureau of Justice showed that, of 10,000 students surveyed, 1,200 students knew someone who had taken a gun to school. It is amazing to me that, given the large number of students who have taken guns to school, there haven't been even more gun related deaths in our schools. 
Since the National School Safety Center began keeping track of school-associated violent deaths in July 1992, there have been 227 students who have died on campus. 53 of them--nearly 1 out of every 4--were from my home state of California. 
In fact, the problem of gun fire on campuses has gotten so bad that students in some California schools practice `duck and cover' drills much in the same way that students in the 1950's and 1960's practiced taking cover during nuclear air-raid drills. 
An article in the Los Angeles Times last August detailed how the threat of gun fire has become like the new nuclear threat looming over today's elementary, middle, and high school students. 
The article reads: `They're called drop drills, crisis drills, and even bullet drills. In many schools, a special alarm sounds, as it would during an actual nearby shooting. Teachers shout `Drop!' and students duck under their desks or sprawl on the ground, covering their heads. Many schools also immediately initiate a lock-down during the drill, as they would with a shooting, sealing the campus off from the violence outside.' 
And it continues: `The drop procedure was used by students at Figueroa Street Elementary School in February 1996 when teacher Alfredo Perez was hit by a stray bullet. Perez's fifth-graders ducked when the bullet flew through the window, and then they crawled out of the room and stayed on the floor until teachers told them they could get up. 
Principal Rosemary Lucente credits the drop bill, which they practice at least once a month, with keeping the students out of further danger.' 
And so it has come to this. Our students are forced to practice duck and cover drills because their schools have gotten too hazardous for them to focus on what they're there for in the first place which is to learn. 
When the situation has gotten that bad it is my view that it is our responsibility to try and help provide some sanity in our schools and protect children from guns. 
We can do that by holding adults who own guns responsible if their careless storage of dangerous firearms results in the threat of death or injury. What's more, we must also encourage parents to spend more time with their children, to reconnect with them, to teach them that guns are not toys, and to teach them the difference between right and wrong. 
Opponents of this bill will argue that it won't solve all the problems of kids with guns, that it won't stop kids from getting killed or injured by firearms. Frankly, I don't know if that's true or not. But I do know that one thing this legislation will do is it will force adults to be more safe and more responsible with their guns and that will save lives. 
I support this legislation whole-heartedly and I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to do the same.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kyl Amendment, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. I am an original cosponsor of S. 474, on which this amendment is based. 
This amendment takes important steps to address the dangerous, billion-dollar-a-year threat to our communities and our laws of Internet gambling. 
The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information, on which I serve as Ranking Member, held hearings on the subject of Internet gambling in March of last year. At that time, I joined Senator Kyl in introducing S. 474, on which this amendment is based. The bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee by voice vote in October of last year. 
Since that time, this proposal has been carefully fine-tuned to address concerns raised by various groups. 
This proposal enjoys the support of a wide range of groups, including law enforcement, family and consumer advocates, and professional and amateur athletics. 
Most importantly, FBI Director Louis Freeh, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, when asked if the FBI supports the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, Prohibition Act, replied, `Yes, I think it's a very effective change. We certainly support it.' 
Similarly, the National Association of Attorneys General explained why such legislation is important in letters to the Senate Judiciary Committee and to the full Senate. The State Attorneys General wrote: 
[M]ore than any other area of the law, gambling has traditionally been regulated on a state-by-state basis, with little uniformity and minimal federal oversight. 
The availability of gambling on the Internet, however, threatens to disrupt each state's careful balancing of its own public welfare and fiscal concerns, by making gambling available across state and national boundaries, with little or no regulatory control. 
This amendment brings our laws on gambling up to date with advances in technology. It ensures that the new medium of the Internet will not prove to be the latest frontier of illegal gambling. 
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, and I am proud to support this amendment, to provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to keep the Internet free of the scourge of illegal gambling. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the bi-partisan leaders of the appropriations subcommittee, Chairman Gregg and Senator Hollings, for providing adequate funding to allow the Census Bureau's census 2000 plan to proceed. The funding will permit the census professionals to continue their plan to guarantee that everyone in every city and rural area will be counted. 
I ask that when this Appropriations bill goes to conference with the House that the Senate conferees stand united against any effort to reduce the decennial census funding level or micro-manage the professional census gathering process. 
I am very concerned about the critical 2000 census, because I believe Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings will face a difficult conference with the House. Contrary to the Senate plan, the House funds the Census Bureau for only six months, crippling the bureau and denying the census professionals the tools they believe will help them conduct the most accurate 2000 census possible. 
The House leadership has also challenged the Census Bureau sampling plan in federal court, asserting it violates the United States Constitution. The federal court should proceed with their review, but the Census Bureau professionals need to proceed with their plan, which represents the best efforts of census professionals and academics to measure the population. 
Before we look forward to conference, I would like to briefly look back and put the current sampling dispute in its historical context. Regrettably, the public debate over the 2000 census has been dominated by the use of sampling, a simple, statistical method proposed by the Census Bureau to count the historically `difficult to count' populations of the nation's urban and rural poor. The Bureau's sampling plan was developed in direct response to the unprecedented census error rates in 1990, the first census in US history to be both more costly and less accurate than the census that preceded it. 
Why is an accurate census important for the nation? The decennial census is the basis for distributing funds throughout the country for more than one hundred federal programs. 
Is the local police force eligible for federal grants for cops on the beat or drug education programs? Check the census, which sets eligibility for Byrne grants, DARE funds or community policing grants. 
How about education funds for schools? The census determines title one or title two education grants. 
How about funds for homelessness, mass transit or other transportation funds? Again, the census determines state and local government eligibility for Social Services block grant money, highway and mass transit grants. 
What about health care for low-income families? Again, the census helps set state Medicaid reimbursement levels. 
The census is instrumental for the effective administration of government at all levels, providing the basis for distributing billions of dollars throughout the country through hundreds of programs. The nation cannot afford the error rates and inaccuracy experienced in the 1990 census. 
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded the 1990 census failed to count about 15 million Americans, while an additional 11 million Americans were double-counted. The California population was undercounted by more than 2.7%, representing 20% of the nation's net undercount. 
If we squander this opportunity for reform and the 2000 census proves to be equally inaccurate as its 1990 predecessor, between 5 and 6 million individuals, would be `missed.' If we do not reform our census plan, 1 to 1.2 million Californians, 3% of the state's population, will fail to be counted. If the census misses 1 million people in California, about 300,000 children will not be counted, depressing state education funding and seriously compromising education in the state. 
Mr. President, concerns for undercounting the United States population are as old as the nation itself. Thomas Jefferson, transmitting the first census to President Washington, commented, `we know in fact that the omissions have been very great.' However, the Census Bureau sampling plan, which enjoys the support of the National Academy of Sciences, academics and census professionals, is a reasoned response to the unprecedented error rates of the 1990 census. Congress cannot make the same mistake again. 
The Census Bureau plan needs to go forward. It's time to allow the census professionals to implement their best plan to improve on the 1990 undercount and deliver the most accurate 2000 census possible. 
I thank the chairman, Senator Gregg, and ranking Democrat, Senator Hollings, for their efforts and extend my continuing support.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, at the end of this week, Vice President Gore is scheduled to depart for Moscow to conduct meetings in preparation for a summit meeting between President Clinton and President Yeltsin in September. I believe this meeting and the future summit is really long overdue and extraordinarily important. I would like to take a few minutes to speak about the relationship between our country and the new Russia. 
United States-Russian relations today stand at a critical juncture. It has been almost a decade since the end of the cold war, and although we have made great strides in reestablishing the friendship that characterized relations between our two countries in the recent past, we have yet to establish the basis for the kind of partnership that is adequate to guide our two nations into the next century. 
The Russian Federation is nearly twice the size of the continental United States. It covers 11 time zones, with a population of close to 150 million people. Lest we not forget, Russia is a country with a nuclear arsenal capable of annihilating the Earth many times over. 
Few countries on this Earth have undergone the sort of wrenching political, economic, and social transformation that Russia is now going through. While China has moved slowly and carefully to release centralized control over its economy, the Russian model has moved rapidly, in a macro way, to embrace both economic and social democracy. 
Today, Russia remains fragile. The United States has a huge stake in what happens now. Our goal must be to see that Russia remains a stable, modern state, democratic in its governance, abiding by its constitution and its laws, market-oriented and prosperous in its economic development, at peace with itself and with the rest of the world. A Russia that reflects these aspirations is likely to be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem, to world peace. 
Conversely, a Russia that erects barriers against what it sees as a hostile world, that believes the best defense is a good offense--such a Russia could be in the 21st century just as it was for much of the 20th century--one of the biggest problems the United States and the rest of the world will face. 
Russia may be down as a major power, but it is far from out. Although it is all too easy for some to look at Russia today and conclude that it is not a country that demands attention as a top U.S. foreign policy priority, that, in my mind, would be a grievous error in judgment. To place United States-Russian relations in a secondary category of concern is a surefire recipe for disaster. The United States has an enormous stake in the outcome of the present Russian struggle for democracy and free markets. 
I believe that it is in Russia's own interests to conduct a concerted effort against the antidemocratic forces and the ultra nationalistic ones, against crime and corruption and, yes, against old Soviet attitudes and habits. This is the course which the government of President Yeltsin has undertaken, and he has done it despite many impediments that still stand in the way. 
Too often we have been quick to point out the shortcomings and imperfections of the Yeltsin government and of Russia--and as recent questions regarding Russian assistance to the Iranian missile program indicate, there is some reason for deep concern. 
I am fully supportive of the President's decision last week to sanction nine Russian companies for cooperation with Iran. In my mind, Russia's assistance to Iran indicates just how far Russia has yet to travel if it wants to be a full partner with the United States in the international community. But I must also note that the cooperation that Russia now provides is a welcome reversal of its stance of a few years ago. I hope that this new level of cooperation is a major harbinger of things to come. 
Indeed, for those who care to look, there have been many positive developments in Russia over the past years--positive developments that include President Yeltsin's constitutionally based election and reelection in 1996, the defeat of hyperinflation, the end of the war in Chechnya in 1997, the signing of the NATO-Russia Founding Act, and successful Russian participation in joint peacemaking operations in Bosnia. 
Russia has also made enormous strides in integrating into global economic and regional economic institutions, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Council of Europe, the Paris Club, and more. Russia has strengthened its ties to the European Union and is active in the United Nations and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
That is not to say Russian reform has scored a knockout blow against crime and corruption, or that the Russian economy is home free. In fact, the current economic crisis and resulting political instability presents the new democracy with its greatest challenge to date. 
The package agreed to last week by Russia and the International Monetary Fund provides significant funding, we hope, to stabilize the Russian economy, and it contains major fiscal reform elements, including tax reform, some of which are going to be put in place, as well as far-reaching structural reforms to increase growth and free-market competition. It represents an important pledge by Russia to continue the development of a free-market democracy, and it is an important vote by the international community in the importance of this new Russia. 
Russia may still be struggling, but it is my belief that it is on the cusp of a constructive interaction in the international community as a democracy. This must be encouraged. As one analyst wrote about World War II era Germany and Japan, `There are no dangerous peoples; there are only dangerous situations, which are the result, not of laws of nature or history, or of national character or charter, but of political arrangements.'  
In Russia today, there is a growing ultranationalism which represents a major threat to its progress as a democracy, and we must be cognizant of that. 
It will take courage for Russia to look to the future positively, to abandon obsolete thinking, to reassess its national security needs and interests in light of new alliances. It will require a high level of determination and hard work by our country to work with Russia to develop these institutions, institutions which can encourage the growth of democracy and free markets and lead to a more stable and cooperative and prosperous new Russia. 
But if future generations are to be spared the danger, the expense, and the terror faced by my generation in dealing with Russia, if we are truly to reap the benefits of the end of the cold war, we cannot stand by and wait to see whether democracy and free markets will survive in Russia. 
In more concrete terms, I believe that the time is ripe for a full-scale, high-level, new initiative towards Russia as we approach the 21st century. 
The Vice President's trip and this September's summit, I hope, will contribute greatly toward this process, but the Senate bears a special responsibility for the conduct of our Nation's foreign policy. We must play a role, too. 
This initiative, I believe, should focus on ways in which the United States can work effectively with the new Russia to strengthen and encourage democratization; to support efforts by the IMF and the international community to assist Russia's economy to make the full transition to free markets; to examine and revise outdated legislation which has created roadblocks and bottlenecks in United States-Russian relations and which place United States firms doing business in Russia at a competitive disadvantage; to provide help in the fight against corruption and organized criminal enterprise in Russia; to expedite existing United States resources now available through OPIC, the Eximbank, and other financial institutions through the development of fast-track type programs which cut red tape for worthy business projects and investments; to encourage and expand existing academic, cultural, and other exchange programs, including those between the Congress and the Duma which aim to support Russia's reformers; and, finally, to work to fully integrate Russia as an equal partner in the international political, economic, and security institutions. 
We must understand how the right kind of foreign assistance can play a crucial role in assuring Russian economic growth and vitality. And we must understand how our assistance can help create the ability for Russia to consolidate its gains and provide the opportunity for Russia to work out its national identity and destiny in ways which will complement American interests. 
None of this will be easy and all of it will require sustained effort. To that end, the Vice President's trip this week is a first major step. And to that end also, I hope to be able to work with the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee of this body to conduct hearings to examine the nature and future direction of United States policy toward Russia. From these hearings I hope we can develop legislation to address United States policy in the areas I have outlined above, and to strengthen United States-Russian ties in an appropriate way. 
I deeply believe that this relationship needs the most intensive concern and interaction at the present time. We must give Russia both time and opportunity to consolidate the reforms that constitute the good news of the past few years, to work with them to beat back the forces that threaten this progress, and to assist them to become a stable, prospering, democratic republic which can be a partner for world peace in the next century. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.  
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the India-Pakistan Relief Act, which I am cosponsoring with my colleague from Kansas. 
Even as we have implemented a strict regime of sanctions on India and Pakistan as called for by law, it is my belief that we must also look to the future and to creating the sort of environment which will allow the United States to engage India and Pakistan in a positive relationship and to restore stability to South Asia. 
To that end, this Amendment does something very simple, and something much needed. It is also something which I believe the great majority of this body supports. 
The Amendment provides the President with the discretion to waive the application of any sanction or prohibition, for a period of 1 year. It contains an exception for those sanctions dealing with dual-use exports or military sales, which will remain off-limits. 
Before the waiver authority is exercised, the President is required to consult with Congress. 
And, prior to the expiration of the waiver authority granted in this Amendment, the Secretary of State must report to Congress on developments in India and Pakistan. 
This last point is crucial. The waiver authority granted in this Amendment is limited to 1 year. Should India and Pakistan prove to be unwilling to resolve their differences--should the Secretary be unable to report on substantial and significant progress--this Amendment will sunset, and the current sanctions will go back into effect. 
It is my belief that the President be given flexibility to use and shape sanctions as most appropriate to attempt to create a positive and constructive environment for the resolution of political and security problems in South Asia. Our current sanctions policy does not provide for that flexibility. 
In fact, without this flexibility it is difficult to conceive how the United States can play a positive and constructive role in attempting to head off a potential nuclear arms race in South Asia or to restore stability to the region. 
Indeed, the Administration currently has a high-level delegation, headed by Deputy Secretary Talbott, en route to the region to continue talks with India and Pakistan and to continue discussions on bringing the current crisis to a close. 
Hopefully, this Amendment will send a positive signal to India and Pakistan that the United States is interested in working with them to resolve their problems, and will provide our negotiators with the leverage that they need if they are to have success in moving the process in a positive direction. 
This Amendment structures U.S. policy to secure commitments from India and Pakistan to make real and meaningful progress in rolling back the current crisis, to settle their differences, and to bring peace to South Asia. 
Although we do not spell out explicit conditions that India and Pakistan must meet in this Amendment, it is my hope and belief that the flexibility that this Amendment introduces will allow the Administration to work with India and Pakistan to take necessary actions to resolve their political and security differences, including ceasing any further nuclear tests; engaging in a high-level dialogue, putting confidence and security building measures in place; and, take steps to roll-back their nuclear programs and come into compliance with internationally accepted norms on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
Indeed, my support of this Amendment lies, in part, in my belief that this is that path that India and Pakistan themselves have indicated that they would like to pursue. 
Both India and Pakistan have made statements indicating that they will refrain from future testing. Both have indicated that they are prepared to consider joining the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And, in a message to the Security Council on July 9, Secretary General Annan wrote that `I have been encouraged by indications from both sides of their readiness to enter into dialogue addressing peace and security matters and causes of tension, including Kashmir.' 
In South Asia today it appears to be too late to talk about preventing the capability of developing nuclear weapons. As I stated on this floor immediately following the first Indian nuclear test, the international community cannot successfully impose nonproliferation policies on South Asia. Ultimately, India and Pakistan must determine for themselves that their own interests are best served by ridding South Asia of weapons of mass destruction--and not by turning the region into a potential nuclear battleground. 
The United States, however, must seek ways to work with India and Pakistan to help them reach that determination. It is my belief that this Amendment serves to structure our policies to make that outcome more likely. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this Amendment.

Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 
today Senator D'Amato, Senator Ford and I are introducing a bill to require health insurance plans to cover the length of hospital stay for any procedure or illness as determined by the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate. 
This bill will return medical decision-making to medical professionals because it is time to stop insurance plans' interference into this important area of physician decision-making. 
It is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Psychological Association. Only a physician, taking care of the patient who understands the patient's history, medical condition and needs, can make a decision on how much hospital care a person needs. Physicians are trained to evaluate all the unique needs and problems of each individual patient. Every patient is different and the course of illness has great variation. 
Lengths of stay should not be determined by insurance company clerks, actuaries or non-medical personnel. It is the attending physician, not a physician or other representative of an insurance company, that should decide when to admit and discharge someone. 
Professional physician organizations develop practice guidelines that guide them in determining medical necessity. These are intended as guidance and are medical judgments made by qualified medical people. Physicians know what medical necessity and generally accepted medical practice are. 
We are introducing this bill because we have had a virtual parade of doctors come to us and in essence say, `We are fed up. We spend too much of our time trying to justify our decisions on medical necessity to insurance companies. Insurance company rules have supplanted doctor decision making.' 
Donna Damico, a nurse in a Maryland psychiatric unit of a hospital, told National Public Radio on October 1, 1997: 
I spend my days watching the care on my unit be directed by faceless people from insurance companies on the other end of the phone. My hospital employs a full-time nurse whose entire job is to talk to insurance reviewers. . . . The reviewer's background can range anywhere from high school graduate to nurse, social worker or even actual physicians. 
A number of examples have come to my attention: 
In 1996, we addressed the problem of `drive-through' baby deliveries, insurance plans covering minimal hospital stays for newborns and their mothers because of examples like this: One California new mother was readmitted after a Caesarean section because of severe anemia from excessive blood loss. She didn't know how much blood loss was normal after a delivery. Two California women were readmitted after vaginal deliveries with endometritis, an infection of the uterus. 
We've had examples of `drive-through' mastectomies, insurance plans shoving women out the door to deal on their own with drainage tubes, pain and disfigurement. S. 249, which I introduced with Senator D'Amato last year, addresses that abuse and we are trying to get it passed.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join with those who have congratulated the committee for what I consider to be really a fine higher education bill. I want to extend my personal congratulations, representing Californians, both to the chairman and the ranking member of this committee. 
This is a bill that really meets the needs of the day with respect to higher education. And I think we can all, hopefully, support it with great pride and enthusiasm. 
I have been very involved in education in California because I have seen this great State, once in the lead, sink to below 
mediocrity in terms of its K-through-12 education system. And there are many reasons for it that the Federal Government cannot control, decisions that have to be made by the State itself, such as eliminating social promotion, setting specific standards of achievement for students in each of the grades, no-nonsense tests, remedial programs, and so on. But one thing the Federal Government can do is provide funds to help with the development of good teachers. And that is what this bill does and does so well. 
I want to bring to the attention of the Senate one anomaly which the amendment I am about to send to the desk seeks to address. And that is that in the Pell grant program, there are two States that require a 5th year of teacher education. One of those States is New Hampshire; the other State is California. New Hampshire provides the 5th year before the baccalaureate degree and California requires the 5th year after the baccalaureate degree, ergo, California's higher education students are not currently eligible for Pell grants. And so, if I may, I send an amendment to the desk.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the clerk. 
Mr. President, this amendment is sent to the desk on behalf of Senator Boxer and myself. Essentially, what this amendment would do is authorize the U.S. Secretary of Education to award, on a case-by-case basis, Pell grants for students taking a 5th year of postbaccalaureate teacher education courses in order to get a teaching credential in a State that requires a 5th year. 
This was brought to my attention, Mr. President, by the new chancellor of the California State University, Dr. Charles B. Reed. I want to just read an opening paragraph. 
When I came to the California State University in March of this year, I established as a top system priority strengthening and improving the quality of our teacher preparation programs. Over the next decade, in California alone, we will need an additional 250,000 new K-12 classroom teachers. In addition to our changing demographics, the shortage of teachers in California is particularly acute due to the State's classroom size reduction initiative. . . . 
The Governor of our State has quite rightly determined that K through 3 should have class sizes of not more than 20 students per teacher. This is a real improvement and, of course, it will mean that more teachers will be necessary in the future. Additionally, there is an extraordinarily large number of teachers who are due to retire over the next 10 to 20 years.

<DOCNO>105-feinstein-ca-3-19980709</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So the amendment simply authorizes the U. S. Department of Education, on a case-by-case basis, to award a Pell grant to a needy student that wants to get a teaching credential, but needs that 5th year required by the state. We all know that even 4 years of college is costly, and many students cannot afford it. That is the rationale, the purpose, and the foundation of the Pell Grant program. 
Well, if you cannot afford 4 years, you likely cannot afford a 5th year. Therefore, we lose teachers because young people cannot afford that 5th year. And it is one of the reasons why today in California we have 21,000 teachers who are not credentialed. This would permit, on a case-by-case basis, a Pell grant to be granted to a needy student for that 5th year. 
These students in California would get a bachelor's degree in an academic subject, such as biology or French or whatever it is, and then take a 5th year in teacher education. That 5th year consists of learning teaching methods and of student or practice teaching. 
The American Council on Education, a consortium of all the higher education groups, has said, `These students [in California] who want to teach are unfairly caught in a state requirement `catch-22' and should not be penalized as a result.' 
One of the central purposes of the higher education bill is to strengthen teacher education. And it is long overdue; and it is well met by this bill. I think we can all be very proud of the vote we will cast. 
Title II authorizes new grants to States and to institutions to reform and toughen teacher training. 
Once again, California may well be leading the way because requiring this fifth year is also a good way to strengthen teacher education. 
According to the National Commission on Teaching, each dollar spent on improving teacher qualifications nets greater gains in student learning than any other use of the education dollar. This study and others have found that teacher quality is very uneven through this country. Just last week, in the ranking member's State, Massachusetts, the state Board of Education said that 56 percent of their teachers failed the State's first basic reading and writing test for teachers. Nationwide, over one-quarter of newly hired teachers lack the qualifications for their jobs according, again, to the Teaching Commission. 
Studies also show that unprepared or underprepared teachers simply don't stick it out. They are more likely to leave teaching after a few years. In my State, California, 30 percent of the teachers leave after their first 2 years; after 5 years, almost half of California's teachers have left. A November 1997 report of the California Advisory Panel on teacher education found in hard-to-staff schools as many as half of all beginning teachers leave teaching permanently after only 3 years in the classroom. That is shocking to me. Among underprepared teachers, this attrition rate climbs to two-thirds. What this is saying is that if a teacher isn't prepared, doesn't have the qualifications, doesn't have the teaching skills and aptitude, two-thirds of them leave within 3 years. This undermines education. 
There is a precedent for the approach of this amendment. Congress gave the Secretary the authority to award year-long Pell grants, similar to what this amendment does, in 1992. 
I want just quickly to make a few other comments on the teacher shortage and why this amendment is important. We have, as I said, 21,000 teachers in California on emergency credentials. That is 1 out of every 11 teachers. Half of California's math and science teachers didn't minor in those subjects in college, but they are still teaching. That is wrong. In Los Angeles, according to a U.S. News & World Report article last October, `New teachers have included Nordstrom clerks, a former clown, and several chiropractors.' 
This is a situation that shouldn't exist. It exists because there are not enough teachers. Therefore, emergency credentials are granted and these credentials can go on for 10 or 15 years and be granted to people who are really not qualified to teach. They are certainly not credentialled to teach. 
The need for good teachers is exacerbated by the fact that we need these new teachers in the next decade because public school enrollment in California is growing at triple the national rate. In California, the need for new teachers is triple the national rate. 
I am hopeful that this amendment would be accepted by this Senate. 
The amendment is going to be particularly helpful to prospective teachers enrolled at California State University. This is an institution today which prepares 60 percent of my State's teaching force. At this university, 48 percent of the students are Pell-grant eligible and the average Pell grant is $1,200 to $1,500. The University of California has 1,200 candidates for a teaching credential each year, and one-third are eligible for Pell grants. Thus, 400 UC students could benefit from a fifth year Pell grant each year. 
Essentially, this amendment is going to encourage more needy students to stick it out, to get that teaching credential, to do that fifth year at the university. That means that our young elementary and secondary students are going to be better served because they will have a teacher in the classroom who is qualified to teach. I, frankly, believe and would propose and urge the California Legislature to eliminate all emergency credentials by the year 2005 and be able to provide that the California teacher corps, K-12, is essentially 100 percent credentialled. But they will not be able to get there unless this body is willing to pass this amendment today. 
Again, in summary, California requires a fifth year. These students are not eligible for Pell grants for the fifth year. Forty-eight percent of the students who would go into teaching need these grants. We need 250,000 new teachers. We currently have 21,000 teachers teaching who are not qualified to teach, who are teaching on so-called emergency credentials. The quality of education, its excellence and its accountability, I believe, will be heightened by this amendment. 
I thank both the chairman and the ranking member. I am hopeful you will accept the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the bill's manager, Senator Jeffords. 
In Title II, Improving Teacher Quality, the bill authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to states to reform teacher preparation and, on page 363, lines 13-15, `to ensure that current and future teachers posses the necessary teaching skills and academic content knowledge in the subject areas in which the teachers are assigned to teach.' 
In (1) beginning on lines 18, the bill includes as an authorized activity that can be funded by a grant, `reforms that hold institutions of higher education with teacher preparation programs accountable for preparing teachers who are highly competent in the academic content areas in which teachers plan to teach, which may include the use of rigorous subject matter competency tests and the requirement that a teacher have an academic major in the subject area, or related discipline, in which the teacher plans to teach.' 
I commend the committee for these provisions and believe they will be very helpful in training good teachers. 
Could the gentleman clarify a point for me?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The bill uses the language, `academic content areas in which the teachers plan to teach.' I am concerned that this would limit grants to programs that train teachers pursuing certain academic majors, such as biology or history or French. 
My concern is that individuals in teacher preparation courses preparing to teach in the elementary grades might be excluded. Students in preparation to teach at the elementary level would not have an academic major, in the traditional sense that is directly related to the subject that they plan to teach, in part because elementary teachers teach all subjects. 
Yet, I'm sure we all agree that strong teaching, particularly the teaching of reading and math at the elementary level, in the primary grades, is critical. It is fundamental to a student's educational success in the subsequent grades. 
Do you not agree?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support S. 1882, the Higher Education Act reauthorization bill. 
The bill has several important features: 
It authorizes $300 million for reforming and strengthening teacher training so that teachers will be better prepared to teach elementary and secondary students. 
It continues student loans and increases the maximum authorized Pell grant from $4,500 to $5,800 in 1999 to help students regardless of income level get a college education. 
It continues federal support for colleges and universities, such as science and engineering programs and graduate fellowships. 
Education, particularly a college education, can open many doors in our society. 
Today, approximately 22 percent of all jobs in the U.S. require at least a bachelor's degree, up from 15.8 percent in 1996, according to Occupational Outlook Quarterly. People with bachelor degrees have median incomes about 60 percent higher than for those with only a high school education. 
In California, shifts in the economy make higher education more important than ever. Service-related jobs, such as those in high technology, have displaced many traditional manufacturing jobs. These new jobs require a level of knowledge and skill that can for the most part only be gained by a college education. 
There are at least three specific factors that make this bill important to my state: 
First, California has 21,000 teachers on emergency credentials and will need up to 300,000 in the next decade. 
Second, California has many first generation, bilingual and `nontraditional' students, that this bill will assist. 
Three, the bill provides for increases in several student assistance programs. Californians receive $1.7 billion in federal student financial aid. Over 400,000 Pell grants go to California students. 
5th year Pell grant. The Senate today unanimously accepted my amendment to authorize the Secretary of Education to award on a case-by-case basis Pell grants for disadvantaged students for the fifth year of teacher education required in California to get a teaching credential. This will enable many disadvantaged students to become teachers, at a time when we are facing a severe teacher shortage and have 21,000 teachers in the classroom on emergency credentials. 
Distance learning. I am also grateful that the managers have accepted two of my amendments to the distance learning demonstration (teaching away from the traditional campus via a computer, teleconferencing or other technologies). The manager's amendment includes a clarification that university `systems' (e.g., UC system, CSU system) would be eligible and the bill now authorizes 15 sites, up from 5 authorized in the committee bill. 
Limited English Proficient Students/School Districts: The bill authorizes state grants for innovative ways to reduce teacher shortages in high poverty areas. At my suggestion, the bill includes as eligible or target areas, school districts with disproportionate numbers of limited English speaking children. This is especially important in California, where 1.3 million students have limited English proficiency, a tripling since 1986, and where 87 languages are spoken. 
Study of Few Borrowers: The bill provides that schools whose student loan default rate exceeds 25% for three years will be ineligible to participate in the student loan program. For schools like California's community colleges, that have just a few borrowers, this method gives the appearance of having a very high default rate. For example, if the school has only four borrowers but two defaulters, they would have a 50 percent default rate. The manager's amendment includes my suggestion of a study of the effectiveness of this measurement method by September 30, 1999. 
Enrollment in California's public schools, the college generation of the future, is growing at three times the national rate. Enrollment in the three major segments of higher education will increase by 28.9 percent, or by 549,144 students, between 1996 and 2006, according to the state's Department of Finance. 
California will have this surge in college applicants because (1) the number of high school graduates has increased by 22 percent since 1993; (2) many adult workers are changing careers by choice because of organization restructuring, or to enhance their employment skills; (3) migration to California from other states and countries is continuing; and (4) more Californians over 40 are pursuing lifelong learning. 
California's higher educational system has four components: the University of California system, the California State University system, the community system, and private colleges and universities. 
The University of California (UC) consists of nine campuses that served 129,257 undergraduate students and 40,605 graduate students in fall 1997. UC educates approximately one in twelve of all postsecondary students in California, and includes the top one-eighth of high school graduates. Total enrollment at UC is projected to grow by about 36,500 students by fall 2006. 
In addition to providing instruction in liberal arts and the sciences, UC has exclusive public responsibility for doctorate, law, medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine degrees. The UC campuses, especially Berkeley and UCLA, are some of the most prestigious public or private institutions in the nation and the world. 
The California State University System (CSU) consists of 22 regional campuses with 276,054 undergraduate students, and 67,725 postbaccalaureate and graduate students enrolled in fall 1997. This was one in six of every student enrolled in higher education in California. Enrollment is expected to grow by 31.4 percent or 105,809 students by year 2006. 
Another characteristic of the CSU system is its large number of `nontraditional' students, students who are older than the usual college age. This is because many community college graduates transfer to CSU and many CSU students are working people seeking to progress professionally or maintain technical proficiency. 
CSU's primary function is to provide instruction in the liberal arts and sciences and CSU prepares 60 percent of the state's teaching force with 21 teacher preparation programs. 
The need for new teachers in my state is especially critical because there are currently 31,000 elementary and secondary classrooms being taught by men and women without full teaching credentials. 
A major emphasis of the bill to which I give my full and enthusiastic support is to increase support for teacher education and to emphasize reform, accountability, and competency. Funds are provided to both states and postsecondary institutions for strengthening teacher training. 
Another important element of higher education in California is the California Community system, the largest community college system in the world. Its 106 campuses provided vocational, academic, and community service programs to over 1.4 million students of varying ages, income levels and educational backgrounds in 1997. Roughly three of four public postsecondary students were enrolled in community colleges. The system is expected to increase by 28.9 percent as its attendance is projected to be over 1.8 million by fall 2006. A notable increase between 1990 and 1997 has been in the age group 50 and older, which grew by 21 percent. 
Students at community colleges are older and tend to be employed full-time, many supporting families. Approximately 41 percent of community college students are in the 20-29 age group. Older students, particularly those over 40, are seeking postsecondary education for several reasons, including career enhancement, job displacement, divorce (especially for women), personal growth, and reforms in government assistance programs. 
The student aid provisions of the bill will be particularly helpful to these students. 
The bill also helps three specific types of institutions: Hispanic-serving institutions, tribal colleges and universities, and historically Black colleges and universities. Although California does not have any historically Black universities, more than 2,000 students do attend Hispanic-serving institutions and tribal colleges and universities. DQ University in Davis serves Native Americans from California and other states; and the National Hispanic University is a California higher education institution with a 25 percent or more Hispanic enrollment. This reauthorization bill strengthens these institutions by providing special grant awards to help them serve these populations and to become financially stable. 
Student financial aid is a critical component of higher education in California. Expenses for tuition and supplies at California's postsecondary institutions, public and private, averaged $19,500 during the 1997-98 school year. The California Postsecondary Education Commission estimates that 50-55 percent of students at California's public and private institutions are receiving some form of state, federal or institutional financial assistance. 
Federal student grant and loan programs since 1973 have enabled people to go to college. Tuition at higher education institutions throughout the United States is increasing at rates higher than the consumer price index (CPI) and the growth in family incomes. This is particularly troubling for California, a high cost state. In 1993 the CPI was 2.7 percent and average undergraduate fees for the University of California system was $3,044.00. The CPI in 1997 was 1.7 percent while the UC fees rose to $4,166, an increase of 136.9 percent! 
Total expenses during the 1997-1998 school year to attend the University of California at Berkeley were $13,169 a year; at UC San Diego, $13,400; at California State University, Chico, $10,000. For private schools, the costs are more than $20,000 a year--at Occidental, $26,000; University of the Pacific, $25,000; and Stanford, $30,000. College affordability is becoming more difficult. 
By continuing federal grant and loan programs, this bill will be a big help to many California families. 
I strongly support S. 1882, the Higher Education Act Reauthorization of 1998 because it continues the federal commitment to an important endeavor of our society, the pursuit of a college education, increasingly the gateway to economic self-sufficiency. It will also revamp and toughen federal support for teacher training, a dire need in my and most states. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was concerned to learn this morning that the IRS will not allow individuals who purchase a special stamp intended to raise funds for breast cancer research to list the donation as a charitable gift for tax deduction purposes. 
Last year, Congress passed legislation that authorized the US Postal Service to issue a stamp priced at 40 cents, with the additional 8 cents going to the National Institute of Health and the Department of Defense to fund breast cancer research. The clear intent of my legislation was that gifts made to fund breast cancer research through the purchase of the breast cancer stamp are to be considered as a charitable donation. For the IRS to treat them in any other way violates the spirit of the law. 
Breast cancer is one of the greatest health risks facing America today. More than 2.6 million women are living with breast cancer right now, one million of them have yet to be diagnosed. Breast cancer is still the number one killer of women between the ages of 35 and 52. The disease claims another woman's life every 12 minutes in the U.S. 
Despite increases in the last few years, research dollars are still desperately needed to fund cancer research. In 1996, the National Cancer Institute could fund only 26% of the research grant applications, a decline from 60% in the 1970's. 
Clearly, there needs to be innovative ways to offset this reduction in research spending. The breast cancer stamp is one such idea. It has the potential to raise millions of badly needed cancer research dollars. I am disturbed that the IRS has chosen to make it more difficult to raise this money. My legislation was designed to encourage contributions for breast cancer research and I hope the IRS will help fulfill its intent.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today we honor the 60th anniversary of the historic Fair Labor Standards Act. The Fair Labor Standards Act is landmark legislation, creating the federal minimum wage, establishing the forty-hour work week and banning oppressive child labor practices. Each element is an important component in our federal commitment to workers and their families. 
We can all appreciate the current strength of the economy: 300,000 more Americans started new jobs in May alone; unemployment was steady at 4.3%, the lowest in 28 years; and median family income has increased for three years in a row and today, more Americans own their own homes than ever before. 
However, while the U.S. economy is expanding, all Americans are not sharing equally in the benefits of the growing economy. Despite growth in both gross domestic product and employment between 1989 and 1994, median family income in 1994 was still $2,168 lower than it was in 1989. In the current economy, growth is not leading to improved economic well-being for typical families. Some working families, particularly single women, are falling further and further behind. For these families, a minimum wage increase is not a windfall, but a necessary step to allow them to attain a real `living wage.' This uneven growth should concern us all in Congress. 
The Clinton Administration's plan is to increase the current minimum wage of $5.15 by $0.50 in January 1999 and another $0.50 a year later, resulting in a wage floor of $6.15 in the year 2000. I support the proposal and would like to take a moment to put the proposed increase in context. If we do nothing, the minimum wage in the year 2000 would be equal to $4.82, a level that cannot support a family. The administration proposal, if fully implemented in the year 2000, would result in a minimum wage of $6.15 per hour. However, based on the inflation estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, that $6.15 wage in the year 2000 would equal only $5.72 in today's dollars. 
The proposed increase would move the minimum wage back to the level of the early 1980s, before inflation was allowed to erode the real value of the minimum wage by 30 percent. Throughout the 1960s and much of the 1970s, the minimum wage was as much as a dollar above the current proposal. The fact is that the minimum wage increases in the 1990s, including the one currently under consideration, will only restore some of the lost ground and real earning power of America's lowest paid workers. 
Despite the 1996 increase, the minimum wage remains below its real value from 1956 through 1983. And if no action is taken, its value will once again erode over time. From 1980 through 1995, inflation rose 86 percent, but the minimum wage increased by only 27 percent. As a result, working families fall further and further behind. Because of inflation, it now takes $7.33 to buy what the minimum wage did in 1968. The current minimum wage of $5.15 has nearly 30% less buying power than it did thirty years ago. That's unfair for low-income individuals, struggling to provide for themselves and their families. 
Since the late 1970s, wage inequality has grown steadily. Wage inequality is the gap between those at the bottom, the middle of the wage scale and those earning the highest income. In 1996, the wealthiest one-fifth of the population, those whose earnings place them in the highest 20% of household earnings, collected 49% of all national income, an increase from 42.8 percent in 1968. By contrast, the share earned by the remaining 80 percent of all Americans declined. The decline in the real value of the minimum wage is a large part of this widening gap. By raising the minimum back to its 1979 level, we can help close the gap and ensure that low-wage workers get a fairer share of the economic growth. The minimum wage helps workers get their fair share of our economic growth and prosperity, raising wages for millions of workers across the country. 
The 60-year-old Fair Labor Standards Act serves as our basic commitment to America's workers. FLSA was subsequently amended by the Pay Equity Act roughly thirty-five years ago, pledging equal pay for equal work. Of the 12 million workers who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage, 60% are women. Pay equity is an important issue in the minimum wage debate. 
Today, the median annual earnings for women is only 71% of a man's earnings, just 71 cents for each dollar. Expressed another way, the median annual income for women in 1995, less than $22,500, was the male median earnings level of the early 1980s. We've all been through the 1980s and shouldn't be expected to go back. 
After more than a decade of wage growth for most women, the bottom two-thirds of women in the workforce saw their wages decline between 1989 and 1995. At the same time, jobs have become less secure and less likely to offer health and pension benefits. 
By increasing the minimum wage, we can provide strong support and raise family income for low income families across the country, helping to address widening income inequality for women, particularly single women raising children. 
Who are minimum wage workers? They are men and women who operate airport metal detectors and X-ray machines at Los Angeles International airport are among those making the state's minimum wage of $5.75 an hour. They receive no benefits, no sick days, and no vacation, and yet they protect the safety of millions of passengers who travel though the nation's second-busiest airport every year. 
Minimum wage workers are disproportionately women, often single heads of households with children. The average minimum wage worker is responsible for providing more than half of his or her family's earnings. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, a minimum wage worker earns $10,712 a year, approximately $2,900 below the poverty level for a family of three. 
During the successful 1996 effort to increase the minimum wage, opposition in the business community argued the increase would trigger a loss of minimum wage jobs. However, recent studies suggest otherwise. A review of the 1996 minimum wage increase found the increase raised wages of almost 10 million workers. Approximately 71 percent of those were adults, with roughly half working full time, and another third worked 20 to 34 hours a week. The study found no impact on the level of jobs or inflation, but workers got the raise they deserve. 
Contrary to Republican critics, the increases were well-targeted, disproportionately benefiting low-income working households. The poorest 20% of American households, those with an average income of $15,728, received 35 percent of the benefits from the minimum wage increase. Raising the minimum wage lifts family income for low-income workers, without the adverse effects and job loss claimed. 
During the 1996 welfare reform debate, there was widespread support for the concept of `making welfare work.' Raising the minimum wage is particularly important for those moving off welfare as a result of welfare reform. We need to make sure these workers are able to find work that enables them to make ends meet. Minimum wage workers are primarily adults, with more than half serving as their family's primary wage earner. Raising the minimum wage plays an important role in moving people from welfare assistance to supporting themselves and their family. 
An Oregon study found that, following an increase in the state minimum wage, the average wage of an individual leaving welfare increased as well. By contrast, the average wage of an individual leaving welfare fell by 5 percent in the years prior to the increase. Nearly one-third who found work, and one-half of those finding part-time work, received the minimum wage. A strong minimum wage offers strong protection for low-income families and can assist them to make a successful transition from welfare to work. 
Mr. President, by any measure, whether its education level or test scores, low-wage workers are equally if not more skilled than the workers of 20 years ago. These workers have more labor market experience, more education and have contributed to an expanding economy which has experienced overall labor productivity growth of 22 percent since 1979. 
Yet today's minimum wage earner receives nearly 30% less buying power than they did thirty years ago. That's unfair for low-income individuals, struggling to provide for themselves and their families. Today, about 12 million workers earn the minimum wage. These low income workers deserve a share of the benefit. These workers deserve a raise.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. President, when this bill was last before this body, I voted against it. I voted against it because it had some amendments to which I could not agree. Those amendments have been removed by the conference committee. I am very pleased to announce my support for this bill. 
To some, this bill will not be politically correct. For me, it is time to try new initiatives in education and to be guided in the future not necessarily by what is politically correct, but by what works in the homes, in the families and in the schools all across this great country. 
If this bill encourages savings for education, our country will be better for it. If it encourages parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles to help their families' children become educated, this will be a major achievement. I believe this bill will help. I am happy to support it. I, too, urge the President of the United States reconsider and to not veto it. 
I have heard this bill called many things, but let's analyze for a moment what this bill does do. It increases the limit of contributions from $500 to $2,000 for an education savings account which is currently available for postsecondary education. Thus, families will be able to quadruple the annual contributions they can now make into education savings accounts. It allows families to spend the money from these accounts on elementary and secondary education, both public and private. 
Of course, there is the rub. Some feel we should not provide anything for private education. I disagree. The bill enables people other than parents--grandparents, aunts, uncles--to contribute to a niece, nephew, or grandchild's education and to get a small tax deduction for so doing. It provides grants to States to implement teacher testing and merit pay programs at a time when everyone is concerned about education and sees that teaching is one of the most productive investments we can make to improve learning. It allows schools to use existing state school innovation funds (ESEA Title IV) funds to reward schools with grants when they demonstrate high achievement. It allows weapons brought to school to be admitted as evidence in any internal school disciplinary proceeding, the bill I introduced with Senator Byron Dorgan. 
Now, the key feature of this bill is that it creates incentives for people to save for education. Some have said this bill benefits the rich. I disagree. These accounts would be available to couples earning under $150,000 a year and to single people earning under $95,000 a year. This will help many Americans. 
A major reason I support this bill is that Americans are not good savers. Our current savings rate has dropped from 4.3 percent in 1996 to 3.8 percent in 1997. Americans today save at one-third the rate that people save in Germany, at one-third the rate they save in France, and at one-third the rate they save in Italy. 
If this bill encourages people to save for the education of their children--whether they use that in public education, in private education, in religious education--I am all for it. The 
point is, let's encourage America's families to save for education. If we fail to save for education, if we fail to place a value on education, we will sink as a first-class society. That is what I think is the overwhelming message of this bill--we value education. 
As has been said, the Joint Tax Committee has estimated that 58 percent--that is nearly 60 percent--of the tax benefit would accrue to those taxpayers filing 10.8 million returns with children in public schools. In California, out of 13 million tax returns filed, 10.4 million or 78 percent of tax returns reflect earnings under $50,000. The average per capita income in California in 1998 is $28,500. One out of every four students lives with a single parent. This bill could, in fact, help many Californians. 
Let's take the example of a family that earns less than $30,000 a year. And if you have a grandparent who could save and contribute, an aunt who could save and contribute, an uncle who could save and contribute, this bill gives them an incentive to save for their grandchild or niece or nephew. Plus, we are saying we value this kind of savings. After all, if we can authorize it for postsecondary education, why don't we authorize it for primary education? The reason is simple: Some people here say you shouldn't provide anything for private schooling. I say if a family can accumulate savings and thus have a choice of whatever school they want their youngster to go to, as long as that youngster receives a good education, is that not really what government is all about? 
Mr. President, I am very happy to support this bill. I want to make one other comment. I am particularly pleased that the conferees accepted the Safer Schools Act of 1998. This provision is based upon a bill which Senator Dorgan and I introduced. It ensures that if a student brings a gun to school, the gun will be admissible as evidence in any school disciplinary hearing. As we are all acutely aware, we have seen a wave of tragedy in recent months involving students shooting other students. It goes without saying that schools should be safe places. Schools should be for books and learning, not guns and shooting. So I hope we will take comprehensive action to reduce these tragedies in the coming months. I would like to work with those who want to help do just that. 
In the meantime, I am pleased that we are taking this common-sense step today to reduce the risk by ensuring that our schools can safely expel students who bring guns into their school. 
In summary, again, to some this bill is simply not politically correct. To me, it encourages American families to save for what is the most vital aspect of American life and that is giving our youngsters a good education. People can put their money into an IRA and they can then use this money based on their own choice for public education, for tutoring, for books and tuition, for private education or for religious education. I believe the time has come to try new initiatives. 
I thank Senator Coverdell, Senator Torricelli, and those who have proposed and supported this legislation. 
I am happy to join with them. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.  
Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on this occasion to share several thoughts. Let me begin by saying, on the amendment before us, I don't believe there is any Member of this body who is for forced abortion. I do not believe there is any Member of this body who would countenance it, who believes it is good public policy and who is reserved about saying that. Therefore, I think we would all hope the President of the United States would come back with a specific commitment in this area from China. 
The question I have, that is deeply disturbing to me, is the Senate is being asked to consider amendments on China policy on the eve of, and even during, President Clinton's visit to China. There used to be a bipartisan consensus on foreign policy in this country. There used to be an understanding that when the President is going overseas, Members of both parties would come together, would wish him well, and would support him. I think, certainly in the last 10 or 15 years, this has been the case. I am very concerned that some are using U.S. policy and China as a political or a partisan issue. 
I note, with some disappointment, that no Republican of either House has agreed to accompany the President on his trip. To me, this gives credibility to the assumption that the Republicans are going to use the trip in a political way. And I think this is very, very dangerous. What I hope to point out in my remarks is some of the danger inherent in this kind of policy. 
Let me, for a moment, talk about the amendments that are before us. Many are controversial. Some would ban various officials from entering the United States; others would prohibit the United States from supporting international loans to China; many run counterproductive to achieving progress with China. Rather, they push division and they encourage China's historic isolationist tendencies. 
Just yesterday, language was added that would move the jurisdiction of certain technological export controls from the Commerce Department to the State Department. This is a serious proposal. It is worth looking at. But the majority and minority leaders have appointed task forces to study the issue and assign various committees to look into it. 
The vote on this proposal today would be to render a verdict on an investigation when that investigation has barely gotten underway. Anyone who thinks the President's trip will be made more successful by the Senate's consideration of these issues knows very little about China. 
I think the President's trip represents an important step forward in building a healthy United States-China relationship. We have major interests. Human rights? Of course, including religious freedom and autonomy for the people of Tibet. 
For 9 years, I have been bringing messages from the Dalai Lama to the President of China asking that there be discussions between the two. I hope that the President will plead that cause, both with President Jiang Zemin as well as in his public addresses in university settings. 
But right now the times are extremely urgent. We have a kind of economic meltdown going on throughout most of the Asian continent. And this financial crisis is combined with the very serious situation with respect to India and Pakistan. 
To underline the dangers that India, Pakistan, and, indeed, the entire international community are faced with on the eve of this trip, I would like to take a few minutes here today to review what we know about the Indian and Pakistani nuclear programs, their capabilities, and what would likely result in a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan if we are unable to forge a real and lasting peace in the region and the current south Asian political and security environment. 
First, what kind of nuclear weapons did India and Pakistan test? 
The Indian Government claims to have tested three different designs on May 11, 1998: a fission bomb with a yield of 12 kilotons, explosive power equivalent to 12,000 tons of TNT; a `thermonuclear device,' with the yield of 43 kilotons; and a `low-yield' device. On May 13, India claims to have tested two additional devices that produced a total yield of less than 1 kiloton. 
For comparison, the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 produced an estimated yield of 18 kilotons. So one of these Indian tests was over 2 1/2 times the size of the Hiroshima bomb. 
According to leading nongovernmental analysts, the 
low-yield device tested in May of this year was likely a compact design intended for deployment on India's medium-range missiles. The subkiloton tests, according to India, provided information needed to perfect computer simulations of nuclear explosions that could be used in subsequent weapons design work, possibly without the need for future testing. 
For its part, Pakistan claims to have detonated five simultaneous nuclear tests on May 28, of boosted devices made with highly enriched uranium, which Samar Mobarik Mand, head of their nuclear test program, claimed produced a total yield in the range of 40 to 45 kilotons. Bear in mind again, Hiroshima was 18. Pakistan conducted an additional nuclear test on May 30. Mand claimed the yield was in the range of 15 to 18 kilotons. 
Pakistan has stated that all six tests were boosted fission devices, some of which are designed for deployment on the new Ghauri medium-range missile. The head of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, A.Q. Khan, claims that although Pakistan has not built a hydrogen bomb, it has conducted research and is capable of building such a device should the Government decide to do so. 
U.S. intelligence, as well as independent analysts, have raised some serious questions about the claims made by both India and Pakistan regarding the number and yield of the tests each has claimed to have conducted. Although there is a certain reassurance to be found in these questions--perhaps neither India nor Pakistan is as far along in developing nuclear weapons as they might like us to believe--ultimately, such quibbling rings hollow. 
Regardless of the exact number or the exact yield of the Indian and Pakistani tests, these tests have made it abundantly clear that both India and Pakistan must now be considered capable of developing and deploying nuclear weapons, and that both hope to gain political and security leverage from this capability. 
Secondly, although neither India nor Pakistan are now nuclear weapons states, given their demonstrated capabilities, how many nuclear weapons could India and Pakistan make? 
India's nuclear bombs are fueled by plutonium, a manmade byproduct of fissioning uranium in nuclear reactors. At the end of 1995, India had a total inventory of 315 to 345 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium, according to a study of world plutonium and highly enriched uranium inventories by independent analysts David Albright, Frans Berkhout, and William Walker. 
Assuming that 5 kilograms of plutonium are required to build a bomb, this would give India enough plutonium for some 63 to 69 weapons. So let us assume they have that ability. 
Pakistan's bombs are fueled with highly enriched uranium, enriched at its unsafeguarded centrifuge facility at Kahuta. Under pressure from the United States, Pakistan halted production of highly enriched uranium in 1991, but reportedly resumed highly enriched uranium production some months ago. After last month's tests, Pakistan still possesses 335 to 400 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, enough for some 16 to 20 nuclear bombs, according to the Institute for Science and International Security. 
If Pakistan is using boosted warhead designs, as it claims, it would produce a considerably larger number of weapons from the same amount of material, depending on the considerations of yield and weight of individual warheads. 
In addition, earlier this year, Pakistan's unsafeguarded plutonium production reactor at Khushab went into operation. It is estimated that this reactor can produce enough plutonium for at least one to three bombs a year. 
Thirdly, how would India and Pakistan deliver these nuclear weapons? Both nations possess advanced military aircraft that would be capable of delivering nuclear weapons. India's military deploys such aircraft as the Jaguar, the Mirage 2000, the MiG-27, and the MiG-29. Pakistan's military aircraft include nuclear-capable, United States-supplied F-16 fighters. 
Of greater concern, because of their speed and invulnerability to conventional air-defense systems, are both nations' ballistic missiles. 
India's Privthi missile, based on the U.S. Scout, has a range of 150-250 kilometers, depending upon the size of the payload. The two-stage Agni missile, based upon Soviet and German technology, has a much greater range, 1,500 to 2,500 kilometers. India claims the ability to hit targets anywhere in Pakistan with the Agni missile. 
Pakistan is believed to have about 30 nuclear-capable M-11 missiles supplied by China. This is a bad thing. The second load of M-11s, to all intents and purposes, have never been delivered. We believe it is important that the President secure, ratify, and maintain the commitment that no further M-11s be sent by China to Pakistan. These missiles have a range of 280-300 kilometers. 
Pakistan's recently developed Ghauri missile, developed with the Chinese' and North Korea's assistance, has a range of 1,500 kilometers. Its flight tests in early April may have been one of the factors that moved India's Government to resume nuclear testing. 
A.Q. Khan, father of the Pakistani bomb, claims that the nuclear devices tested by Pakistan `could very easily be put on our Ghauri missiles.' According to Kahn, Ghauri is the only nuclear-capable Pakistani missile at this time but other missiles could be modified for the mission if necessary. These missiles reduce warning time on both sides to nearly zero, making any nuclear crisis extremely unstable. India could hit targets in Pakistan in 4 minutes, and Pakistan could hit Indian targets in under 12 minutes. 
All of this development has been going on, and we are debating forced abortion, but we have this `macro' situation evolving right on China's doorstep. 
Now, what would be the likely result of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan? In 1990, when President Bush was first unable to certify under the Pressler amendment that Pakistan had not acquired nuclear capability, the Department of Energy requested the Program in Arms Control, Disarmament, and International Security at the University of Illinois to conduct a study of nuclear proliferation in south Asia. One of the papers commissioned for that study estimates what the casualties of that war would be if India and Pakistan were to wage war. The study, based on unclassified sources, projected damage for three different scenarios, depending on the size and scale of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan, from a war with limited nuclear retaliation to a full-scale exchange. 
The results are chilling. At the lowest level, the study determined that there would be between 500,000 and 1 million immediate fatalities on each side in a limited nuclear exchange where the only targets were military centers--500,000 to 1 million people killed in a limited exchange of only military centers. At least another million people would be injured in the attacks, and hundreds of thousands more could be expected to die in the fallout and nuclear poisoning which would follow. 
In a larger exchange which would include an attack on urban centers in both countries, this study estimated that, at a minimum, there would be 15 million Pakistani and 30 million Indian immediate fatalities, with millions more injured and expensive economic disruption. South Asia would be reduced to a virtual wasteland. 
These projections, I should point out, were based on a 1980 census data projected to 1990. If these figures were recreated today, we could expect the projections, with current census 
figures, to be that much greater. 
Think about the magnitude of such a disaster--45 million immediate deaths within a matter of minutes, almost as many killed in India and Pakistan in a few minutes as were killed around the world during the entire 6 years of World War II. It is a number that boggles the mind. In fact, I find it difficult to believe that I find myself here on the floor of the U.S. Senate discussing such scenarios, such carnage, such loss of human life; it is not within the realm of reality. Yet today this is precisely the danger which India and Pakistan face unless both states, with the support and assistance of the international community--and that includes both China and the United States--are able to take clear and immediate steps to end the current crisis and begin the process of building peace in Asia. 
This brings me to the final issue I would like to address: What is the current security and political environment in south Asia? 
In the aftermath of the tests, both India and Pakistan have indicated a willingness to enter into peace talks. On June 12, the Indian Foreign Ministry stated, `India is committed to fostering a relationship of trust and friendship with Pakistan based on mutual respect and regard for each other's concerns.' Pakistan has also offered to resume peace talks. Neither side, however, appears willing to act to back up this rhetoric. Despite their stated good intentions, as of yet there is no agreement on a time, a place, a format, to enter into discussions to address either the nuclear crisis or other important security issues such as Kashmir or the south Asian security agenda. 
This situation is especially troubling because without any confidence and security-building measures in place, without any dialog and discussion, India and Pakistan are especially vulnerable to an inadvertent crisis or to a relatively minor incident sparking a larger conflict. 
On just this past Friday--let me give an example--June 19, the press reported an incident in which five armed men, suspected to be Muslim terrorists by Indian authorities, attacked a Hindu wedding party in a mountain village in Kashmir, killing 25 people. Just a week earlier, Pakistani authorities held Indian intelligence to be accountable for planting a bomb on a crowded train. These are two examples of the kinds of incidents which could well launch a nuclear episode. Without dialog, for sure these are the sorts of events that are open to misinterpretation, can lead to miscalculation, escalation, and tragedy of the most horrific sort. 
The President of the United States tomorrow leaves for China. We can debate forced abortion. You have an unprecedented currency crisis in Asia. You have major turmoil in Indonesia. You have a very serious situation in Thailand, in South Korea. We see the Japanese yen continuing to deteriorate even after the weekend meetings. Many people there felt that Japan has no formula to recover. And you have the significance and importance escalating now, that the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, not be devalued. This, in itself, will take an unprecedented act of courage on the part of the Chinese. 
I believe substantial diplomatic pressure must be brought by the President of the United States to convince the Chinese that against all of this they must hold firm. At the same time, in China, you have an almost impossible situation for the Chinese to maintain. You have the closure of the large state-owned industries taking place and forcing tens of millions of people into unemployment. 
The President of China has recently said what he considers an acceptable rate of unemployment--3.5 percent. It would be very lucky if China could confine themselves to that figure. But to have this growing unemployment and still refuse to devalue their currency is a major gesture to the Western World, because what most of these countries seek to do is cut off American markets further and flood our country with their consumer goods at a lower cost. 
And this is precisely the reason we have the trade imbalance as it is today. 
So these are the macro problems, Mr. President, that I respectfully submit to you are appropriate for the major policymaking body of the United States of America to be deliberating--the future of the world. And I really regret that we get into the kind of discussion that can only have one effect: drive China to be less cooperative, more inclined to devalue, but hopefully not less inclined to care about their southern border or what North Korea is doing over their northeastern border. But these are problems of life and death for millions and millions of people. I feel so strongly and I so strongly urge this body that this is not the time for divisiveness. This is not the time for partisanship. This is not the time for some to make hay when the President of the United States is going to Asia to meet with the largest exploding country on Earth to try to chart a relationship that can come to grips with the nuclear facts I have just spelled out. 
Facts. Facts of life. Facts like, if there is one single miscalculation, like a Muslim terrorist event, another train bombing, a premature launching of a nuclear missile, it could result in the loss of tens of millions of lives all across the Asian continent. This is what our leaders should be discussing --how to develop a strategic partnership, how to force India and Pakistan to the table, how to set up the kind of commitments that are necessary to forge a consensus on Kashmir; how to solve India border problems with China; how to open markets so that the trade imbalance does not continue; how to maintain intellectual property rights in China; how to have China bring in a retail consumer market from the United States, which they have been reluctant to do; how to build on the rule of law. 
You know, people in this body are great critics--particularly people who have never been to China, don't know China, have never read a history book on China, don't understand that for 5,000 years China was dominated by one man, generally an emperor who, at a whim, at the snap of his fingers, could put millions of people to death if he so chose; and then the revolutionary war heroes, none of whom had any education; and now by its first group of really educated leadership in the 5,000-year history of that country. I have heard the President of China say directly that, `We will transition from a rule of man to a rule of law, but it cannot happen overnight.' 
Mr. President, if not the first American mayor, I was certainly one of the first American mayors to visit China in June of 1979, just when that country was coming out of the Cultural Revolution. I have often said that what I saw there was very sobering indeed, because one understands the body language of fear. The body language of fear was prevalent all throughout every city in China that I visited. I have visited China, and I try to go every year; the last time was in September. The changes I have seen are astonishing. Now, remember, this is still a Communist government. There is no prototype on Earth for the kind of change that this Chinese Government is now going through. 
I truly believe, as they now try what they call the `socialist experience,' which we call a market economy, and as they engage with the West, and as our military leaders are able to engage them--I will never forget when John Glenn and Sam Nunn and I met with the Minister of Defense, and at the end of the conversation I said, `Do you have anything else on your mind?' He said, `Yes.' He said, `One of the things that I am concerned about is that we have incidents of American fighter planes overflying Chinese borders.' I said, `Well, has anything been done about this?' He said, `No.' So I went out and called Bill Perry on the phone, who was then Secretary of State, and that was taken care of. 
It has to be known by this body that, up to just less than a month ago, there was no red telephone between our two leaders. As a matter of fact, the first time our two leaders spoke on that red telephone was following the Indian nuclear explosion, where our President called the President of China on that red telephone and said, `Look, this has happened. Will you help?' That is when Jiang Zemin said, `We are of the same mind on this.' 
Now, don't we want this kind of dialog to take place? Sure, we want to make the Chinese know that forced abortion is repugnant to a civilized society, repugnant to our values, and it is brutal and unfair. Sure, we want them to initiate talks with the Dalai Lama, go to the rule of law, provide due process of law for every citizen in China. That is the guarantee for positive human rights--due process of law. Nobody can be arrested in the middle of the night and hauled to jail and kept there. The first change has already been made. The Chinese have changed administrative detention, which is the summary placement of somebody in custody, and limited it to 30 days. We all know the judiciary of China is under the control of the political party. This needs discussion. The judiciary of China must be independent, it must be paid, it must be forbidden to take money on the side. There must be a new criminal code, a new civil code, based on a new China, a China that is reaching out and interacting with the Western World, such as China never has before. 
The history of China must be understood in this. It must be known that after the Boxer Rebellion, in the incident where China lost Hong Kong in the opium wars, China was so humiliated by the West that China turned into itself and never wanted any intercourse with the West. Now we see China changing. 
How China changes is the President's quest. Does China go back into itself, reinforce its totalitarian nature, or does China open further interaction with the West; have an economic democracy that one day by the Taiwan model a social democracy must emerge? 
This, I say to you, Mr. President, is the fitting goal for the President of the United States, because that will change life as we know it on the planet. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I would ask that I be notified when 10 minutes of my time has gone by, and I will try to share it with the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. President, Senator Hatch and I have prepared our bill based on some ten hearings in the Judiciary Committee and is based on, we believe, would create a consensus to create a bill which would do the following: Create a pure tobacco bill with no additional tax measures, no drug enforcement programs, no voucher programs, but which would provide some incentives for the tobacco industry to agree, while increasing the per-pack price, and this is a gross figure, to about a $1.50 over 10 years. This would include excise and State taxes, wholesale and retail markups, manufacturers take. This bill would also ban all tobacco advertising geared toward children and ensures that the FDA has the necessary regulatory authority to regulate the consents, and to limit nicotine. It would also provide, as Senator Hatch has just said, some $92 billion over 25 years for tobacco-related public health programs, and $100 billion over 25 years for research, with tough look-back provisions that require the industry to reduce youth smoking by 67 percent in 10 years. 
It would also require States to negotiate an allocation of tobacco funds to counties that filed lawsuits before the June 20, 1997, deadline. 
As you know, the McCain bill as it came out of the Commerce Committee, required a total payment of $516 billion over 25 years. The Hatch-Feinstein proposal requires $428.5 billion over the same period. Under the McCain bill, as amended, it would have diverted about half the funds to programs unrelated to tobacco or public health. Under the McCain bill, there was less money going to public health programs and to the States than under Hatch-Feinstein, since 26 percent of the funds right off the top went to an election year tax cut. For instance, for the first five years, $47.2 billion would be left over after the tax cut, the Coverdell amendment then takes the great bulk of funds available for public health programs and uses it for drug enforcement, border patrol and school vouchers. That bill allocated 40 percent of the remaining funds available for State programs, while Hatch-Feinstein allocates 50 percent of the funds directed to the State. 
Under our proposal during the first five years, there would be $10 billion more money for Federal public health research and antitobacco programs. There would also be $7 billion more money for State public health and antitobacco programs. The public health aspect, we believe, is the most important part of this legislation. Additionally, one of the most critical areas which must be addressed for any tobacco legislation to be successful in reducing youth smoking, I believe, is advertising. The tobacco industry knows that millions of smokers quit annually and approximately 400,000 Americans die from smoking-related diseases each year. They also understand that 89 percent of all new smokers are adolescents, and for their market share to continue they must continue to market cigarettes to children, and they do. 
So, advertising plays a central role in leading young people to smoke. 
We know that tobacco companies can no longer advertise on television or radio, so they use alternative forms of advertising and promotion to persuade teens to start smoking. We know that, despite endless promises by the tobacco companies that they have not and would not market to children, that they would not use advertising to appeal to children, they have done exactly what they promised not to do. And the evidence is staggering. 
Mr. President, 87 percent of adolescents could recall seeing one or more tobacco advertisements and half could identify the brand name associated with one of four popular cigarette slogans. As a matter of fact, in 1986 Camel cigarettes ranked seventh in popularity among the youngest age group of smokers, with less than 1 percent of all children smoking Camels. One year after Joe Camel was introduced, the brand jumped to No. 3 among teenage smokers--from No. 7 to No. 3--because of Joe Camel. This shows a clear relationship between advertising and teen smoking. 
Three months ago, I saw a tape of a television news report where a beautiful 3-year-old girl was able to match the cartoon Joe Camel with the photo of a cigarette. It was chilling. Even a 3-year-old could associate Joe Camel with cigarettes, and it was a positive association. Some have even said more children recognize Joe Camel than Mickey Mouse. It should not be this way in the United States of America. 
Our provisions in this bill with respect to advertising are as follows: The companies would have to agree to ban all outdoor advertising; all Internet advertising; all stadium/arena advertising; sponsorship of athletic, music, and other cultural events; human images in ads; cartoon characters in ads; product placement in movies, TV, video games, youth publications, and live performances; placing tobacco logos on nontobacco merchandise such as hats and T-shirts; color and image advertising except for adult-only locations; all adult magazines and newspapers; music and sound effects in audio and video advertising. 
So, if a company wants to advertise in media other than periodicals, promotional material, and point-of-sale materials, it must give a 30-day notice to the FDA. These are broad, far-reaching restrictions which will severely limit exposure of children to tobacco advertising. 
Senator Hatch has laid out the liability provisions very well. Something I think we have all learned from this debate is that there should be some form of liability cap. That is the incentive--part of it--for the tobacco companies to comply. Our bill caps liability at $5.5 billion. As Senator Hatch stated, it would terminate all Federal, State, and local suits, Castano action, class action, individual preventive addiction and dependency claims. 
But all individual suits will be preserved and allowed to proceed, with the exception of those making addiction or dependency treatment claims for past conduct by the companies. They could continue the addiction and dependency treatment as long as an illness was related. Consolidation would be allowed by court action or by motions to join cases filed by individuals. 
Additionally, as I have mentioned, the Joe Camel suit was actually brought by a county, and yet that suit was jettisoned in the prior legislation. So we require that the states with those counties who have filed suit before 6/20/97--San Francisco, Los Angeles, Cook County, New York City, and Erie county--that they would all be recognized and provided for in this particular bill. 
I want to speak to the look-back provisions for a moment, because we set tough industry targets to reduce youth smoking and they are the following: 15 percent in 3 years, 30 percent in 5 years, 50 percent in 7 years, and 67 percent in 10 years. And the penalties are actually stronger in our bill. The McCain bill, for example, had $40 million penalty per point when the industry is 1 to 5 percent short; we would have $100 million per point. Under McCain, if an industry is 6 to 20 percent short, their penalty 
would be $120 million per point plus $200 million. Ours impose $200 million per point. Under McCain, it imposes a penalty cap of $2 billion per year industry-wide and $5 billion per year company-specific cap; in our bill, it is $5 billion per year for 5 years and $10 billion thereafter industry-wide.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might have 1 minute to sum up and then yield to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana? 
Another provision in our bill that I want to speak to is the antismuggling provision. I heard so many people say, you don't have to worry about a black market, it is not going to happen. There is a black market today in California based on the present $2-per-pack price. The trick really is how the bill phases in per-pack pricing increases plus FDA's regulation of content and nicotine to see that it is done in a way that does not create an increased black market or increased smuggling. We provide in our bill an additional $9.4 billion over 25 years for enforcement of antismuggling provisions. 
So, if the ultimate goal of tobacco legislation is to reduce teen smoking and smoking overall, we believe this bill will pass scrutiny by our colleagues. We offer to work with anyone who cares to work with us. 
I would like very much to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I very much enjoyed working with him on this bill. 
I now yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman. And I thank him very much for all his work in this area. 
I think, just to summarize--and I recognize there is a lot of territorial imperative resounding around this issue. And I hope that can be put into perspective and that we can look to find something around which we can rally. 
True, this is a compromise proposal. I hope it will not be dismissed out of hand. It has a liability cap, yes. It has strong look-back provisions. It provides $428 billion over 25 years. It does divide the money 50-50 to federal and state. The money that goes to the State can be used for 14 specific programs. The money that goes to the federal fund is used for tobacco-related research and public health programs. It does have the FDA provisions. It does have strong advertising provisions. 
Now, as I have talked to people, there is a kind of purist attitude that `Unless a bill is this or that, I won't vote for it.' Well, there are a lot of strong feelings on behalf of all of us. I could say--and it is true--my calls on tobacco reform have run dominantly in the negative, those people opposed to reform. And yet I think there isn't a Member in this body who does not understand that tobacco reform is something that is important, just forged from one statistic--and that is 3,000 young people a day beginning to smoke, and 1,000 of them dying from tobacco-related illnesses. 
We know we have to do something. We do know when you raise the price, teenagers stop or are deterred from buying. If you combine that with a strong no-advertising provision and a strong look-back provision to keep the companies honest, I think you have a bill that is about as good as one can get. 
So I'm very pleased and proud to join with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, once again, to offer to work with whomever in this body so that we might be able to introduce a bill that will be looked upon with favor by a majority. 
I thank Chairman Hatch and I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, although the Senator didn't say this, I am a cosponsor. 
I want to speak briefly about it. I don't believe in the last decade that there has been a more disturbing fact and change of events on the subcontinent of Asia than the detonation of these nuclear tests. They have taken two countries, and indicated to the world that each has a lethal capacity which is far in excess of the bomb that exploded at Hiroshima. 
This morning I detailed the unclassified analyses of what each of these countries has in the type of nuclear weapons, the type of launching devices, the type of plane, and the potential damage in terms of loss of life of humans that could occur. And it is quite mind-boggling. 
This resolution essentially calls upon all freedom-loving countries, all members of the international community, to support the United States in its sanctions against both India and Pakistan. It calls for the Governments of India and Pakistan to commit to no further additional nuclear test, and it urges them to take immediate steps bilaterally, and under the auspices of the United Nations, to reduce tensions between them. 
This morning I indicated how easy these tensions could increase. I mentioned the bomb on a train. I mentioned 25 people killed at a Hindu wedding, a product of Moslem terrorists. Any one of these events could bring about a miscalculation and produce a nuclear holocaust. 
We also in this resolution urge India and Pakistan to take immediate binding and verifiable steps to roll back their nuclear programs and come into compliance with internationally accepted norms regarding proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And we urge our country to reevaluate our bilateral relationship with India and Pakistan in light of the new regional security realities in south Asia with the goal of preventing further nuclear and ballistic missile proliferation, diffusing longstanding regional rivalry between India and Pakistan, and securing commitments from them, which, if carried out, could result in a calibrated lifting of U.S. sanctions imposed under the Arms Export Control Act and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. 
Mr. President, I believe that this resolution has been cleared on all sides. I would certainly urge its passage by voice vote.

I would just like to make this comment and really express my profound disappointment. For those of us that are somewhat, relatively new to this body, I think to see a very consequential piece of legislation come a cropper in this way is extraordinarily disappointing. Obviously, what has happened is to kill tobacco reform. 
There is no question about how it is being done. There is no search for alternatives. There is no search for where there may be a consensus in this body. And I think there are points where there is consensus. I deeply believe a bill can be put together which can deter teen smoking.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I finish my train of thought for a moment? 
That there is the possibility--I watched the McCain bill come out of committee. And then I watched the amendments go on. And then we sat down to do our due diligence and took a look at the impact that the amendments have on the bill. The Gramm and Coverdell amendment took $16.8 billion off of it. The marriage penalty took, I think, around $31 billion off of it. It ate up all but a very small amount of the public health money. 
Yet the very party that put these amendments on a tobacco public health bill--drugs, taxes--now is going to kill that bill, and no calling together any kind of opportunity for consensus. 
I make no secret that I have been working with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to try to put something together. It isn't perfect. It took what we saw were points at issue here and put them in a form where we thought there could be concurrence. And yet the way we are going to leave this debate, I have no doubt that the Republican Members of the U.S. Senate are clearly going to kill any form of tobacco reform; they are going to kill campaign-spending reform and they are going to kill tobacco reform. I, for one, who tries very hard to work across the aisle, find that just reprehensible. 
Mr. Majority Leader, I would sincerely hope that there would be some leadership to take the remnants of what we can do and put it in a bill to send to the House. I have no other--I tried now----

Now, Mr. Majority Leader, based on what you are saying, there will be no bill at all that would go to conference; ergo no bill, period. That is what I find very disturbing. 
I am prepared to vote for the McCain bill, with the view that it goes to conference, and perhaps some of the ideas that Senator Hatch and I, and others, Senator Jeffords, Senator Breaux, Senator Torricelli have--that might prevail in a conference setting. So I will just, most respectfully, urge you to reconsider, vote out this bill. Let us not give up the issue of tobacco reform.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Alan Bersin, a valued colleague and extraordinary public servant. During his four and half years as United States Attorney for the Southern District of California, the office became one of the premier prosecutorial offices in the country. Under Alan Bersin's leadership the caseload was transformed from one dominated by misdemeanor prosecutions to the largest number of felony prosecutions in the nation. 
As the chief law enforcement officer along the most populous sector of the Southwest Border with Mexico, Alan Bersin has made border enforcement his highest priority, and is perhaps best known for his work as the Attorney General's Special Representative for Southwest Border Issues. He was appointed to the position in October 1995 at a time when the government was seeking new leadership and energy to deal with the proliferation of illegal activity along the southwest border which had become the principal corridor for smuggling of aliens and drugs into the country. Alan Bersin targeted for prosecution the large drug distributors and cartels on both sides of the border, and the repeat border crossers with felony records. He also coordinated resources in a manner never before attempted. Largely as a result of these strategic approaches, crime in the Southern District of California decreased 40 percent during Alan Bersin's tenure. 
Shortly after taking office in 1994, Alan Bersin reached an historic accord with the San Diego District Attorney whereby the county, for the first time in San Diego history, prosecuted drug smuggling case which had a San Diego nexus. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in border drug smuggling prosecutions that is unprecedented, and has allowed the federal government to use its unique resources such as wire tap authority, to focus on the more serious violators. Alan Bersin also helped create a Specialized Drug Enforcement Operation in Imperial Valley which served as a prime trafficking route of the Mexican drug cartels. The special enforcement unit involves 17 federal, state and local drug-related law enforcement agencies, the California National Guard and the Department of Defense. Alan Bersin's ability to bring together enforcement agencies at all levels to cooperate in a number of successful enforcement initiatives has been praised by local, state and federal law enforcement leaders. Also, his ability to coordinate with our neighbor to the South has been most extraordinary. He worked tirelessly to bridge the cultural and political divide in a way that enabled both countries to see that it was in their best interests to find areas of mutual concern and work together to the maximum extent feasible, even though there are other areas on which we will continue to disagree. 
As the patterns of illegal migration changed in response to increased law enforcement personnel and resources, criminal activity moved to new areas along the border. Under Alan Bersin's leadership both countries implemented collaborative programs to prevent criminal activity and to apprehend criminals who oftentimes preyed upon undocumented aliens. Alan Bersin also oversaw the creation of a civil rights working group comprised of federal law enforcement, immigrant rights' advocacy groups from San Diego and Tijuana, the Mexican Consulate in San Diego, the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana and the United States Attorney's Office to bring to the table all those affected by or involved in the enforcement of civil rights laws. The group provides assistance to investigators in locating evidence on both sides of the border to prove allegations of abuse. Other innovative programs launched during Alan Bersin's tenure include helping to establish a Binational Environmental Laboratory to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of environmental cases in Mexico and the U.S. 
Mexico is not the only sovereignty with whom Alan Bersin negotiated well and successfully. At a time when Indian gaming was becoming an enormously difficult and controversial issue in California, and aspects of the issue were being litigated in both state and federal courts, Alan Bersin managed to maintain a level playing field on a government to government basis between the State of California and the Native American tribes of San Diego County. 
Finally, in addition to the official law enforcement achievements during the last four years, Alan Bersin has added a new dimension to public service. By example and by encouragement, he has increased enormously the involvement of his staff in community projects, ranging from training programs to mentoring and public outreach. His commitment to the community will continue as he begins a new career as Superintendent of Schools for the San Diego Unified School District. I am confident he will bring to that position the same vision, inspiring leadership and commitment which made him such an outstanding United States Attorney. He has brought great credit to his office, to the Justice Department and to the nation. Congratulations Alan, and best wishes for every success as Superintendent of the San Diego Unified School District.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the U.S. Customs Service and the Departments of Treasury and Justice for one of the most important victories they have had in the war on drugs to date. 
I would like to thank Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, and Undersecretary of the Treasury for Law Enforcement Ray Kelly for their leadership in this important endeavor and the two hundred U.S. Customs agents, who put their lives at stake, diligently and tirelessly for thirty months, to establish this necessary beachhead in the war on drugs. It is a testament to the dedication and the ability of our law enforcement personnel that they were able to complete this difficult and dangerous operation. 
On Monday, May 18, Secretary Rubin and Attorney General Reno announced the arrests of 112 people involved in illegal drug money-laundering in Mexico, which resulted in the seizure of an anticipated $157 million in over 100 accounts in the United States, the Caribbean and Europe. Furthermore, 4 tons of marijuana and 2 tons of cocaine were seized during this 30-month undercover investigation. The indictments include officials from 12 of Mexico's 19 largest banks, who stand accused of knowingly abetting drug traffickers to launder hundreds of millions of dollars. 
As a result of this investigation, for the first time ever, Mexican banks have been directly linked to money laundering and have been indicted as institutions due to their complicity in money-laundering, the significant number of employees involved, the large number of illegal transactions, and the institution-wide profiting from these illegal transfers, which brought a 4-5% fee per transfer. Bancomer, Mexico's second largest bank, Banca Serfin, Mexico's third-largest bank, and Confia, also among the top twenty, were the three banks involved. 
This investigation, known as `Operation Casablanca', involved two hundred undercover Customs agents, targeting the Cali cocaine and heroine syndicate in Colombia, the Juarez cartel in Mexico, and the involvement of Mexican banks. Two hundred individuals face arrest warrants as the investigations continue, including warrants issued for the Juarez cartel money manager, Victor Alcala Navarro and one of its leaders, Jose Alvarez Tostado. 
I would also like to show my support for the Federal Reserve's issuance of `cease and desist' orders suspending the U.S. operations of Banca Serfin, Bancomer, Banamex, Bital of Mexico and Banco Santander of Spain, because of `serious deficiencies in their anti-money laundering programs.' These banks must institute new and tougher controls to resume business in the United States. 
Despite Mexico's lax enforcement of its own money-laundering statutes, it is good to see that the United States is not afraid to use its own resources to address this serious problem. 
I hope that operations like these will continue to bleed the powerful drug cartels. The American and the international drug war has benefited from this peek into the intricacies of drug-related money laundering. 
However, Mr. President, I cannot help but see this latest good news in relation to my concerns about Mexico's insufficient counternarcotics cooperation with the United States. The Mexican government was not informed of this 3-year, extensive investigation until the same morning the press was. Why not? It would seem that this would have been a perfect opportunity to engage in a cooperative law enforcement effort. 
The Administration's certification of Mexico for its counternarcotics cooperation in March certainly suggests that a major investigation like `Operation Casablanca' would have been a joint effort. However, the reality is that distrust between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement has strained relations and hurt earlier cooperative efforts. 
Undersecretary Ray Kelly, who has been nominated to be the chief of the Customs Service, answered this question in an article of The Washington Post on May 19th. The Mexican authorities were not informed, `Because of fear of compromising the operation and placing the lives of U.S. agents in danger.' 
Since the announcement of the indictments this week, the Mexican government has made statements in support of this operation, and the Mexican Attorney General indicated that his office will investigate these banks as well. 
I just hope that this will result in tougher Mexican laws against drug traffickers and money-launderers and progress toward real cooperation to halt the flow of drugs across our borders, rather than the erratic and insufficient cooperation that we have seen until now. Let the Mexican government take this opportunity to prove their commitment to fighting the spread and profit of drugs. Let this be the start of a new concerted and cooperative effort to rid our countries of this menace.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a general statement about the legislation. 
Let me say this to begin with: I am very concerned by the speed with which this bill has come to the floor. It has really foreclosed any real financial analysis--no joint tax figures that are adequate, no CRS analysis, no CBO study. 
For me, who represents California, there is a certain irony in passing a bill under these conditions. That irony is what we do that we believe is right for people may turn out to be very harmful for those very people. 
And I want to say what I mean by this. I want us to pass a good bill. What is a good bill? It is one that deters smoking; it doesn't create a huge black market; it is constitutional; it would give the FDA full authority to regulate the contents of nicotine; it would prohibit all advertising, which to me is very important, not the kind of crimped regulations, but a prohibition on all advertising; and it would have some strong antismuggling provisions, both domestic and international. 
We have heard Senators state the facts. Forty million Americans smoke today. Most of them are addicted. I don't think we have heard the California facts. Earlier, I was listening to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska say he was speaking on behalf of 1.6 million Nebraskans. My goodness, in California alone, three times the population of the State of Nebraska smokes. We have 4.6 million smokers in California who are adults; that is, 19 percent of the population of the State of California smokes. You can figure how many of those people you believe are truly addicted, who would like to quit but can't. 
Ten percent of our youngsters smoke; that is, 890,000 young people in California smoke. Let me give you a really chilling figure. One out of every four high school senior is addicted to nicotine. One out of every four high school senior in the largest State in the Union is addicted to nicotine. That is why I say an express prohibition on all advertising is important to the success of any antismoking effort. 
Mr. President, 1.8 billion packs of cigarettes are sold in California each year. On a per capita basis, 54 packs of cigarettes are consumed in California each year by every man, woman, and child in the State. And there are more than 32 million of us in that State. We already have a 37-cent State tax. We have a 24-cent Federal tax. And on the ballot in November is an initiative placed there by Rob Reiner, which would put on 50 cents additional. So we will be over a dollar in tobacco taxes in the State of California before this body and the other body do anything at all. 
In California, 300 young people under the age of 18 begin smoking daily. We all know the health consequences. Just yesterday, my closest and oldest friend called. She had just been diagnosed with lung cancer. She quit smoking 30 years ago. Just the day before, I learned of the husband of a very close friend of mine who just had a tumor, stage 4, the size of a softball diagnosed in his lungs. So we all see this happening to us every day. A good friend of mine just died from lung cancer --a lifetime smoker. 
The hard part is not that we don't want to do something, but whether what we do is right. What really will turn around the teenage trap of smoking and addiction? What is the right balance of penalties, pressures, regulations, and health research for the next 25 years? If the goal of this legislation is to reduce and limit youth smoking, and not just creating a spending bill, we must address the link between price of cigarette packs, the ratcheting down of nicotine, if the FDA has full regulatory authority, a black market, and the availability of cigarettes to children. We need to make certain that we don't increase the price of cigarettes so high that it becomes lucrative for smugglers and for organized crime to become involved in cigarette smuggling so that, like cocaine, cheap black-market cigarettes will be available on street corners in cities all over our country. 
Mr. President, there is already a black market in California. It is a substantial black market, and it is based on just the taxes I have mentioned so far--a 37-cent State tax and a 24-cent Federal tax. The State estimates they lose between $20 million and $50 million a year in revenues. 
We have all heard in the Judiciary Committee commentary that when the per-pack price increases beyond $3.60 to $4 a pack--this takes into consideration what the public health people said could be added to a pack--about $2--and what the industry analysts said, anything over $3 to $3.50--at that point we would create a 
black market in this country, unmatched by what happened in Canada in the 1980s. 
I believe that, as I understand the McCain bill, within 5 years in the State of California, with the item on the ballot, you will have a black market in cigarettes unmatched by anything in history. According to an independent industry analyst, the price per pack in 1997 dollar terms, under the Commerce bill, would be $4.61. In California, with what is on the ballot in June, that will make it $5 a pack. If you include inflation, the McCain legislation would be $4.61, and that becomes $5.11 if you add the 50 cents that is on the ballot in my State in November. That is above anything that anyone has said would be the trigger point to create a black market in the State. This is a 25-year prospect, so the numbers only go up from there. 
At the Judiciary Committee hearing 2 weeks ago, John Hugh, the senior assistant attorney general of the State of Washington stated: 
As tax rates have risen generally across the United States, a new trend is emerging. Increasingly, tobacco products manufactured outside the United States are being smuggled into the United States and are sold on the contraband market. In 1988, California increased its tobacco tax from 18 percent to 35 percent per pack. Today, the contraband market is estimated to be between 17 and 23 percent of the cigarettes sold. 
The impact of cigarette smuggling is enormous for this country and most particularly for my State. First, there is, obviously, the loss of State excise tax revenues, which I said were $20 million to $50 million annually now. 
Second, we have no control over the safety of cigarettes that are smuggled in from overseas. For example, tobacco from China is much harsher, and the cigarettes are much more carcinogenic. And that is a very likely contraband potential black market today. Even though all 50 States have laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to people under 18, Federal sting operations show that four in ten teen smokers nationwide today succeed in evading such laws. 
Individuals, including teens, find ways to buy available cheaper cigarettes. In Canada, when they increased tobacco prices by 150 percent in the 1980s, it is estimated that 40 percent of the cigarettes in Canada may have been contraband U.S. cigarettes, where a carton of Canadian cigarettes was $37 compared to $14 for U.S. cigarettes. 
We also heard testimony about how a smugglers' ally developed in an area between Cornwall, ON, and Messina, NY, the epicenter of the Canadian contraband cigarette crisis. 
It goes on and on and on with testimony. 
There is a very real probability that within 5 years in California there will be a major black market, if the McCain's per pack tax plus what happens on the ballot in California in June all go into law. 
With almost 890,000 youngsters smoking, with one out of every four high school seniors addicted to nicotine, what prospects do we have, then, of really reducing teenage smoking unless we can get full regulatory FDA authority, and unless we can prohibit all advertising, which I don't believe we will be able to constitutionally do unless the tobacco companies will agree to ban all advertising. To me, a ban of all advertising is really going to be important if we want to help youngsters to not smoke. 
Let me tell you two things about the McCain bill that I cannot live with. 
I will shortly be introducing an amendment, along with Senators Boxer and Durbin, to cure an injustice in the McCain bill's treatment of local government. As presently drafted, the bill would wipe out the suits that several local governments have filed against the tobacco industry without providing a dime of compensation. That is simply unfair. The McCain bill currently would prevent local governments from sharing in any of the settlement funds now being provided for in the United States. San Francisco was the first local government to sue. It sued in June of 1996. The suit was joined in by 17 other California cities and counties representing over half of the population of the State of California. Local governments in three other States have also sued the tobacco industry. New York City; Erie County, NY; Cook County, IL; the City of Birmingham, AL; and Los Angeles County brought their own suits. These local governments have been litigating against the tobacco industry for 2 years. As a matter of fact, it was the California cities and counties which resolved the Joe Camel case in California. And as a result of that case R.J. Reynolds agreed to pull the infamous Joe Camel campaign. R.J. Reynolds was required to disclose its confidential marketing documents. The release of those documents was front-page news across the country. 
The California county lawsuit is set for trial early next year. In the absence of Federal legislation, the California counties and other local governments would expect to recover appropriate compensation as a result of the trial or the settlement of these cases. The legislation coming out of the Commerce Committee jettisoned all of these suits. 
That is my first major point of a grievance with the McCain legislation, in addition to it moving so fast and the cost such that I believe it creates a major black market. 
The second objection is that the formula for distribution in the State disadvantages 26 States because it is based on an agreement among the Attorney Generals and not on general population census figures. For example, in California, if you use the population percentage as a formula mix, what happens is California's share of revenues is increased 4 percent. And that is 
9 percent to 12 percent, and that is a third net additional cost for 26 other States to which we have sent a Dear Colleague letter out today letting them know about this. 
It is no secret that I have been working with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the distinguished Senator from Utah, on a bill that might well avoid some of these problems--avoid the black market for California, cover local suits and county suits, provide a formula which is really based on what we are trying to do, which is to stop youth smoking, and it makes sense in many other ways. 
Particularly, let me stress again that unless whatever we do here has some encouragement for the tobacco industry to agree not to advertise, the only prohibition we can probably impose, or perhaps--I say perhaps--some of those in the FDA rules, and even that will be litigated and even that will hold up the legislation probably for 5 to 10 years. 
I notice the distinguished Senator from Utah is on the floor. I wonder if I might ask him this question. I have had the privilege of serving with him on the Judiciary Committee for 5 1/2 years now. I regard him as a strong and positive constitutional expert. 
Based on what the Senator from Utah knows of the Commerce Committee bill, does the Senator believe it will be contested in court, and does he believe that it will withstand a constitutional test?

To the Senator's knowledge, is there any sound analysis by a governmental entity such as CRS, CBO, or Joint Tax on the actual per-pack costs of this bill out 25 years?

And I do know we have 5 million smokers, and almost a million juvenile smokers, in the State of California. And I do know that by all the testimony we had in the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, that if the price in 5 years is over $5 a pack, we have a whopping black market on our hands. 
Would you agree with that?

But the figures for California really, if the tax passes in June, indicate that the tax in this bill, plus that tax, would be substantially above $5 within 5 years.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am very concerned about it, because, again, we have 40 million smokers in the United States, 5 million of them in California. There is a huge market. There is a huge number of people already addicted, and as the price per pack, plus reduction of smokers, comes into play, the opportunity for a black market increases, and particularly if you begin to ratchet down the addicting chemical which is nicotine. 
It is a serious question. I am surprised, frankly, that people really don't want to know more about it. I, frankly, am surprised that there is a rush to judgment. It seems to me that because of what we are doing is for 25 years, we better be right. I don't want to see in my State a huge black market in 5 years and know that I voted to help make that market possible.

One of the concerns I have is that it becomes a real pawn for organized criminal elements that also brings on other serious repercussions. But I don't want the Senator from Utah, or anybody else, to mistake me. I want to see us have a bill. I want to see us have a bill that is going to be able to do the job, rather than have adverse, unintended consequences.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I am aware of it. I am also glad that the Senator from Utah is mentioning this, because one of the most discouraging things here has been the rush to judgment, has been the feeling of many people, very well-meaning, very much wanting to see legislation in place, that if you pause to consider these impacts, somehow you are un-American, somehow you are pro-tobacco. And yet, as we know, the devil is in the details with all of these things. It really is the long-term effect of a bill that we need to consider carefully. 
That is one of the reasons I have been, frankly, opposed to the speed with which this bill is being pushed, and I think it is being pushed so that we don't have this information in front of us, so that we don't understand the repercussions, so that a bill gets passed and everybody can pound their chests and say what a wonderful job we have done and then, boom, in 4 years, there can be a cataclysmic event like a big black-market operation.

Not only are we not playing a game, certainly no one in this body has asked me, representing the State, what would be the impact of a bill on the largest State in the Union with the most smokers by far in California, with the most young people. 
I came to this body to use my brain, to try to work for my State and try to see that whatever it is that I vote for doesn't have unintended consequences. 
I think all the purpose of this colloquy is to say that there may very well be serious, unintended consequences, heightened by the fact that we are moving so fast without any major governmental analysis of the long-term, per-pack costs and what those costs might do when you measure elasticity, diminished market demand and a diminution of nicotine in a regulatory order by the FDA. 
These are very serious things. I think they deserve consideration, and I thank you very much.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think that is right. I think what has happened is that we have seen a net figure applied as a gross figure when in fact it is just a beginning figure. It becomes an arbitrary cost added, and then there are all these other costs that come on top that are not factored in. 
I think that is why we need a very thorough, objective report on what actual street prices of cigarettes will be, what you get them for in your 7-11, what you buy them for in your supermarket, what it will be with inflated dollars in 5 years. 
If we know that with specificity, then I think we can make some informed judgments as to whether, in each of our respective States, this is apt to create a black market or not apt to create a black market. We then can relate this data to the distribution table that Joint Tax has done so you know what portion of this falls on the lowest-income people versus the highest-income people.

The beauty of our bill, if people should be interested, is that we have tried to avoid that problem.

Let me once again sum up, because I know the distinguished Senator from Maine is waiting, and I do want to thank the Senator from Utah for his leadership not only of the Judiciary Committee but in what we have been working on. I hope if people might be interested they would let us know. 
In the meantime, I am really not prepared, based on the analytical data--and we have tried to get every single piece we could--to cast a vote which has repercussions for a quarter of a century and which would have repercussions on a State where 5 million people smoke and almost a million youngsters and one out of every four high school seniors is addicted to nicotine. Until I have some of these answers and we know what the impact on the streets in Los Angeles, in San Francisco, in Fresno, in San Diego, is going to be 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, and 25 years hence--then we can cast an informed vote, and then we can go home and say we really have done something good for the people we represent. 
I thank the Chair. I apologize and I thank the Senator from Maine for her forbearance. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, along with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and Senators Boxer and Kerry, I am introducing the Personal Privacy Protection Act. This legislation narrowly targets threatening and endangering harassment and privacy abuses undertaken by the stalker press. 
Freedom of the press is the bedrock of American Democracy. But there is something wrong when a person cannot visit a loved one in the hospital, walk their child to school, or be secure in the privacy of their own home without being dangerously chased, provoked, or trespassed upon by photographers trying to capture pictures of them to sell to the tabloids. 
When people find themselves in the public eye due to a personal tragedy or circumstances beyond their control, they should not be put into personal fear of bodily injury by tabloid media persistently chasing them. And just because a person makes their living on television or in the movies should not mean they forfeit all rights to personal privacy. There is a line between legitimate news gathering and invasion of privacy; between snapping a picture of someone in a public place and chasing them to the point where they fear for their safety; between reporting the news and trespassing on private property. Unfortunately, today that line is crossed more and more frequently by an increasingly aggressive cadre of fortune-seekers with cameras. 
I began the process of developing this legislation together with Senator Boxer more than a year ago, after meeting with members of the Screen Actors Guild and hearing about the abuses people suffer every day at the hands of the stalker press--photographers using telephoto lenses to peer into private homes, cars chasing them off the road, having their children stalked and harassed. The tragic death of Princess Diana last August brought the seriousness of the problem home with a blunt force that stunned the world. 
This legislation is narrowly drafted. It is not aimed at, nor would it affect, the overwhelming majority of those in the media, but is specifically aimed at abusive, threatening tactics employed by some who do not respect where the line is between what is public and what is private. 
The Personal Privacy Protection Act would do two basic things. First, it would make it a crime, punishable by a fine and up to a year in prison, to persistently follow or chase someone in order to photograph, film, or record them for commercial purposes, in a manner that causes a reasonable fear of bodily injury. Cases in which the persistent following or chasing actually caused serious bodily injury would be punishable by up 
to 5 years in prison, and where the actions caused death, by up to 20 years in prison. The legislation would also allow victims of such actions to bring a civil suit to recover compensatory and punitive damages and for injunctive and declaratory relief. 
Second, the legislation would allow civil actions to be brought against those who trespass on private property in order to photograph, film, or record someone for commercial purposes. In such cases, the bill would allow victims to bring suit in Federal court to recover compensatory and punitive damages and to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief. 
Furthermore, in certain specified circumstances, the bill would prevent `technological trespass.' Specifically, the legislation would allow a civil action where a visual or auditory enhancement device is used to capture images or recordings that could not otherwise have been captured without trespassing. This provision would apply only to images or recordings of a personal or familial activity, captured for commercial purposes, and only where the subject had a reasonable expectation of privacy. In such cases, the victim would be allowed to bring suit in Federal court to recover compensatory and punitive damages and to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief. In the case of trespass or technological trespass, only a civil suit by the victim would be allowed; no criminal penalty would be prescribed. 
This legislation is needed because existing laws fail to protect against dangerous and abusive tactics. Although existing laws may cover some instances of abusive harassment or trespass by the stalker press, victims cannot be certain of protection. Existing state laws form at best a patchwork of protection, and courts often make an exception for activity undertaken ostensibly for `news gathering' purposes. 
For example, state and local harassment law are often not codified and may require exhaustive litigation to enforce. These vary from state to state and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and often do not apply in cases involving the media. Some statutes require proof of an intent to harass; and courts in some jurisdictions may allow a broad `news gathering' exception. 
Similarly, reckless endangerment statutes in some states prohibit recklessly engaging in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person. However, these laws are not uniform and their application is very spotty when it comes to dealing with abusive media practices. 
Federal, state, and local anti-stalking ordinances often contain loopholes and generally do not apply to activities undertaken for commercial purposes. The Federal anti-stalking ordinance and 28 of the 49 state anti-stalking ordinances--including California's--require proof of the criminal intent to cause fear in order to prosecute. 
Existing state trespass laws may be insufficient to protect an owner from an invasion of privacy. For example, an Oregon Court of Appeals upheld a jury verdict for a TV news crew that filmed a police raid in executing a warrant to search the owner's 
home, despite the fact that the TV crew had entered the property without permission, because the jury found that the intrusion was not `highly offensive' so as to invade the owner's privacy. 
Furthermore, existing trespass laws fail to protect against technological trespass using intrusive technology such as telephoto lenses and parabolic microphones aimed at bedrooms, living rooms, and fenced backyards in which people ought to have an expectation of privacy. Because trespass law requires actual physical invasion, it does not protect against such invasive tactics. 
In crafting this legislation, we worked with some of the most renowned Constitutional scholars and First Amendment advocates in the nation, including Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern California Law School, Cass Sunstein of the Chicago School of Law, and Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School. At their recommendation, we took the approach of plugging loopholes in existing, long-recognized laws prohibiting harassment and trespassing, rather than creating new provisions out of whole cloth, in order to craft a constitutional bill that fully respects First Amendment and other constitutional rights. This bill does so. The Constitutional scholars concurred unanimously that this legislation is narrowly drafted to withstand constitutional challenge on First Amendment, federalism, or any other grounds. 
Mr. President, finally, I should mention that we worked closely with Representative Sonny Bono on this legislation prior to his untimely death, and it was Representative Bono's intention to introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives. I am deeply saddened that he is not alive today to do so.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, very shortly, Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, will be presenting an amendment which I will strongly support. It is very similar to the amendment which was offered in committee, proposed both by the Senator from Massachusetts and myself representing California. I voted for it then, and I will vote for it now. 
I did in committee also vote for the Abraham bill, because Senator Abraham is correct, there is a problem. The high-tech industry is consistently turning to foreign nationals to fill low-level computer-related jobs. 
In my State of California, this is a very big deal. High tech currently provides about 814,000 jobs in California. That is 18 1/2 percent of the total California employment. So it is a substantial industry. When this industry says to their Senator, `We can't hire high school or college graduates to fill our needs,' I obviously have to be very concerned. 
I have become very saddened by our high-tech CEOs who repeatedly tell me they cannot find qualified workers. As a matter of fact, during the hearings in the Judiciary Subcommittee, we even heard one CEO say that they advertised a brand new, I think it was a Ford Mustang for any individual who would take one of these computer-related jobs. 
Senator Abraham is correct, the industry will reach the cap of 65,000 by May of this year. As Senator Abraham stated, this presents a very serious problem. 
Let's talk for a moment about this 65,000 cap and the way it is now. The 1996 Labor Department report shows that only 41 percent of the H-1Bs presently are computer-related professions. Another 26 percent are physical therapists and health professionals. It is not only computer-related people who are 
presently coming into this country on a H-1B visa, 26 percent of them are physical therapists, which is kind of canny to me to think we can't find American health therapists for these jobs? The IG's report also shows that some H-1B employers have contracted their employees out to other companies functioning as job shops, companies that hire predominantly or exclusively H-1B's and contract them out. Current law does not prohibit this practice of running these job shops, despite the concern that these job shops are paying the H-1B's less than the prevailing wage and have a negative impact on the American worker's ability to keep his or her job. 
The 1996 Labor Department report also indicates that 48 percent of employment-based, permanent immigration is admitted through the H-1B program, and this is a major point I want to make. The H-1B program is not necessarily just a temporary worker program. Fifty percent of these workers achieve permanent status and remain in this country essentially forever. This is a big problem. 
From the CRS report on this issue, dated May 13, 1998, I read the following:  
In practical terms, the H-1B visa links the foreign student to legal permanent residence. Anecdotal accounts-- 
And I think Senator Abraham mentioned correctly that we really don't know; the recordkeeping in this program is very bad-- 
Anecdotal accounts tell of foreign students who are hired by U.S. firms as they are completing their programs. The employers obtain H-1B visas for the recent graduates, and if the employees meet expectations, the employers may also petition for the nonimmigrants to become legal permanent residents, through one of the employment-based immigration categories. Some policymakers consider this a natural and positive chain of events, arguing that it would be foolish to educate these talented young people, only to make them leave to work for foreign competitors. Others consider this a pathway program. 
This is really my point and my concern about the Abraham legislation. The Abraham legislation essentially is a 5-year program, and over 5 years, it would permit 555,000 new foreign nationals to come into this country, 50 percent of whom would remain. This is the 555,000 that is specially targeted for high tech by the Abraham legislation. However, the Abraham legislation also provides an additional 10,000 workers per year for non-high-tech jobs. That is a total of 50,000 over 5 years. So when you add that together over 5 years, this is an additional 605,000 foreign workers coming into this country, taking jobs which many of us believe should be filled by American young people, American high school and college graduates. This is over a 77-percent increase in numbers, Mr. President. 
The amendment that Senator Kennedy will offer is essentially a 3-year program which is a total of only 270,000 workers coming in targeted for high tech over the 3 years. The program would sunset after 3 years, and we would have an opportunity to take a good look at that program at the end of that period of time, hopefully have better records by then and hopefully be better aware of what the needs are after that period of time. 
I mentioned that there are about 815,000 high-tech workers in this country in California alone. So this is really a huge new immigration program over 5 years. Nobody should think to the contrary. It will let in over 600,000 foreign nationals, one-half of whom, by our own past statistics, will remain in this country as legal aliens able to work in this country. In other words, they will have green cards, and they will continue to go from temporary worker to permanent worker, thereby taking up a job which an American young person could occupy. 
Now, this troubles me. It really troubles me. And the reason it troubles me is because these workers are not necessarily superstars. The superstars come in. These are lower level computer programmers. They really are $50,000-a-year job occupants. 
As a matter of fact, there is a chart that essentially shows the salaries. Seventy-five percent of the workers who have been coming in under this program are at salaries from $25,000 to $50,000. So these are not, in the main, the jobs of $100,000 or more. These are exactly the jobs that graduates of the new age, graduates into the global economy from our schools all over the United States should be taking to develop a sinecure in an industry that is only going to bloom in the future. 
So I am troubled by the Abraham bill's numbers. Again, they are 605,000 over 5 years. And 550,000 would go for high-tech workers as opposed to the amendment that Senator Kennedy will shortly make, which would be a 3-year program, 270,000 jobs. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor at the present time. 
Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The amendment that the Senator from Massachusetts will propose will not have a 3-year limit on it at this time. That was our bill we had in committee. Rather, it will require that employers look for American workers first before they hire foreign workers and that they have not laid off American workers 6 months prior or 3 months after they put in an application. 
So I am happy to be able to make that clarification. And I believe Senator Kennedy will be here momentarily. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution expressing concern over the continuing deterioration of the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan, and calling on the administration to increase its efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and to protect the human rights of Afghan women. 
I am joined in this resolution by Senators Brownback, Dodd, and Landrieu. 
Mr. President, every day the women of Afghanistan are excluded from the international community's prevailing vision of human rights, and continue to lack basic legal rights, access to education, and access to economic opportunity. Indeed, perhaps nowhere in the world today is there a clearer test of our commitment to the cause of women's rights than Afghanistan. 
In March of this year I convened a meeting with leading Non-Governmental organizations, the Administration, and Afghan women themselves to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and what options are available to the international community to make the lives of Afghanistan's women better. 
Among those participating were representatives of the Department of State, the International Commission of the Red Cross, Save the Children, the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, Women in Refugee Development, and the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan, among others. 
We discussed the legacy of close to twenty years of war and bloodshed which has torn apart Afghanistan: More than 1 million people have died, and much of the capital of Kabul lies in ruins. 
There are more than 50,000 war widows in Kabul alone, many dependent on international humanitarian assistance for their very survival. The ICRC, for example, distributes food to some 15,000 widows in Kabul. 
According to Theresa Loar, the State Department's Senior Coordinator for Women's Issues, in the 1980s a growing number of Afghan women worked outside the home. There were female lawyers, judges, doctors, and teachers. This trend was reversed in 1992 and now, under the Taliban, `women and girls became, and remain today, virtually invisible.' 
Education is a major concern, where edicts prevent girls from attending school and receiving an education. A small, low-profile, `home school' movement has started, with an estimated 6,500 girls and boys attending classes in Kabul. These home schools, however, are no substitute for access to a real education. 
On September 6, 1997 the Taliban government issued a statement demanding that admission of female patients to hospitals cease immediately, and that all female medical staff stop working. After negotiations with the ICRC the Taliban government reconsidered, but women still face great difficulties in getting access to medical care. 
Many Non-Governmental Organizations are doing work which I can describe as nothing short of heroic to provide medical and humanitarian assistance under the most adverse of circumstances. But they are faced with numerous constraints, from difficulties in collecting data and verifying beneficiary cards, to laws and practices which prevent the distribution of assistance or services directly to the women in need.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, before I send an amendment to the desk, if I may, I would like to make one comment on the remarks posed to the body by the Senator from New York with respect to the legislation that we cosponsored. 
I want to congratulate him for getting this legislation on the tobacco bill. 
I also want to express my dismay that this route has been taken and that an amendment which is very direct cannot get by this body any other way. 
Mr. President, every day women of this country are being subjected to a mastectomy being performed in the morning and being pushed out on the streets that afternoon. It is called a `same-day mastectomy,' a `drive-through mastectomy.' I never thought in my lifetime that I would see the medical profession in a position where the length of hospital stay could not be determined by the physician. 
All we would do in this amendment is say that the length of a woman's hospital stay, having had a mastectomy, would be based on the advice and knowledge of her physician. Whether she has a radical mastectomy, what her reaction to anesthesia is, what her preconditions are, all should be party to that decision, and not some HMO that says henceforth all major surgical procedures called mastectomies will be conducted on a same-day basis. This, to me, is bad medicine. 
We also, as the Senator said, simply provide that the insurance company must provide for reconstructive surgery or prosthetic surgery, and that the doctor cannot be penalized for recommending additional treatment for the woman. 
It seems to me, Mr. President, that we owe this simple gesture to the women of America, because to say to any woman that she has to go into a hospital for major, major surgery and is going to get pushed out on the street--I would hazard a guess that there isn't a man in this room who wants to have major surgery, leave with two to four drains in their body, having had a general anesthetic, and losing a significant portion of their torso, and hear, `You cannot stay overnight in the hospital no matter how you feel.' 
So I hope that the leadership of this body, hearing the capacity, the energy, the stubbornness of the Senator from New York, would really realize that the better part of valor is to allow us to have an up-or-down vote on this amendment. It seems to me, humbly stating, that this is the way this body should, in fact, function.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill to express the concern of this body and condemnation of the recent Indian nuclear tests. 
Mr. President, this is a sense of the Senate. Before I go into the provisions of it, let me state what I understand the facts to be. 
In the last 2 days, there have been five underground nuclear tests in India about 70 miles from the border of Pakistan. According to Prime Minister Vajpayee of India, there was a fission device, a low-yield device, and a thermonuclear device. 
According to the Carnegie Foundation, India is estimated to have approximately 400 kilograms of weapons-usable plutonium. Given that it takes about 6 kilograms of plutonium to construct a basic plutonium bomb, this amount would be sufficient for 65 bombs. With a more sophisticated design, it is possible that this estimate could go as high as 90 bombs. 
India also possesses several different aircraft capable of nuclear delivery, including the Jaguar, the Mirage 2,000, the MiG-27, and the MiG-29. India has 2 missile systems potentially capable of delivering a nuclear weapon: The Prithvi, which can carry a 1,000-kilogram payload to approximately 150 kilometers or a 500-kilometer payload to 250 kilometers; and the Agni, a two-stage, medium-range missile which can conceivably carry a 1,000-kilogram payload as far as 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers. 
India, according to a report, has possibly deployed, or at the very least is storing, conventionally armed Prithvi missiles in Punjab very near the Pakistani border. 
Mr. President, it is no secret that there are intense feelings between these two nations. Pakistan and India, up to late, have been very difficult adversaries. More recently--this makes these detonations even more concerning--I think there has been a kind of rapprochement. 
And we hopefully were seeing some improvement in the relations between these two countries. 
Mr. President, I can hardly think of a more important issue to the interests of the United States than preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As the Secretary of State said the other day, this Nation has no other agenda than peace and stability throughout the world. And that, indeed, is an agenda to which I believe this body can wholeheartedly subscribe. So each State that acquires nuclear weapons creates additional complications in maintaining international security. 
In south Asia today it appears to be too late to talk about preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Both countries, India and Pakistan, now clearly have nuclear capability. And ultimately India must determine for itself whether its interests are best served by ridding South Asia of weapons of mass destruction or by turning the region into a potential nuclear battleground. That, I think, is no less the decision that has to be made. 
We all hope that India will choose the course of deescalation, of standing down, of beginning to reduce its nuclear arsenal and at the very least showing a willingness, now that these underground tests have been carried out, to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
And, all of us saying to the Pakistani Government, please, we urge you not to respond in kind but to show that, indeed, Pakistan understands that greatness is not indigenous to nuclear production, I believe, in the long run, will bring inordinate credibility to the Government and the people of Pakistan, and the favorable response of this body as well. 
Mr. President, the amendment I submit today on behalf of Senators Brownback, Glenn, Bryan and myself essentially reports what has happened in the last 2 days. It then goes on to say that it is the sense of the Senate that we condemn in the strongest possible terms the decision of the Government of India to conduct three nuclear tests on May 11 and two on May 13 and that we support the President's decision to carry out the provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with respect to India and to invoke all sanctions therein. 
I might add that the author of that act is a distinguished Member of this body, none other than Senator John Glenn of the great State of Ohio. And that is a rather comprehensive statement of sanctions that in fact can be placed on India. It will effectively terminate assistance to that country under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 except for humanitarian assistance or food or other agricultural commodities. 
It will terminate sales to that country of any defense articles, defense services or design and construction services, and licenses for the export to that country of any item on the U.S. munitions list. 
It will terminate all foreign military financing for that country, and it will deny to that country credit, credit guarantees or other financial assistance by any department, agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, except that it will not apply to any transaction subject to the reporting requirement of title V or to humanitarian assistance. 
And it will oppose, in accordance with the International Financial Institutions Act, the extension of any loan or financial or technical assistance to that country by any international financial institution and prohibit any U.S. bank from making any loan or providing any credit to the Government of that country except for loans or credits for the purpose of purchasing food or other agricultural commodities. 
Finally, it will prohibit exports to that country of specific goods and technology. 
My point in reading this, Mr. President, is that these, indeed, are strong sanctions. I believe all Members of this body are in support of the President's decision and this amendment gives us an opportunity to say so. 
The sense of the Senate also calls upon the Government of India to take immediate steps to reduce tensions that this unilateral and unnecessary step has caused. We express our regret that this decision by the Government of India will by necessity set back relations between the United States and India, and we urge the Government of Pakistan, the Government of the People's Republic of China and all governments to exercise restraint in response to Indian nuclear tests in order to avoid further exacerbating the nuclear arms race in south Asia. 
We call upon all governments in the region to take steps to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and we urge the Government of India to enter into a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency which would cover all Indian nuclear research facilities at the earliest possible time. 
Mr. President, this is the text and sum of this sense-of-the Senate amendment before this body. I might say, for someone who has taken an interest in India, who has spent time with prior Ambassadors, both of India and Pakistan, attempting to reconcile differences between the two countries, that these tests come to me personally as a very low blow. 
I did not think we would see the day when the detonation of these nuclear devices would take place. However, that is now past. We have seen that day. We hope we learn from that, and we hope, most importantly, that the governments concerned--India, Pakistan, and China--also will recognize the fact that we in this body wish to do everything we possibly can to find consensus rather than animus, to put an end to the adversarial relationships, and to have sanity and soundness prevail when it comes to nuclear weapons. 
I thank the Chair. Perhaps I might ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.  
Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, regretfully I rise to oppose this amendment which, in the current heated environment surrounding the Indian nuclear tests, seeks to repeal the Pressler amendment. 
I believe that to put a repeal of the Pressler amendment on this bill and to allow the United States to resume military aid to Pakistan would be counterproductive and would contribute to a further destabilization of an already unstable South Asian security environment. 
What would India do in response? I urge the Members of this body, when considering whether to vote for an imminent repeal of the Pressler amendment, to think that we are doing this before our people have even had a chance to ascertain what the particulars of this situation are. We are doing it before we have any assessment of what might be the response to this action. I think that is precipitous, and I think it is unfortunate. 
Most immediately, what would be the effect? A repeal of Pressler would release 28 F-16s which Pakistan purchased in 1989, but due to the inability of the President to certify in 1990 that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear device----

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak on passage of S. 2037, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This Act implements two treaties adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO, in December, 1996--the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. 
Passage of this important legislation will clear the way for ratification of these treaties, which are in the paramount interest of the United States--and of the State of California, in particular. These treaties are intended to ensure that foreign countries give intellectual property to the same high level of protection that we afford it here in the U.S. 
The United States is the world's leader in intellectual property, the home of the most creative and dynamic individuals and enterprises in the world--the majority of whom are located in California. This industry constitutes a very important sector of the U.S. economy, and contributes greatly to our global economic position: American creative industries grew twice as fast as the rest of the U.S. economy from 1987-94; more than 3 million Americans worked in the core copyright industries as of 1994; exports of U.S. intellectual property were more than $53 billion in 1995; and the Business Software Alliance reports that 50-60 percent of its revenues come from overseas. 
It is vital that we do everything we can to protect and defend this important sector of the economy from foreign piracy, especially in this new digital age, when the potential exists for thousands of absolutely perfect, priated copies of American intellectual property to be made almost instantly, at the tough of a button: American copyright owners lose $15 billion in overseas sales to piracy every year; the digital gaming industry loses $3.2 billion per year to priacy--almost one third of its $10.1 billion annual sales; and the recording industry's domestic business is flat and they need a strong export market for sales growth. 
Indeed, some countries, such as Argentina, have said that computer programs aren't even protected by copyright; ratifying WIPO will ensure that they are. Foreign countries have been waiting for the U.S., as the world's largest producer of intellectual property, to take the lead in WIPO ratification before the ratify the WIPO treaty, so this is an important step we are taking today. 
The bill which we crafted in the Judiciary Committee is a truly impressive achievement. We worked together with a plethora of diverse industries, academic interests, and law enforcement to forge a bill which advances everybody's interest. 
Title I of the bill implements the WIPO treaties, and 
outlaws so-called `black boxes': devices designed to accomplish the perfect digital piracy which I have mentioned. By protecting against this piracy and paving the way for ratification of the WIPO treaties, this title provides immense help to America's creative industries, including authors, composers, publishers, performers, movie-makers, the recording industry, and the software industry. 
Title II of the bill provides for protection from copyright infringement liability for on-line service providers who act responsibly. This title provides much-desired protection for on-line service providers, such as Yahoo! from my State of California, telecommunications companies, and educational institutions. 
Title II includes a provision which I authored, section 204 of the bill, which requires the Copyright Office to take a comprehensive look at the issue of the liability of schools and universities for the acts of their students and faculty who may use their network to post infringing materials, and to make recommendations for legislation. 
Among the factors which the Copyright Office is to consider are: What is the direct, vicarious, and contributory liability of universities for infringement by: faculty, administrative employees, students, graduate students, and students who are employed by the university. 
What other users of university computers universities may be responsible for; the unique nature of the relationship between universities and faculty; what policies should universities adopt regarding copyright infringement by university computer users; what technological measures are available to monitor infringing uses; what monitoring of the computer system by universities is appropriate; what due process should the universities afford in disabling access by allegedly infringing computer users; should distinctions be drawn between open computer systems, closed computer systems, and open systems with password-protected parts; and taking into account the tradition of academic freedom. 
I want to thank the Chairman, Senator Hatch, and the Ranking Member, Senator Leahy, for working with me on this provision. 
It is my hope and expectation that copyright content providers and the educational community will get together and work cooperatively to address these issues during the course of the Copyright Office study. 
Title III of the bill ensures that computer maintenance and repair providers will not be found liable for copyright infringement for performing their ordinary services. 
Title IV of the bill provides additional copyright exemptions for libraries, archives and broadcasters, and another study, of distance learning, which could benefit educational institutions. 
So this bill helps an incredibly broad spectrum of American interests: authors, telecommunications, universities, computer makers, movies, software, broadcasters, and on and on. No small number of these industries are centered or have very substantial presence in, and immense importance to the economy of, my state of California. 
Thus, it is with great pleasure that I applaud the passage of this legislation, and urge the House to protect America's economy and rapidly pass it as well.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my support to S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act. This legislation, introduced by Senator Gramm and Senator Dodd, is essential to my state of California, providing needed uniform national standards in securities fraud class actions. 
In 1995, with my support, Congress successfully passed the Securities Litigation Reform Act. The 1995 Act provided relief to American companies hit with frivolous, or nuisance, lawsuits. Specifically, the legislation adopted federal provisions to discourage nuisance securities lawsuits and increase the level of information provided for investors. 
This is very important to my state of California, where hundreds of burdensome lawsuits are filed each and every year. More than 60% of all California high tech firms have been sued at least once. Apple Computers executives stated they expect to be sued every two years. These lawsuits levy a heavy cost on businesses who have to pay for expensive legal battles, draining company resources which might otherwise be spent on growing and improving the health of the company. Securities litigation, as several high tech executives have described, is truly `an uncontrolled tax on innovation.' 
The high-tech industry has been central to the successful economic recovery in California. As thousands of workers in the aerospace industry lost their jobs, and as the recession of the '90s stalled the economy, it was California's entrepreneurial spirit, the investment in new ideas, research and new technology which resulted in a rebounding economy. 
In California, there are over 20,000 established high-tech companies. With roughly 670,000 workers, California ranks 1st in the nation in high-tech employment. To put it in another way, for every 1,000 workers in my state, 62 are high-tech. That is significant when one considers that as the 7th largest economy in the world, California supports almost every kind of industry and business known to commerce. 
Start-up companies in the high-tech and biotech industries are most directly affected by securities lawsuits. These high-tech and biotech companies dedicate a large percentage of company funds for research and development. The average high tech firm invests between 16-20% of company revenues in research, with biotech firms often as high as 60%. This level of investment is integral to their business success. However, with the burden of frivolous lawsuits, California companies are not able to use their resource on developing innovative technologies and new products for the market place. 
The 1995 Securities Litigation Reform moved in the right direction. However, the 1995 legislation did not address recent actions by plaintiffs to file frivolous cases in state courts. Since the passage of the 1995 legislation, suits traditionally filed in federal courts are now being placed in state courts. The current law does not protect companies from this threat. 
The bill, which I have been pleased to support, will protect companies from this side-door tactic. The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997 establishes uniform national standards in securities fraud class action suits. It would permit a defendant, whether a company or individual, who is sued in state court to proceed into federal court. This legislation would in effect require that every large securities class action be brought into federal court. 
The creation of effective national standards will make it easier to protect companies from so-called nuisance shareholder lawsuits. Specifically, the legislation would provide for the shifting of securities lawsuits filed in a state court into the more appropriate federal court, a process called `removal.' The removal authority would only apply for class action suits involving nationally-traded securities, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Without removal authority, these companies, whose securities are traded throughout the fifty states, could face liability under federal securities laws in fifty state courts. This widespread liability would undermine the reforms enacted in the 1995 Securities Litigation Reform Act. 
Further, this legislation would prevent `forum shopping,' a method for nuisance lawsuits to be initiated in the most sympathetic state jurisdiction. This is a very real concern for California. According to a recent study by former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Joseph A. Grundfest, approximately 26% of litigation activity has moved from federal to state court since the passage of the 1995 law. The study elaborates:  
This increase in state court litigation is likely the result of a `substitution effect' whereby plaintiffs' counsel file state court complaints when the underlying fact appear not to be sufficient to satisfy new, more stringent federal pleading requirements. 
California is the home to one-third of the nation's biotechnology companies and medical device companies. These firms have been the source of tremendous growth. Yet these high tech firms are the very ones who face one of every four strike suits and who have had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements. National standards will address this problem effectively and fairly. 
By establishing a uniform system for the movement of cases from state to federal court, Congress can limit abusive lawsuits that inhibit economic and job growth. The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997 will offer important protection for American companies from nuisance lawsuits. 
I appreciate the efforts of the Banking Committee and the sponsors, Senator Gramm and Senator Dodd, for their work on this issue and encourage my fellow Senate colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer a very simple amendment to S. 1618 that will protect the critical area of consumer health care privacy. This amendment provides that in communications with health care insurers or providers, patients have the right not to have their confidential conversations recorded or monitored. 
This amendment fills a loophole in existing law. Federal law currently provides that at least one party must consent to the taping or monitoring of a private conversation. The federal law allows states to provide even more stringent restrictions, and require that all parties to a conversation must consent to their taping or monitoring. 
However, this law provides no protection to patients against unauthorized taping or monitoring. Even when, as in my State of California, the state law requires all parties to consent for taping or monitoring, the law fails to protect them. Patients are construed to consent to taping or monitoring, whether they expressly consent or not, if they are informed of the taping or monitoring. This is most often accomplished by a recording at the beginning of the telephone call. If patients refuse to have their calls monitored, they are told to simply take their business elsewhere. But there is nowhere else to go. 
The confidentiality of details about our health is one of the most sensitive topics imaginable. Physician-patient confidentiality is a bedrock principle that goes back literally thousands of years. 
Not only is this an ethical issue, it is a health imperative. In fact, it can be a matter of life and death. Anything less than full confidentiality compromises the willingness of patients to provide the full information that treating physicians need to treat them properly. It can literally jeopardize their health and their life. 
We naturally assume that intimate details that we share with our doctor and health care professionals are strictly confidential. But they are not. Today, any communication we have with a health care professional may be taped and monitored. 
This problem is exacerbated by the rising role of health insurance companies in treatment. Oftentimes, it is a health insurance company, rather than a trusted doctor, with whom the patient must share intimate personal health details. That health insurance company may not have the same ethical and legal confidentiality obligations as the patient's treating physician. 
When my office contacted the top 100 health insurance providers in this country, we learned that most health insurance companies who responded tape or monitor calls from patients. 
I want to share briefly some of the responses we received. Kaiser Permanente is a health insurance provider that operates in 19 states and the District of Columbia, and provides care to more than 9 million members. Its practices vary from state to state, depending on applicable state laws. 
Among other things, Kaiser Permanente may: Monitor randomly selected calls, in which case it may or may not notify patients in advance; or tape record all or randomly selected calls, in which case it may or may not notify patients in advance. 
United HealthCare wrote that they did not believe that recording or monitoring calls presented a privacy issue. Their rationale was that they only randomly record calls and only after advising the caller that the call may be recorded. 
Great-West responded that a patient has the option of communicating in writing if the patient does not want to be recorded. Well, let me say simply--that's not good enough for me. 
Despite the two-party consent rule in my own State of California, NYL Care Health Plans, Inc., responded that no violation of California law occurs in the absence of a `confidential communication.' Under California law, the definition of a `confidential communication' does not include communications where the parties may reasonably expect that the call may be recorded. NYL Care asserted that, since patients were told that their call could be monitored, their calls were not confidential calls. 
In my view, NYL Care's interpretation of `confidentiality' turns its commonly understood meaning on its head. In fact, I doubt whether any of my colleagues would agree that communications about one's own health problems are not confidential. 
Finger Lakes Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Upstate New York randomly tapes records calls from patients and is in the process of implementing a front-end message to patients. 
In the case of Blue Cross Blue Shield of the National Capital Area, a patient receives no notice that the call may be monitored. Their Associate General Counsel stated that in both Maryland and the District of Columbia, no consent was required. 
Not only is unauthorized taping or monitoring of telephone calls just plain wrong, it is simply unnecessary. None of the health insurers who responded to my office could provide a valid reason for monitoring or taping incoming calls from patients. 
The standard response I received from health insurers was that they monitored or tape recorded calls for `quality control.' Yet no one could explain how the health insurer's record of the information discussed protects the patient. It's easy to see, I think, how the industry's practice leaves the patient disadvantaged. 
My amendment is simple. First, it requires express consent from patients in order to be taped or monitored by health insurance companies or health care providers. 
Second, it requires health insurance companies or health care providers to give patients the option not to be taped or monitored. 
Third, it applies only to health insurance companies or health care providers. It does not affect the remaining companies that tape or monitor customer communications. 
Mr. President, this amendment simply ensures a basic right that most patients believe they already enjoy. I urge its adoption.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, at this time, on behalf of Senator Brownback, Senator Glenn, and myself, I send to the desk for reference to committee a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which, in essence, deals with the explosion of three nuclear devices by the Government of India yesterday. As this body well knows, the Government of India conducted underground tests on three separate nuclear explosive devices, including a fission device, a low-yield device, and a thermonuclear device. They did this also very close to the border of Pakistan, thereby raising tensions between the two countries and in the entire south Asia region. 
This sense of the Senate will condemn that explosion in the strongest possible terms and will call upon the President of the United States to carry out the provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with respect to India and invoke all sanctions therein. 
It will also call upon the Government of India to take immediate steps to reduce tensions that this unilateral and unnecessary step has caused. 
I am aware that Senator Brownback's subcommittee, of which I am a member, will be meeting tomorrow, and will be discussing this issue, and, hopefully, will be able to agree to this resolution. 
I am delighted to work with the Senator, and I note that he is present on the floor at this time, so I will say no more but simply send this to the desk.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like the Senator from New York to know that I am a cosponsor, also, of the Patients' Bill of Rights Act. I understand the importance of this bill. I would very much welcome floor time to consider this bill as well. 
However, I did indicate in our Democratic caucus that absent that opportunity, and because women all across this Nation are going through some of the same events that two women who brought this to my attention 3 years ago in California went through, and that is to show up to have a radical mastectomy at 7:30 in the morning, and then to be pushed out on the street at 4:30 that afternoon with drains in them, the effects of anesthetics still upon them, really unable even to walk--is it not true that what we strive to do is make a simple reform and say that no woman without the permission of her physician will be subject to this kind of treatment ever again in the United States of America?

<TEXT>
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from New York. 
I must say that I think what is happening here is unfortunate. I think what we are seeing overwhelmingly all across the United States is a state of medical care and health insurance in this country that is becoming much more oriented toward business and much less oriented toward medicine. And this is prompting, I think, all across this land a terrible situation for physicians and for patients. 
What prompted me to introduce this bill was two California women who wrote to me. I want to read them to you and enter their full statements in the Record. 
One was from a woman in Newark, CA. And she wrote--and this was almost 2 1/2 years ago--that she had a modified radical mastectomy as an outpatient at the Fremont Kaiser outpatient clinic. She was operated on at 11:30 in the morning and was released at 4:30 that afternoon, with no attempt made to see if she could even walk to the bathroom. She was 60 years old. And the discovery of cancer and the subsequent surgery were extremely draining both emotionally and psychologically. 
That is one case. Same day. Let me read you about another case.  
My mastectomy and lymph node removal took place at 7:30 a.m., November 13. I was released at 2:30 p.m. that same day. I received notice, the day before surgery, from my doctor that mastectomy was an outpatient procedure at Kaiser and I'd be released the same day. Shocked by this news, I told my surgeon of my previous complications with anesthesia and the fact that I have a cervical spine condition, which adds an additional consideration for any surgery. 
Then she goes on and she says: 
While in a groggy, postoperative daze, swimming in pain and nausea, I was given some perfunctory instructions on how to empty the two bloody drains attached to my body. I was told to dress myself and go home. My doctor's written chart instructions for a room assignment, if I developed acute nausea or pain, were ignored by the nursing staff. 
This is the problem we are trying to stop right here and now. I frankly am sorry that the bill isn't broader. But this is something whose cost is small--$100 million. We know it can be accommodated. We know we can get the job done. 
This bill is simple. It requires every insurance plan in the United States of America to cover the hospital length of stay determined by the physician to be medically necessary. It does not prescribe a fixed number of days. It does not set a minimum. It leaves the length of the hospital stay for the mastectomy up to the treating physician. 
Secondly, it requires health insurance plans to cover breast reconstruction following a mastectomy. 
Thirdly, it requires insurance plans to cover breast prostheses and complications of mastectomy, including lymphedema. 
And, finally, it prohibits insurance plans from financially penalizing or rewarding a physician for providing medically necessary care or for referring a patient for a second opinion. 
This is a simple bill. It is a direct bill. It is going to directly benefit the lives of tens of thousands of women. I regret that it isn't more comprehensive. But we know it is doable, we know what it does, and we know women will immediately be better off because of it. 
So I am very proud to stand here with my colleague from New York and with others in the Senate. The great bulk of women Senators are supporting this. This is tangible; it is doable. We believe it can become law quickly. And we say, let us seize the moment and let us accomplish at least this for women of America. 
So I thank my colleague from New York for his authorship. I was very proud to be an original sponsor on this bill. We did have a hearing. We have tried to get the job done before, but hopefully it will get done this morning. 
As an original cosponsor of S. 249, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, I am pleased to sponsor the amendment on mastectomy hospital length of stay that Senator D'Amato is urging the Senate to consider. It is time to pass it. 
Senator D'Amato and I introduced this amendment as a bill on January 30, 1997, 16 months ago. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on the bill, S. 249, on November 5, 1997. We have filed this as an amendment, to be considered by the Senate, three times: 
On March 16, we filed it as an amendment to H.R. 2646, the Parent and Student Savings Account PLUS Act. 
On May 6, we filed it as an amendment to H. R. 2676, the IRS restructuring bill. 
On March 31 and on February 10 of this year, Senator D'Amato offered it as an amendment in the Finance Committee. 
In sum, we have made numerous efforts to get the Senate to consider this bill. 
The D'Amato-Feinstein mastectomy bill has 21 cosponsors, including a bipartisan group of women Senators: Senators Snowe, Moseley-Braun, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Mikulski and Boxer. 
This amendment has four important provisions: For treatment of breast cancer: 
1. It requires insurance plans to cover the hospital length of stay determined by the physician to be medically necessary. Importantly, our bill does not prescribe a fixed number of days or set a minimum. It leaves the length of hospital stay up to the treating physician. 
2. It requires health insurance plans to cover breast reconstruction following a mastectomy. 
3. It requires insurance plans to cover breast prostheses and complications of mastectomy, including lymphodemas. For treatment of all cancers: 
4. It prohibits insurance plans from financially penalizing or rewarding a physician for providing medically necessary care or for referring a patient for a second opinion 
Let me share with you two firsthand experiences, two California women describing their treatment by insurance companies in having a mastectomy. 
Nancy Couchot, age 60, of Newark, California, wrote me that she had a modified radical mastectomy on November 4, 1996, at 11:30 a.m. and was released by 4:30 p.m. She could not walk and the hospital staff did not help her `even walk to the bathroom.' She says, `Any woman, under these circumstances, should be able to opt for an overnight stay to receive professional help and strong pain relief.' 
Victoria Berck, of Los Angeles, wrote that she had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. on November 13, 1996, and was released from the hospital 7 hours later, at 2:30 p.m. Ms. Berck was given instructions on how to empty two drains attached to her body and sent home. She concludes, `No civilized country in the world has mastectomy as an outpatient procedure.' 
These are but two examples of what, unfortunately, is symptomatic of a growing trend and a national nightmare--insurance plans interfering with professional medical judgment and arbitrarily reducing care without a medical basis. 
Premature discharges for mastectomy, with insurance plans strong-arming physicians to send women home, are one glaring example of the growing torrent of abuses faced by patients and physicians who have to `battle' with their HMOs to get coverage of the care that physicians believe is medically necessary. 
Increasingly, insurance companies are reducing inpatient hospital coverage and pressuring physicians to discharge patients who have had mastectomies. This is beyond the pale. It is unconscionable. 
The Wall Street Journal on November 6, 1996, reported that `some health maintenance organizations are creating an uproar by ordering that mastectomies be performed on an outpatient basis. At a growing number of HMOs, surgeons must document `medical necessity' to justify even a one-night hospital admission.'

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the United States observes National Police Week, I believe this to be an appropriate time to recognize the outstanding work performed by the men and women of the Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). 
As the security and law enforcement arm of the Department of State, the DSS, since 1916, has protected U.S. diplomatic installations and personnel around the world as well as providing critical security and law enforcement services within the United States. Presently, 260 DSS special agents are serving in over 140 of our embassies and consulates throughout the world. Additionally, 500 special agents are assigned to offices throughout the United States and work closely with their counterparts in federal, state, and municipal law enforcement organizations. 
DSS special agents have been in the forefront of the fight against international terrorism and transnational crime. In 1995, DSS special agents assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, working closely with Pakistani Authorities, were instrumental in the apprehension of Ramzi Yousef, a terrorist wanted in connection with the World Trade Center bombing in New York City. DSS agents had the lead role in debriefing the original informant, coordinating surveillance of Yousef's activities, and entered Yousef's room alongside Pakistani police to effect his arrest. Subsequently, Yousef was convicted in New York of his heinous act of terrorism and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. 
The DSS also runs effective Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Narcotics awards programs in which it offers large cash rewards of up to $4 million. In 1995, this program, along with the efforts of DSS agents throughout Latin America, helped to bring about the downfall of the Cali drug kingpins of Colombia, apprehending eight high ranking members of that organization. The DSS is currently playing a very key role in attempting to apprehend suspects involved in the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland, as well as Mexican drug trafficking. 
The DSS also plays an important role in ensuring the security of our borders through investigations of falsified U.S. passports and U.S. visas. In the U.S., work in this area complements the work of state and local authorities as well as other federal agencies. This role enables the DSS to utilize versatile charges that enable it to apprehend fugitives and return them to various jurisdictions throughout the United States. 
In my own state of California, DSS agents were instrumental in establishing a verification system involving possession of U.S. visas, whereby many illegal immigrants have been identified who were previously, and fraudulently, claiming and receiving medical and welfare benefits from the state of California. The California Department of Health Services estimates that this system saved California taxpayers over $2 million in 1997 alone. 
Additionally, the DSS has conducted extensive training programs for foreign police officials, both in the U.S. and abroad, which over the last decade have resulted in over 18,000 foreign police officers receiving training in anti-terrorism and anti-crime skills. By enhancing the capabilities of these police elements, the DSS is increasing the capacity of other countries to render assistance to the United States in our continuing struggle against international terrorism and crime. 
Furthermore, the technical expertise of the DSS' security engineering personnel has enabled the nation's business to be transacted safely and securely in hostile environments throughout the world. U.S. diplomatic installations rely on the ability of the DSS to provide a secure area in which to conduct sensitive functions. These programs provide the secure technical foundation in computer and information security which is so necessary in today's technological age. 
The DSS has continually provided crucial support services for our foreign policy and law enforcement objectives. Their contributions have been recognized by the granting of heroism awards by organizations such as the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA) and the International Organization of Chiefs of Police (IACP). 
In the first session of Congress, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999 (H.R. 1757), approved the inclusion of members of the DSS under the provisions of the Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP). A separate proposal, H.R. 633, would also include these personnel under the law enforcement retirement provisions. These measures, which provide long overdue parity for DSS personal with federal law enforcement colleagues, will be important in determining the future role of DSS agents. 
I would like to thank the Diplomatic Security Service for the tireless role that they have played in combating terrorism and transnational crime as well as helping to protect U.S. businesses, embassies, and all the branches of the U.S. government represented abroad. They have continually provided crucial services in support of our foreign policy and law enforcement objectives, often at substantial risk to their own lives.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate because I was very concerned in reading this morning's newspaper about criticism of the administration in the Middle East peace process. As a strong supporter of Israel and its security, I want to take this opportunity to commend President Clinton and Secretary Albright for their current effort to preserve the peace process. 
About a month ago, 81 Senators sent a letter to the President of the United States in which they expressed concern about the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. They, in effect, were concerned about a proposal for land redeployment going public, about security cooperation, and final status talks. 
I was not one of those 81 Senators. In fact, a few days later, I sent a letter of my own expressing my support for the current course. In that letter, I mentioned that I have great faith in what the administration is doing, and I still believe that.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in view of the attacks leveled against the administration's efforts by leaders of the other body, I felt it necessary to come to the floor today to respond. As a concerned American, who cares deeply for the State of Israel, its future and its security--as I think my statement in the Record on Israel's 50th anniversary will reflect--and 
as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the relevant subcommittee for the past 4 years, I have watched these negotiations go up and down. 
What I have never forgotten is the importance of Israel's survival as a Jewish, democratic state with safe and secure borders. I have never forgotten a meeting I had with Yitzhak Rabin in the mid-1980s, when I was the Mayor of San Francisco and he was Israel's Minister of Defense. He explained to me how the demographics of Israel and the West Bank and Gaza showed that, over time, the Jewish majority in these areas would be eroded. 
He showed me even then, as we stepped out on the Knesset balcony and looked out and saw how close Jordan really is to the capital, how Israel could return some land, which accomplished the goal of preserving Israel's security from a military and strategic view while also preserving a strong Jewish majority. I have never forgotten that. That is the reason why success in this peace process is so important--because peace is the ultimate guarantor of Israel's security. 
No one ever thought it would be easy to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians. If it were easy, peace would have already been achieved. It is almost 20 years now since the end of the Camp David accords. But criticizing the administration at this particular point in time, I strongly believe, is counterproductive. In many cases these criticisms are driven by politics--not by the urgent desire for peace and Israel's security. And I find that deeply troubling. 
It is a responsibility of the executive branch to conduct these negotiations, not the Congress. That is provided for in the United States Constitution. So, in my view, it would be prudent for all of us who care about Israel and the search for peace to give these negotiations a chance to succeed before rushing to criticize. 
There is no more knowledgeable or respected negotiator that I know of than Ambassador Dennis Ross, who is leading the American effort. The State Department has an institutional knowledge of these talks going back 20 years--all the way to the Camp David Accords--which deserves a certain amount of respect as well. And President Clinton's own commitment to Israel and its security cannot seriously be called into question. 
For months now, the President has been urged--by many of the same people who are now criticizing him--to put forth a strong effort to rescue what has been a crumbling peace process. 
In that time, the Secretary of State and the Middle East peace team have shuttled back and forth to the Middle East trying to find a formula that would advance the talks. President Clinton has been personally engaged in the details of these talks, and has met on several occasions with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Chairman Arafat, and other regional leaders. 
After months with no progress, the issues that divide the two sides have crystallized into a clear few dominant issues. So our negotiators have tried to help the two sides identify possible solutions that would allow them to move on to the next stage of the talks. 
Like any mediator, having reached this point, the United States now faces two choices: Either identify the terms it feels the parties can move ahead on, or walk away from the talks. Frankly, I would expect them to be criticized whatever they would do. 
But what the President and Secretary Albright are doing is not trying to impose a solution on either side--they are simply trying to create the conditions that allow for progress by proposing the ideas they believe can bridge the gaps between the two sides. Ultimately, only the parties themselves can decide if these ideas are acceptable. 
To the best of my knowledge, the terms being discussed are quite favorable to Israel: The Palestinians originally sought Israeli redeployment from 30 percent of the West Bank, and Israel offered 8 percent. On the table now is 13 percent, which many security officials maintain could isolate two or three settlements, but would not jeopardize Israel's security. 
In addition, the current proposal would result in final status talks beginning immediately, and tough requirements on Palestinian security cooperation--both of which Prime Minister Netanyahu has been seeking for many months. 
And the Administration is still working hard to address Israel's concerns. Ambassador Ross, who just arrived back from London last night, is flying out to Israel tonight for further talks. 
President Clinton made clear what he is trying to do yesterday in a press conference. He said:  
I have tried to find a way actually to do what [Prime Minister Netanyahu] suggested. I have done my best for a year now to find the formula that would unlock the differences between them to get them into those final status talks. That's all I am trying to do. There is no way in the world that I could impose an agreement on them or dictate their security to them even if I wished to, which I don't. 
If the current peace process fails, the deadlock will likely lead to unilateral acts by both sides, an escalation of violence, the further unraveling of Israel's relations with its neighbors. If the United States is committed to Israel's security, we cannot allow that to happen. 
So I want to express my support for the Administration's efforts. I think they are principled, worthy efforts, and are the best hope at the moment of saving the peace process from disaster. They are also grounded in a deep commitment to Israel's security. 
So I would ask my colleagues to please give these talks a chance to succeed, to please refrain from attempts to micromanage the Administration's conduct of these negotiations, and to please recognize that Israel's security depends on their success. 
Thank you. I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation to reform the Internal Revenue Service. The Finance Committee deserves tremendous credit for leading the reform effort and conducting hearings to illustrate the tremendous concerns. The legislation will help restore public confidence in a very troubled agency. 
Last summer, the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, under the leadership of Senator Bob Kerry and Representative Portman, issued its report to reform the agency, The Finance Committee conducted several days of hearings, receiving compelling testimony, regarding a variety of concerns with the activities of the IRS. It's clear that these problems transcend any single administration, but reflect years of neglect, improper incentives, inadequate training and mismanagement. 
This legislation, along with the appointment of the agency's new Commissioner, Charles Rossotti, will help provide a `fresh start' for the troubled agency. 
I support the legislation, which adopts important reform steps: 
Crates an IRS Oversight Board: The bill creates a new entity, the IRS Oversight Board, drawing on private sector individuals as well as the Treasury Secretary, the IRS Commissioner and a representative of the IRS employees. The Commission will have the authority to review and approve major issues of policy, such as IRS strategic plans, IRS operations and recommend candidates for important positions, like the IRS Commissioner and the National Taxpayer Advocate. 
Adopt important protection, including more disclosure to taxpayers and enhanced protection for the `innocent spouse': The bill requires the IRS to better inform taxpayers about their rights, potential liabilities when filing joint returns, as well as the IRS process for auditing, appeals, collections and the like. The bill would expand the protections provide to `innocent spouses' who find themselves liable for taxes, interest, or penalties because of a spouse's action taken without their knowledge. 
End Bureaucratic overlap: The legislation allows the IRS Commissioner to move forward to eliminate the current national, regional and district office structure of the IRS. The Commissioner has proposed a plan to replace the antiquated 1950s structure, with a new management model, operating to serve specific groups of taxpayers. This can ensure greater professionalism in the agency and more uniformity across the nation. 
Strengthens and streamlines the Role of the Inspector General: The bill creates a new office of the Treasury 
Inspector General for Tax Administration. Regional and district Inspectors General would report to the IRS Inspector General, rather than district offices, strengthening their independence and enhancing their oversight role. 
Strengthens the Office of the National Taxpayer Advocate: The bill strengthens the office of the National Taxpayer Advocate, to represent the interests of taxpayers in the IRS policy process, proposing legislation, changes in IRS practice and assisting taxpayers in resolving problems. The National Taxpayer Advocate is also supplemented by local taxpayer advocates around the country. These local advocates will report to the national advocate, rather than local officials, which might undermine the independence and public credibility of the local taxpayer advocate. 
Prepares for the future: The bill encourages more taxpayers to file tax returns or tax information electronically, expediting the process for taxpayers and employers filing payroll tax information. 
The bill adopts important reforms. As a previous supporter of efforts to strengthen taxpayers' rights, I am pleased to extend my support. 
I acknowledge the IRS, which includes thousands of diligent, conscientious employees, has an extraordinarily difficult challenge. Each year the Service receives: nearly 210 million tax returns in 1997; collects and accounts for well in excess of one trillion dollars; generates nearly 90 million refunds; and receives millions of calls, letters and visits from taxpayers in need of help. 
The vast majority of these taxpayers are dealt with fairly and effectively, but no excuse can be made for some of the experiences and horror stories described during Finance Committee hearings. 
As Senators know, last September, the Finance Committee began to hold a series of hearings identifying heart-rending stories from taxpayers, identifying specific tax problems. One of the witnesses, Kristina Lund of California, described the tax problems linked to IRS enforcement action following her divorce. Ms. Lund was stuck with the tax bill, frustrated by an unresponsive IRS, as a tax debt ballooned from $7,000 in 1983, to $16,000, as a result of delayed notification and confusion between Ms. Lund and her former husband. The burden of correcting the problems were enormous for Ms. Lund, a newly hired bank employee earning approximately $15,000, and her 14 year old daughter. This bill incorporates some reform for the `innocent spouse,' preventing more individuals from falling into Ms. Lund's circumstances. The bill would expand the protections provided `innocent spouses' who find themselves liable for taxes, interest, or penalties because of actions by their 
spouse of which they did not know and had no reason to know. The bill will ensure that more women are treated fairly. 
I am pleased the Senate was able to add, with my support, Senator Graham's amendment to clarify that coercion or duress cannot void an innocent spouse's claim for protection. I share Senator Graham's concern with the bill, which provided that an innocent spouse, who had knowledge of the under-reported income, was denied `innocent spouse' protection. Without the Graham amendment, a spouse could be coerced or pressured to go along with a tax scam, and suffer the tax consequences for years. I am pleased we could add the Graham amendment, providing an extra layer of protection for innocent spouses. 
We have heard a great deal of frustration with the IRS, but Congress deserves its fair share of the blame for taxpayer frustration with the complex and confusing tax code. Over the years, the IRS Tax Code has become more complicated, not less so. Despite the best of intentions, Congress has helped to make the taxpayers and tax collectors responsibilities more difficult. 
The Finance Committee received the testimony of the Certified Public Accountants, noting that from 1986 to 1997, there have been eight years with significant changes to the tax laws, including the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act. The witnesses noted the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which I supported, alone contains: 36 retroactive changes; 114 changes that became effective on August 5, 1997; 69 changes that became effective January 1, 1998; and 5 changes that became effective on another date. 
No wonder taxpayers and tax professionals are so confused and frustrated! 
Congress needs to be certain we are providing the IRS with the resources needed to get the job done. Tax professionals noted the Treasury Department also has a significant backlog in producing IRS regulations to provide guidance for taxpayers. Tax complexity increases the IRS' challenge to administer the tax system fairly, and compounds the taxpayers' problems in meeting their tax obligations. 
Congress also needs to ensure we are providing adequate resources to the IRS, to permit adequate training and ensure the skills of the IRS employees are current and up to date. During the hearings, the Finance Committee listened to the testimony of Darren Larsen, a Southern California attorney, in which she described conduct that was simply contrary to federal law. Ms. Larsen described the use of some `on-the-job instructors' who lacked an understanding of some of the legal fundamentals and passed their errors on to newer revenue officers. I am sure the vast majority of IRS enforcement officers work diligently to implement the laws, but even occasional errors are unacceptable. 
I am pleased to support the Committee's legislation. However, one area of reform the Committee declined to implement deals with the `marriage penalty.' I will continue to follow the committee's work on this issue closely, which is an important issue for women. 
Marriage penalties arise because a couple filing a `joint return' face tax brackets and standard deductions that are less than twice the level of those for single filers. As a result, the marriage of two individuals who pay taxes in the same tax bracket, receive a smaller standard deduction and may be forced into a higher bracket than they would if they filed their taxes as individuals. While more couples receive marriage `bonuses' than marriage `penalties,' the issue deserves closer review. 
Senator Hutchison has introduced S. 1314, legislation to address this issue, proposing to allow married couples to file `combined' returns, in which family income is allocated to both individuals, taxing each spouse at the single taxpayer rate. The legislation would allow couples to file as either joint, single, or head-of-household. This would eliminate those taxpayers who receive a marriage penalty, while leaving marriage bonuses in place. 
However, by getting rid of the `marriage penalty,' Congress could find itself unfairly increasing taxes for single tax filers. Further, the proposal could cause substantial revenue losses, perhaps as much as $40 billion per year, and would complicate the tax system. Taxpayers would be required to perform tax calculations, both, as an individual and as a couple, choosing whichever tax was lower. In this legislation to simplify the tax code, Congress should be very concerned with a proposal which could require additional steps and additional tax calculations for taxpayers. 
I am interested in the approach taken by S. 1989, legislation introduced by our colleague, Senator Ford. This approach would widen the tax brackets and raise the standard deduction for joint filers to a level twice that of the single tax filer. This approach would also eliminate the marriage penalty, while providing added tax relief for families. I am anxious to follow the Committee's progress. 
The Senate Finance Committee has taken very important steps to reform the IRS and I am pleased to support the legislation. I have previously supported efforts to provide more protection for taxpayers, including the earlier `Taxpayer Bill of Rights' and this bill makes similar progress. The administration also deserves support and IRS Commissioner Rossotti also deserve our support. Taxpayers want and deserve better information and a more fair process. I am pleased to support these efforts to set a new course for the IRS.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military Honors Preservation Act of 1998 which will ensure that those who have served this nation with distinction will not see their service medals devalued by the crimes of others. 
This bill simply states that a member of the United States armed forces may not enter a federal, state, or local penitentiary for the purpose of presenting a medal to a person incarcerated for committing a serious violent felony. My hope is that this bill will be seen as it is intended: an attempt to secure the well deserved sense of honor of those who have served in our nation's armed forces. Service to our nation and the opportunity to receive recognition for that service is a duty and a privilege not to be taken lightly. 
I decided that this legislation was necessary when I heard of the unbearable pain suffered by the family of Leah Schendel, a 78-year old woman who was attacked in her Sacramento, California home just before Christmas in 1980. Mrs. Schendel was brutally beaten and sexually assaulted. This vicious attack caused a massive heart attack that killed her. The man who perpetrated this horrific crime, Manuel Babbitt, was convicted and sentenced to die--he is currently sitting on death row in San Quentin Prison. 
This past March, the suffering of Mrs. Schendel's family was renewed when they learned that the man who had so viciously brutalized their loved one was being honored by the United States Marine Corps, in San Quentin! In a ceremony at the prison, Mr. Babbitt was awarded a Purple Heart for injuries he suffered during the Vietnam War. For Mrs. Schendel's family, this medal ceremony was a slap in the face. It said to them that the government was more concerned with honoring a convicted criminal than respecting the feelings of his victims. 
I believe that there is no higher calling for an American than to serve our nation. I have worked hard to make sure that California veterans, who have been overlooked or fallen through the cracks of the system, get the recognition and benefits they deserve. However, I believe that someone who, in his or her post-service life, shows such a blatant disregard for the laws of this nation and makes a mockery of the high standards of the United States military should not be accorded recognition. 
Just like the right to vote, or the right to a military burial in Arlington Cemetery, I believe anyone who has committed a heinous crime forfeits the right to be honored by the American people. Please join me in supporting this bill for the sake of Leah Schendel, and for every American veteran who should rightly feel that they are a hero.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 50th anniversary of the State of Israel, and the enduring, unshakable friendship that has been built between the United States and Israel during those 50 years. 
Fifty years ago today, according to the Hebrew calendar, David Ben-Gurion told the world that the State of Israel was born. In that moment, one of the greatest events in the life of the Jewish people took place. Since the Jewish people were expelled from their ancient homeland nearly 2,000 years ago, the desire to return had remained in the hearts and prayers of Jews throughout the world. 
In the early decades of this century, the Zionist movement brought thousands of young, idealist Jews back to Palestine, which was at the time controlled by the Turks, and then the British. They returned to the land, establishing kibbutzim and agricultural settlements, and reinvigorated ancient cities. They built the foundations for a state, joined during and after the Holocaust by other Jewish immigrants, fleeing unprecedented persecution. 
Supported by Jewish communities around the world, their efforts, and the burning need for a Jewish homeland, were recognized by the United Nations in the Partition Plan of November 29, 1947, which called for the creation of a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. Six months, later, on May 14, 1948, the State of Israel was formally established. 
Much like the United States, Israel is a nation of immigrants. The establishment of Israel has provided a home and refuge for more than 2.6 million immigrants since its inception. They came to escape persecution, to build a better life, or simply to participate in the rebuilding of a nation. 
Jews from every continent and dozens of countries, speaking nearly every language on earth, have returned to their ancient homeland: from Russia fleeing first pogroms and then Communism; from Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungry, Romania, and Czechoslovakia fleeing the Holocaust; from Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and North Africa fleeing Arab anti-Zionism; from Iran fleeing the Ayatollahs; and from Latin America fleeing cruel military regimes. 
In the 1990's Israel has seen the largest wave of immigration in its history. 757,000 immigrants, some 700,000 of them leaving behind the chaos of the former Soviet Union, and 14,000 of whom were rescued in one day in a daring airlift from Ethiopia. Israel has served as a model for ethnic diversity as Jews from all parts of the world have ascended to the highest levels of the public and the private sector. 
Within minutes of Israel's founding in 1948, President Harry Truman recognized the new state. But there was little time for celebration, because within 24 hours, Israel was attacked by Arab forces from all sides. Immigrants who had just fled the horrors of the Holocaust were given guns and instructions to fight, in languages they did not understand. 
In that desperate War of Independence, Israel lost nearly 1% of its population defending itself. But the military acumen and spirit of sacrifice that made that victory possible presaged the building of the Israel Defense Forces--a true citizen army--into one of the world's most respected militaries. In subsequent 
wars when Israel's survival was threatened--in 1956, 1967, and 1973, Israel fought off seemingly insurmountable odds to retain its statehood. 
As spelled out in its Declaration of Independence, the state was formed adhering to democratic and Jewish values, recognizing the freedom of all individuals who reside within it. Israel's vibrant democratic system embodies many of the same values that America holds so dear, including: the separation of powers; concern for human rights; an independent judiciary; a representative parliament (the Knesset) with 11 political parties representing Jews, Arabs, Christians, Druze, men and women; a free press with the highest percentage of newspapers and readers per capita in the world; an average of 80% voter turnout in national elections; and, guaranteed civil liberties. 
Over the years, the United States and Israel have built a deep and multi-faceted friendship. Based on common values of democracy and peace, and backed by the United States' ironclad commitment to help Israel safeguard its security, the U.S.-Israel relationship is poised to develop into an even more intimate one in Israel's next 50 years. 
In science and technology, trade, culture, and of course, security cooperation, the ties grow deeper every year. Most recently Israel and the U.S. have moved to deepen their defense cooperation by expanding the Arrow anti-missile program, developing the Theater High Energy Laser designed to defend against Katyusha rockets, and by the U.S. providing $25 million for anti-terrorism assistance. 
Thanks to the industriousness of its people, and with the help of American financial assistance and free trade agreements with both the United States and the European Union, Israel has transformed itself from a small, agriculturally-based economy in a largely desert climate into a modern, successful, high-tech economy. 
Israel's industrial exports are today 1,380 times what they were 47 years ago. Its Gross Domestic Product has risen from $2.5 billion in the 1960s to $90.6 billion last year. Its computer industry and agricultural technology are some of the most successful and innovative in the world. 
Israel has also seen phenomenal growth in health care and education. More than 33% of Israelis have formal schooling of 13 years compared from 6% in the 1960's and the life expectancy of Israelis is among the longest in the world. It is a sign of Israel's economic maturation that in January of this year, Israel and the United States began to discuss proposals to reduce and phase out U.S. economic aid to Israel. 
For Israel's long-term security and economic success, there is no higher priority than the achievement of a permanent peace settlement with all of its neighbors. The peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994 were the first steps in that process. The United States has stood by Israel in its desire to achieve peace with its neighbors, and will continue to work to help Israel achieve peace with Syria, Lebanon, other Arab nations, and, perhaps most urgently, to fulfill the promise of the handshake between the late Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn in 1993 by achieving a final peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. 
For all of us who care so deeply for Israel's security, who long to see Israel achieve peace with its neighbors, the current peace process has reached a critical juncture. Since Israel's security can best be guaranteed by peace between it and its neighbors, the United States must remain prepared to do everything we can to help reach a successful conclusion to this peace process. That is the best 50th birthday present we can give the people of Israel. 
On this historic occasion, I would like to offer my utmost congratulations to President Weizman, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the people they represent, and express my deep admiration for the accomplishments of the State and people of Israel, a nation that has risen from the darkest moments of history to rebuild itself as an example of the capabilities of the human spirit, the unbreakable ties that exist among a people, and the great justice of democracy. May Israel's next 50 years bring it even greater success.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to clarify that children receiving health insurance under the new Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are eligible for free vaccines under the 1993 federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. 
I want to especially commend the leadership of Congresswoman Jane Harman who is introducing an identical bill in the House today. 
We are introducing these bills because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has apparently interpreted the law so narrowly that as many as 580,000 children in California will lose their current eligibility to receive free vaccines, under California's new Healthy Families program. 
The federal Vaccines for Children program, created by Congress in 1993 (P.L. 105-33), provides vaccines at no cost to poor children. In 1997, as many 775,000 poor children in my state, who were uninsured or on Medicaid, received these vaccines. California received $60 million from the federal government to provide them. 
Mr. President, what can be so basic to public health than immunization against disease? Do we really want our children to get polio, measles, mumps, chicken pox, rubella, and whooping cough--diseases for which we have effective vaccines, diseases which we have practically eradicated by widespread immunization? Every parent knows that vaccines are fundamental to children's good health. 
Congress recognized the importance of immunizations in creating the program, with many Congressional leaders at the time arguing that childhood immunization is one of the most cost-effective steps we can take to keep our children healthy. It makes no sense to me to withhold them from children who (1) have been getting them when they were uninsured and (2) have no other way to get them once they become insured. 
According to an Annie E. Casey Foundation report, 28 percent of California's two-year old children are not immunized. Add to that the fact that we have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. Our uninsured rate for non-elderly adults is 22 percent, the third highest in the U.S., while the national uninsured rate is 17 percent. As for children, 1.7 million or 18 percent of our children are without health insurance, compared to 13 percent nationally, according to UCLA's Center for Health Policy Research. Clearly, there is a need. 
In creating the new children's health insurance program in California, the state chose to set up a program under which the state contracts with private insurers, rather than providing eligible children care through Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Unfortunately, HHS appears to be interpreting this method of providing these children health insurance as making them `insured,' as defined in the vaccines law, and thus ineligible for the federal vaccines. I disagree. 
It is my view that in creating the federal vaccines program, Congress made eligible for these vaccines children who are receiving Medicaid, children who are uninsured, and native American children. I believe that in defining the term `insured' Congress clearly meant private health insurance plans. Children enrolled in California's new Healthy Families program are participating in a federal-state, subsidized insurance plan. Healthy Families is a state-operated program. Families apply to the state for participation. They are not insured by a private, commercial plan, as traditionally defined or as defined in the Vaccine for Children's law (42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(2)(B). On February 23, the California Medical Association wrote to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, `As they are participants in a federal and state-subsidized health program, these individuals are not `insured' for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(B).' 
The California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, which is administering the new program with the Department of Health Services, wrote to HHS on February 5, `It is imperative that states like California, who have implemented the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) using private health insurance, be given the same support and eligibility for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program at no cost as states which have chosen to expand their Medicaid program.' The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized on March 10, 1998, `More than half a million California children should not be deprived of vaccinations or health insurance because of a technicality. . . ,' calling the denial of vaccines `a game of semantics.' 
Children's health should not be a `game of semantics.' Proper childhood immunizations are fundamental to a lifetime of good health. I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill into law, to help me keep our children healthy.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senate adoption of the Conference Report on the State Department Authorization Bill, which we will be voting on tomorrow. 
I do so with disappointment, and concern. As an advocate of many of the good provisions in this bill, it is ironic to be arguing today against adoption of this Conference Report. 
With its provisions to reorganize America's foreign policy institutions and to press for reform at the United Nations while paying off our arrears, I think it is fair to say that the State Department Authorization bill is one of the most far-reaching and important bills that we will consider this Congress. 
I am disappointed, therefore, that Congress finds itself seemingly unable to pass this bill in a form which will allow it to become law. 
Now, we find ourselves in this position today is because a few hard-line House Republicans, by insisting on the inclusion of language to restrict international family planning assistance, have been unwilling to compromise and be flexible in the interests of American foreign policy and national security. 
Let me briefly state 3 reasons why I think that without the family planning restrictions this is a good bill. 
First, this bill authorizes funding of both existing needs and the correction of long-time existing problems, such as a failing computer system, the construction of two major long overdue embassies, and the remediation of security and maintenance problems around the world. International law enforcement, narcotics abatement, and refugee programs are all increased under this bill. 
Second, the State Department Authorization Bill takes an historic step in working with the administration and Secretary Albright to reorganize the foreign policy bureaucracy of the United States, so that the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the United States Information Agency, and the Agency for International Development are brought within the State Department and other operations are streamlined. 
The reorganization plan presented by this bill preserves the unique skills and capabilities of each of the current foreign affairs agencies while creating a new, streamlined, structure capable of meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century. It is a plan supported by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations Committee and by the President and Secretary of State. 
Finally, this bill also contains a package to allow repayment of our arrears to the United Nations, some $926 million, with much-needed reform benchmarks designed to ensure that the United Nations will remain an effective organization in the decades to come. 
I am an unabashed supporter of the United Nations. I believe a strong and effective United Nations is both important to the world and to the national interest of the United States. 
With little fanfare or recognition the United Nations serves American interests each and every day. Through the UN High Commission for Refugees, it feeds and clothes homeless refugees in time of war. The World Health Organization fights diseases like AIDS. The United Nations Children's Fund combats childhood poverty, hunger, and sickness. The UN Development Programs helps the poorer nations of the world develop their infrastructures. The UN provides a forum for negotiating multilateral agreements on arms control, protecting the environment, and other matters that affect all nations. 
The United Nations helps to protect peace and security in dozens of trouble spots around the world. Although we are often quick to criticize UN operations, we are slow to credit those successful U.N. peacekeeping operations in such places as the Golan Heights, Macedonia, Angola, and Kuwait--all important to American foreign policy concerns. 
This is not to say the United Nations is without its faults. The need to reform and streamline the UN bureaucracy, refocus the budget structure, eliminate duplication, and add transparency to all its operations are all included in the 3 year time-period of this bill. 
As the Ranking Member of the International Operations Subcommittee, I was involved in the initial discussions on UN dues payment arrears. The final result negotiated by the Secretary of State, the Chairman, and the Ranking Member is a 
tough, but achievable, series of reforms to be implemented by the United Nations over the next three years, during which time the United States will pay the $926 million it owes in back dues. 
Payment of these arrears is no trivial matter. The U.N.'s current financial difficulties are threatening to render it unable to implement many of its most important programs. Prompt payment by the United States of its arrears is the best way to ensure that the UN will be able to survive as a force for international peace and security in the post-Cold War era. 
As someone who values the United Nations, I regard the United Nations arrears and reform package included in this bill to be a major step forward, and one of which we can all be proud. 
That is why I find it so unfortunate that we are faced today with the prospect that all of these achievements will be for nothing. And why? Because a small group of abortion opponents in the House have tied up this Bill over the issue of the so-called `Mexico City' family planning language. In so doing, they are placing their own narrow domestic concerns and political agenda ahead of all the substantial achievements and reforms encapsulated in this Bill. 
In short, unable to advance their agenda through the normal channels of congressional policy making (an agenda unsupported by the vast majority of the American people, I might add) they have decided to hold this bill hostage to achieve a major blow to family planning throughout the world. 
Ironically, their opposition to family planning is antithetical to their goal of reducing abortions because family planning actually reduces the need for abortions, and without it terrible starvation and deprivation is visited upon millions in other lands. The irony is that no U.S. international family planning funds are spent on abortion in this or any other bill. 
Since 1973, U.S. law has prohibited any USAID funds from being used to pay for abortions as a method of family planning or to coerce any person to have an abortion. Today each and any program supported by these dollars are voluntary, and none involve abortion. All programs are rigorously monitored to ensure strict compliance. 
In Russia, where the average Russian woman used to have a stunning 7 or 8 abortions in her lifetime, family planning has made a huge difference. An active family planning effort has actually reduced the number of abortions in Russia from 1990 to 1994 by over 20%, from 3.6 million to 2.8 million. That is 800,000 fewer abortions in a four years period of time due to family planning efforts. 
The story repeats itself over and over, wherever family planning exists. As our esteemed former colleague Mark Hatfield, who was a proudly pro-life Senator, reminded us each time we debated this issue, family planning assistance prevents abortions. 
I also find the prohibitions placed on free speech contained in the Conference Report--in essence a global gag rule on responsible family planning discussions--to be unacceptable. Foreign family planning providers would only be eligible for U.S. dollars if they agree to have their voices silenced. They could neither lobby nor discuss or educate under the terms of this Bill. The fact that the language included in this Conference Report dictates what public statements can be made, what conferences can be attended, and what educational materials can be produced with an entity's own funds I find an overreaching and dictatorial edict by a country that prizes free speech. 
One of the most important and effective components of U.S. foreign assistance has for years been our family planning programs. These programs reduce poverty, improve health, and raise living standards around the world by enhancing the ability of couples and individuals to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children in some of the most overpopulated and depraved countries on earth. Most of us take these rights for granted. None of us knows the level of deprivation and suffering that exists outside our borders. 
What we can not do now--what we should not do now--is allow a small minority of this and the other body to effectively stop any U.S. family planning efforts worldwide. 
The President has stated that if the Conference Report passes with the family planning restrictions he will veto this bill. By including language in this Conference Report which we know will result in a veto we will sacrifice--needlessly and pointlessly--all the important work accomplished to date. 
I sincerely hope and urge that there are sufficient votes in this body to reject this Conference Report, return it to Conference, remove the counterproductive language, and develop a report which the Senate can support, and which the President can sign. 
I urge my colleagues to reject adoption of this Conference Report. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today as I and a number of my colleagues do every year to mark and remember a dark day in human history: The beginning of the systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenian men, women, and children. 
On April 24, 1915--eighty-three years ago--the Ottoman Empire launched a brutal and unconscionable policy of mass murder. Over an eight year period, 1.5 million Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from their homes, their land and property confiscated. 
As we remember the dark past of the Armenian people, however, our act of remembrance also offers the opportunity to celebrate hope and the resilience of the human spirit. Today, the people of Armenia can look to a promising future, as they continue to work for democracy and peace in their homeland. 
The Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the twentieth century, an appalling precursor to events in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Central Africa, as well as too numerous other places. As we mark this day of remembrance, people of conscience around the world must redouble our commitment to fight for human dignity and freedom, and vow to never again allow genocide to occur.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity to speak on this bill. I take this opportunity to do so now. 
Prior to yesterday, it was my full intention to vote for this bill. After yesterday, I regret to say I have some serious problems with it and cannot vote for it at this time, but I will, if the problems are remedied, vote for this bill when it comes out of conference. 
Let me speak just briefly about what the problems are and then why I think the Coverdell-Torricelli bill is so important and groundbreaking. 
Yesterday, this body accepted on a 50-to-49 vote an amendment to convert over $10 billion in currently targeted Federal education funds to a block grant to States. With adoption of this amendment, our efforts to direct limited Federal funds to national priorities are obliterated. Funds for disadvantaged students, funds to make schools safe and drug-free, funds for meeting national student achievement goals--virtually gone. 
For ESEA Title I, the bill as it now stands deletes important requirements: 
Requirements for student performance standards and assessment, something that I believe is vital if we are going to change the downward trend of public education in this country. 
Requirements for evaluating a program's effectiveness. How could someone oppose that? 
Requirements to take corrective action if programs are not effective. You mean, don't change a program if you find out it is not effective? 
And requirements that Federal funds not supplant State and local funds. 
That was the Gorton amendment. 
Secondly, that same day the Senate adopted, on a 52-47 vote, an amendment which would prohibit voluntary national testing of students. Last year, this body worked out a bipartisan compromise on reading and math testing under which States and local school districts could participate in national achievement tests, if they wished, voluntarily. Many, including several school districts in California, have agreed to participate. A good thing. Without national tests we have no way of comparing student performance, therefore, the success of individual States in educating their students from State to State. This was the Ashcroft amendment. It would abolish these voluntary tests. 
Both of these amendments run counter to my very strong education beliefs. And more importantly, I believe they obliterate any chance of a veto being overridden by this body. I think that is really too bad, because I was one Democrat who was planning to vote to override a Presidential veto if necessary because I believe the Coverdell-Torricelli bill breaks important ground which I, frankly, am pleased to stand and support and defend. 
I have heard the bill called a lot of things: `A voucher system.' In my view, it isn't. A `subsidy to private institutions.' In my view, it isn't. A `gift to the wealthy.' In my view, it isn't. I have heard it said that it is `bad education policy.' I disagree. `Bad tax policy.' I disagree. 
What this bill is, is an encouragement to save for education in a society that lives on credit and saves very little. In my book, that is good. I intended to vote for this bill. 
Last year, as you all know, we had the IRA savings accounts for higher education of $500. Both political parties thought that was good. That would be extended to $2,000 and extended down through elementary school by this bill, whether the family that saves wants to spend that money in a public institution, a private institution, a religious or a parochial institution. I think that is good, sound public policy. 
I have heard it said this is only for the rich. I suppose the reason for that is because these special savings accounts would be available to couples earning under $150,000 and single people earning under $95,000. And some people say, `Why should we give them any benefit?' Well, let me tell you, in my view, saving for education makes sense, whether you make $30,000 a year or $90,000 a year. It is good and we should encourage it. Of course, it may not be politically correct, but if it makes education a higher priority or a little easier, even better, what is wrong with that? 
Let me speak for a moment on how Americans save.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This bill is not the end-all, be-all solution to the problems of our schools. But it is a good step. 
It is my intention to vote against this bill at this time because of the two additions I cited earlier. If the Gorton and Ashcroft amendments come out in conference and the appropriate tax incentives to save for education remain, I will vote for this bill and I will vote to override a Presidential veto.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Senators Bingaman and Reid today and I thank them for including my suggestions to be more explicit in how school districts use funds authorized for dropout prevention. 
At my suggestion, Senators Bingaman and Reid added several specific strategies to the activities authorized by their original amendment. Under the original Bingaman-Reid amendment, funds would be authorized as grants to states and states would in turn award grants to public middle and secondary schools for activities like professional development and planning and research. 
Under the Feinstein amendment, schools could also use grants for remedial education; reducing pupil-teacher ratios; efforts to help students meet achievement standards, such as tutoring or enrichment programs; and counseling for at-risk students. 
I believe that the additions I suggested provide some concrete guidance to the states and represent specific, targeted strategies aimed at the underlying causes of the dropout problem. 
Students at risk of dropping out need extra help and attention, such as smaller classes, counseling, and after-school academic programs and summer school. They require more than the normal school program, but schools are strapped as it is and this new `injection' of funding can help schools provide these extra services. 
For example, limited English speaking proficiency is a major risk factor for dropping out school, especially for Latino children, according to the General Accounting Office in their July 1994 report. For Latino students born in the U.S., the dropout rate is 18 percent. For newly immigrated Latino students, the dropout rate is 44 percent. For African-American students the dropout rate is 12 percent and for Anglo students it is 9 percent, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Nearly one in five Latinos between ages 16 and 24 leaves school without a diploma [Hispanic Dropout Project, U.S. Department of Education, February 1998]. Whatever the numbers, in my view, one percent is too high for any group. Everyone needs a solid education. 
Other risk factors for dropping out are poverty, pregnancy, motherhood, disruptive behavior, academic failure, and lack of skills, said the General Accounting Office and the National Center for Education Statistics. 
Dropping out of school can begin a downward spiral to delinquency, unemployment, disillusionment, drug and alcohol abuse and crime. Dropping out forecloses opportunities for a lifetime--having children who are poor and uneducated; lack of job skills; civic breakdown. 
Public schools need help and the added resources of this amendment in an effort to bring concentrated attention to at-risk students and to prevent the downward plunge that can begin when children drop out of school. We should not give up on these children but give them extra help to stay in school. This amendment can provide some help and I urge the Senate to adopt it.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on April 3, 1998 I addressed a conference at Stanford University on the subject of `The Content of U.S. Engagement with China.' This conference, on an issue which I believe to be of paramount importance, was convened by The Center for International Security and Arms Control and the Institute for International Studies in conjunction with the Stanford University and Harvard University Preventive Defense Project. I thought my colleagues would find my remarks to be of interest, and I ask that they be printed in the Record.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to support two construction initiatives to help our public schools reduce overcrowding. The first is included in Senator Roth's substitute bill that is before us and the second is an amendment by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. 
The two proposals combined mean that California could issue tax exempt bonds totaling $2.8 billion. They differ in their approach and help two different types of districts. The Roth proposal will help suburban high-growth areas. The Moseley-Braun proposal will target disadvantaged, inner city districts, while also providing the state with authority to address the needs of other districts.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today, legislation that would provide permanent residency to Suchada Kwong, a recently widowed young mother of a U.S. citizen child who faces the devastation of being separated from her child and family here in the United States. 
Suchada Kwong's U.S. citizen husband, Jimmy Kwong, was tragically killed in an automobile accident in June of 1996, leaving a 3-month-old U.S.-born son and his 29-year-old bride. 
Because current law does not allow Suchada to adjust her status to permanent residency without her husband, Suchada now faces deportation. 
Suchada and Jimmy Kwong met in Bangkok, Thailand, through a mutual friend in 1993. He communicated with her frequently by phone and visited her every time he was in Bangkok. They fell in love and were married in September 1995, and Suchada gave birth to Ryan Stephen Kwong in May 1996. 
Suchada was supposed to have her INS interview on August 15, 1996. However, Jimmy was killed in an accident in June, less than 3 weeks after his son was born and 2 months short of the INS interview. Now, because the petitioner is deceased, Suchada is ineligible to adjust her status. While the immigration law provides for widows of U.S. citizens to self-petition, that provision is only available for people who have been married for over 2 years. 
Suchada's deportation will not only cause hardship to her and her young child but to Suchada's mother-in-law, Mrs. Kwong, who faces losing her grandson, only a short time after she lost her only son. 
Mrs. Kwong is elderly, and though she is financially capable, could not care for her grandson herself. Mrs. Kwong is proud to be self-supporting, having owned and worked in a small business until her retirement. The family has never used public assistance, and through Jimmy's job, the family has sufficient resources to support Suchada and Ryan. It would also be difficult for Suchada as a single mother in Thailand. Here in the United States, she has the support of Mrs. Kwong and their church. 
Suchada was granted voluntary departure for one year on October 1996 to explore other options or prepare to leave the United States. During that time period, Suchada and her family have explored all options but failed. Now, the voluntary departure period has expired and Suchada must leave the country, leaving behind her young child and her family here in the United States. 
Suchada has done everything she could to become a permanent resident of this country--except for the tragedy of her husband's death 2 months before she could become a permanent resident. I hope you support this bill so that we can help Suchada begin rebuilding her life in the United States.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. President, together with my California colleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, I rise today to introduce legislation to eliminate tariffs for twenty-one chemical compounds. These compounds are components of certain AIDS and cancer drugs. For the benefit of my colleagues who may be called upon to consider the legislation, I want to describe our concerns and urge their support. 
The AIDS and cancer drug chemical compounds will be entitled to receive a zero tariff when a revised international agreement eliminating tariffs for pharmaceutical products goes into effect in January 2000. 
Until then, however, the compounds could face a tariff of between six and twelve percent, raising costs for patients and their families and discouraging the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical products in this country. The legislation we introduce today would eliminate the tariff, providing the same zero tariff provided by the WTO agreement. 
The list of specific pharmaceutical products which are entitled to receive the zero tariff is only updated every three years through the WTO negotiations. Drugs which are not approved by an agency of a federal government, like the FDA in the United States, cannot be included in the negotiations. Without formal federal approval by one of the governments, the drug cannot be included in the negotiations until the next round of negotiations, perhaps as much as three years later. This is unfair for those pharmaceutical products experiencing delays in the FDA approval process or whose approval does not match up with the negotiating timeline. 
The international community, through the World Trade Organization, committed to eliminate tariffs for pharmaceutical products. This agreement will help ensure that individuals around the world get the medicine they need, reducing drug costs by eliminating the tariff. Otherwise, the pharmaceutical products would be subject to a 6-12% tariff before they could be brought into the United States. 
In 1996, the administration agreed to treat certain chemical compounds as if they were an approved pharmaceutical product, in order to provide the zero tariff for an AIDS drug produced by a San Diego pharmaceutical company which was awaiting FDA `fast track' approval. This drug later received its formal FDA approval, becoming the first AIDS drug approved for children's use. However, as a result of changes to the manufacturing process, a different set of chemical compounds are now used, which are not eligible for the zero tariff. This tariff legislation would extend the zero tariff for these replacement chemical compounds as well. 
Last year, the administration completed negotiations for the update round, revising the list of drugs eligible to claim the zero tariff. The administration agreed to incorporate twenty-one chemical compounds, which are constituents of an AIDS or cancer drugs, into agreement. As a result, these chemical compounds will receive a zero tariff when the WTO agreement goes into effect in January 2000. Until then, however, the AIDS and cancer chemicals remain subject to US tariffs. 
The legislation we introduce would suspend the tariff until the international agreement goes into effect in 2000. These chemical compounds have been added to the zero tariff international agreement, but we should take off the tariff now to speed up the development of the AIDS and cancer drugs. 
These chemicals are not available in the United States from domestic manufacturers and are not used for other products. Consequently, the zero tariff does not undermine domestic chemical manufacturers. In fact, these chemicals eligibility for the zero tariff has been reviewed and 
approved by the chemical industry advisory committee, which advises the administration on trade policy. 
This legislation only reduces the tariff for these chemical compounds that will receive a zero tariff under the international agreement. The zero tariff for these chemical compounds has, literally, been approved by both the United States and the international negotiators. 
In 1996, the administration completed negotiations to confer eligibility for the zero tariff adopt a zero tariff for pharmaceutical products. At the time, the administration agreed to add certain chemicals, used to prepare an AIDS drug which was awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The administration's decision treats the chemicals as if they were a fully approved product. 
We must do everything we can to find a cure for HIV/AIDS and cancer. However, until we have a cure for this urgent health priority, we need to find effective treatments and put them in the hands of people with needs. By eliminating the tariff, we eliminate one more hurdle in getting the product to the patients and their families. These provisions will help accelerate the manufacturing and final testing for new drugs and deserves the full support of Congress. 
Under the 1994 GATT agreement, most pharmaceutical products are entitled to enter the country without a tariff. However, the zero tariff does not apply to many new pharmaceutical products or their chemical ingredients. As a result, the chemicals would be ineligible for the pharmaceutical zero tariff. 
The administration indicate the chemicals present no risk for law enforcement or anti-narcotics enforcement. The chemical industry advisory committee, an industry group which advises the US Trade Representative on trade issues, has also reviewed and supported the zero tariff. 
Ambassador Barshefsky and the Administration deserve tremendous credit for extending the zero tariff for these chemical components through international negotiations. As a matter of public policy, we should do everything in our power to develop effective AIDS and cancer drugs and treatments and ensure that drugs are made available as swiftly and at as low a cost as possible. We simply cannot delay or waste time in providing drugs, treatments or materials needed to fight these diseases. This tariff legislation represents a modest, but important, step. 
The Senate Finance Committee is currently developing miscellaneous tariff legislation, a bill which will include a variety of non-controversial tariff measures introduced by Finance Committee members. I would like to have this legislation incorporated by the Finance Committee, which would permit the acceleration of drug production, providing more timely relief for the public. The legislation is expected to have only a de minimis impact on tariff revenue. However, for AIDS and cancer patients, their families and those at risk, the impact may be profound. Congress should take this opportunity to reduce tariffs for these chemical compounds. 
Without this legislation to remove the tariff, we will be tolerating needless hurdles and delay, rather than expediting relief. Patients and their families do not have time to wait for the next round of drugs to be approved and added to the zero-tariff list. By importing the chemical compounds without a tariff, we can accelerate the drug development process.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, next week, the students, parents and faculty from Orange Grove Junior High in Hacienda Heights, California, will be visiting our nation's Capitol. This will be the twentieth consecutive year that students from Orange Grove have visited Washington, D.C. This also marks the twentieth consecutive visit by Orange Grove's tour leader and history teacher, Rick Fries. 
It was in the Spring of 1979 when Rick Fries first led a group of more than 25 students and adults to the East Coast, visiting Jamestown, Yorktown, Williamsburg, Charlottesville and finally Washington, D.C. For each succeeding year thereafter, he would bring another group of Orange Grove students, sometimes to new historic places, but always to Washington. His students have seen where Revolution was born in Boston, where Independence was declared in Philadelphia, where the Union was preserved in Gettysburg, and where our laws are made right here in Washington. 
From the very first tour in 1979, Mr. Fries' goal was simple: to make American History come to life for his students. The name of his tour says it all: Living History. It's fair to say he has succeeded. This year, Mr. Fries will be leading a group of 63 students and 20 adults to Washington. His tour is so popular among Orange Grove students, it is sold out well before the beginning of the school year. 
The tour has remained popular after all these years because the enthusiasm Mr. Fries shows for history and for his students has never wavered. Those who have traveled with and learned from Mr. Fries all agree: He makes the history of our country an enjoyable experience for both students and parents because he enjoys it as well. 
It's no secret to all who are associated with Orange Grove Junior High that Mr. Fries consistently has been one of the school's most popular teachers--popular with both students and parents. He is well-liked simply because he truly cares about his students. And he's considered a wonderful teacher of history because he truly cares about his country. 
Mr. Fries is one of those remarkable teachers who has made a lasting impact on the lives of young people. In fact, one of his students who traveled with Mr. Fries on his first tour to Washington back in 1979 is now a Legislative Director for my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine. This former student has said that his own interest in government, and his own love of history, was due largely to Rick Fries. I am sure there are quite a few more current and former students who were inspired by Mr. Fries, and not just in history and government. Mr. Fries also dedicates his time with young people as a football and basketball coach, and follows the example of the legendary UCLA Coach John Wooden, who developed in his athletes not just physical strength, but also strength of character. 
It is fitting that the Orange Grove students will be visiting Capitol Hill on April 13--the birthday of the author of the Declaration of Independence and our third president, Thomas Jefferson. I understand Mr. Fries is a great admirer of President Jefferson, and it shows when he and his students visit Monticello--President Jefferson's home--and the Jefferson Memorial. I also understand that of all the tributes given to President Jefferson, Mr. Fries is particularly fond of the one given by President John F. Kennedy, when the following at a White House dinner honoring Nobel Prize winners: I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.' 
Mr. President, I am sure I speak for the community of Hacienda Heights when I express my admiration and thanks to Rick Fries. 1He is truly an inspiration to his students and his fellow teachers for his tireless devotion to young people and to his profession. I wish Mr. Fries, and the students, parents and faculty from Orange Grove an enjoyable and memorable twentieth visit to our nation's capitol.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who has brought joy and laughter to countless Americans during his nearly fifty years in entertainment, Bob Barker. Next week, Mr. Barker, who is the host and executive producer of the legendary game show CBS' `The Price is Right,' celebrates airing the 5,000th episode of his series. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing his achievements. 
In his 26th season, `The Price is Right' is the longest running game show in American history and continues to be America's highest rated daytime game show. Beyond the fact that most Americans have watched the show at some point in their lives, more than 42,000 people have been contestants on the program, while an approximate 1.3 million have participated in the studio audience. Both the show's spontaneity and Mr. Barker's effortless rapport with contestants have given `The Price is Right' its unique popularity. Bob has repeatedly said over the years, `The Price is Right' is not just a television show, it is an event. Today I commend Mr. Barker not only for reaching this impressive milestone with the show, but also for his longstanding ability to entertain the American people. 
Mr. Barker was born in Darrington, Washington, and spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota where his mother was a school teacher. His family eventually moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he attended high school and Drury college on a basketball scholarship. When World War II intervened, he became a Navy fighter pilot, but the war ended before he was assigned to a seagoing squadron. 
Following his discharge, Mr. Barker returned to Drury College and took a job at a local radio station to help finance his studies. It was there that he discovered that what he did best was to host audience participation shows. After graduating summa cum laude with a degree in economics, he went to work for a radio station in Palm Beach, Florida. A year later he moved to Los Angeles, and within a week, he was the host of his own radio program, `The Bob Barker Show.' 
Bob Barker's career was forever transformed in 1956 when he debuted as the host of the television show, `Truth or Consequences.' It was his 3,524 consecutive performances on `Truth or Consequences' over its eighteen-year run that won him the title of `Most Durable Performer' in the Guiness Book of World Records. During his forty-one years on network television, he has taped more shows than any other individual for a network series. Between `Truth and Consequences,' `The Price is Right,' and his 21 years as host of both the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, he has hosted more than 8,500 shows in the course of his career. According to CBS, he has made more appearances on television in general than anyone else in the entire history of the medium. Bob has won 12 Emmy Awards, ten of which were for his performances as a game show host and represent the largest number of Emmys given to a single television performer. 
Bob is an outspoken and eloquent supporter of animal rights, and has consistently used his celebrity to help to control the animal population, thereby reducing the number of needless animal deaths. Each day he closes `The Price is Right' with a reminder to spay and neuter your pets. He has established the DJ&T Foundation to provide funding for free spay and neuter clinics across the nation. In recognition of his efforts, he received the International Society for Animal Rights' highest honor, the Henry Salt Award, in 1995. 
Therefore, as Mr. Barker commemorates the 5,000th episode of `The Price is Right,' I thank him for his special lighthearted touch. As he told the Los Angeles Times in 1996, `We don't solve the world's problems. But hopefully we help a lot of people to forget their problems for an hour * * * We're there to entertain, laugh, and have fun.' On behalf of the people of the state of California, I congratulate you, Bob, and thank you for entertaining us and making us laugh.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that we must rededicate ourselves to making our public education system the best. These reforms, if implemented by states and local school districts in partnership with the federal government, will improve: The achievement of students; the quality of teaching; and the accountability of public school systems. 
This sense of the Senate amendment has six elements. It calls on the federal government to work with states, school districts and local leaders to accomplish the following goals by the year 2005:

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of this amendment, and in particular to thank my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, for her hard work. I am aware that there is another school construction amendment. It is known as the Roth amendment. It is part of the Coverdell tax bill. These amendments, in my view, complement one another. 
What the Senator from Illinois has done is structure an amendment so it really benefits some of the older, more stressed urban school districts in America. What the other amendment would do is stress the smaller, suburban rural areas where there is substantial growth going on. So between the two of them, they provide to the States and the cities and the counties of America a truly major, major commitment to new school construction. 
This is a $21.8 billion authority for State and local governments to issue bonds to construct and rehabilitate schools. For California alone, this would mean $2.2 billion in bonds. It is the most of any State. Thirty-five percent of these bonds would be used by the 100 largest school districts based on their ESEA title I funding which assists disadvantaged children; 65 percent would be distributed by States based on their own criteria; in addition, the Secretary of Education could designate 25 additional districts based on the State's share of Elementary and Secondary Education Act title I grants, excluding the 100 largest districts. 
Under this amendment, California school districts are 
really helped. Bakersfield would get $19 million; Compton, $30 million; Fresno, $56 million; Long Beach, $48 million; Los Angeles, deeply troubled, and I will show you why in a moment, $488 million; Montebello, $22 million; Oakland, $35 million; Pomona, $18 million; Sacramento, $31 million; San Bernardino, $32 million; San Diego, $69 million; San Francisco, $28 million; Santa Ana, $27 million; and Stockton Unified, $24 million. 
This proposal, again, helps the large urban poor districts. California's public school enrollment, much of it in these districts alone, between 1997 and the year 2007, is going to grow by almost 16 percent. That is triple the national projected rate of growth of 4.1 percent. California schools will grow three times faster than schools in the rest of the United States. 
Each year, between 160,000 and 190,000 new students will come into California schools. The high school enrollment is projected to increase by 35 percent by 2007. Approximately 920,000 students--that is almost 1 million--are to be admitted to schools in the State during that period, boosting total enrollment from 5.6 million to 6.8 million. 
Our school population is bigger than the population of most of the States. That is how important this bill is to California. California needs to build 7 classrooms a day, at 25 students per class, just to keep up with the average growth that is going to take place. We need to build 327 schools over the next 3 years just to keep pace with the growth that is going to take place. We have the largest class sizes in the Nation. Students are crammed into every available hallway, assembly room, and many of them in temporary buildings. Los Angeles--and this is staggering--Unified School District has 560,000 seats for 681,000 students. That means they don't even have seats for 120,000 students. So the absence of seats in Los Angeles is bigger than most of the school districts in a State. And this is just one city in the State. 
I could go on and on with examples. But of 60 percent of the schools over 30 years old, most do not have modern infrastructure. Eighty-seven percent of the schools need to upgrade and repair buildings. The California Department of Education estimates that this State--one State alone--just to stay even, needs $22 billion during the next decade to modernize public schools and an additional $8 billion just to meet enrollment growth. That is $30 billion in the next decade just to stay even. 
I have heard a lot of talk on this floor about education, and I can say only one thing: If you talk education and you have crowded and dilapidated schools and you don't have seats for the children in the schools, there is only one thing you can really do, and that is put your money where your mouth is. This is the first step toward `putting your money where your mouth is' amendment. 
I am so proud of the Senator from Illinois. There is no 
single piece of legislation, there is no single amendment on any bill, that will help the school system of the great State of California more than the Moseley-Braun amendment. I want to make that crystal clear. 
Here is what it costs. I mentioned the cost and that we need $30 billion just to stay even. Here is what it costs to build a school in California: An elementary school, $5.2 million; a middle school, $12 million; a high school, $27 million. 
Our schools must be built to withstand earthquakes, floods, El Nino, and myriad other natural disasters. The cost of building a high school in California is almost twice the national cost. The U.S. average is $15 million; in California, it is $27 million. We have the largest pupil-per-teacher ratio in the country. And thanks to the Governor and the legislature, we are now beginning to reduce class size. K-3 is now limited to 20 students per teacher. 
In conclusion, studies show that test scores of students in schools in poor condition can fall as much as 11 percentage points below scores of students in good buildings. I think this amendment is important. I really hope that no one in this body would not vote for this amendment because of the Coverdell bill. The Coverdell bill and the Roth amendment cover very different school districts than does this amendment. If you want to help the big urban school districts of America, where the dilapidated schools are, where the learning really needs improvement, there is only one game in town, and it is Carol Moseley-Braun's school construction amendment. I am proud to support it.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Senator Murray's amendment today to create a reserve fund for adding 100,000 public school teachers and to reduce class sizes in the early grades to 18 students per classroom. 
CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS ARE OVERWHELMED 
I come from the State that has some of the largest class sizes in the Nation in our public schools. In 1994, California's schools averaged about 30 students per class, the highest in the country. In 1995-1996, when the average pupil teacher ratio for all grades, elementary and secondary in the Nation was 17.3 students per teacher, in California, it was 24.0. 
In the 1993-1994 school year, in elementary schools, California had 29.4 students per class while the U.S. average was 24.1. For secondary schools in 1993-1994, the average California classroom had 29.7 students while the average U.S. classroom had 23.6 students, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics. 
When one computes total teaching staff per pupil, again, California's number are substantially higher than national rates, says NCES. In 1995-1996, California's pupil-teacher ratio was 24.0, compared to the U.S. average of 17.3 pupils per teacher. The 1997 estimate likewise has California exceeding national rates: California, 22.7 students per teacher; U.S. 17.0 students per teacher. 
Today, many classes have 40 or more students per teacher. Our students and teachers are crammed into every available closet, cafeteria and temporary building available. At John Muir Elementary School in San Bruno, one class spent much of the year on the stage of the school's multipurpose room as it waited for portable rooms to arrive. Los Angeles Unified School District has 560,000 seats for 681,000 students. 
To add to the problem, California will have a school enrollment rate between 1997 and 2007 of 15.7 percent, triple the national rate of 4.1 percent. We will have the largest enrollment increase of all states during the next ten years. By 2007, our enrollment will have increased by 35.3 percent. To put it another way, California needs to build seven new classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the surge in student enrollment. 
The California Department of Education says that we need to add about 327 schools over the next three years, just to keep pace with the projected growth. But these phenomenal construction rates will only maintain current use. They do not begin to relieve overcrowding, our current large class sizes. 
Fortunately, California has embarked on an effort to reduce class size, providing state funds to local school districts to hire more teachers for grades K through 3. The goal is to cut class sizes from 28.6 students to no more than 20 students in grades K through 3. California is spending $2.5 billion over two years to cut class size and the annual cost of this reform will be about $1.5 billion. California has created at least 17,000 new classes and over half of the State's 1.9 million eligible students are now in classes of 20 or fewer students. A similar federal effort, like President Clinton's initiative and Senator Murray's amendment, can complement California's effort.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I want the Senator to know what a pleasure it is for me to be able to support the Senator's amendment and also to say many, many thanks for his leadership on this issue. I am a member of his task force. He has been absolutely indefatigable in the pursuit of quality child care for the citizens of our country. I am very proud to support this amendment. 
Mr. President, if I might begin by asking a quick question through the Chair. I ask the Senator from Connecticut this question: Is he aware of how many children are on the waiting list for child care facilities in the largest State in the Union?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Boxer and I, I think this one statistic irrefutably points out the need for this amendment. I did not support the welfare reform bill. The reason I didn't support the welfare reform bill was exactly this. The way the bill is weighted, the targets that need to be met in the State of California increase with time. We estimated that we had to develop in California 600,000 additional child care slots a year just to keep up with the need. 
What the Senator has just revealed to me indicates that within this first year we already see a waiting list of 200,000. I expect in the next 2 years this waiting list to increase threefold, up to 600,000 families waiting for adequate child care. 
If we want Americans to leave welfare behind as a way of life, if we want to see Americans entrepreneurial and working, then we must see there is adequate child care available for the children of these families. A great bulk of the people involved here are single parents with children. They need to earn a living. They have no choice. They must find child care. 
This amendment creates in the reserve fund some moneys to be able to help the State create the slots. Let me say how difficult this is in California, an earthquake-prone State, tough building codes, tough individual county and city codes. Therefore, these 
facilities are expensive to build. This amendment provides an opportunity to try a number of different approaches, including employer-based child care, child care that is shared, chambers of commerce working with schools, working with college districts to provide teachers for these child care facilities. All of this can be done. You cannot do it without money. Therefore, I think this reserve fund is certainly small to begin with but certainly necessary. 
It is with great pride that I thank the Senator for his leadership and that both Senator Boxer and I are delighted to support this amendment.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator D'Amato, Senator Boxer, Senator Rockefeller and others in support of legislation to create the Medical Innovation Tax Credit. The proposed tax credit can be an effective complement to the existing research and experimentation tax credit. The new proposal will support additional medical research at fine research universities, like the University of California and Stanford University, assisting in the development of new products to improve health and save lives. I am pleased to support Senator D'Amato's proposal. 
Under the legislation, the Medical Innovation Tax Credit would provide a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company with a tax credit equal to 20% of their expenditures for human drug clinical trials conducted at medical schools, university teaching hospitals or non-profit research hospitals working in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health. 
The proposal will provide an important incentive to conduct the research trials in the university hospital setting, improving academic training, health care and the development of new research and bio-medical products. 
The legislation will assist medical schools and research institutions leverage additional private sector support for medical schools and teaching hospitals. Teaching hospitals have historically been an important site of research activity. However, partially because of the universities' broad education mission, teaching hospitals face a cost-disadvantage when compared to a `for profit' contract research organization. This new research credit will help level the playing field for medical schools and teaching hospitals. 
The proposal will help provide, in an indirect manner, additional resources for medical research. The administration and Congress both enthusiastically support increasing federal support for medical research through the National Institutes of Health. However, with our acute budget needs, Congress may face difficulty in meeting our goals. Congress can provide new sources of revenue for these research hospitals by encouraging them to serve as sites for clinical trials. Only clinical research activities conducted in the United States can qualify for the credit, decreasing the economic incentive to move the research activities to lower cost facilities off-shore. 
The support is appropriate because academic health centers address important societal priorities, accepting expenses other medical facilities may not have to incur. 
University-based teaching hospitals provide a disproportionate share of high-cost, critical services to low-income or uninsured individuals. 
University-based teaching hospitals carry a higher burden of necessary, but in many cases unprofitable, services, such as emergency trauma care and burn unit facilities. Academic health centers represent only 2% of all non-federal community hospitals, but have 33% of the trauma units and 50% of its burn units. 
The credit will help provide, in an indirect manner, additional funds for medical research by encouraging them 
to serve as clinical trial sites. The infusion of research dollars will support their vital missions. 
The proposal will help arrest the declining rate of clinical research trials conducted at these facilities. 
The American Association of Medical Colleges, which supports the legislation, reports a 22% drop in clinical research at member hospitals. 
A recent study of three pharmaceutical companies indicates that although pharmaceutical R&D is larger than the research funds of the National Institutes of Health, the level of university-based clinical trials has declined from 82% in 1989 to 68% in 1993. 
This proposal can help schools arrest the steady, five year decline and make the most of their research dollars. 
The credit will serve as an effective supplement to the current Research and Experimentation Credit and the Orphan Drug Tax Credit and provide a cost-effective incentive to encourage companies to pursue research in an academic setting. The credit will promote research at teaching hospitals, lead to the development of stronger research universities, contribute to new medical therapies and products and strengthen our world leadership in the important field of medical innovation. I am pleased to lend my support.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to continue the arguments that the Senator from Georgia has made and add some of my own. And, Mr. President, I do not make these arguments lightly, nor do I make them with any sense of pleasure. 
It is never easy or pleasant to criticize a friend, a neighbor, and an ally. And Mexico is all of these. The United States and Mexico have a deep and complex relationship that spans every conceivable form of interaction across a 2,000-mile border. And we need to work together to solve problems that confront us. 
I have heard many arguments--`Oh, this is all a United States problem.' Well, Mr. President, the United States is trying to address that problem. Let me give you just two facts to corroborate that. One, in 1998, the U.S. Federal Government has spent or will spend nearly $16 billion fighting drugs. Of that, on demand reduction alone, we will spend $5.37 billion; on interdiction, $1.62 billion; on domestic law enforcement, $8.4 billion. And it all goes up next year. 
One interesting fact is in 1985 prisoners on drug charges in Federal prisons were 31.4 percent of the total. Today, almost 60 percent of the Federal prison population is in prison on drug charges. So the number of people in Federal prisons for drug crimes in the United States of America has risen by over 30 percent in this decade. 
We are trying. We may fail, but we do try. So this country does make a substantial effort--prevention, education, treatment, all of it. 
`Full cooperation' means full cooperation. And there were six benchmarks, as Senator Coverdell stated, that comprised the basic part of our concerns of last year: enforcement, dismantling the drug cartels, combating corruption, curtailing money laundering, extraditing Mexican nationals on drug-related charges, and law enforcement cooperation. 
I would like to discuss each one of these areas in detail. But I want to make the point that I believe Mexico has fallen short of the mark of full cooperation in each of these areas. 
On the day the certification decision was announced, the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, said, `I would just like to underscore the absolutely superlative cooperation we have received from Mexico.' I thought a lot about that. What I finally realized is, you know, now I know what the problem is. Mexico's cooperation with the United States focuses primarily on the political level. Tragically, it does so at the expense of the much more important law enforcement level. The degree to which the administration emphasizes this political level of cooperation is evident by the State Department's statement of explanation on the certification of Mexico. The first two paragraphs focus exclusively on meetings held between senior officials, commitments they have made, documents they have signed, and so on. 
In other words, the most compelling rationale for certifying Mexico this year that the administration can offer is based on political-level agreements. But if there is one truth about the war on drugs, it is that it is fought on the streets, not in the conference rooms and banquet halls. Handshakes between men and women in suits do not stop drug trafficking. Good intelligence and good police work can and do stop drug trafficking. Law enforcement cooperation, not political-level agreements, is where the rubber hits the road in counternarcotics. Until this exists in Mexico, the administration's certification of Mexico will have all the weight of an inflated balloon--impressive to look at, but hollow at the core and easily punctured. 
So with this background, I would like to offer my response to the administration's rationale for its decision to certify Mexico, in hopes that the Senate will act to overturn this decision. And I will rely on the benchmarks we set last year. 
The State Department statement of explanation says: `Drug seizures in 1997 generally increased over 1996 levels.' Now, this is true, but it is only part of the picture. 
Let us begin with this first chart. Yes; this is 1996, and as you can see, cocaine seizures have gone up from 23.6 metric tons to 34.9 metric tons. But look back at the peak in 1991 when it was 50.3 metric tons, look at the drop; look at 1993 when it was 46.2; and then look at it drop back down into the low 20s. Cocaine seizures today are still over 30 percent below where they were back in 1991 when the supply was not nearly as large as it is today. 
Let us take a look at heroin seizures. Again, we are told they are much improved. But look at the heroin seizures by Mexico. Beginning in 1994 at 297 kilograms, they go down in 1995 to 203 kilograms, and they go up in 1996 to 363 kilograms; this year they have gone down all the way to 115 kilograms. I think this is very, very dramatic. 
Let us take a look, if we can, at methamphetamine seizures by Mexico. 1994, 265 kilograms; 496 kilograms in 1995. It has gone steadily downhill--to 172 kilograms in 1996 and all the way to 39 kilograms in 1997--as the United States of America has been inundated with methamphetamine labs. I am ashamed to say my State, the largest State in this Union, has become a source country for the dissemination of methamphetamine now throughout the rest of the United States--the great bulk of it coming from one cartel, which I will point out. A great bulk of the labs are operated, regretfully, by Mexican nationals in this country illegally. 
Let us take a look at ephedrine seizures. Ephedrine is a key chemical without which methamphetamine cannot be produced. Here were the seizures in 1996--6,697 kilograms. Look how high they were. Here are the seizures in 1997--only 608 kilograms, a drop of over 90 percent. This is clearly a great drop. 
Now let us look at narcotics arrests of Mexican nationals by Mexico in Mexico. 
In 1992, they arrested 27,369 people. Look at it in 1997--10,572 people. That is a two-thirds drop in arrests when we are putting all this pressure on, saying, `Go after the cartels. Stop the assassinations. Break it up.' The arrests have actually dropped. 
Take the next chart. Now, one of the major tests--not the only test; it is not 100 percent accurate--of supply is what street prices are. In Main Street, prices for drugs drop when the supply goes up. Every single narcotics officer that works undercover or works the streets of America will tell you that. So we went to the Western States Information Network, which surveys the findings of local police departments on the west coast. Let me share with you what we found. 
Cocaine in the Los Angeles region has fallen from $16,500 per kilo in 1994 to $14,000 per kilo in 1997. It has leveled off this past year. But this is the drop over that period of time. 
Now, let us talk about black tar heroin. Black tar heroin is Mexican heroin. In the Los Angeles area, look at the street prices in 1991. According to DEA, this is nearly the exclusive province of the Mexican family-operated cartels based in Michoacan. In Los Angeles, the price per ounce has dropped two-thirds, from $1,800 in 1992 to $600 in 1997. The price today is one-third of what it was 5 years ago. This is why we see a tremendous increase in heroin addiction in this country. The supply overwhelms the demand, and the prices drop. 
In San Francisco it is the same story. Black tar heroin--an average of $3,500 per ounce in 1991. Today it averages $600 per ounce, a dramatic drop in price. 
And we see the same pattern with methamphetamine. In Los Angeles, the price per pound for methamphetamine averaged $9,000 in 1991. Today it has dropped down--gone up and down--but dropped down to $3,500 per pound. It is a two-thirds drop in price. That is enormous in the methamphetamine contraband market. 
So these street price statistics tell the story of supply. And supply comes mainly flowing across our southern border. 
Just this week, the March 23 edition of the San Diego Union-Tribune had an article entitled `Brazen Traffickers Want Run of the Border: Drug Flow From Mexico Now More Deadly, Frequent.' 
So in my view, low seizure figures, low arrest figures, falling street prices in our cities, and inundated Customs and Border Patrol agents are hardly indications of `full cooperation' by Mexico's authorities. 
Let me speak about what the great danger is now. What I believe to be the biggest criminal enterprise in the Western Hemisphere is developing in Mexico, and that is the cartels. 
There are essentially four major cartels: the Juarez cartel, known as the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel; the Sonora cartel, known as the Caro-Quintero cartel; the Tijuana cartel, known as the Arellano-Felix brothers; and the Amezcua-Contreras brothers. 
In testimony about a month ago, DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine left little doubt when he talked to the Foreign Relations Committee about Mexico's efforts to dismantle the cartels. He said:  
Unfortunately, the Government of Mexico has made very little progress in the apprehension of known syndicate leaders who dominate the drug trade in Mexico and control a substantial share of the wholesale cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine markets in the United States. 
To me, this is a very telling statement. The State Department would have us believe all is well in the Mexican effort against the cartels--and they will point out some arrests--but every one of these arrests is second and third level cartel participants, not top level. I believe Mr. Constantine's testimony tells the true story--very little progress. I hope my colleagues will take these words into consideration. 
Let me begin with the Juarez cartel. 
Mr. Constantine stated: 
The scope of the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel is staggering, reportedly forwarding $20-$30 million to Colombia for each major operation and generating tens of millions of dollars in profits per week for itself. 
Meanwhile, the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel--that is the Juarez cartel--spreads its tentacles into U.S. cities, where it recruits U.S. gang members to act as its agents. DEA has identified active Carrillo-Fuentes cells in cities around the United States--Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Houston, Dallas, Denver, Chicago, and most recently New York City. 
Now, this is really interesting, because New York City used to be the preserve of the Colombian cartels who marketed their cocaine directly. But a DEA study in August of 1997 revealed that the Mexican distribution networks were rapidly moving into the east coast markets of New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, displacing the Colombians. 
This trend was illustrated in a major DEA investigation--Operation Limelight--which uncovered a Chicago-based cell of the Carrillo-Fuentes organization that was delivering hundreds of kilograms of cocaine to a distribution network in New York. I believe my colleague from Illinois will, hopefully, speak to that. 
Now, some felt that the death of Juarez cartel's leader--Amado Carrillo Fuentes--during attempted plastic surgery last May, could have set the stage for the weakening of the cartel. 
One might even concede that Carrillo-Fuentes' death was as a result of his feeling under some pressure from the Mexican authorities, although this is far from proven. 
But instead of getting weaker, the Juarez cartel is now stronger. Mexico didn't take any action whatever to capitalize on the opportunity provided by this death. Today the Juarez cartel continues to operate. This is in spite of a power struggle within the cartel that has produced an orgy of violence--50 drug-related murders in and around Juarez, which is clearly well beyond the Mexican authorities' ability to control. 
There has been no effort to arrest the new leaders of this cartel, men such as Vincente Carrillo-Fuentes--Amado's brother--or Juan Esparragosa Moreno, a top aide, or Eduardo Gonzalez-Quirarte, a key manager of the organization's distribution networks along the border. 
The other major drug trafficking cartel is the most violent and the most vicious. That is the Arellano-Felix cartel, operating right across the border from California in Tijuana. According to the DEA, `Based in Tijuana, this organization is one of the most powerful, violent, and aggressive trafficking groups in the world.' They are active today, this year, in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. Once again, no effort to arrest their leaders. 
On September 11, the most violent of the Arellano-Felix brothers, Ramon Arellano-Felix, was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. He has been indicted in San Diego on drug trafficking charges. Why has there been no effort taken by the Mexican authorities to rein in the operations of the Arellano-Felix organization or to arrest its senior leaders? 
I would like to talk about one other cartel. The first is the Jesus Amezcua cartel. According to the DEA, `The Amezcua-Contreras brothers, operating out of Guadalajara, Mexico, head a methamphetamine production and trafficking organization with global dimensions.' This organization has established links to distribution networks in the United States in locations like California, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Iowa, Georgia, and North Carolina.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in 1988, Congress passed the Duty Free Sales Enterprises Act which, among other things, gave Customs the authority to audit duty free stores to ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing import activities. The Act also permitted off-airport sites, as long as they were in within 25 miles of the airport. What happens is: tourists visit the off-airport site, buy duty-free goods and those goods are shipped to meet them when they arrive home. 
When the bill was passed, audits were conducted in person by Customs inspectors. The 25-mile limit was imposed so as not to unduly burden inspectors who would otherwise have to travel great distances between stores. However, audits are no longer conducted in person; rather they are done by computer. Inspectors no longer have to travel between stores. 
This legislation adds new section to the law establishing the 25-mile limit to allow exceptions if Customs is reasonably assured the goods being sold are duty free items for people leaving through international airports. All of the other regulations controlling audits and inspections are still in effect; this simply allows stores outside of the 25-mile limit. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. President, I am introducing today, the Child Support Penalty Fairness Act of 1998. Similar to the House passed Child Support Performance and Incentive Act, this legislation decreases penalties for states who didn't make the October 1997 child support enforcement system deadline but this legislation provides exemptions for those counties, such as Los Angeles county, that made the deadline even if the state didn't. 
This legislation decreases the overall penalties to 4% of the child support administrative funds in the first year, and doubles the percentage of penalties each year, capping it at 20% by the fourth year. Additionally, if the state becomes certified during the year, 75% of the penalties would be forgiven for that fiscal year. The penalty structure in this legislation is the same as Clay Shaw's bill, HR3130, which passed the House of Representatives two weeks ago and awaits consideration in the Senate Finance Committee. 
The current penalties for not having the child support enforcement system up and running are enormous. States would be penalized all their TANF (AFDC) funding and their child support administration funds for the year. 
The total loss in TANF funds and child support administrative funds from the 14 states amount to over $8 billion annually and for California, the penalty would be $3.7 billion in TANF funds and $300 million in child support administrative funds annually. 
What is unique about this legislation is that in addition to lowering penalties, it exempts from the penalties those counties who had their own certifiable systems prior to October 31, 1997. 
All of us agree that for states who did not make the deadline, they should be held accountable. But for those states who have county based child support systems where individual counties could have been certified by HHS independently, it is unfair to penalize the counties with the state. 
For California, 25% or $75 million of the penalty will be borne by LA County, the largest county in the nation serving 550,000 families and whose program is larger than 42 other states. Despite the fact that LA County completed its system by the October 1997 deadline and could be certified as recognized by HHS in its March 2, 1998 proposed rules, LA County will be penalized along with the rest of California. 
This is unfair and wrong. As I propose in my legislation, when counties have met the system requirement by building their own system with separate HHS funding, their portion should be exempted from the total penalties imposed on a state. 
Mr. President, I know there is bi-partisan support for my proposal which is similar to Clay Shaw's bill which passed the House. My proposal differs from Shaw's bill in that it exempts penalties for those counties who met all the requirements and completed their child support enforcement system before the October 1997 deadline. This provision is critical for many states whose counties have done their job but will suffer enormous penalties because the state as a whole have failed. 
I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, the memorandum of understanding, and excerpts from 42 CFR Part 307 be printed into the Record.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it was a great treat for me to listen to the very eloquent comments of the Senator from Michigan. A few years ago, Vice President Walter Mondale said to me `When you go to the Senate, listen to Carl Levin; he is one of the most articulate and erudite Members of that body.' After hearing his discussion of the NATO enlargement, I just want to say the Vice President was correct.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee to support the legislation before us. I happen to believe that admitting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO is a natural and logical response to the end of the cold war, and is a crucial element of a larger strategy to build a Europe that is at last undivided, democratic, and at peace. I support enlargement because, first, I believe there is a sound strategic rationale for enlargement; secondly, because I believe that Russian concerns that NATO expansion presents a threat or a challenge to the well-being of Russia are unfounded; and, thirdly, because I believe that costs of enlargement will not be an undue burden on the United States but, rather, will be shared among all members on a fair basis. 
Let me speak briefly about each of these issues. For almost 50 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has served as the centerpiece of American foreign policy in the European theater. NATO presented a firm committed alliance, a major deterrent to any aggressive thrust by the Soviet Union. It has been a successful military alliance, and it has served the national interests of the United States in preventing aggression in uncertain times. 
When NATO was originally formed during the early days of the cold war, it was conceived as a purely defensive alliance, a static line protecting Western Europe from Soviet encroachment. But it has been more than 8 years since the Berlin wall came down. Today, the Soviet Union is gone and the sort of military threat for which NATO was originally conceived and designed, thankfully, no longer exists. 
I believe that this new post-cold-war era calls for a new NATO, a NATO that is an alignment of like-thinking states committed to democratic values and mutual defense within a given geographic community. This new, enlarged NATO is not intended to be, nor do I believe it will be, a threat to any other State or group of States. 
As our Secretary of State has put it, the strategic rationale for enlarging the Alliance is straightforward. Admitting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO `will make America safer, 
NATO stronger and Europe more peaceful and united.' I believe that. 
A larger NATO will make the world safer by expanding the area of Europe where wars do not happen. Twice in this century we have sent our sons and daughters across the Atlantic to Europe to fight and die in world wars which began in Europe. By reaffirming our commitment to an enlarged NATO, history teaches us that we make it less likely that we will be called to do so again. It has often been said that vigilance is the price of freedom. NATO remains a form of vigilance. 
A larger NATO will also be a stronger NATO. To align themselves with NATO, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have strengthened their democratic institutions and resolved ethnic and border disputes in the region. They are bringing their militaries into alignment with the requirements of NATO membership. They have met the requirements for application: democratic reform, development of free market economies, and that each country be able to make a substantial military commitment to the alliance. 
The United States has important political, economic, security and, yes, moral and humanitarian interests in Europe. These interests demand continued active U.S. engagement in the transatlantic community. Just as NATO has for the past 50 years, I believe that an enlarged Alliance will provide an effective mechanism to maintain a more unified European community with shared values. 
The second issue which I mentioned, the future of NATO-Russia relations, is one which I know is of great concern to many of our colleagues. Let me share my perspective on this issue. 
I would agree with some who oppose enlargement that if it inflames `the nationalistic, anti-western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion,' as George Kennan recently wrote, then it truly would be a questionable course of action. But I do not really believe that NATO enlargement provides a realistic basis for this thinking. 
In fact, for all the politicking against NATO enlargement inside Moscow's ring road, many thoughtful Russians, especially younger ones, realize that NATO enlargement is not a threat. 
Russia now has a constructive relationship with NATO. Our troops are cooperating in Bosnia. Russia has requested that their troops be allowed to participate in all future Partnership for Peace exercises. And we are moving ahead with arms control. Russia is ahead of schedule under the START I treaty. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has committed to Duma ratification of START II. And we have agreed on the outlines of a Start III treaty that will cut both United States and Russian nuclear arsenals to 80 percent below their cold war peak. Russia has joined us in banning nuclear testing and ratifying the treaty to outlaw chemical weapons. 
Now, all this is not to say that future NATO-Russia or United States-Russia relations will be smooth and trouble free. There probably will be issues in the years ahead on which we will disagree and which we will have to work through. But if Russian policy and/or Russian-European relations should sour, it is my belief that it will be because of the internal dynamics of Russia itself, not because of NATO enlargement. 
In fact, it is my belief that enlargement of the Alliance and engagement with Russia may offer increased opportunity for the development of a democratic Russia and an even more productive relationship between Russia and the United States. 
I strongly believe that a key and critical outcome of NATO enlargement must be a greater engagement with Russia to assure that NATO enlargement is not perceived as a threat nor as an act that in any way signals aggressive intent. It is this path, I believe, which offers the best hope for a peaceful and secure Europe in the decades ahead. 
A third area of concern is questions which have been raised about the costs of enlargement. 
NATO has estimated that the common fund cost for enlargement will be $1.5 billion over 10 years. The U.S. share of these enlargement costs is about $360 million, in proportion to the current 24 percent U.S. share for common-funded projects. I believe that this cost for the U.S. share of enlargement is reasonable. 
In my mind, however, the critical cost issue is burdensharing. If we go forward and enlarge and adapt the Alliance, all NATO members must be willing to pay their fair shares. 
I must say I was very concerned last year when French President Chirac commented, in effect, that France would not pay one more centime for the costs of enlargement. 
During the hearings conducted by the Foreign Relations Committee, assurances were received from the administration that all allies will, in fact, pay their fair share. And, despite the earlier negative French comments, both the current members of NATO and the three prospective members have pledged that, indeed, they will meet their share of Alliance costs. 
I have been reassured by these comments, and I have also worked with the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee to assure that strong, clear, and unambiguous language regarding costs and burdensharing has been included in the resolution of ratification. That in fact is now the case. 
The language which we have included requires the President to certify that the inclusion of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will not increase the overall U.S. share of the NATO common budget, and that the United States is under no obligation to subsidize the costs of new members joining the Alliance. The President must also certify that enlargement will not undermine our ability to meet other security obligations. 
Finally, the resolution of ratification also includes a reporting requirement which will provide Congress with detailed information on the national defense budgets of NATO members, their contributions to the common budget, and U.S. costs associated within enlargement. 
So, as we proceed with the process of enlargement, this information will allow Congress to make a determination about the efforts that our allies are making and, if necessary, take action at the appropriate time to ensure that the burdens of the expanded alliance are fairly met. 
In summary, I believe the inclusion of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in NATO will contribute to a stronger, more stable, and more secure Europe, one that is even a more reliable partner for the United States. Such a Europe is clearly in U.S. national interests, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the resolution of ratification. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. President, I am introducing today the Child Support Performance Act of 1998. This legislation decreases penalties for those 14 states who did not make the child support enforcement system deadline last October. 
This legislation decreases the overall penalties to 4% of the child support administrative funds in the first year, and increases the penalties by 4% each year up to 20%. However, if the state meets the benchmark goals it set out with HHS at the beginning of the year, 75% of the penalties would be forgiven each year. This provision encourages states to set realistic goals for the year and recognizes their progress each year instead of the all or nothing approach under current law. 
The current penalties for not having the child support enforcement system up and running are enormous. States would be penalized all their TANF (AFDC) funding and their child support administration funds for the year. 
The total loss in TANF funds and child support administrative funds from the 14 states amount to over $8 billion per year. More specifically, California would lose $4 billion. Illinois would lose $654 million. Michigan would lose $857 million. Pennsylvania would lose $794 million. 
There is enough blame to go around for the states' failures to meet the child support enforcement systems deadline. 
The lengthy private sector contractor procurement and federal approval processes; many vendors' inability to complete work to specifications within the time allowed; the long time needed to convert large caseloads into a new system; the difficulties inherent in a single system conversion in large states like California. 
All of us would agree that the huge financial penalties imposed on 14 or more states would cause hardship to the children and families in the affected states. However, since over 30% of all child support cases are interstate collection cases, the penalties would have a nationwide impact. 
What this means is that children in Kansas or Georgia will not be able to get child support from parents in California, Pennsylvania or the other 12 states who face the devastating penalties. 
For the 14 states who face such devastating prospects, without my legislation, the rigid one statewide system requirement and the harsh penalty imposed on states would impoverish 19 million families with children nationwide. 
Let me also point out the unfairness of current penalties on Los Angeles County. For California, 25% of the penalty will be borne by LA County, the largest county in the nation, serving 550,000 families. Despite the fact that LA County completed its system by the October deadline and could be certified as recognized by HHS in its March 2, 1998 proposed rules, LA County will be penalized along with the rest of California. 
This is unfair and wrong. As I propose in my legislation, when counties have met the system requirement by building their own system with separate HHS funding, their portion should be exempted from the total penalties imposed on a state. 
The House of Representatives recently passed Clay Shaw's legislation, H.R. 3130, that lowered the penalties for those states who did not meet the October 1st deadline last year. Representative Shaw's bill lowers the penalties but remains very harsh for those states who missed the deadline but who are on their way to becoming certified within a year or two. 
Under Shaw's bill, California alone would face $12 million in penalty in the first year and up to $60 million in the forth year, denying 2.36 million impoverished families in California of their child support. It will not hurt the state, but only those families we are trying to help. 
In other big states like Illinois, approximate 730,000 families with children may not get their child support because the state faces $2.7 million in penalties during the first year, and up to $13.5 million in the fourth year. 
For Michigan, 1.5 million families with children may not get their child support because the state faces $3.27 million in penalties during the first year, up to $16.3 million in the fourth year. 
Some, argue that these cuts are necessary to punish the states for not coming into compliance, but the reality is, that again only hurts the families with children. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is, if we don't have child support enforcement systems up and running, children and families don't get their child support. 14 states do not have a child support enforcement system and imposing harsh penalties will not encourage states to perform better but debilitate their ability to serve.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to introduce private relief legislation to assist Mrs. Ruth Hairston, of Carson, California. Identical legislation is proceeding through the House, an effort led by Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald and I am pleased to support this effort. 
Mrs. Hairston requires this extreme step in order to be able to pursue a federal court appeal of the Merit Systems Protection Board (# CSF 2221413), which denied Mrs. Hairston's eligibility for an annuity following the retirement and untimely death of her former husband. The legislation does not require the annuity, but will only permit the filing of an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals. As a result, Mrs. Hairston will be permitted to challenge the denial on the merits, rather than accept the denial due to the failure to file an appeal within thirty days. 
I would briefly like to describe the facts which warrant this legislation. 
Mr. Paul Hairston retired in 1980, electing a survivor annuity for Mrs. Hairston. However, the couple was divorced in 1985, entitling Mrs. Hairston to receive 1/2 the retirement benefit under the settlement terms. Mr. and Mrs. Hairston began receiving benefits in 1988. 
The Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews Civil Service retirement claims, concluded Mr. Hairston had failed to register Mrs. Hairston for survivors benefits following passage of 1985 law, renewing the survivor annuity previously selected in 1985. As a result, the spousal survivor benefits for Mrs. Hairston were canceled. Following Mr. Hairston's death in 1995, Mrs. Hairston's benefits, her portion of his retirement benefit under the divorce settlement, ceased. Mrs. Hairston was denied eligibility as a surviving spouse, but did not challenge or appeal the denial of eligibility, due to hospitalization and poor health. 
I am pleased to introduce this private relief legislation to assist my constituent Mrs. Ruth Hairston. While this legislation represents an extraordinary measure, the step is necessary in order to permit a federal court appeal of the denial of eligibility by he Merit Systems Protection Board. As I have previously stated, this legislation does not require any specific outcome. The federal court will review the appeal with all the rigor the case deserves. However, Mrs. Hairston will receive her day in court and the opportunity to challenger the decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board to deny eligibility. 
This legislation was brought to my attention by Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald, who has been pursuing identical legislation in the House. I understand Mrs. Hairston is under considerable financial pressure and could face foreclosure on her home. I am pleased to try to assist Mrs. Hairston in her appeal.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with enthusiasm and pride that I ask my colleagues to confirm Judge Jeremy Fogel for appointment to the Northern District Court in California. 
I recommended to President Clinton the appointment of Judge Fogel. 
Judge Fogel has been unanimously approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and I hope that he will receive the same type of support today. 
Judge Fogel is extremely well qualified for this appointment. He is a highly respected judge in the San Jose area. 
For the past three years, in fact, Judge Fogel was ranked as the best Superior Court Judge in the Santa Clara County according to a survey of both prosecutors and attorneys. 
Judge Fogel has earned a reputation for fairness and sound reasoning over the course of his 17-year career on both the Municipal and Superior Courts in California. 
Let me provide a few details about Judge Fogel: 
He obtained his Bachelors degree from Stanford University, graduating with `great distinction,' and went on to earn his Juris Doctorate from Harvard University, graduating cum laude. 
Following law school, he served as a civil attorney at Smith, Johnson, Fogel & Ramo in San Jose and worked as executive director of the Santa Clara County Bar Association Law Foundation. 
Appointed to the Municipal Court in 1981, he served as Presiding Judge of the Court's Felony Division and in 1984, Presiding Judge of the Municipal Court 
Immediately after election to the Superior Court in 1986, he was assigned to be the Court's sole civil law and motion judge. Judge Fogel has also served as the civil team leader responsible for settlement and case management. 
Judge Fogel is also a recognized expert in judicial ethics and discipline, having taught ethics to judges and lawyers since 1988. 
He has served as an advisor on judicial ethics to the Judicial Council of California, the Commission on Judicial Performance and the California Judges Association. 
His outstanding experience in the State Courts and his experience advocating for high judicial standards are just some of the reasons Judge Fogel is so well respected within the legal community and has such strong bipartisan support. 
Judge Fogel's support--from Republicans and Democrats alike--includes many endorsements from law enforcement leaders, attorneys and Judges on the State Court who know him best. 
In the law enforcement community, Judge Fogel has earned the strong support of Santa Clara County District Attorney George Kennedy and the California Narcotics Officers Association. 
I'd like to quote from just some of the impressive letters of support we received on behalf of Judge Fogel: 
State Court of Appeal Presiding Justice J. Clinton Peterson wrote: 
Judge Fogel is a highly disciplined jurist of exceptional intellect. . . . By reputation he has long been one of the leading members of the Santa Clara bench, noted particularly for his outstanding judicial demeanor and impartiality in applying the law. 
Weldon Wood, principal of Robinson & Wood and officer of San Francisco Chapter of American Board of Trial Advocates said: 
My experience with Judge Fogel comes from several years of almost daily contact by me or members of law firm while he served as the Civil Law & Motion Judge. . . . In that position he was called upon to read, understand and rule on a huge volume of motions, many of which were quite complex. He was exceptionally impressive in his grasp of the facts and the law in ruling on those motions. His reputation for making the correct and legal ruling is excellent. He treats all who appear before him with courtesy, respect and proper judicial decorum. 
Santa Clara County Bar Association President Richard Loftus wrote: 
The lawyers of this County believe him to be a bright, thoughtful person who is a leader of the local judiciary. 
Retired California Court of Appeal Associate Justice Harry Brauer said: 
[Judge] Fogel is extraordinarily competent, and I am not given to hyperbole. He is conscientious and has good judgement. He works very hard . . . There is not a Superior Court judge in that District who is better qualified then he is. . . . You could not do better than to nominate Judge Fogel. 
San Jose Attorney David Bennion wrote: 
He does not favor one side over another. He treats people and clients evenhandedly. 
As these quotes indicate, Judge Fogel's sound judgement has earned him the highest respect of those in the legal community 
Jeremy Fogel, quite simply, is one of the best and brightest Judges in California. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to confirm his nomination to the Northern District Court.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, for Women's History Month, I want the world to know how proud I am of the women's business leadership in California and the entire United States. It is with great pride that we recognize California is No. 1 in the number of women entrepreneurs as well as the fastest growing state for women minority entrepreneurs. 
The entire nation should celebrate with us as we recognize that there are almost 9 million women entrepreneurs today of which 1.1 million are minorities. 
The female labor force is making great strides as we project, along with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that 72 million women will be working by the year 2005 representing 63% of women 16 and older. 
As the decade draws to an end and a new millennium approaches, we celebrate women entrepreneurs as the fastest growing segment in our economy. And may I remind you again, dear colleagues, California is No. 1. 
Despite all the good news, women entrepreneurs still are under-served in access to capital. I am proud of several of the California banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo. They need to do more, as do all of our California banks (and all banks across the United States) to help finance the growth of women-owned business, the growth of minority-owned business, and the financing of U.S. Exports. 
How can one represent the great State of California and not talk about technology. It is fantastic to note that women now represent 52% of all Internet users. The analyst said just a few years ago we were technologically illiterate. We proved them wrong. 
I want to recognize the Business Women's Network (BWN) for its outstanding capacity and record to unite business women. BWN is a giant network now of 1200 women's associations whose membership total more than 9 million. In addition, BWN has located 750 women's web sites nationwide and will publish profiles of the 1200 organizations and 750 web sites in its 1998 Directory due out in October 1998. 
Women are the economy, as University of California/Berkeley professor and former Chairman for the Council of Economic Advisors, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, reminds us of this fact. Women represent more than $3.5 trillion in spending economy. And, women owned businesses generate over $3 trillion in revenue. 
Again, thanks to the Business Women's Network for helping us recognize that it is essential to salute business women. As my Congressional sisters today have selected Women in Business as the issue of the day, how appropriate that I, too, with the support of my Senate colleagues recognize the important progress women in business are achieving. 
I also want to salute Aida Alvarez, Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA). She single-handedly has moved women entrepreneurs and minority entrepreneurs up as priorities for this Nation. With the role of the Office of Women Business Ownership and its Women Centers, and with SCORE's commitment to counsel more women and add to its rolls more women counselors, we all say, felicitates Administrator Alvarez. 
I praise the National Women's Business Council for emphasizing critical issues such as access to capital for women entrepreneurs. 
In summary, as Women's History Month makes us stop and reflect where we come from, I personally want to salute all women in business and look forward to much greater gains for the next millennium, now not many months away. Congratulations to the Business Women's Network (BWN), and the 1200 business organizations representing entrepreneurs and professionals, diversity, and high and low income business women.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' attention the nomination of James C. Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. As was the case with Dr. Satcher's nomination to be Surgeon General, his nomination has been on the shelf, held by a `hold' at the request of only a few Senators. I will deal shortly with the reasons Jim Hormel's nomination has been stalled. But let me take just a few moments to review the history of the nomination and some of the facts about the nominee and his background. 
Last fall, following a hearing on his nomination, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to approve Jim Hormel's nomination by a vote of 16 to 2 at a business meeting on November 4, 1997. In point of fact, for those who were not present at the business meeting, the nomination was deemed a routine matter, and was approved by a voice vote, along with the rest of the committee's agenda of nominations and legislation for that day. No Senator spoke in opposition to the nomination. It was only after the meeting that two Senators asked to be recorded against the nomination, as was their right, which resulted in the final tally. Still, 16 to 2 is a strong endorsement by the Committee on Foreign Relations. 
The nomination was placed on the Executive Calendar, and, despite the fact that the Senate confirmed every other Foreign Relations Committee nominee before the close of the first session--some 50 nominees in total--Jim Hormel's nomination was left languishing because of `holds' placed on it by a few Senators. 
That such a distinguished and qualified nominee would face opposition is, on its face, hard to understand. Let me tell you a little about the Jim Hormel I have known for some 20 years now. He is, first and foremost, a loving and devoted father of 5, and a grandfather of 13. His entire family has been unfailingly supportive of his nomination. Anyone who has met him or knows him knows that he is decent, patient, and a very gentle person. 
His professional credentials are equally impressive. He is an accomplished businessman. He serves as chairman of the California investment firm, Equidex, and he serves as a member of the board of directors of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. 
He has also spent time as a successful lawyer and educator. He received his J.D. from the University of Chicago, one of our Nation's finest law schools, and he later returned there to serve as dean and assistant dean of students from 1961 to 1967. In addition, he currently serves as a member of the board of managers of his alma mater, Swarthmore College, another of our Nation's finest institutions of higher learning. 
Jim Hormel has also been a remarkably generous philanthropist and dedicated community activist. He has supported a wide variety of causes and organizations, but there has always been a common theme: bringing people together, resolving conflict, helping those who are in need, and making the surrounding community a more pleasant place in which to live. 
Even a sampling of the organizations he has supported is impressive in its breadth as well as its diversity. In addition to his support for Swarthmore and the University of Chicago, he has provided resources and assistance to the Virginia Institute of Autism, Breast Cancer Action, the American Foundation for AIDS Research, the American Indian College Fund, the United Negro College Fund, the NAACP, the Institute for International Education, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the Catholic Youth Organization, Jewish Family and Children's Services, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Public Library, the San Francisco ballet, and the San Francisco symphony. Many of these organizations have honored him with awards. 
Not surprisingly from such a community-minded individual, Jim Hormel has throughout his life also harbored a firm commitment to public service. The first example of this was his service in the U.S. Coast Guard, Active Reserve, from 1951 to 1957. Later, he established the James C. Hormel Public Service Program at the University of Chicago Law School to encourage law students to go into public service. As a consequence of his leadership in this area, he was recognized by his peers when he received the Public Service Citation from the University of Chicago Alumni Association. 
His commitment to public service and his dedication to the cause of human rights ultimately came together when he was named as a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva in 1995. There, he helped the United States team press its case for improved human rights in nations as diverse as Cuba, China, and Iraq. 
Finally, he was nominated in 1997 to serve as an alternate representative of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly. Now, this part of his biography is particularly ironic, in light of the situation we find ourselves in today, because this position is subject to Senate confirmation, and, indeed, on May 23, 1997, this same U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed Jim Hormel to represent this country at the United Nations. 
So we have a well-qualified nominee for Ambassador. He has had a remarkable and distinguished career in several fields. He has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to public service. In recent years he has gained firsthand experience in diplomacy as a representative of the United States. He was overwhelmingly approved by the Foreign Relations Committee, and most notably, he was confirmed by this very same U.S. Senate only 10 months ago. 
I suspect most listeners--and most of my colleagues--would expect such a nomination to be quickly brought to a vote and confirmed. Yet, the majority leader has refused to call this nomination for an up-or-down vote, and a number of Senators on the other side of the aisle have placed `holds' on the nomination. 
It seems clear to many of us why these Senators do not want to allow a vote on Jim Hormel's nomination: because Jim Hormel is gay. In a clear, unquestionable case of discrimination, these Senators refuse to let the full Senate vote for a qualified nominee because of his sexual orientation. This Senator does not believe that the Senate wants to be party to this kind of discrimination. 
Jim Hormel is exactly the kind of person who should be encouraged to engage in public service. He is intelligent, civic minded, generous, and he is a person of proven accomplishment who wants to serve our country. So we need people like this in public service, and we cannot afford to drive them away because of their sexual orientation. 
I think that is the point that was made well in a letter from the former Secretary of State, George Shultz, and Mrs. Shultz, when they wrote to the majority leader urging Jim Hormel's speedy approval, stating that they know him very well, and concluding with this:  
We recommend him to you because we believe he would be a wonderful representative for our country. We hope that his nomination can be brought to the floor of the Senate for a vote as soon as possible. 
I submit to you, Mr. President, that George Shultz, former Secretary of State, should know who would be a wonderful representative and who would not be a wonderful representative of our country. 
So, as a matter of simple fairness, a qualified nominee with broad support, approved by the committee of jurisdiction, should at least be allowed a vote. If people have concerns, express them. Let's address them. But let's give the nominee a vote. 
In this regard, I want to compliment the distinguished chairman, my chairman, of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his thoughtful remarks on this subject when he appeared on NBC's Meet the Press on November 30, 1997. He said: 
I get tired of that stuff. We ought to vote on him. And I personally believe he would pass, and he'd become the next ambassador to Luxembourg. I just don't believe in prejudice against any individual, regardless. And frankly, we have far too much of that. 
I believe Senator Hatch is right on every point. 
So I call on the majority leader, Mr. President, to schedule a vote on Jim Hormel's nomination. I call upon those who have holds to allow the nomination to reach the floor. If they wish, let's debate the qualifications. Let's debate any allegation about him, or against him. But it is wrong to simply prevent the Senate from speaking on this nomination. 
I have seen news reports where some of the Senators who have `holds' on this nomination claim it is not because he is gay. They claim it is because of his views on certain issues involving gay rights, or something to that effect. The truth is I am not sure exactly what their objections are because they have been very reluctant to describe them publicly. I would certainly welcome the opportunity to meet privately with those Senators who are holding up the nomination to talk through their concerns. 
Perhaps my colleagues who have holds are embarrassed in some way, or perhaps they feel their arguments are not strong enough to stand the light of day. I am hard pressed to come to any other conclusion because, apart from fleeting quotes in news articles and vague statements by spokespersons, the Senators opposed to Jim Hormel have done little to lay out their case against him. They are content to just quietly allow the Senate rules to prevent a vote. 
That is not right, Mr. President. Around here, if a Senator takes a strong position on an issue, or a nomination, they have an obligation to their constituents, their colleagues, and the Senate itself, to explain themselves publicly. This is what the tradition of deliberative debate is all about. 
So I challenge my colleagues who have `holds' on this nomination to come to this very floor, explain why they believe Jim Hormel is unfit to become an American Ambassador because he happens to be gay. Let other Senators and the American people judge on the merits of the argument. 
From what I have read in news reports, I can anticipate that some of these Senators, if they choose to speak at all, will try to argue that this is not about Jim Hormel being gay--rather it is about his views on gay rights. 
We may hear a lot of stories about books that appear in the San Francisco Public Library to which Jim Hormel generously donated half a million dollars. 
Are we to understand that donating funds to a library means you are responsible for every book in this library? Many of these same books are in the Library of Congress. Is the Senate responsible, because we fund that library, for the content of every book in that library? Of course not, Mr. President. You know that. I know that. This is a specious argument. This is designed to kill a nomination. 
We may also hear stories about Jim Hormel's charitable giving, some of which has gone to organizations which support equal rights for gays and lesbians. Is equal rights a cause we in the Senate do not support? And even if this issue is subject to some controversy in the Senate, do the Senators blocking this nomination know or care that Jim Hormel has, in writing, committed to limiting his charitable contributions to noncontroversial areas such as the performing arts, museums, educational institutions, humanitarian assistance and health care? He will not use his office to advocate or promote any personal view on any issue and will not engage or associate himself with any outside activities that conflict with his official duties and responsibilities. We have that in writing. This is the only time I know of any ambassadorial nominee who has actually put that in writing. I find it, in a way, very difficult to recognize that he has to do it. Nonetheless he has done it. 
So the issue is a very simple one. We have a qualified nominee who was resoundingly approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. He is entitled to a vote, and I, as a U.S. Senator, am entitled to cast my vote for him. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday, Sunday, March 8th, was commemorated by women around the globe as International Women's Day. I rise today to recognize the importance of this day, and to discuss five issues--the use of rape as an instrument of war; the human rights of women in Afghanistan; international trafficking in women and girls; international family planning; and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women--where I believe the United States can and must play a key role in leading the international community's efforts to improve the status of women around the world. 
Every day, women around the globe are subject to abuse, violence and discrimination simply because they are women. Whether it is the rape of women in Bosnia and Rwanda as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing, the human rights abuses faced by the women of Afghanistan, or the more subtle forms of discrimination faced daily by women everywhere, the majority of the world's women and girls remain excluded from the prevailing vision of human rights and continue to lack basic legal and fundamental rights. 
As we look around the globe, it seems safe to say that U.S. foreign policy does not lack for challenges. Yet, even as we face these other challenges--be it the threat of Saddam Hussein or the threat of an Asian financial crisis--we must also recognize that advancing the status of women is not only the right thing to do, it must be a central part of the foreign policy of the United States. 
As I mentioned earlier, as we work to advance this broader agenda there are five areas in particular which I would like to address today: The use of rape as an instrument of war, the situation in Afghanistan, international trafficking in women and girls, international family planning, and the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I join my colleague Senator Boxer in introducing the Sonny Bono Memorial Salton Sea Restoration Act. This legislation is similar to that now pending in the House of Representatives, but it seeks to respond to concerns expressed by local, state and federal officials about problems with the House bill. Despite the fact that there are differences between the two versions, the time to address the problems of the Salton Sea has come, legislation will move forward promptly, and be signed into law. 
I have spoken on this floor about the problems facing the Salton Sea. Now it is time to turn to how to solve those problems. The legislation introduced today reflects the work of scores of people in California concerned with the Salton Sea. It is consistent with the approach they believe is most appropriate, and it involves them in the process. 
This legislation proceeds in two stages. 
First, it provides funding and sets a deadline of 18 months for the conduct of additional scientific research on the problems facing the Salton Sea, for the evaluation of various projects to address these problems, for the selection of a specific project, and for the completion of the necessary environmental reviews required by the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act. 
Second, it authorizes funding, subject to modification by Congress, for the implementation of the project that is chosen. 
The research funded in this legislation is absolutely crucial, for the problems facing the Salton Sea are complex. Previously, most concerns expressed about the Sea related to its increasing salinity and its rising water level. More recently, however, massive die offs of fish and migratory birds have occurred, that appear to be caused by problems other than salinity. 
So, in addition to determining the optimum elevation for the Sea, and the desirable level of salinity, it is important to understand the interrelationships between these two components and the pollutants that continue to flow into the Sea. 
Finally, this legislation proposes a tight timetable for reaching a decision on the best project to solve the problems facing the Sea. However, it is my understanding that the Department of the Interior already has the authority and a limited amount of funding to begin additional testing and environmental review and is willing to do so. This means that an 18 month timetable is realistic. There has been deep concern that a 12 month timetable is insufficient if a sound plan is to evolve which also involves the rivers, now heavily polluted, which empty into and add contamination to the Salton Sea. Therefore, I urge all parties to begin working while this legislation moves through Congress. 
Mr. President, in closing, I want to say that I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to craft a bill that is acceptable to both bodies, a bill that will preserve and enhance the Salton Sea, a bill that is a fitting tribute to the memory of the late Congressman Sonny Bono, who cared so deeply about the Salton Sea. Thank you.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by Senator Lautenberg and Senator Dewine to implement a nationwide .08 blood alcohol level requirement for DUI offenses. 
Let me begin by saying that I agree with those who say alcohol consumption--and how much is enough--should be a matter of personal responsibility. Adults should have the common sense to know when enough is enough and when not to get behind the wheel. 
Tragically, however, the statistics show common sense is not that common. 
In California, we already have the .08 standard and still the accident rates are staggering. According the California Highway Patrol, there were 91,654 DUI arrests and 37,622 DUI accidents in 1996. Also in that year, there were 1,254 fatalities and 35,654 injuries due to DUI-related accidents. Let me remind you this is with the standard we are pushing for in this bill. 
To put these statistics in perspective, in California there were 3,555 total traffic fatalities in 1996. Nearly 40 percent of the traffic fatalities in California in 1996 were alcohol related. I understand this is consistent with the national average which show that 41 percent of all traffic fatalities are alcohol related. 
According to a MADD survey, 68.8 Americans support lowering the legal blood alcohol limit to .08. That same survey showed that 53 percent of Americans consider drunk drivers to be the nation's number one highway safety problem. 
However, when you cut through the numbers, this is really an issue about saving lives and about personal safety. Every American--no matter where they live--has a right to feel safe on our highways. I believe tough DUI laws, including strict blood alcohol limits, do reduce drunk driving and do make our roads safer. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution on behalf of myself, Senator Boxer, Senator Hutchison, Senator Durbin, and Senator Santorum, to commemorate the acts of kindness of the residents of Remy, France afforded World War II Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Houston Braly. While these deeds occurred more than fifty years ago, the story of this young pilot is carried on in the hearts and minds of the people of Remy. Now the friends and comrades of Lt. Braly have joined together to show their appreciation in a most sincere gesture of goodwill. 
On August 2, 1944, Lt. Braly's squadron of P-51 fighters on patrol in northern France encountered a German munitions train. The squadron made three unsuccessful attack runs at the train, which was almost impossible to see because of camouflage. On the fourth run, however, Lt. Braly's fire hit a car carrying explosives, causing a tremendous explosion. 
Airplanes circling 13,000 feet over the battle were hit by shrapnel from the train. Haystacks in fields some distance away were seen burning, and nearly all buildings in the small French town were demolished. The 13th century church in the town of Remy barely escaped destruction, but the historic stained-glass windows were destroyed. 
The explosion also claimed the life of Lt. Braly, who was only twenty-two years old on that tragic day. 
Despite the near total destruction of the small town, the residents of Remy regarded that young American as a hero. A young woman pulled Braly's body from the burning wreck of the plane, wrapped him in the nylon of his parachute, and placed him in the town's courtyard. Hundreds of villagers showered the site with flowers, stunning the German authorities. Threats of reprisals were made if the tributes continued, but eventually the authorities agreed that a small, private burial could be performed in the church's cemetery. 
The next morning it was discovered that despite the potentially severe consequences, villagers had once again paid tribute to the young pilot. The covert placement of flowers on Lt. Braly's grave continued until American forces liberated Remy to the cheers of the townspeople. American soldiers were led to Lt. Braly's grave, which was marked by the bent propeller of his P-51 fighter. 
Nearly 50 years later, Steven Lea Vell of Danville, California, came across this story during the course of research he was doing at the Air Force Archives in Alabama. Mr. Lea Vell was so moved by the story that he visited Remy, France, only to find that the stained glass windows of the magnificent 13th century church which were destroyed in the explosion had not been replaced. Mr. Lea Vell contacted various members of the 364th Fighter Group, under which Lt. Braly had served. These veterans had heard the stories of how the residents of Remy had honored their fallen friend. They joined together to form Windows for Remy, a non-profit organization working to raise $200,000 to replace the stained glass windows to repay the town for their distinguished actions toward Lt. Braly. 
Mr. President, the residents of Remy have not forgotten the story of that young American pilot. On Armistice Day, November 11, 1995, fifty years after the war ended, the town of Remy paid tribute once more to Lt. Braly. On that day they renamed the crossroads where he perished to `Rue de Houston L. Braly, Jr.' 
I am confident that my fellow senators will join me in commending the people of Remy, France for their kindness and recognize the friends and former comrades of Lt. Braly for their efforts to pay back this debt of honor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia, and I rise to join him in submitting these resolutions for disapproval of the President's decision to certify Mexico as fully cooperating with the United States in the fight against drug trafficking. 
Mr. President, as we all know, when the President made the same decision last year, it sparked an intense debate between the administration and what was in all probability a majority of Congress who did not believe that Mexico had earned certification. I have looked long and hard at the evidence that is available. I have received extensive briefings from law enforcement and intelligence officials. Anyone, I believe, who has received these same briefings would come to the conclusion I have reached, that once again the decision to certify Mexico is incorrect and not grounded in the facts. 
While Mexico has made some limited progress, there remain gaping holes in its counternarcotics effort. Whether due to inability or lack of political will, these failures badly undermine the urgent effort to keep the scourge of drugs off our streets. Regardless of America's demand problem, when the supply of drugs reaches the point where it comes in at literally tons each day, any demand program is extraordinarily difficult to sustain. 
Has Mexico cooperated in some areas? Of course. There are one or two new police units which seem to have trusting relationships with the DEA. New vetting procedures are beginning to be implemented in the hiring of new police officers. Mexico and the United States have agreed on a bilateral drug strategy, although it is a vaguely worded document that will take years to evaluate whether it has been successful and whether actions on the streets will follow this roundtable document. 
It can also be argued that pressure brought to bear on drug lord Amado Carrillo-Fuentes was responsible for driving him to seek refuge in another country--Chile--and very likely for his attempt to conceal his identity through plastic surgery. The surgery, of course, resulted in his death and the torture-murder of the entire surgical team. His organization, however, continues to operate, and a reign of violence has been unleashed as his would-be successors battle for control of his organization. 
But last year, Senator Coverdell and I laid out a number of key areas that we would use to judge whether or not Mexico has reached the standard of full cooperation. Sadly, our top law enforcement agencies indicate that none of these changes has produced significant results. There has been no demonstrable action on any--and I repeat `any'--of the benchmarks outlined by Congress last year as key measurements of cooperation by Mexico: dismantlement of drug cartels, the arrest and prosecution of cartel leaders, the extradition of Mexican nationals on drug charges to the United States for prosecution, effective prosecution of corrupt officials, law enforcement cooperation, effective money laundering laws implemented, security of U.S. drug agents working in bilateral efforts in Mexico. 
Let me touch on each of these. The cartels in Mexico today are either as strong or stronger than they were a year ago. And despite much talk of cooperation, there has been no substantial progress by the Government of Mexico in developing prosecutable cases against the leaders of the major drug trafficking groups, even when these individuals have been identified by U.S. investigations and are made the subject of U.S. indictments. 
The scope of Mexican drug trafficking has increased significantly, along with the attendant violence, even against United States and Mexican law enforcement officials and informants. During 1997, DEA recorded in excess of 50 incidents of threats along the Southwest border. According to the information I have received, the Mexican Government has arrested and prosecuted few individuals in connection with these acts. None of the major cartels has been dismantled nor have their leaders been arrested. 
Take the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization. After the death of Amado Carrillo-Fuentes, there were numerous enforcement actions taken against his organization, but the intelligence was unproductive, leading to insignificant asset seizures and new arrests. 
On July 30, 1997, Mexican authorities detained a close associate of Carrillo-Fuentes, Manuel Bitar-Tafich, leading to seizure of $50 million in the United States. However, because the Mexicans have not provided the needed documents to support the seizure in the United States, much of the money had to be returned. Bitar himself remains in custody, but there has been no movement on his case. While the Mexicans have reported seizing $52 million in Mexico, no documentation supporting this seizure has been provided to the U.S. Government. 
The Mexican Government arrested Noe Brito, a member of Carrillo-Fuentes' security apparatus. He was released, however, before the DEA was even allowed to interview him. 
The Arellano-Felix operation--the notorious cartel located just south of California in the Tijuana area--continues to operate with impunity. There have been several enforcement actions in 1997, but few resulted in significant results against the cartel's trafficking operations. 
On November 8, 1997, the Mexican Attorney General's Office arrested Arturo Everardo Paez-Martinez, a known cartel assassin. 
Paez is incarcerated in Mexico on the basis of a provisional U.S. arrest warrant but has not been extradited. 
On September 20, Mexico's counternarcotics unit reporting to the Attorney General arrested two men on weapons charges, who are known members of the `Juniors,' a group of young assassins recruited by the Arellano-Felix cartel. The Government of Mexico offered to extradite one of the men, but the United States had to turn down the offer due to lack of outstanding charges and evidence against him. This is an example of what results from a lack of cooperative law enforcement efforts. 
The Sonora Cartel. Miguel Angel Caro-Quintero heads his family's organization operating out of Sonora, Mexico. There are four outstanding warrants for him on smuggling, RICO statute, and conspiracy charges. He has been operating freely in Mexico since 1992. There are also provisional arrest warrants issued for both Miguel and Rafael Caro-Quintero. 
The Amezcua-Contreras brothers. The Amezcua-Contreras brothers' organization is believed to be the world's largest clandestine producer of methamphetamine. The organization procures huge quantities of the ephedrine in Thailand and India, which is supplied to laboratories in Mexico and California. The Amezcuas' methamphetamine is distributed in large cities across the United States. A U.S. law enforcement investigation, Operation META, concluded in December of 1997 with the arrest of 101 defendants, seizure of 133 pounds of methamphetamine, and the precursors to manufacture up to 540 pounds more, along with 1,100 kilos of cocaine and over $2.25 million in assets. 
Mexican efforts against this organization have not met with great success: 
On November 10, 1997, the Mexican military's special vetted unit arrested Adan Amezcua at his ranch in Colima on gun charges, not on drug charges. He is the only Amezcua not under indictment in either the United States or Mexico. He remains in custody pending further investigations. The Government of Mexico has failed to indict or arrest any of the principal members of the Amezcua organization in Mexico. 
The DEA International Chemical Control Unit has supported elements of the Government of Mexico financially and logistically for numerous investigations of the Amezcuas, with little or no results. None of the investigations resulted in arrests or produced information that could be used in U.S. courts. 
Though Jesus and Luis Amezcua are currently under Federal indictment in the United States on a variety of charges, there are no provisional arrest warrants for them and they remain at large in Mexico. 
Extradition was a key benchmark and a test of cooperation. There have been no extraditions from Mexico to the United States of any Mexican nationals on drug charges--none. 
The identities of the leaders of the major criminal groups based in Mexico who control the flow of heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine to the United States have been known for several years. In fact, U.S. law enforcement agencies have built cases on and indicted in the United States virtually all of these cartel leaders. The Department of Justice has filed provisional arrest warrants for the most significant drug traffickers in Mexico. While several have been arrested, many others remain at large and none has been extradited to the United States. 
In the war against drugs, extradition of cartel leaders for trial and imprisonment in the United States is a key and indisputable beachhead in the war against drug trafficking. It is also a major benchmark of cooperation. 
In my view--and I know the view held by law enforcement in the United States--the drug lords operating in Mexico only fear extradition to the United States, where they know they will stand trial and face punishment commensurate with their crimes. The Mexican law enforcement institutions and legal system present no deterrent to their operations. 
That is why this Senate, many of my colleagues, and law 
enforcement officials have repeatedly said that the most meaningful measurement of real progress in drug cooperation with Mexico is if the major traffickers are apprehended and extradited to the United States. 
Provisional arrest warrants have been filed by the Department of Justice for the following major traffickers: 
Agustin Vasquez-Mendoza, Ramon Arellano-Felix, Rafael Caro-Quintero, Miguel Caro-Quintero, Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes, Eduardo Gonzalez-Quirarte, Oscar Malherbe, Arturo Paez-Martinez, Jaime Ladino-Avila, Jose Gerardo-Castro/Gonzalez-Gutierez, William Brian Martin, Miguel Angel Martinez-Martinez, Antonio Hernandez-Acosta, and Miguel Felix Gallardo. 
These are all key lieutenants in either the Amezcua, Carrillo-Fuentes, Caro-Quintero, or Arellano-Felix organizations. The Justice Department requested extradition of four of the above within the past year. The first two requests have been stalled or completely thwarted by Mexican courts. 
Last November, the United States and Mexico Attorneys General signed a protocol to the United States-Mexican Extradition Treaty that authorized temporary surrender of a convicted party to the other country to face drug charges. This is certainly a positive signal, but it has yet to be tested in practice. 
The bottom line is that, to date, there has not been a single extradition of a Mexican national to the United States on drug charges--not one. 
Corruption. Drug-related corruption is probably the single greatest obstacle that the United States faces in its global battle against international drug trafficking. Unfortunately, drug corruption in Mexico is so deeply rooted that it persists despite attempts to eradicate it. 
The level of drug corruption in Mexico continues unabated. According to the briefings I have received, virtually every investigation our law enforcement agencies conduct against major traffickers in Mexico uncovers significant corruption of law enforcement officials. 
Our own law enforcement agencies indicate that endemic corruption among Mexican law enforcement officials continually frustrates our effort to build cases against and to apprehend the most significant drug traffickers in Mexico, and it is the primary reason there has been no meaningful progress in drug law enforcement in Mexico. 
In the wake of the devastating disclosure that Mexico's own `drug czar' was on the payroll of Amado Carrillo-Fuentes, the Mexican Government dismantled the INCD, the Mexican counterpart to the DEA, and fired the majority of its employees. 
Unfortunately, many of those fired were ordered reinstated by Mexican courts. 
Additionally, of the 40 military officers arrested as part of the Gutierrez-Rebollo investigation, none has been brought to trial or convicted to date. 
The following cases indicate how deeply drug corruption has penetrated into Mexican institutions: 
Colonel Jose Luis Rubalcava, who had been Director of the Federal Judicial Anti-Drug Police under the INCD, was arrested on or about April 14, 1997 on charges in connection with 2.5 tons of cocaine seized in Sombrete, Mexico in 1995. This is the director for the Judicial Anti-Drug Police--2 1/2 tons of cocaine. 
U.S. law enforcement officials speculate that bribery and corruption may have been behind the withdrawal of Baja state police protection from a Tijuana news editor prior to his November 27, 1997 attempted assassination. The editor had been putting public pressure on the issue of drug corruption. 
According to a December 1997 statement by Mexican Attorney General Madrazo, out of some 870 Federal agents dismissed on corruption charges in 1996, 700 have been rehired in either the PGR--the Mexican Attorney General's office--or at the state and local level. The rehiring was done at the direction of the courts. 
If you cannot fire corrupt law enforcement officials, how can you fight drugs? 
The issue of prosecuting corrupt officials is important, because without fear of prosecution, there is little deterrence. Too often in Mexico, officials are fired, but never prosecuted. 
In 1997, there were only 3 corruption cases being prosecuted, including General Gutierrez. Another case involves the theft of 476 kilograms of cocaine by 17 PGR officials, including an Army General in Sonora. The third involved a Judicial Police Comandante. The Mexican government has reportedly begun additional prosecutions, but many more cases need to be brought to trial in order to have any deterrent effect.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank both the Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for their yeoman's work, their perseverance and their energy on behalf of this cause. 
I am one who, in a very short period of time, has had to raise very large amounts of money for political campaigns. And I am one who has watched and seen the evolution of soft money and what that soft money has wrought upon the American political system. 
So I rise today to join with my colleagues in very staunchly supporting the McCain-Feingold legislation. 
Since the 1996 election, Members of Congress and the public have repeatedly called for reform of what is, without question, a broken system. 
Congress had ample opportunity to pass this bill last October, but, shamefully, after so much talk, there was still no action to back it up. It should be no source of pride for this body to know that the public believes that Congress is all talk and no action on an issue that has dominated the Washington agenda for the last year and a half. 
Now we have an opportunity to put our votes where our mouths are when it comes to campaign spending reform and, if nothing else, vote to ban soft money. 
It is interesting to read the newspapers where Member of Congress after Member of Congress admits to the vicissitudes and the problems of soft money. For the first 6 months of 1997, the Republican Party raised $21.7 million and the Democrats $13.7 million. Both of these figures are increases over the 1995-1996 cycle, and both are sure to rise in the coming months. 
While many in this body would like to see stronger legislation, and some would like to see no legislation at all, it is important to note that McCain-Feingold is essentially a stripped-down bill, pared to address a number of the most pressing issues. The most important aspect is soft money. 
Last fall, we had a healthy debate about the amounts of soft 
money flowing in and out of party coffers, so I am not going to speak at length about that. But without reform, we can expect soft money expenditures to rocket up with no brakes. 
The Court's decision in the Colorado case opens the door to unlimited independent party spending on behalf of candidates running for office as long as those expenditures are not coordinated with the candidates. 
Prior to the Colorado decision, parties long supported their candidates with hard money. Those were the regulated dollars. In our case, limited to $1,000 contribution per election. 
Increasingly, though, candidate advocacy has fallen to soft money, and that is money contributed in unlimited, unregulated amounts from seldom-disclosed sources. 
Increasingly, the form that soft money takes is in scurrilous, vituperate ads that are often far different than reality. I believe that goes for both sides of the aisle. I think it is a scourge on our American political system. 
We have an opportunity today to say we ban soft money and to limit express advocacy to a certain length of time prior to the election so that the opportunity for untrue, false and often defamatory ads is greatly reduced. If this bill were to do nothing else, I think that would be an enormous contribution to the political culture of a campaign. 
One of the reasons, Mr. President, I did not cast my hat in the California gubernatorial campaign is because of the specific nature of campaigns today. There is very little that is uplifting about them. 
The McCain-Feingold bill bans soft money and prohibits parties from funneling money to outside groups and would prohibit party officials from raising money for such groups. 
Instead, these groups--and there are similar advocacy groups on both sides--would have to raise money from individual contributors or from PACs to raise money. 
There is nothing in the bill barring these groups from continuing to participate in campaigns, but the bill does prohibit these outside groups from serving as de facto party adjuncts funded by the parties. 
Also, this bill does nothing to prevent individuals from making unlimited contributions to advocacy groups, it merely requires them to report their contributions.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, it is my intention to open the debate, then yield to Senator Mack, then Senator Thurmond, and then Senator Kennedy for the remainder of my time. 
Mr. President, I urge the Members of this distinguished body to vote no on cloture. I do so because I believe that by voting for cloture today we could do enormous harm. 
The technique involved here, somatic cell nuclear transfer, creates what are called stem cells, which can be used for creation of tissue which has the same DNA as the person whose tissue it is. Therefore they are used as important adjuncts in cancer research; they offer important opportunities to overcome rejection of tissue in third-degree burns; to solve major problems inherent in juvenile diabetes; for osteoporosis; for Alzheimers; for Parkinsons disease; and for a host of other diseases. 
Mr. President, there is no need to rush to judgment. No one, I believe, in this body, supports human cloning. There is a scientific moratorium on human cloning. The FDA has exercised jurisdiction to prevent it. 
There is no need to rush to judgment. This bill is less than a week old. There has been no hearing on it. There are no definitions of critical terms in this bill. 
Let me quote what the American Cancer Society has said in a letter dated February 9:  
The American Cancer Society urges you to oppose S. 1601, legislation that would prohibit the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer. The American Cancer Society agrees with the public that human cloning should not proceed at this time. However, the legislation as drafted would have the perhaps unintended effect of restricting critical scientific research. The language could hamper or punish scientists who contribute to our growing knowledge about cancer.

I know in their last days how important research is to patients and how willing they are to try new things. Life is critically important.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Mr. President, I very much regret the fact that the Senator from Missouri has chosen to mischaracterize both my position and my bill. I hope we will have a chance in committee to iron that out. But at this time, I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation of Margaret Morrow to the Federal District for the Central District of California. 
Her consideration by the United States is long overdue: 
Ms. Morrow's nomination has twice been reported out by the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I have the honor to serve; 
Both times she has enjoyed the public support of the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch; 
Both times the American Bar Association voted unanimously to give her its highest rating, `well qualified.' 
Yet for nearly two years, Ms. Morrow's nomination has languished in the Senate. 
By way of background, Ms. Morrow graduated from Harvard Law School, cum laude, in 1974. Prior to that, she graduated from Bryn Mawr College, magna cum laude, in 1971. 
Since 1996, she has been a partner in the Los Angeles office of Arnold & Porter, one of the nation's preeminent corporate law firms. 
Prior to 1996, she helped form the Los Angeles law firm of Quinn, Kully & Morrow in 1987, where she chaired the firm's Appellate Department. 
Prior to 1987, she practiced for 13 years at the Los Angeles firm of Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn, & Rossi, where she attained the rank of partner and handled a wide range of commercial litigation in the federal and state courts. 
The legal profession has recognized Ms. Morrow's quality of work, commitment to the profession, and dedication to the broader community with a host of awards. 
Among the many legal awards Ms. Morrow has received are the following: 
In 1997, she received the Shattuck-Price Memorial Award, the Los Angeles County Bar Association's highest award, awarded to a lawyer dedicated to improving the legal profession and the administration of justice. 
In 1995, she received the Bernard E. Witkins Amicus Curiae Award, presented by the California Judicial Council to non-jurists who have nonetheless made significant contributions to the California court system. 
In 1994, the Women Lawyers Association in Los Angeles recognized Ms. Morrow as most distinguished woman lawyer with the Ernestine Stalhut Award. 
She received the 1994 President's Award from the California Association of Court-Appointed Special Advocates for her service on behalf of abused, neglected, and dependent children. 
In 1990, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles presented her with the Maynard Toll Award for her significant contribution to legal services for the poor. She is the only woman to date who has received this award. 
Margaret Morrow's excellent legal skills have been consistently recognized: 
She was listed in the 1997-1998 edition of The Best Lawyers in America. 
In 1995 and 1996, the Los Angeles Business Journal's `Law Who's Who,' listed her among the one hundred outstanding Los Angeles business attorneys. 
In 1994, she was listed as one of the top 20 lawyers in Los Angeles by California Law Business, a publication of the Los Angeles Daily Journal. 
Margaret Morrow has held leadership positions in Federal, State and county bar associations and other legal organizations. 
She served as the first woman President of the State Bar of California, a position she held from 1993 to 1994. Prior to that, she served as the State Bar's Vice-President. 
From 1988-89, she served as President of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, creating the Pro Bono Council and the Committee on the Status of Minorities in the Profession during her term. 
As President of the Barristers' Section of the Los Angeles County Bar, she established a nationally recognized Domestic Violence Counseling Project as well as an AIDS hospice program. 
She directed the American Bar Association's Young Lawyers' Division and served on its Standing Committee for Legal Aid for Indigent Defendants. 
She has served on the boards of a number of legal services programs, and has been a member of several Advisory Committees of the California Judicial Council. 
The true test of Margaret Morrow's qualifications to serve on the federal bench is the long list of attorneys, judges, law enforcement personnel, and community leaders who actively support her nomination. 
Indeed, the list of Margaret Morrow's supporters reads like a `Who's Who' of California Republicans and Bush, Reagan, Deukmejian, and Wilson appointees. 
Just to highlight a few of Margaret Morrow's many supporters: 
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Republican; 
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, Republican; 
Orange County District Attorney Michael Capizzi, Republican; 
Former DEA Head, U.S. District Judge, and U.S. Attorney, Robert Bonner, who was appointed to those positions by Presidents Bush and Reagan; Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Stephen Trott, Reagan appointees to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals; and the list goes on and on. 
Perhaps most telling is the recommendation of H. Walter Croskey. Judge Croskey is a Governor Deukmejian appointee to the appellate court of the State of California, and a self-described life-long conservative Republican. 
Judge Croskey is well-acquainted with Margaret Morrow's reputation in the legal community, having observed her over a period of 15 years, when she appeared before him in both trial and appellate courts, and worked professionally on numerous State and local bar activities. 
Based on his observations, this conservative Republican appellate jurist concluded: 
She is the most outstanding candidate for appointment to the Federal trial court who has been put forward in my memory. 
Margaret Morrow is, by any measure, an unusually accomplished member in her profession, and I believe that her qualifications will serve her well as a member of the Federal judiciary. 
I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm her nomination.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Dr. Robert Reid, who on February 16, 1998, will become the 133rd President of the California Medical Association, the largest medical association in the nation. With a membership of 35,000 physicians, California Medical Association represents California physician from all regions, medical specialities and modes of practice--from solo practitioners, to academic physicians, to physicians working in large group practices. Reflecting the diversity that is California, the association's members advocate for quality of care and access to health care for all of the state's residents. 
Dr. Reid is a practicing Obstetrician-Gynecologist and Director of Medical Affairs for the Cottage Health System in Santa Barbara, California. Prior to becoming the hospital's Medical Director, Dr. Reid served as the hospital's Chief of Staff and has been a member of its Board of Directors since 1991. 
Dr. Reid is also a fellow of the American College of Obstetrics-Gynecology and Past President of the Tri-Counties Obstetrics-Gynecology Society. 
He became active in organized medicine in 1972 when he joined the California Medical Association. Ten years later he was elected President of the Santa Barbara County Medical Society and has since gone on to serve the House of Medicine as alternate delegate to the AMA, Vice-Speaker of the CMA Committee on Scientific Assemblies, and chair of the CMA Finance, Membership Development and Communications committees. 
Born in Milan, Italy, Dr. Reid is a graduate of the University of Colorado Medical Center. He lives in Santa Barbara, CA, with his wife Patricia, and is the father of four grown children. I am sure Dr. Robert Alfred Reid will continue to make many important contributions to medicine and to the nation's health policy debate.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will follow on the comments of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, since the Senate is scheduled tomorrow to vote on a cloture motion, whether to move Senate bill 1601, a bill that prohibits the cloning of human beings. I will clarify where we are and what the issues really are. 
Let me be clear at the outset: I support a ban on the cloning of human beings. There is widespread agreement that the cloning of a human being should be prohibited. That agreement, I believe, exists in the Congress. It clearly exists in the scientific community. It exists in the medical community, in the religious community, and it exists in virtually every patient and health group that I know of. 
I submit, Mr. President, that the cloning of human beings is scientifically unsafe; it is dangerous; it is morally unacceptable; and it is ethically flawed. We should enact a ban. We should pass a law that establishes the illegality of human cloning and sets forth appropriate penalties. 
The argument I make today is not the ban, but how the bill before the Senate tomorrow, the Bond-Frist bill, would affect scientific research. I introduced identical bills with Senator Kennedy, Senate bills 1602 and 1611 which would protect research that someday, we believe, is likely to provide cures for many of the most dreaded diseases. 
Some examples are treatments for damaged nerve cells, for spinal cord injuries, blood cell therapies for leukemia and sickle cell anemia, liver cell transplants for liver damage, cartilage cells for reconstruction of joints damaged by arthritis or injuries, the creation of stem cells to treat burn victims, and the creation of cells to treat some 5,000 different genetic diseases. 
The bill that the leadership is trying to rush through the Senate, Senate bills 1599 and 1601, would make it a crime with up to 10 years in prison to conduct that kind of research--research that someday will save lives and suffering. 
Those bills, because they don't have clear scientific terms, they don't have definitions of critical words which are part of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology, would submit scientists to prison terms for treatments using this technique. These penalties would have a serious, chilling effect on promising scientific research. 
Somatic cell nuclear transfer--and I am a newcomer to this so I have had a crash course, and I still have an awful lot to learn--this transfer process is its own science. It has a lexicon all of its own. Scientists tell us that the traditional definitions of reproductive health--the traditional definitions of reproductive health--do not fit somatic cell nuclear transfer. There is the rub.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me quote one part: 
The American Cancer Society urges you to oppose S. 1601, legislation that would prohibit the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer. . . . The legislation as drafted would have the unintended effect of restricting critical legal scientific research. The ability to create therapeutically valuable stem cell lines from oocytes, therefore promoting genetic reprogramming of cells to prevent and cure cancer exemplifies the type of research that could be hindered with overly restrictive regulations. The current language in S. 1601 could hamper or punish scientists who contribute to our growing knowledge about cancer.'

Senators should also take time to hear from patients and their families who yearn for cures and treatments for life-threatening diseases. A rush to legislate in this area could have serious consequences for research that could benefit the lives of millions of Americans.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me move for a moment to think tanks. I must say, Mr. President, that one of the most interesting letters to me is one from the CATO Institute, dated February 6. 
They attach to their letter a very interesting article from Science magazine which really casts major doubts on the conclusions drawn from the Dolly experiment. 
The letter says that the new information indicates that there is no need to rush legislation, and it can be accorded the time and deliberation appropriate to legislate that can have a lasting impact on biological research in this country. 
The article from Science magazine questions whether Dolly originated from adult cell DNA. Interesting. And it suggests that she might have resulted from the cloning of an embryonic cell. `Scientists have cloned embryonic cells for years, and those activities have raised no public concern. The last sentence in the first paragraph of the Science news article sums up the significance of the new information. If Dolly isn't the product of DNA from a mature cell, `it would mean that human cloning, which for most conceivable purposes would start with adult cells, is not the immediate threat some worry about.' 
And CATO goes on and says: 
With this new information in hand, there appears to be no need to rush legislation, and at a minimum there is ample time for hearings with knowledgeable and respected scientists, ethicists, theologians, and others testifying about the proposed legislation and its ramifications. 
The CATO letter continues, 
Many scientists, including the Director of the NIH, worry that hastily drafted and loosely drawn legislation directed against cloning will foreclose research that promises new drugs and the capacity to replace or repair nerves, skin, and muscle lost to injury or disease. The information from Science indicates that legislative haste is not necessary.

And this is truly amazing. There are 27 Nobel laureates on this letter. 
What they say, in summing up, is: 
If legislation is deemed to be necessary, we respectfully urge you to be sure that it be limited to the cloning of human beings and not include language that impedes critical, ongoing, and potential new research.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me be very clear. Every letter that is coming in says: Stop, consider, proceed cautiously; this bill would be harmful; it would stop vital research. What is the rush, since the FDA has asserted jurisdiction and the scientific community has engaged in a moratorium? Why proceed like this in such haste, straight to the floor? 
Only two letters have come in saying, proceed like this: One from the Christian Coalition, and the other one is from the National Right to Life Committee, two letters. The entire scientific community says, go slow, define your terms, know what you are doing. 
Let me share with you what I understand this technology is. Let's say a somatic cell were taken out of my tissue. The nucleus of that cell is removed and is entered into an egg cell and fused. That cell, once fused, begins to divide and create more cells. The only way that cell can produce a human being is if it is put into a human uterus. Otherwise, it cannot produce a human being. We don't even know if it will produce a human being if it is put in a uterus. There is only one known instance in an animal, Dolly, which now Science magazine has challenged in a major way. But what we do know is that those stem cells, because of their DNA, can clone tissue. 
For example, a third-degree-burn patient who may reject a skin graft may some day get a skin graft made from his or her own cells and will not reject it. My husband, Bert Feinstein, died of colon cancer and liver cancer. What a miracle if those cells could have been used to come up with a cancer treatment that would have prevented his death. That is really where we are. That is what we hope for. 
There are no definitions in the bill. We don't know what they call a somatic cell. We don't know what they call an embryo. The bill does not define oocyte. But the point is, we have to know, and these terms have to be spelled out in the legislation. 
The bill says, if there is this stem tissue research, it is illegal, and the scientists have a 10-year sentence. 
So what we are begging, imploring, respectfully asking the distinguished majority leader is, please, let's not proceed tomorrow. Let's observe the regular order. Let's go to committee. Let Senator Kennedy and I have an opportunity to present our bill. Let's have the majority leader, Senators Bond and Frist, whom I respect, have an opportunity to present their bill. Let's discuss it and see what is best. Then at least we have heard everybody with knowledge. 
Let me be clear. I want a bill. I want a carefully crafted bill. I want this Congress to act to ban the cloning of human beings. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep sympathy to the families of those killed in Italy by a low flying plane. Like all Americans, I was shocked, saddened, and angered that an American plane caused this tragedy. 
We do not have all the details at this time and are having to rely on media reports, but I want to be very clear. This tragedy never should have happened. This was a disgraceful act, military training should not be done in civilian areas. 
I wish that I could say that this was an isolated incident. Unfortunately, I cannot. Accidents during training missions occur with disturbing frequency. 
Last September, the Secretary of Defense was forced to suspend all training flights after a rash of six crashes within one week. 
Also in September, a F-117 crashed in Maryland, injuring 4 civilians and burning a portion of a home. 
In 1996, a U-2 spy plane crashed in the parking lot of the Mercury-Register newspaper, killing one and injury two others. 
In October, a military jet crashed in Pennsylvania. The pilot managed to eject safely, but the plane exploded near a busy interstate highway. 
It may be impossible to make training missions 100% safe for the pilots, but we have an obligation to make sure they are safe for civilians. 
In the tragedy in Aviano, Italy, the pilot was flying an approved flight path though not at an approved altitude. This flight path led the plane, at a very low altitude, directly over a functioning ski lift. While I have trouble believing news reports that pilots entertain themselves by flying under the ski lift cables, that plane never should have been in the proximity of the ski lift. The potential for tragedy was simply too great. Unfortunately, it took the deaths of 20 people to prove it. 
Clearly, responsibility for this tragedy lies not only with the pilot, but also with the commanders who authorized these dangerous flights. There is a certain degree of risk involved in all training missions. That risk should not fall upon innocent civilians. How many more incidents such as the one in Aviano have to occur before it becomes clear that the potential for tragedy in these missions is too great? 
I would like to see the following actions taken: 
1. A change in the guidelines over where planes can fly training missions. 
2. An immediate report to the American people of the facts of the accident at Aviano. It has been almost a week and we still have no information from the military. 
3. If the investigation shows that the pilot was at fault, the pilot should be subject to Italian law.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Congress has increased the priority of the war on drugs in recent years. We've allocated nearly $300 million in additional funds to the U.S. Customs Service since 1996. 
And I think all of us know that the Southwest Border is still, without question, ground zero in U.S. drug interdiction efforts, with more than 70% of the cocaine and other narcotics entering this country across the 2,000 mile stretch of border between our country and Mexico. 
To meet this threat Congress authorized more than $100 million over the last two years to add 650 inspectors and employ state of the art technologies along the Southwest border. The President's budget in fiscal year 1999 calls for an additional $104 million for Southwest Border narcotics efforts. 
So you can imagine my surprise when I opened yesterday's edition of the Los Angeles Times to read the following: 
The amount of cocaine seized at the commercial ports of entry along the U.S./Mexico border plummeted 84% in 1997, forcing U.S. Customs Service officials to develop a new drug fighting strategy and leaving them concerned about a backlash in Congress. 
Well, Mr. President there is a backlash from this United States Senator because for five and a half years now I have sounded a constant drumbeat on Treasury and on Customs to stop the mixed missions of the Customs Department and understand that there is a major problem with cocaine coming across the Southwest Border. Frankly an 84% drop in seizures last year indicates that all of the money and all of the personnel we have been pumping in has simply not done the job. 84% at the Southwest border, and cocaine seizures are down 15% across the nation. 
If someone could tell me the reason for the drop is because, overall, there is less cocaine coming into the country--I'd say, congratulations, our efforts have been successful. 
But that doesn't appear to be the case. Narcotics intelligence officials continue to warn that an estimated 5 to 7 tons of cocaine enters this country every single day of the year. We are just not getting it. 
If someone could tell me that the drop along the Southwest Border is because our efforts have been so successful, that the drug smugglers are going elsewhere--I'd say bravo, the taxpayers' money has been well spent. 
But, again, that does not appear to be the case. Customs officials are widely quoted in news reports saying the problem is that the drug traffickers continue to stay two steps ahead of our interdiction efforts. And in fact, that is the case. 
Let me again quote from this article:  
Customs officials received a warning in June 1997 that portions of the agency's enforcement strategy at the ports had been compromised. A June 20, 1997 memo from Assistant Commissioner Robert S. Trotter to all Southwest border port directors warned that `traffickers have developed detailed knowledge and profiles of our port operations'. 
More than once, Customs officials have come into my office to tell me that--not only is it not possible to increase inspection of trucks and cars entering our border, obviously because there are so many of them--it is not really necessary, because today we are applying sophisticated technology, including electronic technology, random searches, and Customs' vast intelligence operations and all of that combined is enough to do the job. 
Four years ago I went and spent a day at the Otay Mesa port at the Southwest border. I observed, directly adjacent to our Customs facilities, `spotters' who are individuals standing out on the street with radios and cellular telephones. I then 
went up to a hill overlooking the Customs facility and I watched the spotters work. They get on their phones and they talk to the trucks waiting to cross the border and they direct the trucks as to which lines they should be in to get through the border. 
I mentioned this at the highest levels of the Treasury, both verbally and in writing. I said that we must do something about the spotters. Four years later, the spotters are still there, they are still operational. I am told that there is no law under which we can do anything about it. Unfortunately, at no time has Customs come forward in this four year period with any recommendations for any laws to be passed to deter this activity which is almost certainly an illegal conspiracy to bring cocaine into this country across the Southwest border. 
The `random' searches that I have heard so much about are supposed to keep traffickers trembling in their big-rigs. But they have become so predictable that, by Customs' own admission, `traffickers know what cargo, conveyances, or passengers we inspect, how many of those conveyances are checked on an average day, what lanes we work harder, and what lanes are more accessible for smuggling.' 
Now, Mr. President, I am not insensitive to how difficult this task is, and I want to commend the extremely hard working men and women of the United States Customs Service. I know many of them personally. I know they work hard. I know they try to do their job. They put on those uniforms every day, they inhale all of these exhaust fumes, and they try to keep up with what has been a massive increase in traffic coming across the border. 
But, Mr. President, I do not like to be told how effective our intelligence is, and how sophisticated our technology is, and how tough our enforcement efforts are--and then read reports in the newspaper from Customs' officials about how easily the traffickers are walking all over us. 
I do appreciate the candor from Acting Commissioner Sam Banks on the weaknesses in our efforts. And I understand that Customs is moving very rapidly to counter this 84% drop in seizures with a new operation entitled `Operation Brass Ring'. They clearly know that what they are doing is insufficient. 
For some time, I have believed that the mixed mission given by the Administration to the United States Customs Service creates a situation whereby the law enforcement functions of the United States Customs Service cannot be carried out properly. 
You cannot run an agency with a mixed mission, especially a mission that has the kind of a diametrically different goals that Customs faces. Move the trucks by the millions, just do random searches, depend only on technology, and avoid statistics like the one that just appeared in the Los Angeles Times with an 84% drop in seizures in cocaine coming across the Southwest border. 
I have urged the Administration to appoint a law enforcement person as the new Commissioner of Customs. I am heartened to understand that the Administration has just signed off on the appointment of Ray Kelly as the new Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service. 
I have worked with Mr. Kelly over the past few years as he has been the Secretary for Enforcement in the Treasury Department. I believe he is a straight shooter. He is a law enforcement person. He has an exemplary background. I hope that he will be able to redirect the Customs Service to understand that they do have a law enforcement mission. And, in fact, that that mission is to deter contraband from coming across the border of the United States. 
We also know, Mr. President, that guns in large supply are moving from this country down to Mexico. These guns are used for two purposes. One is to give them to the cartels for their use and the second is for revolutionary insurrection against the government of Mexico. 
I believe that the work of the United States Customs is really cut out for them. In the best of all worlds, trade will continue to increase across the Southwest Border, providing jobs and income for those on both sides of the border. 
But if we are serious about the drug threat--as we say we are--we must demand that the law enforcement functions of deterring contraband be made the highest mission of the United States Customs Service.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is a rush to judgment on one of the most fundamental issues of the 20th century. Mr. President, this is not renaming National Airport Ronald Reagan Airport. 
Mr. President, I submit respectfully to the distinguished Senators on the other side of the aisle that this is a major debate that has scientific implications, moral implications and ethical implications. It is a debate, also, that involves one of the most difficult areas of science involving human genetics, with a vocabulary and a lexicon that is not understood by the great bulk of the American people and certainly not by many of us in the U.S. Senate. 
Both the Bond-Frist bill and the Feinstein-Kennedy bill dealing with the subject of human cloning were introduced less than 48 hours ago--48 hours. No hearings have been held on either bill, no floor debate has been held on either bill. The medical community, the research community, patients with currently incurable diseases whose cure we might affect by both of these bills have barely read the bills, much less analyzed them.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Biotechnology Industry Association analyzes both the Bond-Frist bill and the Feinstein-Kennedy bill, which is a second bill that addresses cloning. This interesting analysis, representing the entire biotechnology industry of the United States, makes a very important point, that whatever we do here impacts on human research in a multitude of different areas, and most particularly it affects cancer research. Mr. President, I will comment on this paper and also comment on a number of other items. 
The American Association for Cancer Research's letter to Senator Connie Mack urges that there be a 45-day delay in enacting any legislation until definitions and implications of legislation can be determined in a more reasonable and thoughtful manner and in an open and public process. They are calling for reason, they are calling for thoughtful deliberation, they are calling for a public process. Who can deny that on a very complicated subject? 
The Whitehead Institute--and specifically Gerald R. Fink, a Director of the American Cancer Society, Professor of Genetics--in his letter talks about the limited ability to develop cell-based strategies, which will take place if the Bond-Frist bill is ramrodded through this body. 
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine has written a letter urging this body to vote no on the Bond-Frist legislation. 
The American Psychological Association has written to us urging that we delay, that there be discussion and debate, and they point out that we need to protect research efforts in this area. 
The American Association for the Advancement of Science has said that they are deeply concerned about the ethical and scientific issues. They warn us: `Use great caution in moving with this legislation.' 
Even the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Missouri, Colombia, has written to this body urging caution. 
The University of California at San Francisco, Roger A. Pederson, Professor and Research Director of the Reproductive Unit of the Department of OB/GYN and Reproductive Science, has written to this body urging caution and restraint as well.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri. I appreciate his comments. And I must tell him that in the main I agree with him. 
We have submitted an alternative bill to Bond-Frist. It is Feinstein-Kennedy. 
I am opposed to human cloning. I believe human cloning is scientifically dangerous, it is morally unacceptable, it is ethically flawed, and we should outlaw it. That is not the issue. 
The issue is we are dealing with a complex subject. The bill at hand is a bill that uses words and does not define those words. There is the rub. 
So the issue here today is whether we go ahead and ramrod through legislation with virtually no consideration by this body, legislation that would impose a permanent ban forever with prison terms of up to 10 years, and we will not understand fully what that bill will do. That is why the medical and the scientific research community have asked us to proceed with caution. 
Let's say that you don't believe me. Would you believe the Biotechnology Industry Association representing the entire biotechnology community? Let me quote from page 4 of their 9-page statement to us. 
The current Bond bill goes beyond cloning because it does not define the term `somatic cell' or limit to cases where the DNA is identical. It only defines the term `somatic cell nuclear transfer,' but it does not define the term `somatic cell.' We need a brief glossary of terms to define what constitutes a `somatic cell.' 
`Zygote' means a single celled egg with two sets (a diploid set) of chromosomes as normally derived by fertilization; 
`Egg' and `oocyte' mean the female gamete; 
`Gamete' means a mature male or female reproductive cell with one set (a haploid) set of chromosomes; 
`Sperm' means the male gamete; 
`Somatic cell' means a cell of the body, other than a cell that is a gamete, having two sets (a diploid set) of chromosomes; 
Here is the point. 
So a `somatic cell' is any cell of the body other than a gamete, and it includes a fertilized egg. This means that the current Bond bill would make it a crime to use somatic cell nuclear transfer even in cases where the somatic cell contains a nucleus derived from sexual reproduction, which is obviously not cloning. This means that even though the nucleus is not a clone, the current Bond bill makes it a Federal crime to create it. This means that the current Bond bill goes beyond the issue of cloning. 
Because of this coverage of all `somatic cells' the current Bond bill would make it a crime for doctors to use a currently effective treatment for mitochondrial disease. In this treatment women who have the disease have an extreme and tragic form of infertility. The disease is a disease of the mitochondria, which is an essential element of any egg. The treatment for this disease involves the use of a fertilized nucleus which is transferred through the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed. The new egg is a fresh, undiseased egg. The current Bond bill would make it a crime to provide this treatment even though the nucleus which is transferred is the product of fertilization, not cloning. 
This is the Biotechnology Industry Association's statement. 
It goes on into other areas that would be prohibited. But let me say what I think the major problem here is. 
The key terms in this bill are undefined, and the full scope of the bill is unknown by anyone in this body. It is just 48 hours old. We don't understand the impact of it. The bill is not ready for rushing to the full Senate for immediate consideration. 
The Bond-Frist bill fails to define the following terms: somatic cell, oocyte, embryo, and preimplantation embryo. 
These are all technical, scientific, state-of-the-art terms that need definition. The bill actually drops the definitions that were in earlier versions of it. 
Undefined key terms will chill vital medical research and treatment. The medical and scientific community has overwhelmingly stated that this bill would chill important scientific and health research. The bill criminalizes that research. Scientists will refuse to do that research. Venture capitalists will refuse to fund it when faced with possible prison terms. 
The Bond bill bans somatic cell nuclear transfer technology, and, as a result, the Bond bill may ban production of genetically identical tissues for treatment of disease and transplantation, including blood cell therapies for diseases, such as leukemia and sickle cell anemia; nerve cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's; multiple sclerosis; nerve cell therapy for spinal cord injury; insulin transplants for diabetes; skin cell transplants for severe burns; liver cell transplants for liver damage; muscle cell therapy for muscular dystrophy and heart disease; and cartilage-forming cells for reconstruction of joints damaged by arthritis or injury. 
Let me say what I think the problem is. 
Senator Kennedy and I have another bill. We approach this differently. Rather than banning all somatic cell nuclear transfer, period, the end, we say you can't use this technology if you are going to implanting it in a human uterus. You cannot grow a baby by implanting it in a human uterus. 
Let me restate that. 
You cannot grow a baby using this technology unless it is implanted in a human uterus. I have confirmed that, to my knowledge, scientifically at this stage, there is no way of doing it. However, you can use this somatic nuclear cell transfer for the tissue research, the other areas of research that I am talking about. Once you ban the technology, you cannot use it for these other areas of research. 
That is why we feel that the place to ban it is with implantation in the female uterus or womb. 
That stops the production of a baby. It is dangerous. It took 277 implants in Dolly before they got it to work. And there is a lot we do not know about the procedure. It is terribly dangerous because you are taking a cell at a certain degree of maturity, not an infant cell. You are taking a mature cell, and you don't know what the impact of that cell is going to be on developmental disabilities and the rest of human development. 
So scientifically it is dangerous to clone a human. Morally, we say it is unacceptable, and there are a lot of reasons for this: Who would clone? What rules do you set up in cloning? Do you permit the cloning of Adolf Hitlers and the other less favorable characters of history, history past and history future. 
So there are many, many questions to discuss. I think everyone in this body believes that human cloning should be made illegal, but we should not attack the technology from which so much good can come. For example, using this technology scientists believe that it will be possible to treat third-degree burns, to provide skin grafts because the DNA would be the same. We may that be able to clone their skin, grow that skin and transfer that skin without rejection. The same thing may be true of diabetes, and particularly in juvenile diabetes which is so recalcitrant and so difficult to handle. 
This technology may offer a cure. And with respect to cancer, this technology is what is used in the mass production of anticancer drugs. It would stop all of this particular technology. 
So the key is not to stop the technology. The key is to stop the implantation of the embryo produced by this technology in a human uterus. That is what we do in our bill. And that is why I can say virtually all of the scientific community supports Feinstein-Kennedy and opposes Bond-Frist. 
Now, I am aware of the fact our staffs met earlier this morning. We all want the same thing. Let me beg this body, do not do something in a rush that is going to mean one day someone is not going to have a cure for cancer or diabetes or somebody lying in a burn unit at St. Francis Hospital in San Francisco or anywhere else is not going to make use of this technology to produce tissue that the body will not reject. 
That is really the issue. Why does this have to be done in 48 hours? The FDA says it will prevent human cloning. Why are we rushing to do something and use terms like somatic cell and we do not define in the legislation what a somatic cell is. How many people do we condemn to death because we shut off research because anybody that does any research will have a 10-year Federal prison sentence, a 10-year Federal prison sentence if you do research on somatic nuclear cell transfer to try to develop a skin graft for a third-degree burn that will not be rejected? 
That is essentially what we are talking about here today, Members of the Senate. The Bond bill additionally could ban noncloning treatments for diseases carried in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is the nonnuclear material in a cell. So parents whose children inherit cytoplasmic diseases can have healthy children by using a variation on somatic cell nuclear transfer. This isn't cloning. It is curing a disease. And I am as sure as I am standing here the Bond-Frist bill bans this kind of therapy. 
So let's have hearings. These bills should go to committee and be considered thoroughly. Let's have the biotechnology community testify. Let's have the scientific community testify. Let's have a glossary of terms that we all agree upon. And let's put those definitions into a bill. Yes, let's ban human cloning. Let's say you cannot implant a uterus with somatic cell nuclear transfer. Then there are no babies. Then there is no human cloning. But the rest of the research, research to cure diseases, can move ahead. 
I am aware of the fact that the distinguished Senator from Florida is in the Chamber and may wish to make a statement. If I could regain the floor, I would be happy to yield to him for the purpose of that statement.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I would like to continue if I can then, and if there is any message that I might be able to deliver on behalf of the distinguished Senator from Florida, who probably knows more about research into areas involving cancer than many of us in this body, I would be happy to deliver it for him. 
I say to the distinguished Senator, I do not want to yield the floor and lose the floor because it is my intention to slow down Senate consideration today in this rushed manner in hopes that we will be able to send it to committee, have a hearing and follow the normal deliberative process, including sending it back to the Senate soon for thoughtful consideration.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am afraid to yield the floor because I may well lose the floor and not get it back again. So I will continue, if I may. 
Mr. President, just yesterday, Dr. J. Benjamin Younger, the Executive Director of the American Society For Reproductive Medicine, wrote: 
`I urge you and your colleagues to carefully consider any human cloning legislation and to proceed through the proper legislative channels so that a sloppily drafted bill does not get passed and sentence millions of Americans to needless suffering. 
Mr. President, once again, I say we should not charge ahead at full throttle on a bill that legislates issues as profound as those surrounding human cloning. There is simply too much at stake. 
I would like to give you just a quick side-by-side comparison of the two bills under consideration that ban cloning, Bond-Frist and Feinstein-Kennedy. 
Feinstein-Kennedy, as I have said, bans the implantation of the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer into a woman's uterus. It makes unlawful the shipping of the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of implanting into a woman's uterus. And it prohibits the use of Federal funds for implanting the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer into a woman's uterus. I recognize that is current in the fiscal year 1998 appropriations law, but we reinforce it in our bill. 
The Bond bill, as I understand it, bans human somatic cell nuclear transfer period. It is defined as taking the nuclear material of a human somatic cell and incorporating it into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been removed or rendered inert and producing an embryo, including a preimplantation embryo. Again, it defines none of these terms. And it makes unlawful the importation of an embryo produced through human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. It is silent on the use of Federal funds, probably because the authors know that a prohibition on human embryo research is already in place. 
The length of the ban in our bill is 10 years. It is a permanent ban in the Bond bill. 
The reason it is a temporary ban or a moratorium of 10 years is largely because a voluntary moratorium has been put in place by the entire American scientific community, and to the best of my knowledge, what they were requesting a 5-year moratorium which the President's bill contained. We felt the 5-year moratorium was too short. We prefer the longer period so that it can be reviewed at 
the end of 10 years. 
The Feinstein-Kennedy bill protects and allows biomedical and agricultural research on practices which are not expressly prohibited. That would include research or practices involving somatic cell nuclear transfer or cloning technologies, mitochondrial, cytoplasmic or gene therapy or somatic cell nuclear transfer to create animals. We do not interfere with that. The Bond bill protects or allows areas of scientific research not specifically prohibited. It is silent on mitochondrial, cytoplasmic or gene therapy. And that is part of our problem here, and that is one of the reasons why we think it needs to go to committee and we need to know at the end of the hearing exactly what it is we are doing. 
On the issue of a national commission, Feinstein-Kennedy authorizes the current National Bioethics Advisory Commission for 10 years, from the date of enactment. The current commission terminates in 1999. Our would continue it and we require reports and recommendations from the commission in 4 1/2 years and in 9 1/2 years. The Bond bill would establish a new national commission to promote a national dialogue on bioethics of 25 members appointed by the Senate and House majority and minority leadership by December 1, 1998, to conduct a discourse on bioethical issues, including cloning, and to report to Congress by December 31, 1999 and annually thereafter. 
On the issue of penalties, the Feinstein-Kennedy bill has a civil penalty of $1 million or three times the gross pecuniary gain or loss resulting from the violation, in other words, a very stringent civil penalty. If an individual uses somatic cell nuclear transfer and implants the product into a woman's uterus, we subject that individual to forfeiture of any property derived from or used to commit a violation or attempted violation. This would get at the lab or hospital where an implantation into a human uterus would take place. Obviously, it has to be done somewhere, and I think this is in a sense a fail-safe major penalty because that entire lab could be forfeited. 
The Bond bill has 10 years in prison or a civil penalty if pecuniary gain is derived of not more than twice the gross gain or both. We think 10 years in prison, when definitions are not included to clearly show what we are talking about, 10 years in prison for someone who might use somatic cell nuclear transfer to create the DNA in a cell that could produce a skin graft or another tissue culture, a skin graft that would heal a burn patient, that that individual should not be subject to 10 years in prison. 
On the issue of preemption, there is a difference between the two bills as well. Feinstein-Kennedy preempts any State or local law that prohibits or restricts research or practices constituting somatic cell nuclear transfer, mitochondrial or cytoplasmic therapy or the cloning of molecules, DNA cells, tissues, organs, plants, animals or humans. 
So, we would set a national standard so that the States could not pass legislation and say it's OK to insert a somatic cell in a woman's uterus. We preempt the area. 
Internationally, there are some differences in the two bills, too. Feinstein-Kennedy has a sense of the Congress that the President should cooperate with foreign countries to enforce mutually supported restrictions. The Bond bill has a sense of the Congress that the Federal Government should advocate for and join an international effort to prohibit the use of human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology to produce a human embryo. 
I think we could easily come to agreement on many of these, particularly this last one. I think we want the same thing. 
The major difference is that the Feinstein-Kennedy bill would allow the technology to proceed in medical research as long as it does not involve human cloning.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I know there are others on the floor. The distinguished Senator from Texas and my friend and colleague from Massachusetts wished to speak on this issue. I would just like to wrap up very rapidly. 
This whole issue was really galvanized with the cloning of the sheep Dolly. Let me reinforce the fact that it took 277 attempts before this cloning was successful. The impact of the cloning is not yet known. 
The second point is that the science is such that huge disabilities, real problems can result from human cloning. It is unsafe. 
And my third point is, the circumstances to not require us to rush. Chicago physicist Dr. Richard Seed propelled the debate into full force last month when he told the media that he intended to clone human beings. And he said that there were 10 clinics in the United States interested in offering cloning services and that he believed the demand would be for 200,000 cases per year. That's according to the American Medical News. 
Since that time, as you know, the scientific community itself has exercised a self-imposed moratorium on human cloning. I know of no legitimate lab, hospital, or facility that will permit human cloning today. I also would like to add that the FDA has said that they are asserting jurisdiction in this area and will not permit human cloning. So I respectfully submit to those who feel there is time pressure that forces us to proceed to the Senate today, that is not correct. There is time for us to take time to consider this issue, to hear the testimony, to go over the scientific terms, to really debate whether the Feinstein-Kennedy approach or the Bond-Frist approach or perhaps a third or fourth approach is the right way to go. 
So I would like to end my comments today, Mr. President, by 
thanking you for your discretion and by appealing to the majority side of this body. You have an opportunity to do some good. But you also have an opportunity to do enormous harm that could cost tens of thousands of lives needlessly if we do not legislate carefully. So let's do it right. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Kennedy and I are introducing legislation that would prohibit, for a period of ten years, any person from attempting to clone a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. 
The reason for this legislation is simple: the cloning of a human being today remains scientifically dangerous, morally unacceptable, and ethically flawed. 
Let me be clear about the intent of this legislation right at the outset: I am opposed to human cloning. I do not believe it is, or will ever be, morally acceptable to clone human beings. 
This legislation was carefully drafted so that it would not prevent or interfere with vital biomedical research into cancer and other diseases, birth defects, infertility, and the mass production of drugs and vaccines. 
The Bill authorizes the continuation of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, and requires the Commission to report to the President and the Congress in 4 1/2 years and 9 1/2 years on the science and ethical issues associated with this technology. 
The Commission's reports to Congress will also include a recommendation as to whether the moratorium should be continued beyond the ten years set by this legislation.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the ranking member, and I thank the Presiding Officer. I also would like to begin by thanking the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for what was, by and large, a rapid and prompt processing of Carlos Moreno. I submitted the name of Carlos Moreno to the President for appointment to the District Court from the Central District of California. In a sense, Madam President, I believe he is prototypical of really what a good Federal judge should bring to that office. I would like to just quickly go over what is an amazing success story. 
Judge Moreno was born in East L.A., just 2 miles from the Federal courthouse where he will be serving. He has earned the respect and admiration of both the legal and the law community, and he has had 13 years of service on the State courts. He has strong bipartisan support, including the endorsements of the former Governor George Deukmejian and Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block. 
As the chairman of the committee pointed out, he obtained his bachelor's degree from Yale in 1970 and his J.D. from Stanford in 1975. He began his legal career in the City Attorney's Office of Los Angeles where he worked for 4 years, from 1975 to 1979. 
He prosecuted numerous jury trials, misdemeanor prosecutions, and criminal and civil consumer protection cases. He worked as a litigation attorney for 7 years, handling commercial litigation in State and Federal courts. So he has experience in both the civil as well as the criminal law. His caseload there included bankruptcy, wrongful termination, banking, real estate, and antitrust. 
In 1986 the Governor of California, George Deukmejian, appointed him to the municipal court. He served there for 7 years, handling 40 civil jury trials in addition to a regular criminal trial workload. 
In 1993, Governor Wilson elevated him to the California Superior Court where he served for the past 4 years. He averaged approximately 2 dozen jury trials a year, at least a third of which have been homicides. The remainder have consisted of a broad range of felonies and he has presided over about a dozen bench trials per year. 
So, 13 years as a municipal and superior court judge. This year he was selected as the superior court judge of the year by the criminal law section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and was described as one who earns praise from both prosecutors and defense attorneys for his fair, even-tempered handling of a high-volume calendar of criminal cases. The large number of court trials he handles in which both sides, both sides, waive the jury and try the case before him is an indicator, I believe, of the trust he has received from opposing counsels.

I thank the ranking member and I thank the chairman for the rapid processing of this distinguished nominee. 
I yield the floor.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Kathy Lacey, my deputy legislative director, who I regret will retire at the end of December after serving California for 27 years as a staff member in the U.S. Senate. 
Kathy came to Washington, DC 27 years ago having studied at Vassar College and after graduate work at the University of Southern California. Her graduate work at USC was in Asian studies and Chinese language. She knew other friends who had used their studies by going to work for the Federal Government and she thought she would find similar opportunities. Instead, former Senator Alan Cranston hired Kathy and she went to work using her love and knowledge of California. 
When Kathy describes her service in the U.S. Senate to younger staff just starting their careers, she says that her effort was always on behalf of the people of California. Her work ranged from trying to assist farmers with export of their crops, to helping cities get their funds to build sewage treatment plants, to fixing levees or to analyzing the science of radioactive waste, pests, and pesticides, or endangered species. 
But what gives Kathy the most satisfaction is the work which she has done, both with me and with Alan Cranston, to protect California's special places. Legislation she has worked on over her 27-year career has protected almost 12 million acres of wilderness in California. More than half of that acreage was part of the Desert Protection Act. I could not have successfully gotten that bill passed without Kathy's knowledge and continuous work. 
But Kathy was also involved in the creation of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, establishment of Channel Island National Park, expansion of Redwood National Park, protection of Mineral King through its addition to Sequoia National Park, establishment of the Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area, preservation of the Tuolumne River, enactment of the Smith River bill which protected watersheds and old growth in the Six Rivers National Forest, and designation of almost all of the wilderness in California including the 1.8-million-acre California wilderness bill. 
Kathy grew up in Pasadena. Her parents had come to California as teenagers. Her mother and brother still live there. Because Kathy chose to come to Washington, DC, and work for California, she has made a lasting contribution to her State. 
Kathy plans to leave the Congress and have new adventures with her husband, Cal, who has also recently retired. On behalf of everyone in California, I thank Kathy for her professional spirit which was important to me from my first days in the U.S. Senate and I thank her for her dedicated example which has proved so significant to California.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to cosponsor legislation introduced by my colleagues Senator Grassley and Senator Jeffords to extend the production tax credit, a tax incentive to encourage wind-generated energy. 
Today, California's Tehachapi-Mojave area is the world's largest producer of wind-generated electricity. The New York Times has described the area's 5,000 electricity producing wind turbines as a vision of the future. Wind generation energy provides a renewable, clean, environmentally sound source of energy in California. I am pleased to lend my support to the Grassley-Jeffords legislation. 
The production tax credit provides a 1.5 cent tax credit for each kilowatt of electricity produced in the United States during the first ten years a new wind energy production facility is in service. The legislation is an inexpensive way to encourage clean, efficient and sustainable energy future for our children and grandchildren. 
Under current law, the production tax credit is scheduled to expire in 1999, complicating the planning and development of new wind energy generation facilities. New wind energy facilities, like any major construction project, take several years to move from planning to operation. Without the certainty of the credit after 1999, investors will be reluctant to commit funds for the development of new wind energy facilities. Industry officials have already noticed a decline in investment, which can be attributed to the credit's uncertainty. 
Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy technology. The amount of wind-generated power has increased by 25 percent each year during the last 5 years, growth which is expected to accelerate through 2010. Wind-generated energy is expected to become a $400 billion industry worldwide by 2020. However, most of the growth is occurring in Europe, rather than here in the United States. No new wind power generation development has occurred in the United States since 1991. 
I am pleased that California companies, including those in south and central California, are among the world's leading manufacturers and developers of wind energy facilities. If domestic firms are able to capture even one-fourth of the jobs associated with serving the growing market, the growth would support approximately 150,000 jobs. These are high-technology engineering jobs, traditional areas of strength for California, providing a solid economic foundation. 
The Grassley-Jeffords legislation will have important environmental consequences as well. The President's initiative against global warming includes $5 billion program of tax incentives, which could include the extension of the production tax credit. Coal is currently the Nation's largest source of power, providing 55 percent of the Nation's energy needs. However, coal has the highest level of carbon dioxide, when compared with the amount of electricity produced. Wind production energy is a significantly cleaner alternative, helping to decrease carbon dioxide emissions. Wind energy could supply 30,000 megawatts of energy by 2010, rather than current 1,700 megawatts today, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 18%. These are cost-effective steps for our energy future. 
I am pleased to join Senator Grassley, who has demonstrated his long-standing commitment to this important issue, and cosponsor the Grassley-Jeffords legislation. Without an extension, I am concerned wind energy production will not be able to develop, undermining economic, environmental and clean air goals. Wind generation energy provides a renewable, clean, environmentally sound source of energy for California's future. I am pleased to lend my support to the legislation.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I am joined by a bipartisan group of my colleagues in submitting a resolution that expresses support for the agreements reached at the recent summit between President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China. 
As the resolution makes clear, the United States and China did not come to agreement on every issue that divides us during the summit. Significant, even fundamental differences remain in some areas, particularly in the area of human rights. But there is no question that the summit was a positive step forward in building a cooperative partnership between the largest developed country and the largest developing country on earth. 
The summit has, of course, occasioned a vigorous debate on the United States' policy toward China. It seems to me that the key to a successful China policy is to be able to encourage this large nation to take its place in the world as a stable, responsible leader that can help ensure peace and stability in Asia and the world. 
The question is how to do this? Our choices seem to boil down to two: 
Some say we should contain China, prevent its rise, and isolate it from the world community. We should recognize it as an adversary. 
Others--myself and the cosponsors of this resolution included--say we should engage China, understand that our relationship is complex, develop a strategic partnership where we have like interests, and through intensive communication try to achieve common ground. 
Last week's summit was, in my view, the beginning of a course of ongoing top level dialogue and diplomacy. 
It showed that we must deal with China on the top levels. Prior to last week, our two presidents had had little communication. There was no red telephone, no way for the leaders to speak. Our dialogue was sporadic, and took place on second and third levels. 
Was the summit a success? Yes. It was definitely more that just a series of photo-ops. It accomplished progress and concrete results which bear explicit restatement. 
First, the summit established the ability of two country's leaders to talk with each other. They have resolved to engage in ongoing communication, conduct regular summit meetings--indeed, President Clinton will go to China next year--and the establishment of a telephone hotline. 
This high-level communication is important, because Beijing does not always know what all its ministries are doing. Our intelligence can help bring it to their attention, as was the case when Chinese companies shipped ring magnets to Pakistan. U.S. intelligence also helped China shut down a number of illegal CD factories. 
Second, the summit produced a very important nuclear non-proliferation agreement. China committed that it would engage in no new export of nuclear technology, expertise, or equipment to Iran. This is in addition to China having already signed the N.P.T., the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the CWC, and its commitment to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime and its annexes. China also agreed to participate in multi-lateral efforts to control and monitor the export of nuclear materials. In exchange we have agreed to allow the export of peaceful nuclear energy technology to China. 
Third, the summit led to several extremely useful military-to-military agreements. Two two sides agreed to expand military-to-military exchanges, including at the Secretary of Defense level, and to establish communications links to avoid accidental incidents at sea between the our navies. 
Fourth, the summit produced agreements aimed at increasing U.S.-China cooperation on law enforcement. China agreed to the stationing of two DEA agents at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, and we will expand our cooperation in combating organized crime, counterfeiting, alien smuggling, and money laundering. 
Fifth, the two sides reached agreements aimed at improving China's energy usage and decreasing its pollution problem. The United States and China will engage in a cooperative effort--using U.S. technology to work on China's serious urban air pollution problem, and to provide electricity to rural villages. 
Sixth, in perhaps the most important contribution we can make to the cause of human rights in China, the two sides agreed on a number of measures aimed at promoting the rule of law in China. The United States and China will engage in a joint effort in developing the rule of law in China. It will involve the training of judges and lawyers, exchanges of legal experts, and assistance to China in drafting new criminal, civil, and commercial codes. 
Seventh, even in the area of human rights, there were some modest gains. I emphasize `modest' because we still have fundamental differences with the Chinese on human rights. What we see as issues of basic human freedom and dignity, the regard as their `internal affairs,' with deep implications for China's stability and unity. 
America's position was clearly put forward--by the President, by Members of Congress, and by the many demonstrations that followed President Jiang around. I believe Chinese leaders may now have an understanding of the depth of feeling about human rights issues in the United States in a way they could not have known before the visit. 
Nevertheless, there was some limited progress. China agreed to receive a group of religious leaders from the U.S. to conduct fact-finding on religious freedom. China also agreed to resume a prisoner accounting project run by a businessman and human rights activist, John Kamm. In addition, China agreed to the establishment of a non-governmental organization human rights forum. Preparatory sessions will be held soon. And just prior to the summit, China signed the U.N. Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which obligates parties to promote these rights in their countries. 
Clearly, there were also major disappointments on human rights. There was no release of dissidents, and no comment that indicated any new thinking on Tiananmen Square. On Tibet, China clings to old and discredited arguments and has been non-committal on all overtures for talks with the Dalai Lama, and the repression in Tibet continues. 
But even with the disappointments, things are changing in China. No large country has changed as much as China has in the last 30 years since the end of cultural revolution. Today there is a freer lifestyle, an improved standard of living, and much greater educational opportunities. There is a greater openness, and tremendous economic development. There is also a gradual lowering of tariffs and opening of borders. 
Our relationship with China is not without its strains. Taiwan, for example remains the number one issue of sensitivity for China. The Chinese view it as a fundamental issue of sovereignty. I think the Administration understands this, and is firmly committed to the One China policy. 
But otherwise, all issues remain negotiable and subject to the enterprise of diplomacy conducted at the highest levels. In this regard, the summit was definitely a step forward. For that reason, my colleagues and I submit this resolution to recognize the achievements of the summit, and to express our support for President Clinton's intention to make a return visit to China next year.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was pleased to join yesterday with the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, as a cosponsor of his bill, S. 1413, the Enhancement of Trade, Security, and Human Rights Through Sanctions Reform Act. 
This bill is an attempt to bring some order to one of the more vexing foreign policy problems we in Congress face--the question of when to impose unilateral economic sanctions. 
Congress has been quick to enact unilateral economic sanctions over the years in response to behavior of foreign nations that we find objectionable. At times, the executive branch has done the same. By one estimate, between 1993 and 1996, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions 61 times on 35 countries. 
The question we must ask, and which in my view we fail to ask at times, really is fundamental to the conduct of U.S. foreign policy: Are U.S. interests advanced best by deepening relations or diminishing relations with a country that is not acting as we would like? 
Frankly, there is no one answer to this question. The answer clearly varies from case to case. There is no doubt that unilateral sanctions do have a place in our foreign policy tool box. I have voted for them at times, as has nearly every Member of Congress. 
However, there is no doubt, as well, that we have imposed sanctions recklessly at times, without due regard to their effectiveness, or to the damage they could cause other U.S. foreign policy interests, the U.S. economy, and our ability to provide humanitarian assistance. 
What S. 1413 would do is force Congress and the executive branch to apply the brakes in the occasional rush to impose unilateral sanctions. Our effort is not to prevent unilateral sanctions in all cases, but instead to impose a more judicious process that we should follow before they are imposed. This process is designed to create some breathing space--time to adequately consider both the possible impact of unilateral sanctions on other U.S. interests, and whether there are other policy alternatives that might be more effective than unilateral sanctions. 
It will also ensure that when we do pass unilateral sanctions, we do not lock ourselves into a policy that deprives us of all flexibility. By making Presidential waivers and a 2-year sunset policy standard practice for the imposition of unilateral sanctions, we will ensure that we are not forced to perpetuate a policy that is not working, has become outdated, or is excessively damaging U.S. interests in other areas. 
It is worth repeating that nothing in this legislation will prevent us from passing unilateral sanctions into law. This bill is merely designed to bring some order and discipline to the process. I want to commend the Senator from Indiana for his leadership in this area, and I look forward to working with him to pass this bill into law.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, a California company has embarked on an effort that I believe demonstrates how entrepreneurship and public service can go hand in hand. 
The Recovery Network is a new nationwide cable television program dedicated to helping people recover from the devastating disease of addiction. This Santa Monica-based network is the first of its kind and the only broadcast network in the world devoted entirely to substance abuse recovery and prevention. 
It is estimated that more than 130 million Americans suffer from or are affected by alcoholism, drug abuse, eating disorders, depression, gambling and other addictions. The Recovery Network offers a lifeline of help to millions of those in need offering group recovery sessions, information on 12-step recovery programs, a 24-hour 800-number help line, discussion shows designed for children of alcoholics and parents with drug abuse problems, and information shows on the pharmacological effects of alcohol and other addictive substances. Recovery Network serves not only those in need of help, but also the friends, families, teachers, and professionals seeking guidance and tools to effect change. 
Another important part of the Recovery Network is the localized programming effort. `Neighborhood Recovery' enables local community groups to offer their services through cable programming. Organizations like Californians for Drug-Free Youth, and the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug-Free Community can reach out to people in their specific area offering information on local meetings and other resources. 
I believe this type of public service programming is exactly what Congress envisioned when it passed the Cable Communications Act in 1984, `* * * to provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and service to the public' and `* * * assure that cable systems are responsive to the needs and interest of the local community.' 
Community cable became a permanent fixture on the American landscape in 1948. Its purpose was to service remote communities with a master antenna providing a clear television broadcast signal. Three years later, 70 cable systems services 14,000 homes nationally. Since then, cable television has become a vital full-service link to citizens in every city and town in the United States, serving more than 67 million households nationwide. 
People suffering from alcohol and drug addiction have found the Recovery Network there to help when they were most in need: 
One young couple from Ohio who was traveling and struggling to maintain their sobriety early in recovery happened upon the Recovery Network on their hotel television. They said `* * * we turned you on unknowingly, and it was like an AA meeting right in our hotel room. It really helped us refocus on what is important, and that is AA and staying sober.' 
An Indiana viewer wrote `I just want to say thank you for the programs and the light at the end of the tunnel that they showed me.'

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to commend and strongly support Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Policy Control, in his call for increased funds for the drug interdiction effort. I have been one who has been most critical over the low priority effort that has been made to stop the flow of drugs into this country. The recent series in the Washington Post--I think it was five articles--pointed out that anywhere from 5 to 7 tons a day of heavy narcotics is flowing into our country. 
General McCaffrey reports that he has been visiting at least four Cabinet Secretaries, including the Cabinet Secretary representing Defense, to really ask for moneys to increase the interdiction efforts with respect to hard narcotics. 
I, who have criticized, must also be one who stands and supports this. Later today, Senator Coverdell and I, and I hope the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, who has just come to the floor, will be joining in a letter to the Secretary, also indicating our support. 
General McCaffrey insists that he cannot certify the Pentagon's requested budget for fiscal 1999 unless it includes $141 million in additional drug interdiction funding. I believe the general is right in taking this action. I urge the administration to support him. 
While highlighting the fact that other Federal agencies have increased their counternarcotics spending at a faster rate, the general has asked that the Defense Department increase the amount it spends for the drug fight in four key areas. 
The first is Andean coca reduction. He is asking for an increase of $75 million to carry on the drug fight in the Andes region, where American and local officials are working in cooperation to disrupt the cocaine export industry. 
National Guard counterdrug operations--he is asking for an increase of $30 million to support antidrug activities of the National Guard that partially restores reductions incurred since 1993 in State plans funding, which include support for counterdrug activities along the border. 
Third, he is asking for an increase of $12 million for a program to intercept traffickers in the Caribbean Basin, including southern Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the eastern Caribbean. This would implement commitments made by the President during the Caribbean summit in Barbados. 
And he is asking for money for Mexican initiatives, an increase of $24 million to provide additional resources to reduce the flow of illicit drugs from Mexico and for a drug training program for Mexican officials so that they can locate and arrest drug traffickers and money launderers at the border. 
The point that General McCaffrey makes, that I think is so important, is although the domestic funding of domestic agencies to fight drugs has gone up, the Defense Department funding, which is really the interdiction funding--the air surveillance, the radar, the trafficking, those thing that is going into really cutting off the flow of narcotics--has gone down by 2 percent this year. If you look at a chart of its decline over a period of years you will see where it went up to a high in 1992, came dramatically down by 1994, and has remained virtually flat, even declining some more, between 1995 and 1999. So the current DOD budget is only 1.3 percent higher than fiscal year 1990. 
We were told we have 5 to 7 tons of cocaine and hard narcotics coming in over our border a day. 
And yet, the DOD budget is only 1.3 percent higher in these areas than it was in 1990. That is less than a single year of inflation. 
So, I think the head of this Office of Drug Control has a very, very good point in asking for this money and, frankly, for really putting his foot down. Many of us in the Senate have been after him to be more vigorous to stop the flow of narcotics: `Why don't you do something about it? Why don't you see that the air and sea and land interdiction is beefed up?' He can't do that without the resources to do it. 
Mr. President, I happen to believe in terms of the appropriateness of it being in the Defense Department budget, that there is no threat to America's national security equal to the threat of drugs. Tens of thousands of people are killed in this country from drugs. Hundreds of thousands of lives in this country are ruined by drugs. It is largely responsible today for the crime rate in virtually every community throughout this Nation. It is a driving force and a central drawing card for the gang movement in the United States and its spread across State lines. 
The cartels have flourished because of it, and with it has come some of the most violent actions which anyone can possibly conceive: prosecutors killed, attorneys threatened. Just today, if you pick up the newspaper, you will see one of the cartel leaders, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who underwent plastic surgery. The doctors who performed that surgery disappeared. Their bodies were just found. Their fingernails had been pulled out. Their bodies were covered with burns. The garrote still remained around their neck. And this is everyday action surrounding drugs, the movement of drugs and the activities of the five big Mexican cartels. 
All of this has created increased and, I think, unnecessary tensions between two countries, neighboring countries--the United States and Mexico--who should be good friends and working together. We can't work together without the resources to carry out the job well. No Nation today, again, presents the threat to this Nation's national security as does the heavy flow of narcotics into this country. 
So I am very proud, and Senator Coverdell and I will be issuing a joint press statement indicating our strong support for this action. We want a standup drug czar. We want him to call it as he sees it. We want him to take forceful action wherever that action is needed. 
I am proud to stand here representing one of the States that is impacted in a major way by drugs, to say both to the Secretary of Defense and to the President of the United States, `Please support the drug czar in his request for these additional moneys. They are necessary for him to do the job.' 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senate, in particular I thank the majority and minority leaders for the agreement that allowed the confirmation of Christina Snyder as a Federal district court judge to proceed. I think this body will be proud of Mrs. Snyder's work on the bench. I have a great deal of faith in her. 
I thank the majority leader very much for scheduling this vote on the nomination of Christina Snyder. Mrs. Snyder is an excellent candidate, and I am delighted that the Senate will act today on her nomination. 
Christina Snyder's nomination has been pending before the Senate since being reported by the Judiciary Committee on September 18, and the California district courts face an urgent need for additional judges on the bench. 
I recommended Chris Snyder to the President, in January 1996, for appointment to the central district of California because I believe she is extremely well qualified for the position. 
Christina Snyder is a highly respected lawyer in Los Angeles. She has more than 20 years of experience in the courtroom and served as a partner in three respected Los Angeles law firms. 
She has focused her legal career on civil proceedings, where approximately 70 percent of her cases have been in the Federal courts. 
Her practice has consisted of complex civil litigation, representing mostly defendants, including cases involving the Federal securities laws, civil RICO, antitrust, intellectual property, and the Lanham Act. 
Christina's record for integrity and decisiveness has earned the respect of her peers, both Democrats and Republicans alike. 
Chris Snyder has the support of professors, judges, and lawyers in the central district and throughout California. 
Among her many supporters are such prominent Republican Los Angeles leaders as Mayor Richard Riordan, who noted his very high regard and enthusiastic support for her, and Sheriff Sherman Block. 
As a testament to her high regard by her colleagues in the legal profession, Mrs. Snyder was nominated for membership to the prestigious American Law Institute. Membership in the organization is equally divided between lawyers, judges, and legal professors. It is indeed an honor to be elected to the organization and Mrs. Snyder was elected to the institute the very first time she was nominated, a noteworthy accomplishment. 
Mrs. Snyder has also lectured on various subjects related to banking law and intellectual property law, and is currently coauthoring a treatise on the local rules of practice of the Federal courts in the State of California. 
As an attorney for over 20 years, she has the experience and temperament to excel in this position. 
I urge the Senate to confirm her nomination to the central district court. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.  
Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator Gordon Smith and Ron Wyden of Oregon, as well Senator Max Baucus and Senator Slade Gorton to introduce legislation to strengthen tax incentives and encourage more charitable giving in America. The legislation, based on S. 1121 which I introduced last year, represents an important step to encourage greater private sector support for important educational, medical, and other goals in local communities across the country. 
Americans are among the most caring in the world, contributing generously to charities in their communities: American families contribute, on average, nearly $650 for each household, or about $130 billion annually, to charities. Approximately, three out of every four households give to nonprofit charitable organizations. 
However, charities are very concerned for the future, as Federal efforts to balance the budget will limit funds for social spending for urgent needs like children's services, homelessness, job training, and health care. While support for charities grew by 3.7 percent in 1994, contributions for human services, the area most closely associated with poverty programs, dropped by 6 percent. Nonprofit charities are very concerned about their ability to maintain their current level of services or grow to address unmet needs. 
Nonprofit charities can never replace government programs, but they can play a critical role and provide vital social services. The Federal Government must ensure we are doing everything we can to encourage support for charities, which supplement Federal programs.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering legislation with Senator Kyl as original cosponsor, a legislation which provides full reimbursement to state and local counties for costs incurred for emergency medical services and ambulatory services provided to undocumented aliens injured during a pursuit by border patrol or under the custody of federal, state, or local authorities. 
This legislation: Authorizes full reimbursement for emergency medical costs, including ambulatory services for illegal aliens who are injured during illegal crossings at land and sea ports, or during a pursuit by border patrol, or while in custody of federal, state, or local authorities; 
Authorizes up to $18 million per year for the next 4 years from a separate account under the Attorney General to reimburse states and localities for emergency medical services provided to illegal aliens. 
Requires the Attorney General to submit a written report to Senate and House Judiciary Committees on the policy and practice, including custody practice, of the border patrol by March 1, 1998. 
Requires annual report by the Attorney General to Senate and House Judiciary and Appropriations Committees on the implementation of this bill. 
INS reports show that in FY96, 1.65 million illegal aliens were apprehended, of which 97% or 1.6 million apprehensions were made at the Southwest Border. INS also reports that more than 300,000 illegal aliens come into the country every year and in FY97, over 111,000 criminal and other illegal aliens were put through formal deportation proceedings. 
With increased focus on apprehending illegal aliens at the 140 mile stretch of our Southwest border, recent reports also show increases in unreimbursed emergency medical service cost of illegal aliens to state and local county hospitals. 
The California State Auditor recently released a report which charged that San Diego alone incurred up to $8.1 million in unreimbursed charges in emergency medical service for illegal aliens between January 1996 and May 1997. The Auditor estimates that San Diego hospitals incurred from $4.9 million to $8.1 million in unreimbursed emergency medical services and ambulatory services for up to 1074 illegal aliens during the seventeen month period. The unreimbursed medical service costs include hospital care, costs incurred for paramedics and air transportations, physicians, surgeons and laboratories. 
These uncompensated services, which hospitals and other emergency service providers are required to provide under California law, were provided to illegal aliens who were injured during illegal crossings at the border and while escaping border patrol pursuits. 
The Sacramento Bee recently reported the following:  
Every time a Border patrol chase results in injuries, San Diego area hospitals provide `free' care to those injured... (For instance), medical care for Fransciso Quintera--who was struck by a car while fleeing Border patrol agents--cost UCSD Medical Center over $1 million in uncompensated expenses. In one recent vehicle chase, a van loaded with illegal immigrants crashed while evading the Border Patrol, costing Scripps Hospital $200,000 and Mercy Hospital $100,000 in uncompensated care. 
In the 1996 Immigration Act, Congress acknowledged the huge cost shift to state and local county hospitals in unreimbursed cost for emergency medical services provided to illegal aliens by authorizing full reimbursement for emergency Medicaid and ambulatory services. 
However, the $25 million appropriated annually over the next 4 years under the Balance Budget Act for emergency Medicaid for illegal aliens is insufficient to cover the full cost of emergency medical services for illegal aliens nationwide, where high immigrant States like California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona and Massachusetts end up picking up the responsibility for caring for the injured illegal aliens. 
In fact, for fiscal year 1998, there are no appropriations for reimbursement for emergency ambulatory services, as authorized by the 1996 Immigration Act. Instead, Congress only requires INS to perform a pilot project in Nogales, Arizona and report its findings to Congress. 
Appropriating $25 million over the next 4 years and performing a pilot project in Nogales, Arizona is not enough to cover the millions of dollars high immigrant States like California incur every year in unreimbursed emergency medical and ambulatory costs for illegal aliens injured at the border or during a border patrol pursuit. 
Mr. President, time has come for the Federal Government to take full responsibility for the cost associated with providing emergency medical services, including ambulatory services, for illegal aliens and lifting the fiscal burden on State and local counties. 
Thank you and I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise on this final day of debate on the conference report to the DOD bill, and I do so to express my strong opposition. 
Now, I very much regret this. I have great fondness for the chairman of the Committee, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, and great respect for the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin. The great bulk of the bill I wish to support. I understand that there are important things in the bill. However, from the perspectives of Texas and California, there is a basic unfairness in this bill that we cannot leave unaddressed, and I rise to address those points. 
I want to say how privileged both my colleague from California and I have been to work with the senior and junior Senators from the great State of Texas in trying to remedy the unfairness in this bill. Unfortunately, I must indicate we have not been able to achieve an accommodation, and therefore we register our objections through our `no' votes. 
I oppose the conference report because it contains language that will effectively stop, ban, prohibit any further public/private competitions of depot workloads at both McClellan and Kelly Air Logistics Centers. These competitions will lower the cost of weapons systems repair and will save the taxpayer money. It is hard for me to understand why they are not being permitted to go ahead. 
It is unfortunate that this debate has to take place. We felt we had an agreement. The distinguished Senator from Michigan knows that he called me one night to indicate that at least 2 1/2 points of the four points we had raised would be accommodated. We agreed to that. We backed off. Overnight, committee language was written which essentially undid the compromise, and we have been able to achieve no remedy since that time. 
In the debate last week, this body heard that if this restrictive depot language remained in the bill, the President would probably veto the bill. A strongly worded letter was sent to the majority leader and other senior Members of Congress detailing the administration's concern dovetailing our concern. I will not read the letter, but I would like to talk about some of the points in it. 
The depot language in this bill constrains DOD's ability to conduct competitions for depot-level repair work. This will result in decreasing the amount of potential savings the Department would reap from these competitions and could then redirect to fund other vital needs like readiness and weapons modernization. 
Second, the administration is correct. The conference report absolutely `seeks to impose unique and inappropriate requirements on DOD's process for allocating the work now performed at the closing San Antonio and Sacramento Air Logistics Centers.' 
Contrary to what members of the Depot Caucus espouse, the option to privatize this depot work was explicitly made available in the 1995 BRAC closure report. The BRAC 95 Commission specifically recommended that the Department `consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD depots or to private-sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.' 
And, yes, the President did strongly support the Commission's decision which specifically reinforced the option of privatization. In his letter to the chairman of the BRAC 95 Commission, the President wrote, `I was pleased to learn that . . . you confirmed the Commission's recommendations permitting the Department of Defense to privatize the workloads of McClellan and Kelly facilities in place or elsewhere in their respective communities. . . . In my communications with Congress, I have made clear that the Commission's agreement that the Secretary enjoys full authority and discretion to transfer workload from these two installations to the private sector, in place, locally or otherwise, is an integral part of the overall BRAC 95 package it will be considering.' 
The President goes on to say without ambiguity,  
Moreover, should the Congress approve this package but then subsequently take action in other legislation to restrict privatization options at McClellan or Kelly, I will regard this as a breach of Public Law 101-510 (the base closure law) in the same manner as if the Congress were to attempt to reverse by legislation any other material direction of this or any other BRAC. 
While I'm on the subject of the BRAC, let me clear the air on this point. Some have alleged that this public/private competition process which could result in this work being privatized at McClellan and Kelly is just a crooked attempt to keep these bases open. Let me say, without ambiguity, it is not. McClellan and Kelly will both be closed in 2001. BRAC 95 made that decision. And, the communities of Sacramento and San Antonio are struggling to deal with this decision and make the best of it today. 
Nearly 3,000 jobs not associated with the ongoing competition at McClellan's Air Logistics Center will be moved to other Air Force depots because when McClellan's gates are locked in 2001, that is it. Those 2,300 jobs that are associated with the public/private competition may also be moved to other Air Force depots depending upon its outcome. That's it. If this depot language remains in the conference report, McClellan will undoubtedly lose these remaining 2,300 jobs. And that is what this is all about. 
As far as the property and buildings at McClellan are concerned, they will be transferred under the base reuse process to recipients in the local community according to their base reuse plan. 
Third, the Department is already conducting a fair and open public/private competition at McClellan and Kelly. The depot language in this conference report would change that. It would, without question, skew these competition in favor of the public depots. But, don't take my word for that, or the administration's, just listen to the supporters of the depot language. 
One of the authors of the language, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, believes that this language shuts the door on private industry's ability to compete. Quoted in the Daily Oklahoman he said, `I think it's highly unlikely any (contractor) would want to bid on it.' 
How are my colleagues and I supposed to believe this is a fair competition? Not only is that the sentiment of the Depot Caucus, but in the letter we have heard quoted on the floor very effectively by the distinguished Senator from Texas, the Industry-Depot Coalition, the Aerospace Industries Association, the American Electronics Association, the American Shipbuilding Association, the Contract Services Association, Electronic Industries Association, National Defense Industry Association, Professional Services Council, and Shipbuilders--all agree that the impact of this is to kill private competition. 
In a letter today sent to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, the chairman of the committee, they point out that the legislation, `* * * places in statute competitive requirements that are at this time only to be applied to the proposed competitions for the workloads at Kelly and McClellan. As believers in fair competition and equal treatment in all areas of competition, we simply cannot support a statutory requirement such as this one, that places unique requirements on only one category of bidders. If the object is to ensure fair competition, the statute should reflect that philosophy clearly, unambiguously, and uniformly.' 
Mr. President, I have had calls from private contractors saying they can't compete and won't compete under this language. I have said to them, `Would you put this in writing? Will you go public?' 
Do you know what they told me? `We are afraid to. There will be reprisals against our companies if we state this publicly.' 
Have we come to that? 
Let me also say, the Sacramento Bee quoted an industry representative who said, `I can't conceive of a company that would bid for McClellan and Kelly under these circumstances.' So, the Senators from Texas and the Senators from California are fighting for survival. We are fighting for the ability to do what is professed to be the will of this body, which is to see if private competition can be effective in handling some of this workload and that a fair bidding and contracting process exists to carry out that competition. 
Secretary Cohen has supported us in this effort and for that I am very pleased. 
It is amazing to me that the Depot Caucus has taken this position. Let me cite the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center in Georgia as an example. Members of the Depot Caucus have complained from the first day that the competition announced by the Air Force would be unfair and biased. They said public depots couldn't possibly win. But, Warner Robins won. How did this happen? 
One of the reasons it happened is that public depots can hide their overhead in other accounts when they bid against private industry for this work. Members of private industry on numerous occasions have said this is exactly why they can't compete under this bill that is being passed today. Warner Robins, as I understand it--and I have never been contradicted in this--took advantage of this ability to hide overhead costs to help make its bid below that of their private competitors. In fact, the Air Force had to add penalties to Warner Robins' bid for the 500 employees and other overhead that had been shifted to other accounts. 
When conference began, the President's advisers said that he would veto the DOD authorization bill if these depot provisions were included in the bill. This veto message has not changed. The Depot Causus' anticompetition provisions, included in this bill by the conferees, will serve to delay and restrict the public-private competitions for depot workload currently underway at both McClellan and Kelly Air Force Bases undermining any effort to do this work in the private sector in a more cost-effective way. 
DOD's own policy calls for greater reliance on the private sector for appropriate depot maintenance workload. Outsourcing helps preserve private sector capabilities and enhances DOD's ability to capture new technologies that are constantly being developed in the private sector. By introducing greater competition into the mix, outsourcing lowers the cost of depot-level maintenance activities increasing funding levels for modernization and readiness needs. 
Secretary Cohen stated earlier this year that these provisions:  
. . . could cost the Department significant sums in lost annual savings and start-up costs. The could severely impact military readiness. The San Antonio and Sacramento workloads involve thousands of highly trained workers and large, expensive equipment and facilities. . . . To transfer all of these workloads without a competitive evaluation and risk assessment would be unwise from a business perspective and would involve a significant risk of disruption in mission performance and degradation in military readiness. 
DOD has stayed true and faithful to the Secretary's statement in also urging and recommending to the President that this bill be vetoed. 
So, I urge my colleagues, please support the Senators from Texas and California in opposing this conference report until these depot provisions are removed from the bill. We need to let these competitions go forward in a truly fair and level way so that we can fund the modernization and the readiness accounts. DOD believes that the first competition will result in an expected savings of $190 million. That is what is at stake in this issue, as far as funding for readiness and preparedness of the military is concerned--$190 million. 
Turning to another subject, I would also like to raise concerns with a provision in the conference report on revised export rules for computers. The conference report enacts new, and I believe damaging, restrictions on the sale of many types of computers. The proposal is unworkable and will result in undermining our security in the long run. 
Computer technology advances rapidly. What was called a supercomputer only a few years ago, represents only routine computing power today. An overbroad restriction will not make the world a safer place, but will undermine U.S. interests by locking up U.S. exports, shifting sales to foreign manufacturers and denying the administration the necessary flexibility to respond to evolving technology and worldwide competition. 
Export restrictions must be based on an objective review of a computer's computing power and the computing needs of the potential computer application. In a letter to conferees, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger wrote. 
The President's 1995 decision to streamline computer export controls addressed the outdated controls then in effect. Given the rapid pace of technological change, we must avoid substituting similarly inflexible controls mandated by Congress. It is vitally important to maintain our ability to adjust controls to keep pace with technological change while focusing our limited resources on exports of national security concern. 
So the administration needs the authority to distinguish between sales that jeopardize national security and those that do not. That is what the administration is asking for. In stating this as a rationale, as well, they would recommend that this bill be vetoed if it goes out in its present form. 
I believe that is a correct assessment. I think we only kick ourselves in the pants, to have this kind of a restriction in this bill. Other countries will simply buy elsewhere. Our companies will lose those sales and the President, as well as the Department of Commerce, will lose any flexibility they have in making some decisions that are really based on meaningful criteria. This bill fixes that criteria at a lower level on computers that are not, in fact, supercomputers today. That is the mistake that is inherent in the writing of this provision. 
It is for these reasons that Senators Gramm, Hutchison, Boxer, and I oppose this bill. There are those who have said, and I want to address it, these four Senators are resisting pay raises. They don't want increases in housing allowances. They don't want authorization of military construction projects. 
That is baloney, and it is the reason that the four of us introduced a bill last week that goes ahead and authorizes the pay raises, the hazardous duty pay, the military construction projects, and military health care.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer my views on this fast track proposal before the Senate. I have followed the debate very carefully. California has a significant stake on issues of international trade, an important engine driving the California economy today. 
In recent weeks, we have heard a great deal about fast track, often with broad, sweeping claims. Some have said those voting against fast track are protectionist, xenophobic or antitrade. Others have claimed fast track is the Sun, the Moon, and the stars. I want to take a few minutes to describe just what I think fast-track authority is all about. Fast track is the abrogation of congressional authority to have some leverage on trade agreements and the ability to offer amendments on the floor. 
This fast-track bill provides the President, for the remainder of his term, plus an optional extension, the authority to negotiate any trade treaty in the world and bring it rapidly to this body, without an opportunity to offer amendments. Article 1, section 8, of the U.S. Constitution gives the Congress responsibility over economic matters. Through fast track, we are effectively abrogating this responsibility. 
There is no State in this Nation that has a more important role on issues of trade than the State of California. The stakes are very high. 
California is the seventh largest economy on Earth. We are the economic powerhouse and the economic engine of the Nation, responsible for 13 percent of the Nation's economy and 20 percent of the Nation's export. 
Free and fair trade is an integral part of California's economic future. But free and fair trade can only be brought about through a level playing field, with everybody playing by the same rules. My job as a U.S. Senator is to stand up and articulate my State's interests when its needs and concerns are not being taken into consideration. Simply stated, fast track gives the President total authority to negotiate any trade agreement. 
Is fast track absolutely necessary? We have heard a great deal of comment and concern, calling for the passage of fast track: `We have to do it, we have to do it, you are un-American if we don't do it.' But the fact of the matter is this President has concluded 220 trade agreements, and only 2 of them, the GATT Uruguay round and the North American Free Trade Agreement, have required fast-track authority. 
In fact, other than GATT and NAFTA, there have only been three additional agreements in the Nation's history that have been adopted through the fast-track process: the Tokyo round of GATT in 1975, the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement in 1998 and the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement in 1989. These are the only five agreements in the history of our Nation that have been passed using the fast-track process. 
Yet we have seen exports increase in our country by 50 percent since 1991, without fast-track. Today, exports are 30 percent higher than they were in 1993. The trade growth and the trade agreements are occurring without fast-track authority. 
Now, it may well be if I were the President of the United States, I would want to have fast track, too. It would make my life simpler. I would not have to deal with a Congress that can sometimes be recalcitrant or difficult and, at our best, obstreperous, and at our worst, an actual impediment. 
However, the Senate is supposed to be a deliberative body and I feel sometimes no legislation is better than just any legislation. Yet with this fast track matter, we have seen a great rush. We are told we can't wait until next session or next year to have more thoughtful consideration on this issue. We have to do it right now. 
I must tell you, the stakes are very big for my State. Fast track forces me to give my authority to offer changes. I give up my ability to pick up the phone and tell the administration, `Hey, if you negotiate this, I'm going to try to amend it on the floor because it disadvantages industries in my State.' 
The bottom line is, I think, the argument that the United States can't negotiate trade agreements without fast track, based on the record, are incorrect. Senator Byron Dorgan has ably pointed out that the agreements that have been the subject of fast track, have been followed by a growing negative trade balance. Yet we can't do anything about it so we don't talk about it. 
Under NAFTA, a $1.7 billion trade surplus in 1993, after NAFTA's passage, grew to a record trade imbalance of $16.3 billion by 1996. Our trade deficit with Canada has also grown, more than doubling from $11 to $23 billion annually. 
We can't amend NAFTA, we can't change NAFTA. All we can do is give 6 months' notice and withdraw. The stakes are very big now, and withdrawal is not apt to happen politically. 
The GATT agreement, which I voted for, has contributed to the largest merchandise trade deficit in U.S. history, rising in each of the last 4 years to an all-time high of $165 billion today. 
I think these mounting trade deficits should be a loud and clear message that America should negotiate better trade deals rather than give up congressional responsibility through fast track. To me, these experiences say, `Go slow. Fast track may well backfire.' 
Yet, through fast track, we are saying we have to proceed quickly, we have to give up all scrutiny, we have to give up all right of amendment: do it fast, do it fast. 
I would like to discuss one area where we face significant concerns. Right now, the international financial markets are more complex than ever. Today's international trading picture is more diverse and complicated than ever before. Take, for example, the currency problems some Southeast Asian nations are experiencing, which may well create a very unanticipated result. 
Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund announced it is preparing an emergency line of credit for Indonesia. The Indonesian rupiah has dropped more than 18 percent against the dollar since late September. Thailand received a $17 billion loan from an IMF-led consortium in August, which represents the second largest IMF rescue package ever. 
Indonesia and Thailand now join the Philippines as Asia's former `economic tigers' who have looked for IMF emergency help due to financial crisis. As you may recall, following NAFTA, the United States extended the largest loan package to Mexico when it faced financial crisis and the peso was devalued. Much to Mexico's credit, this loan was promptly and fully repaid. 
Many knowledgeable people involved in the Pacific rim trading theater believe these currency fluctuations are very serious harbingers of things to come. In many of these countries, banking practices may also be a subject of concern, with loans extended to those with political clout, rather than the most worthy. These currency fluctuations may foreshadow major banking scandals in the future. 
If you combine questionable banking practices with currency fluctuations, we may see a scenario in which the only course open to some of these nations is for them to press harder to increase their exports and erect import barriers, regardless of what the trade agreements say. Further, the United States does not have a great record in enforcing many of the agreements that are on the books. As a result, U.S. manufacturers would lose exports and market share. 
Free and fair trade is an integral part of California's economic future. But under fast track, California's two Senators could very easily get rolled despite the State's enormous economic stake. Many States, each with two Senators, don't have nearly the economic interests that we do. My State could face an agreement that very much disadvantages California's industries, and I would have no opportunity to try to correct that. 
We are the leading agricultural State in the Union, home to 10 percent of the Nation's food processing employment. 
The California wine industry is the Nation's leader, producing 75 percent of the wine and 90 percent of the wine exports. 
We are the leading high-technology State, providing 20 percent of the Nation's jobs in high technology. 
We lead the Nation in entertainment, providing 50 percent of the Nation's production. 
We are home to 5 of the Nation's 10 largest software firms. We are the Nation's leader in biotechnical and pharmaceutical products, providing as much as 30 percent of the Nation's output. Yet, under fast track, I am asked to give up any opportunity to fight for my State's interests on the floor of the U.S. Senate if they are disadvantaged by a trade agreement negotiated by the administration. I cannot agree to those restrictions. 
Let me talk for a moment about specific concerns with S. 1269, the Finance Committee bill. I have listened intently to the debate other the past several weeks. I have scrutinized amendments which may be offered to this legislation. In my view, the major deficiencies in the fast-track legislation before the Senate have not been addressed. In some ways, the legislation before the Senate today is weaker in addressing those concerns than in prior fast-track laws. 
Under S. 1269, trade negotiations that involve issues such as protecting U.S. manufacturing, labor, or environmental standards, cannot be included in the fast-track process but will have to be dealt with separately where they could be the target of amendments, Senate filibusters, or bottled up in committee and never see the light of day. 
Let me give an example. Unlike previous fast-track laws, S. 1269 requires that a provision of a trade agreement, to be entitled to receive the protection of fast track, must be `directly related to trade.' 
Previous fast-track laws have provided fast-track benefits to those provisions of an agreement that `serve the interests of U.S. commerce' and are `necessary and appropriate' to carry out the agreement. 
So what is the practical effect of the changes? If a trade agreement included a component to fund border cleanup, these cleanup provisions could not be protected by fast-track rules because they are not considered `directly related to trade.' They would have to proceed through the regular legislative process, subject to amendments, filibusters, with no certainty the provisions would ever receive a vote. 
For example, NAFTA implementing legislation reduced tariffs in Mexico, Canada, and the United States and created the Border Environmental Cooperation Commission and the North American Development Bank to fund environmental cleanup. Although adopted in the NAFTA fast-track approval process, these two entities would not be eligible for fast-track if they were included in a future trade agreement brought under S. 1269's fast-track authority.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Texas. 
Madam President, I rise to oppose the Defense authorization conference report. I oppose this conference report because it contains language that will effectively ban any further public-private competition of depot workload at McClellan and Kelly Air Logistics Centers. If this restrictive depot language remains in the bill, the President has said he will veto the bill. A letter is already in the Record, signed by Office of Management and Budget Director Franklin Raines, to that effect. I will read the letter in part: 
The bill includes provisions whose intent is to protect public depots by limiting private industry's ability to compete for the depot-level maintenance of military systems and components. If enacted, these provisions, which run counter to the ongoing efforts by Congress and the Administration to use competition to improve DOD's business practices, would severely limit the Department's flexibility to increase efficiency and save taxpayer dollars. 
Both the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Panel recommended repeal of current laws constrain DOD's efforts to competitively outsource depot maintenance workload. Rather than facilitating DOD's use of competitive outsourcing, the bill attempts to further restrict it. 
This so-called compromise essentially puts an end to the Defense Department's plan to conduct public-private competitions for the depot work currently done at both Kelly and McClellan. The possibility for a private company to win one of these competitions is the cornerstone of each community's reuse plan that resulted from the Base Realignment and Closure Act which will close both of these bases at the turn of the century. 
Continuing to quote from Director Raines' letter: 
The bill seeks to impose unique and inappropriate requirements on DOD's process for allocating the work now performed at San Antonio and Sacramento Air Logistics Centers. The Department is conducting a fair and open competition to determine the most efficient and cost-effective way to perform this work in the future. Both private contractors and public depots are competing for the work. By dictating how DOD should treat certain competitive factors, this bill seeks to skew any competition in favor of the public depots. 
This skewing of the outcome of these ongoing public-private competitions is what is unacceptable, and we will fight it to the bitter end. 
We tried to work with the committee toward an agreement. At one time, the Senators from Texas and California thought we had succeeded in reaching an agreement with the committee. We were ready to buy half a loaf. There were four points we wanted, but the agreement we thought we had only contained 2 1/2 of those needs. We agreed to back off. Overnight those who wrote the bill put in technical language which essentially killed the ability for private contractors to bid. One of the ways they did it was by hiding their overhead costs. 
I think the Senators from Texas can well explain how this has happened in the past, and how great a disincentive this would be to any private company who might want to bid on our workloads. 
I find it amazing that this depot caucus language was still included, even after the first private-public competition held for Kelly's C-5 air work workload was won by Warner Robins Air Logistics Center in Georgia. 
Members of the Depot Caucus have complained from the first day these competitions were announced by the Air Force that they would be unfair and biased. They said that public depots could not possibly win. But Warner Robins won. How did this happen? 
One of the reasons is that public depots can hide their overhead in other accounts when they bid against private industry for work, and members of private industry on numerous occasions have said this is exactly why they cannot compete under current law. 
Warner Robins, as I understand it, took advantage of this ability to hide overhead costs to help make their bid below that of their private competitors. In fact, the Air Force had to add approximately $170 million to Warner Robins' bid for the 500 employees and other overhead that had been shifted to other accounts. 
The way the next two competitions are set up, under this bill, private industry will be very reluctant to bid, and probably will not bid, on the workloads at McClellan and Kelly. In fact, the Sacramento Bee quoted an industry representative who said, `I can't conceive of a company that would bid for McClellan and Kelly under these circumstances.' 
Supporters of the depot language say this is a compromise that will allow fair and open competitions at McClellan and Kelly. I say baloney. How can I or my colleagues from California and Texas believe that these competitions will be fair and open when one of the authors of this very language, a Senator from Oklahoma, believes that this language shuts the door on private industry's ability to compete. Quoted in the Daily Oklahoman he said, `I think it's highly unlikely any contractor would want to bid on it.' Now, how are my colleagues and I supposed to believe it is a fair compromise with statements like this? We need fair and open competition for the depot work at McClellan and Kelly. As Secretary Cohen has stated repeatedly, this language just does not provide it. 
We need to allow public-private competitions in order to achieve the kinds of savings necessary to reach the procurement levels needed to fund the modernization of our weapons systems. 
Madam President, I have much more to say, but in the interest of time let me say this.

We are open to a compromise. We are willing today to accept the very language that we thought we had agreed upon, which gave us the two and a half issues out of the four which would enable us to have public-private competition at these bases. In order for this to occur, we must return to the earlier compromise language, before the changes were made. 
Madam President, I cannot tell you what a big deal this is in Northern California. The entire community has been mobilized around this concept of possibly being able to privatize the workload. All we are asking for is fairness. All we are asking is that the deck not be stacked against us. All we are asking is that public depots not have the opportunity to fudge bids by hiding costs. This conference report denies that, and we have decided that we will use every avenue open to us to fight this bill until we either achieve a compromise or a veto.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the committee and I also thank the chairman of the committee. 
I was very pleased to hear the chairman's statement that it is his belief that Mr. Kennard possesses an `unblemished reputation' for candor and integrity. I appreciate his comments and believe they have been well stated. 
As California's Senator, I am particularly pleased to rise in support of the President's nomination. 
Bill Kennard has very strong California roots. He was born in Los Angeles. He graduated with honors from my alma mater, Stanford University. He then attended Yale Law School. 
Bill Kennard's family also has strong California roots. His father, Robert Kennard, now deceased, was a very well-regarded architect in the Los Angeles area. He formed the largest continuously operating African-American architectural practice in the western United States and also served as the founding member of the National Organization of Minority Architects. 
His mother, I want this body to know, is also a distinguished person. She grew up in the great Central Valley of California. She received a master's degree in bilingual education and has worked in the field of bilingual education in Los Angeles. 
The President's nomination is, in fact, a historic one. Following his confirmation, he will be the first African-American to serve as FCC Commissioner in the history of the United States. He is well prepared for the challenges ahead of him. He has a broad telecommunications background in both the public and the private sector and an impressive range of experiences that, I believe, will serve him well and serve the Nation well. 
Since 1993, as the chairman mentioned, Bill Kennard has served as FCC general counsel. He has represented the Commission before the courts and served as its principal legal advisor. In that capacity, he has defended the commission well. 
Bill Kennard was a partner in the Washington law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand, specializing in communications law. He has served as assistant general counsel of the National Association of Broadcasters. 
I also know that he has been involved in the needs of his community here in Washington and has served on the board of a nonprofit homeless shelter. 
With this committee's leadership, the Congress was able to pass the most comprehensive communications legislation since passage of the 1934 Communications Act, upgrading our telecommunications law to address modern telecommunications needs. 
The 1996 act sought to develop a regulatory framework that provides the benefit of competition for consumers, spurs the development of new products and reduces costs, while it also removes unnecessary regulatory barriers. 
Congress has set the stage for a new telecommunications era, and we need to ensure that that law is implemented properly and that it works fairly for consumers. I think that, as FCC general counsel, Bill Kennard has the experience to help see these reforms through. 
I happen to believe he will be an independent and a strong voice, yet responsive to the concerns that the distinguished chairman has pointed out. I am pleased to add a California voice and to support this distinguished nominee. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. 
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill. 
This conference report contains both authorization and appropriations for the all-important Headwaters Forest acquisition in northern California. 
Mr. President, California's ancient redwood forests are among our Nation's most valued treasures, which is why the battle to preserve them has reached a fever pitch in recent years. 
The Headwaters Forest, nearly 3,000 acres located in Humboldt County, is one of the last remaining ancient redwood groves still in private hands. The land is owned by the Pacific Lumber Co., which is owned by the Maxxam Corp. 
Over the past decade there have been over a dozen attempts to save this ancient redwood grove. All have failed. 
Five attempts at Federal legislation failed. 
Three attempts at State legislation failed. 
Three statewide bond measures to raise funds to acquire the redwoods were rejected by California voters. 
Two State legislative measures to reform California forestry regulations, one that would have restricted logging on private lands, and another that some said was not restrictive enough, both failed. 
With the background, last year I was asked to see if I could facilitate an agreement between the property owner and the State and Federal Governments. After more than 100 hours of intense negotiations, an agreement was reached for the State of California and the Federal Government to jointly purchase the Headwaters Forest from Pacific Lumber Co. 
Under the Headwaters agreement, the governments will purchase the 3,000-acre Headwaters Forest and the 425-acre Elkhead Springs Grove, plus nearly 4,000 additional acres of adjacent land to serve as a buffer. In all, approximately 7,500 acres would be acquired and protected. 
The price under the Headwaters agreement is $380 million, of which the Federal Government will contribute $250 million and the State will contribute $130 million. 
Without the Federal funding to complete this agreement, there is no agreement. And if there is no agreement, the Pacific Lumber Co. will proceed with its huge taking lawsuit against the Federal Government for the cost of any regulations that prevent the company from logging its old growth redwoods. In the end, the real losers will be the American taxpayers who will possibly pay even more if Pacific Lumber wins its taking lawsuit. That is why this conference report is so important. It provides the $250 million federal share for Headwaters. 
Specifically, this Headwaters package includes: Appropriation of $250 million for the Federal purchase of the Headwaters Forest; appropriation of $10 million for a payment to Humboldt County, CA; and a prohibition on the expenditure of $250 million for 180 days from date of enactment. 
This will allow a period of time for the authorizing committees to review the issues associated with the Headwaters transaction and recommend any changes in the authorization if necessary. The funding will be available at the end of the 180 days. 
The conference report also provides an authorization to purchase the Headwaters Forest. While many believe the Department of the Interior has more than sufficient authority to acquire the property, I know that others disagree and have insisted on authorizing legislation. The authorization is contained in this conference report. 
Specifically, this bill authorizes the Headwaters acquisition with the following conditions: The State of California provides $130 million for its share of the costs, the State of California approves a sustained yield plan for the Pacific Lumber Co. property, a habitat conservation plan is approved and an incidental take permit is issued to Pacific Lumber, an appraisal of the lands to be acquired is done and reviewed by the Comptroller General, Pacific Lumber Co. dismisses its lawsuit against the Federal Government, a report is made to Congress on applicable HCP standards, Humboldt County is eligible for payment in lieu of taxes [PILT] payments for Federal lands acquired, 50 percent of management costs in excess of $100,000 will come from non-Federal sources, development of a management plan, with consideration of management by a trust, and expiration of the authorization on March 1, 1999. 
If asked, is this authorization exactly what I would have drafted, the answer is no. But it gets the job done. And that is what is important. 
I firmly believe that the Headwaters agreement is our last best hope to preserve these magnificent ancient redwoods. I urge my colleagues to approve this conference report.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of my colleagues in the Senate what I believe to be a building environmental crisis in southern California, and that has to do with the Salton Sea. Let me begin by telling you what the Salton Sea is. The modern day Salton Sea is often referred to as the largest manmade water body in California. It was formed in late 1905 as a result of a break in a temporary levy along the Colorado River. For a period of about 16 months after the breach, the Colorado River flowed into the below-sea-level depression then known as the `Salton sink,' filling it to a depth of more than 80 feet above its lowest elevation. Since that time, the water level in the sea has been seeking a balance between desert forces that extract water as a product of evaporation and the inflows of water from surface and subsurface sources. The Salton Sea is about 350 square miles. It is 35 miles long, it has 115 miles of shoreline, and it is 15 miles wide. It is a big body of water. Today, the depth is about 51 feet, and I believe it is about 234 feet below sea level. 
This lake was originally a freshwater lake. It is now dying because of a confluence of events. It is the combination of the rising salinity levels caused by the evaporation I just mentioned--and the body of water is now 25 percent saltier than the ocean--plus major disease outbreaks and other up to this point identified as unknown causes that scientists believe are linked to millions of gallons of polluted agricultural drainage as well as chemical wastes coming out of Mexicali. Now, these wastes flow from the Alamo and the New Rivers, which go from Mexico, flow north, and empty into this huge body of water. The body of water is best known as being between Palm Springs and the Mexican border. It is near the areas we considered for the Desert Protection Act, and originally it was hoped that it would be a major recreation area. As a matter of fact, it was hoped that about $500 million a year in revenues would be produced because of recreational and job opportunities. Instead, it is now just a dreadful situation. 
The two rivers I just mentioned, the New River and Alamo River, account for about 78 percent of the water replenishment of the Salton Sea. The Whitewater River on the northern end also dumps agricultural runoff into the Salton Sea. I first visited the area in 1990 when I was in El Centro. I remember going to the banks of the New River and there were workers there, volunteers, picking up rubbish along the riverside. They had on elbow-high gloves. I asked the question, `Why do you wear these gloves?' They told me that even above the gloves they would get blisters when they worked around the area. So in 1990 something was going on. It has gotten a lot worse since then. 
In 1996, pathogenic micro-organisms were identified in the sea's environment, and that includes the New River. Among them were the organisms capable of causing polio, typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis. Also, concerns about public health from disease-causing agents have resulted in the issuance of public health advisories warning of the dangers of eating fish caught in the sea. 
Because of its diverse ecosystem, the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge has been ranked among the top 10 of our Nation's 510 national refuges. It is of critical importance to the western region because of its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and Mexico. It is a key component in the Pacific flyway for millions of migratory water birds that rest at that refuge on their annual journeys to and from Canada and South America. So birds that touch down there may well also be dying elsewhere. However, an increased frequency and severity of massive die-offs of thousands of waterfowl and shore birds and millions of fish have been occurring in the Salton Sea in recent years, and it's threatening the existence now of the entire regional ecosystem. 
The size of the calamity is mind-boggling. The mortality toll includes birds from every one of the species that visit the sea, including the endangered California brown pelican, with which I happen to be particularly enamored. 
The degradation of the Salton Sea ecosystem is also taking a toll on the economy of the surrounding area, and we have seen economic values drop off precipitously. There are some who believe it is too late to save the Salton Sea because the problems are too complex and too large. I don't share that point of view, and I am asking this body's support for increased efforts to address the sea's problems to prevent further degradation of this environmentally rich ecosystem and to preserve it for all time. 
Let me quickly mention a brief chronology of happenings. In 1992, more than 150,000 waterfowl, known as eared grebes, died from an undiagnosed cause. In 1996, a severe botulism outbreak killed more than 15,000 birds, including more than 1,400 endangered brown pelicans. About 15 percent of the western race of the North American white pelican have perished in the last 2 years. That is 15 percent of the entire white pelican population of the west coast. 
Earlier this year, an outbreak of Newcastle disease decimated an entire nesting colony of nearly 2,000 double-crested cormorants. The destruction of the cormorant nesting colony on a small island less than 100 yards long, which had been popular with the birds, shows how quickly death comes in this area. One week the island was alive with the sounds and sights of hundreds of nesting waterfowl, of eggs hatching and new fledglings checking out their surroundings. The next week they were all dead, every one of them. Today, all that is left are the skeletal remains and the rotting carcasses that dot the island. 
It is a macabre, tragic scene, as I think some of these photos begin to show. This is a bird skeleton in a nest. Right here you can see one of the bird skeletons and a baby carcass in the sand with a nearby pen, just to show you the size. There are just a few in this photo, but they dot the whole landscape. 
The birds died in their nests or where they collapsed in the sand, unable to fly or walk. So the scenes you see are depicted all over the island. Two of my staff members visited the Salton Sea recently--just a couple of weeks ago--and had to carefully pick their steps in order to avoid stepping on dead birds. 
Equally tragic is the sight of birds stricken with botulism which affects the nervous system. First they lose their ability to fly, and then the ability to stand upright or walk. Lastly, as the deadly disease progresses they become completely paralyzed and can no longer raise their heads, and they drown or they die of starvation. 
So the task of rescuing sick and dying birds and cleaning up the endless stream of carcasses is being handled by dedicated men and women of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge in Imperial County. I have the utmost respect for their work. 
Since last March, they have been bringing in boatloads--often three times a week--of stricken birds and carcasses of the dead that have been picked up throughout the sea. The death toll as of October 22 for this year stood at 6,792 birds, including 234 endangered California brown pelicans. The White pelican held by refuge worker, Marcos Orozco, rescued a week or so ago, and the other sick birds in the boat may have a chance to survive. They are the lucky ones who will undergo emergency treatment at the refuge's recently completed hospital in an attempt to stabilize them until they can be transferred to a volunteer organization's rehab facility in Orange County. If successful there they will be released back to the wild. 
Let's talk about the brown pelican that you see dead in this photograph. And you see part of the Salton Sea here with this small island and vastness behind it. Last year more than 1,400 of these birds perished in the waters and on the mud flats of the sea. For refugee worker Orozco, it was the first time in his 26-year career at the Salton Sea that he had seen a die-off of brown pelicans. However, the deaths are continuing, and the prospects are not good. 
`It is not a pretty sight,' notes refuge manager Clark Bloom who has observed grown persons breaking down and crying when they witnessed the sick and dying birds. 
My big concern here is that not enough is being done. And I am almost as sure as I am standing here that it is only a question of time before some of these micro-organisms also begin to impact people as well. Right now it is birds. But if it were people, I think the shouts would be deafening. 
And it is hard for me to imagine what 1 million dead fish floating on the surface of this lake must look like. But for Ken Sturm, the wildlife biologist at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, the scene is one he will not forget. 
He reported that the lifeless mass of Tilapia, a popular sport fish which he observed at the northern end of the sea, extended more than 3 miles in length. That was on September 8, about 6 weeks ago. But that isn't the beginning nor the end. On September 24, another floating mass of at least 1,000 dead fish was spotted at the southern end of the refuge. 
Scenes like this are commonplace along many shoreline areas, and in much larger numbers, I am sorry to say. A parasite which affects the gills of the fish is a prime suspect in some of the fish die-offs, but more scientific research is needed to pinpoint the exact cause. 
Another suspect which some experts believe could trigger conditions leading to the fish kills is a purplish algae like that shown in this photo. It doesn't look like much. But they believe 
it is a potentially deadly algae. I would hazard a guess that it probably comes from some chemical waste. 
There are some bright spots. 
The first, of course, is the staff of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. They have been doing a truly commendable job. However, they need additional resources, including boats and personnel, in order to respond adequately. 
Also, the Pacific wildlife project in Orange County, a volunteer group, deserves commendation. Ninety percent of the birds that are rescued would have perished without their care. 
Also noteworthy is the fact that private groups, agencies, and businesses in the area have contributed to date more than $60,000 this year in cash and services to finance construction of a field hospital for sick birds at the Federal refuge. Whether the sick white pelicans in the refuge that you see in the photo here make it or not is unknown. They have just been brought in from the sea and given emergency treatment, and we will see if they survive. 
While these efforts are underway, the Federal Government and others are analyzing projects for restoration of the Salton Sea. This is where it gets very complicated. 
The Bureau of Reclamation in September of this year issued its final draft on the Salton Sea which evaluated 54 alternatives to improve the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the sea. Five of those alternatives will be now considered further. The problem is no one agrees. 
The recently enacted 1998 Energy and Water appropriations bill includes $400,000 for the Bureau of Reclamation to continue its research project. 
The conference report in the fiscal year 1998 VA-HUD and independent agencies appropriations bill includes $6 million in the EPA's budget for continued research on the Salton Sea--now you are beginning to see the number of agencies that are coming into this--including $1 million for the University of Redlands and $5 million for the Salton Sea Authority.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
The first letter is to Frank Raines of OMB asking that 2 million additional dollars in fiscal year 1999 be included, and giving the rationale for those inclusions. 
I have received a letter dated October 20 indicating--and I thank him very much for that--that OMB is reviewing the request. 
I also have a letter dated September 23 to Bruce Babbitt of the Interior, and to John Bernal of the International Boundary and Water Commission. I have received no response to either of these letters. 
It is my view that the Department of the Interior should take this off of the back burner and put it on the front burner. And I would respectfully suggest that they utilize the same club-fed methodology that they have used I think with great success in handling California's water problems. This is where the Secretary of the Interior really takes the responsibility to pull together all of the disparate groups into a kind of working commitment to see that the right thing is done. 
My concern is that the die-off could continue for years, and the chemical and agricultural wastes continue to interface. 
If you fly above this river you will see where the river leaches out a crystalline substance into the agricultural heartland of the Imperial Valley. You will see where it directly abuts green field row crops. This I think is the potential danger in terms of the future for people working in that area, not only for blisters but also for something potentially much more serious. 
So I am hoping that Secretary Babbitt will elevate this into a club-fed effort and that we can really get cracking. 
The House Subcommittee on Water and Power also held an oversight hearing in Palm Desert on October 3 of this year, a few weeks ago, helping to focus national and regional attention on the Salton Sea and the need for action. However, as I said, at this time there is no agreement on a plan. And the critical research must be done. But what is clear to me is that it must be expedited. We now have a die-off that has been going on throughout this decade, and is escalating. We now have identified microorganisms which yield typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis, and other diseases in what is a 350-square-mile body of water which is polluted in a major and very sad way. 
So the longer a solution is delayed, Mr. President, the worse the situation will become. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to weigh in on the provisions included in the VA-HUD conference report regarding the health care needs of Northern California's veterans. The conference report provides a total of $70.8 million for renovations to the existing McClellan Air Force Hospital at Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento, as well as for outpatient clinics in Fairfield, Mare Island, Martinez, Auburn, Chico, Eureka, and Merced. While I applaud this much-needed expansion of services in Northern California, I remain deeply disappointed by Congress' decision not to build a veterans hospital at Travis Air Force Base. 
Since 1991, veterans in Northern California have been waiting for a new hospital to replace the Martinez hospital, which was closed for seismic reasons. I made a commitment with Vice President Gore to help bring a full veterans hospital to Fairfield, and I have been fighting for 4 years to get this project fully funded. Two previous Congresses appropriated funding to construct the Travis VA Hospital. 
Now, unfortunately, we are turning our back on that commitment. It is truly a sad day when the men and women who have served our country without question--and who have the right to expect their government to fulfill its promises--are simply told `tough luck.' 
The fact is that a clear majority in Congress oppose the hospital's construction. This opposition has only grown stronger after two independent reports--one by the General Accounting Office and one by Price Waterhouse--concluded that the Travis VA hospital was not justified. Key Committee chairmen in both the House and Senate have made it clear that Congress will provide no Federal funds for a replacement hospital at Travis. 
The VA-HUD conference report does appropriate $70.8 million for veterans' health care needs in Northern California, including: 
A sharing agreement between VA and the Department of Defense for 100 VA beds at David Grant Medical Center at Travis. These beds will be serviced by VA doctors. 
A new $13.5 million VA clinic, to be built adjacent to David Grant Medical Center. This clinic will include emergency room facilities, ambulatory surgery, mental health, some specialty services, and offices for doctors. 
Conversion of McClellan Hospital at Mather Air Force Base to a VA Hospital. This will provide 55 new VA beds. 
Upgrades to the VA outpatient clinics at Mare Island and Martinez. 
New outpatient clinics in Auburn, Chico, Eureka and Merced. 
Contracts with community hospitals in Martinez and Redding. 
While this plan does not fulfill the promise that the VA made to Solano County veterans and does not establish the hospital that veterans groups like Operation VA fought so hard for so long to obtain, when examined in light of the position of current congressional leaders, it does provide health care for many veterans who presently cannot access the VA system. The new outpatient clinics and additional hospital beds will make it far easier for veterans in Northern California to benefit from the VA health system. For the first time, vets living along the North Coast and in the Sierra will have real and meaningful access to the VA. They will not have to drive for 4 hours or more for basic care. Their visits to the five new VA outpatient clinics will undoubtedly result in higher utilization of the VA inpatient facilities at Travis and Mather Air Force Bases. 
I know that the people of Solano County have a lot of unanswered questions about the VA proposal, and I pledge that I will work with them to make sure that VA offers the high quality and accessibility of care that our veterans deserve. I am sure that groups like Operation VA will continue to fight for improved veterans health care in Northern California, and I am proud to join in that fight.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Finance Committee recently approved fast-track authority for the President. I thought I might come to the floor and express some of my very serious concerns about this proposal. 
Let me begin by saying to those who would paint every Member of Congress who has a problem with the fast track proposal with some broad brush calling us protectionists or xenophobic. I, for one, am not. 
Trade is very important to my State. California is the seventh largest economy on Earth, and we produce 20 percent of the Nation's exports. Exports are one of the largest growing economic sectors in my State. More than 1 million jobs in California are directly related to trade, and that number is growing. So I see free and fair trade as an integral part of California's economic future, and it is my responsibility as a U.S. Senator representing that State to see that the concerns and issues and industries of my State are protected in agreements, or at least as nearly as I can do so. 
As I see it, America already has the most open markets in the world, but the problem is that this openness isn't reciprocated by many of our trading partners, and that brings us to the present situation. 
Article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives Members of this body constitutional responsibility for matters of trade and the economy. Fast track is essentially a surrendering, an abrogation, of those constitutional responsibilities provided to this body by the Constitution of the United States. I, for one, see no reason why we should surrender that. 
Essentially, fast track is simply the ability of the administration to negotiate a trade agreement, then bring it quickly to the Congress, get it ratified within a specific period 
of time, without congressional opportunity to amend it in any way, shape, or form. 
The administration claims that fast track authority is needed to keep our economy growing strong, to allow our companies to compete with those of the European Union and Japan in growing markets such as South America and the Pacific Rim and to maintain America's symbolic commitment to free trade by letting the President negotiate agreements without fear that Congress is going to mettle in any of the details. 
In my view, that argument flies in the face of reality. Since President Clinton has taken office, 220 trade agreements have been negotiated with foreign nations. Only two of those required fast track. 
In recent years, U.S. exports have been the strength of the economy. U.S. exports increased 50 percent since 1991 without fast track. Today, exports are 30 percent higher than in 1993. 
According to trade data released by the International Monetary Fund, United States exports to Brazil, South America's richest market, grew 56 percent from 1994 to 1995. During that same period, the European Union's exports to Brazil grew only 8 percent, while Japan's exports grew only 18 percent. This growth in U.S. exports has occurred without fast track authority. As a recent Wall Street Journal article citing the IMF data, pointed out, U.S. exporters hardly seem handicapped without fast track. 
So arguments that the United States cannot negotiate trade agreements without fast track I think are specious. Further, to argue that without fast track the United States risks losing the jobs that come with robust trade begs the question of how previous fast-track agreements have fared in this regard. 
Once again, I did not vote for NAFTA, but NAFTA was my first experience with fast track. Once spurned, hopefully twice learned. Under NAFTA, the United States $1.7 billion trade surplus with Mexico in 1993 became a record trade deficit of $16.3 billion by 1996. 
The balance of trade has gone exactly the wrong way. 
Our balance of trade with Canada has also grown, more than doubling from $11 billion to $23 billion annually. 
Let us look at GATT, another important trade agreement. The GATT agreement has contributed to the largest merchandise trade deficit in U.S. history. Today, it is at an all-time high of $165 billion. 
I think these experiences combine to present an eloquent statement that says: Go slow. Fast track may well backfire. In the future it may not be as desirable as some claim. 
If we look at the currency problems in certain southeast Asian countries, we can identify some of their trade strategies. I think what happens, as a result of some of the financial problems, is these countries push for more exports to our country and they close their markets to our products. This is a very real danger signal for the future. I think it indicates that as a nation we should go slow. We need to be very careful and deliberate in these negotiations. 
The Commerce Department estimates that every $1 billion in exports equals between 14,000 and 15,000 jobs. Based on that calculation alone, the United States has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs as a result of these trade deficits. The administration claims a modest increase in U.S. net exports as a result of NAFTA, but the jury is still out. 
These mounting trade deficits should be a loud and clear message that America should negotiate better trade deals, rather than give up congressional responsibility through fast track. 
The bottom line is that Members of Congress are being asked to forfeit our ability to offer amendments to any trade agreement with no guarantee that the major industries of our States will not be disadvantaged by those agreements. Under fast track, Congress is left with no recourse except to vote against the whole agreement. 
The President tried to address some of these concerns in the proposal he sent to Congress. But the goals and objectives of the President's fast track proposal are still just that--goals and objectives. Previous fast track agreements have demonstrated why this is just not good enough. 
For me, a Californian, NAFTA was a big case in point: 
NAFTA had an immediate negative impact on the California wine industry. The California wine industry produces 90 percent of our Nation's wine and 90 percent of the wine exported by the United States. 
Coincident with NAFTA, Mexico gave Chilean wines an immediate tariff reduction from 20 percent to 8 percent and a guarantee of duty-free status within a year. By contrast, United States wines face a 10-year phaseout of a much higher Mexican tariff, leaving U.S. wines at a significant disadvantage in the Mexican market. It is actually a wipeout of our market share of wine in Mexico. 
The result of this tariff inequity was predictable. Exports of all U.S. wines to Mexico have dropped by one-third since NAFTA went into effect, while Chilean wine exports to Mexico have nearly doubled. The size of the Chilean gains virtually match the size of U.S. losses. Chilean wine picked up the market share lost by the U.S. wineries, dominated by California. 
During the NAFTA debate in Congress, the administration pledged to correct these tariff inequities within 120 days of NAFTA's approval. Let me quote from a letter to Members of Congress from then U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor dated November 8, 1993:  
Pursuant to your request, you have my personal commitment that, within 120 days of the coming into force of NAFTA, I will personally negotiate the immediate reduction of Mexican tariffs on US wines to the level of Mexican tariffs on Chilean wines and, thereafter, have them fall parallel with future reductions in such tariffs. 
I personally talked with Mr. Kantor at least three or four times on this issue. I also talked with the President, as well as others in the White House. This was a glaring discrepancy, and the 
whole administration made a commitment to correct the discrepancy. 
You would think that at least by today, 3 years later, the tariffs would be parallel. But 3 1/2 years later, these inequities remain enshrined in the agreement. As a matter of fact, as the result of an unrelated trade dispute, Mexico actually raised tariffs on United States wine back up to pre-NAFTA levels of 20 percent, increasing the tariff from the 14 percent it had reached under NAFTA. Rather than drop to zero within 10 years, the tariff is now 20 percent, a wipeout for an American market share. 
Another product of fast track, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT, also contained monumental inequities that seriously disadvantaged California's wine industry. Prior to the Uruguay round of GATT, major wine competitors had wine tariffs that were almost four times the United States tariff on an ad valorem basis. 
But, even though the United States had the lowest tariffs of any major wine producer, United States negotiators agreed in the Uruguay round to drop United States tariffs by 36 percent over 6 years, while the world's largest wine producer, the EU, dropped its tariffs by 10 percent. As a result, the current U.S. tariff on all wine products is an average of 2.4 percent. That is far lower than the EU's current average tariff of 13 percent.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have some very specific concerns about fast track that are not adequately addressed in the current proposal. 
First, tariff inqequities: As I said, the United States is already the most open market in the world. But our trade agreements have sometimes disadvantaged American industries by not requiring a level playing field with other nations. All too often, the price of modest tariff reductions elsewhere has been further reductions in the already low U.S. tariffs. 
Any future agreements should require that other countries meet our tariff level before we agree to lower our tariffs further. Any fast-track proposal would have to address this issue before winning my support. 
There should also be stronger enforcement mechanisms included when trade barriers are not lowered as provided for in an agreement. Half the problems with previous trade agreements have stemmed from nonenforcement. A recent report from the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan said more effort must be dedicated to enforcing existing agreements. 
For example, Europe simply did not accept the GATT commitments on audio visual services, instead, maintaining its 1989 European Union Broadcast Directive. This EU directive limits the market for U.S. movies and TV broadcasting. 
Another example is an agreement signed with China in May of this year which grants the United States access to Chinese markets for table grapes. However, despite the agreement, China maintains a 55 percent tariff on United States table grapes, presenting a significant barrier to United States exports. 
Second, phytosanitary standards: 
In addition to tariff inequities, disagreements over phytosanitary standards continue, and are often used as de facto trade barriers. For example: Japan's stringent tests for pesticides on American nectarines, cherries, and other fruit continues to deny market access for United States products. 
Another example is Chile: The United States imported 1 billion trays of fresh vegetables from Chile during the 1996-97 growing year, while the United States exported no similar products to Chile during its growing year--why?--because of Chile's phytosanitary restrictions on imports of United States poultry, fruit, and vegetables, which has effectively banned all imports of these goods. 
The President's fast track proposal--section 2(b)(6)(C)(iii)--states that unjustified phytosanitary restrictions should be eliminated, but there is no language requiring that scientifically based standards be established before a trade agreement can be signed. 
Third, dispute resolution: The previous free trade agreement with Canada, and the NAFTA agreement, established a process for resolving disputes. But the process does not always work. For example: 
California growers have complained in the past about Mexican inspectors being unavailable at the border, so shipments are delayed. 
There is also no timely method of solving a dispute within a matter of hours. This is important when perishable goods are sitting at a border or a port warehouse awaiting a decision. 
A bigger problem now is that if a Mexican inspector finds a pest and does not know whether that pest is subject to quarantine, it reportedly takes a week for the inspector to find out. No shipper can leave fruit sitting at the border for a week. 
In January of last year, Mexico shipped over 8,000 boxes of brussels sprouts to the United States market causing the price to drop literally in half. This product dumping caused the price to drop to a level from which the brussel sprout industry could not recover during that season. 
The dispute resolution process needs to be strengthened to include a mechanism for swift resolution--within 48 hours--when a dispute involves perishable commodities. 
Fourth, environmental standards: I agree with many of my colleagues that we should not encourage a race to the bottom, in which the country with the weakest environmental protection wins the prize of economic growth. 
We all know that pollution knows no geographic boundaries. U.S. commitment to preserving the quality of our environment should be as vigorous as our commitment to open markets, and that commitment should be reflected in our trade agreements to the greatest extent possible. 
For example, large numbers of American companies have located in Mexico. The pollution from these companies goes into the New River, which flows north into the United States, terminating at the Salton Sea. I have flown over the New River, and I have seen first hand the extent of the pollution which is killing the Salton Sea. No companies in the United States can do what is being done in Mexicali. 
Also, Mexican farmers have access to pesticides and other chemicals that are not available to American growers. These disparities will only increase as we enforce our own laws. 
California growers will soon face an uneven playing field regarding the use of methyl bromide, a widely used soil and post-harvest fumigant. Under the Clean Air Act, the United States is phasing out the use of methyl bromide by 2001, but our trading partners will continue to use the chemical. Moreover, many of our trading partners require our growers to fumigate their crops with methyl bromide before the commodity is shipped. 
U.S. requirements to control particulate matter will add costs to U.S. producers, while no comparable requirements are being imposed on many of our trading partners. 
Our trade agreements should encourage our trading partners to live up to the highest environmental standards, not put added pressure on American companies to lower our standards. 
Fifth, manufacturing base and labor standards: I also share the concern raised by many of my Democratic colleagues that we need to be particularly careful to protect our manufacturing base, and not undermine labor standards, as we negotiate new trade agreements. 
At one point, California was home to six automobile manufacturing plants, but today we are reduced to one. Once we lose our manufacturing capacity, I am very concerned it will be very difficult if not impossible to reclaim. 
Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, made a blunt assessment of the situation: he said America will cease to be a world power if it loses its manufacturing base. I wholeheartedly agree. 
Service jobs, like energy and transportation services--which have fueled much of my State's economic rebound--are important, but can't compensate for the loss of higher-wage manufacturing jobs in this country. And if we lose our manufacturing base, we lose the service jobs, technology advances, and innovation that go with it. 
U.S. manufacturers already face enormous pressure to relocate manufacturing capability abroad to meet the regulatory and competitive demands of foreign nations. 
The Semiconductor Industry Association, representing the makers of computers chips, says 30 percent of their investment abroad is due to chipmakers' desire to avoid high tariffs or meet a foreign government's requirement that manufacturing be done in their country, in order to sell in an otherwise closed market. 
For example: China's $3 billion semiconductor market is growing rapidly. But they have a closed market, imposing high tariffs unless the manufacturer builds a plant in their country. 
This is a $132 billion worldwide market and is expected to reach $245 billion market by the year 2000. California is the Nation's leading chip producing State, so this is enormously important to my State. 
U.S. trade agreements must aggressively tear down the trade restrictions that force U.S. manufacturers overseas. 
U.S. manufacturers often cannot compete with foreign countries on wage costs. 
One of the arguments advanced by NAFTA supporters was the expansion of trade will boost the economies of our trading partners--and theoretically their wages--and expand the demand for our products in return. However, based on our NAFTA experience, the theory has not materialized. 
According to the Labor Department, the wage gap between United States and Mexico workers is widening, rather than narrowing. In 1993, Mexican wages were 15 percent of those in the United States. Today, they are 8 percent. 
This decline in wages is not solely the effect of the Mexican peso crisis. In 1994--before the peso collapse--real hourly wages in Mexico had already dropped to nearly 30 percent below their 1980 level--UC-Berkeley sociologist Harley Shaiken. 
Mexico's financial problems only exacerbated the trend. Since 1994, real wages in Mexico have dropped another 25 percent to roughly half their 1980 level. 
Clearly, NAFTA has not yet improved the wages of Mexican labor. 
Conclusion: Any fast track legislation must contain the following assurances: 
There must be a mechanism for swift and effective dispute resolutions. 
There must be language included stipulating that any agreement negotiated under fast track must set equal tariffs between the United States and our trading partners before the United States agrees to lower tariffs further. 
There must be mandatory mutual acceptance of scientifically-sound phytosanitary standards. 
There must be enforceable environmental standards in place. 
And there must be labor and wage provisions, and aggressive reduction of trade barriers, to protect our manufacturing future. 
Without these assurances written into the bill, I am very concerned that extension of fast track authority would give away, once again, the only ability I have as a U.S. Senator to influence trade agreements to see that they are responsive to the concerns of my State and important industries. 
Until these concerns are addressed, Mr. President, I must oppose any extension of fast-track authority.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, about 2 weeks ago it came to my attention that several countries may be exporting semiautomatic assault weapons into this country despite the 1968 Gun Control Act, which limits the importation of these weapons. 
When I asked the ATF to explain why these weapons were granted import permits, I learned that ATF, in the last few years, has not applied--or at least has not been consistent in applying--a standard of review for importation of weapons set by Congress under the 1968 Gun Control Act, a standard which has been specifically applied to semiautomatic rifles and shotguns since 1984. 
The Gun Control Act of 1968 allows importation of only those types of firearms `generally recognized as particularly suitable for, or readily adaptable to, sporting purposes.'

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, a woman who devoted most of her life to improving the lives of others lost her battle with cancer recently, and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the accomplishments and the contributions of this extraordinary woman. 
Angie Martin struggled with the dreaded disease of breast cancer for the past 5 years. She died on August 31 at her home in Sausalito, CA, and a memorial service will be held here in Washington, DC on Monday, September 29. The many people who knew Angie know that this memorial will not be in mourning for her death, but in celebration of a life of service to others. 
The world is filled with passionate idealists. Angie was of the rarer breed of people who also had the ability to inspire passion in others. Rarer still was her talent for turning those passionate ideas into action. Her efforts were always aimed at improving the lives of others, the most rare gift of all. 
Angie Martin pioneered grassroots organizing techniques, establishing a vital link between citizen action and social change, and created a model for grassroots and political campaigns nationwide. Working with consumer advocate Ralph Nader in Connecticut in the early 1970's, Angie helped to create the first ever citizens lobby devoted to environmental and consumer issues. She worked to improve conditions for migrant workers in New York state, and organized the highly acclaimed 1986 Hands Across America event to build awareness for the cause of hunger and homelessness in the United States. 
Together with her friend and partner, Gina Glantz, Angie took on some of our Nation's toughest issues: homelessness, hunger, migrant workers, gun violence, teen pregnancy. Her counsel was valued by many of our Nation's most prominent leaders, including Senator Ted Kennedy and Vice President Walter Mondale. 
Angie battled her disease with the same conviction and courage she brought to fighting for causes she believed in. Her legacy will live on in the lives of those she worked with, and in the lives of those she helped through her passionate efforts over the last three decades. 
My thoughts and prayers are with her husband, Gene Eidenberg, and daughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. I know many of my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to this remarkable woman, by continuing the fight to find a cure for breast cancer and for all cancers, and by continuing to address the important issues for which she dedicated her life's work.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, S. 830, the bill before us today, will improve the tools used by the Federal Food and Drug Administration to bring more, safe and effective drugs, biologics and medical devices to the American people more quickly. 
FDA is one of our Government's most important agencies because FDA approves life-saving medicines and devices and FDA protects us from unsafe and ineffective medicines and devices. Thanks to FDA, products like defective heart pacemakers, dangerous intrauterine devices, and overheating infant incubators are not sold. 
FDA's 2,100 scientists and 7,000 other employees monitor about $1 trillion worth of products each year, inspect over 15,000 facilities a year, and examine about 80,000 product samples. FDA finds about 3,000 products a year unfit for consumers and detains 30,000 imports a year at ports of entry.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Section 807 of the committee substitute for S. 830 prohibits State and local governments from establishing or continuing--for nonprescription drugs, any requirement that is different from, in addition to or otherwise not identical to a Federal requirement; for cosmetics, any requirements for packaging and labeling that are different from, in addition to or otherwise not identical to a Federal requirement. This includes any requirement relating to public information or any other form of public communication relating to a warning of any kind for a nonprescription drug. 
My State, California, has a long history of regulating nonprescription drugs and cosmetics and I would like to ask the bill manager's to engage in a colloquy with me to clarify his intent and the language of the bill. 
The California Department of Health Services in a September 12 letter expressed their concern that they would have to request interpretations from FDA. They wrote: `For interpretation of Federal requirements, and in order to determine if a State conflict exists, it will be necessary for States to continually request from the Federal Government an interpretation of their requirements and both Federal and State legal review of those interpretations.' 
Could you explain the bill's intent?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. According to California officials, a number of requirements now in force in California could be considered to be in addition to Federal law under this bill and therefore could be preempted. 
The first area relates to public warning requirements. The California Department of Health Services maintains that the bill would likely prohibit State-initiated public health warnings. 
California DHS asked, for example, if point-of-purchase placards could be required.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that provides permanent resident status to three children, Sergio, 17 years old; Fauricio 15 years old; and Ana Lozano, 14 years old; who were granted immigrant visas to come to the United States with their mother earlier this year. Now they have lost their mother and could be deported because they were recently orphaned. 
The children have lived with their mother, Ana Ruth Lozano, until her death in February of this year due to complications from typhoid fever. Since their mother's death, the children have been living with their closest relative, their U.S.-citizen grandmother who lives in Los Angeles. 
Without their mother, the children do not have the legal right to remain in the United States. The Lozano children can be deported because the immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children without their parents. 
Without their mother, these children can be deported by the INS despite the fact the children have no family who will take care of them in El Salvador except their estranged father who, INS reports show, was abusive to the mother and the children. 
Without this bill, the children will most likely be sent to an orphanage in El Salvador. Here in the United States, the childern have their U.S.-citizen grandmother and uncles who will give them a loving home. 
I have previously sought administrative relief for the Lozano children by asking the INS district office in Los Angeles and Commissioner Meissner if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in their case. INS has told my staff that there is nothing further they can do administratively and a private relief bill may be the only way to protect the children from deportation. 
I hope you will support this bill so that we can help the Lozano children begin to rebuild their lives in the United States. 
Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the attached news article and the bill be entered into the Record.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on campaign spending reform. 
I recognize that this is not the first bill introduced in Congress on this issue. In fact, at last count, there were 85 bills introduced in either the House or the Senate on campaign finance reform--17 of them in the Senate alone. 
Frankly, I would be quite satisfied if the bill I am introducing today was tabled in favor of a floor vote on the McCain-Feingold bill, of which I am a cosponsor. 
Last week, all 45 Democrats in the Senate pledged to vote for McCain-Feingold if given the opportunity. Combined with the three Republican cosponsors of the bill, this legislation needs only three more votes for passage. Surely there are three more Republicans who will support this bill. 
But we are not there yet, and I believe strongly that action must be taken on this subject now. Today. This Congress. This session. 
 This Congress has spent $10 million in taxpayer funds investigating wrongdoing in the last election cycle. 
 Eighty-four Members of this Congress have called for special prosecutors. 
 We've spent 6 months in public hearings decrying how bad the system is, how bad soft money is, and how badly we need reform. 
There is nothing to hide behind if this Congress does not act on reform. 
I do not believe Members of this body can or should be able to take a pass on reform based on disagreements with McCain-Feingold, or based on an all-or-nothing attitude. Therefore, I offer my legislation as a bill that contains the common denominators--the basic elements--of reform that many of us profess to agree on. 
Let me state clearly; I am a cosponsor of McCain-Feingold and will vote for McCain-Feingold if it comes to the floor for approval, as I believe it should. 
My legislation is an alternative, focussed on what I, and what most of my colleagues, have said are the most pressing areas in need of reform: the elimination of soft money, greater disclosure on contributions, and regulation of dollars now unregulated. 
The cornerstone of any campaign reform bill must address the issue of soft money. After all the charges and disclosures about the abuse of soft money in federal campaigns, we would be hard-pressed to explain to the public why we did not take action at least on this issue. 
However, just banning soft money--for which there appears to be sufficient support in both Houses--cannot be our only action. A simple ban on soft money will force the shifting of these dollars into unregulated independent expenditure campaigns where huge amounts of anonymous money is used to influence campaigns and--most commonly--to attack candidates. 
Between $135 and $150 million was spent on so-called issue ads in 1996--about 35 percent of the $400 million spent on all campaign advertising in 1996, according to a new study released yesterday by the Annenberg Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The study--the most comprehensive on this issue to date--showed that, compared with other forms of political advertising and coverage, the content of issue ads were the highest in `pure attack.' 
To this end, I have prepared this small package of measures--many of which appear in other bills--which, taken together, is a step on the road to spending reform, and would be a solid step forward in the battle to decrease the flood of unregulated money in campaigns. 
Specifically, this bill would: 
Ban soft money to national parties. During the last election, both parties spent a combined total of over $270 million in soft money. Democrats spent $122 million and Republicans spent almost $150 million. Over the first 6 months of this year, both parties have raised $34 million in soft money, with Republicans out-pacing Democrats $23 to $11 million. 
Change the definition of `express advocacy' to include any communication that uses a candidate's name or picture within 60 days of an election as `express advocacy'. Only `hard' dollars--limited in amount and fully disclosed--could be used to fund independent campaigns of a candidate's name or image is used in express advocacy for or against a candidate. 
Change the personal contribution limit from $1,000 per election to $2,000 per election and index those contribution limits for inflation in the future. The $1,000 per election limits have not been changed since 1974. That was 23 years ago and, as every candidate knows, the cost of printing postage and buying media has more than quadrupled in that time. 
Increase the disclosure requirements so that any group or individual spending more than $10,000 up to 20 days prior to an election would have to report that to the FEC within 48 hours. This threshold drops to $1,000 within 20 days of an election. 
Implement a policy whereby if a person is not eligible to vote in U.S. elections, he or she would not be permitted to contribute to candidates or parties. 
Lower the threshold for reporting contributions to candidates from $200 to $50. This increases disclosure. 
Allow the FEC to seek an injunction in U.S. District Court if it has evidence that a violation of campaign laws is about to occur. 
Permit the FEC to refer matters to the Attorney General for prosecution if any significant evidence of criminal wrongdoing exists. 
I believe a bill containing these elements is doable this year and I offer it as a package for the consideration of this body. 
In closing, it is my sincere hope we will move to enact meaningful campaign finance reform this year. If we can't act now, after all that has been said and done this year, I'm afraid we never will. The American people deserve more than lip service on campaign reform. 
I implore the majority leader to bring the McCain-Feingold bill to the floor and allow us to debate it, amend it, and vote on it. If we can't agree on the McCain-Feingold bill, then let us vote on an alternative such as mine. Either way, let us have at it.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member. 
Mr. President, while I am pleased that we are voting today on three judicial nominees and I am supporting them, I am concerned about those whom we are not voting upon--in particular two fine nominees from California. 
I am also concerned about what appears to me to be a plan to force the splitting of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by crippling its ability to do its work. 
Ten of the twenty-eight judgeships on that court are now vacant--36 percent of the bench. 
I will ask unanimous consent that a table showing the status of each vacancy within the ninth circuit be place in the Record following my remarks. 
I believe that proponents of the ninth circuit split wish to keep these seats vacant as long as possible, so that the vacant judgeships can then be transferred to the new twelfth circuit, and filled by judges who they hope will be more in line with their own political philosophy. 
Unfortunately, this plan is substantially impairing the ability of the ninth circuit to do its job, and impeding justice for the millions of Americans who live within the ninth circuit --creating what the Honorable Proctor Hug, chief justice of the ninth circuit, has called a vacancy crisis. 
The time has come for the Senate to end this death by attrition, and act upon these nominations, so that the ninth circuit can get on with its work. 
These votes we are taking today will clear out all the judicial nominees who remain on the executive calendar, except for three, two of whom, as I have mentioned, are from California 
These two nominees, Margaret Morrow and Anthony Ishii, have had their nominations pending longer, both in the Senate and on the floor of the Senate, than have two of the three nominees upon whom we are voting today. 
Margaret Morrow was first nominated almost a year and a half ago, on March 18, 1996. She was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee on June 27, 1996, but the Senate failed to take further action upon her nomination before we adjourned. 
She was nominated again in the beginning of this year, and favorably reported by the committee again on June 12, 1997. 
Anthony Ishii was nominated on February 12, 1997, and has been on the floor since July 10. 
In contrast, Christopher Droney and Janet Hall were nominated on June 5, 1997, and have only been on the floor since July 31. 
So while I am happy that we are acting upon their nominations, I hope that we will soon act upon the older nominations of Margaret Morrow and Anthony Ishii. 
Let's bring their nominations up, debate them if necessary, and vote them up or down. 
I urge the distinguished majority leader to do this, I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I would like to continue along the lines of some of my colleagues' comments with some of my own, informal as they may be, about what happened this morning. I find myself very much thinking along the lines of the Senators from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. 
I watched the CNN coverage from Jerusalem this morning, and my heart very much went into my throat. I wondered how much can the people of this small nation endure. I looked at the faces on the streets, and I saw a kind of brokenness, a spirit diminished, a hurt that was turning rapidly to anger. 
I have been one on the Foreign Relations Committee who has been a supporter of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act. That act expired prior to our recess. It was not renewed. My understanding is that as a result the Palestinian office in this area has closed, and I believe it should remain closed, and that the aid specified through the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, which we call MEPFA, has ceased. I believe that aid should cease. I believe that the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act at this point in time should not be renewed and, as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, it is going to take a great deal to convince me to go in any other direction. 
The last terrorist attack before this was July 30. Since then, there has been an aborted attack. Today, we saw three suicide bombers go into a busy pedestrian mall and blow themselves up in a kind of fanaticism that certainly is not understood in Western countries or really any peace-loving country. It is not the act of peace-loving people to blow themselves up and blow up anyone that happens to be around them. 
I submit that the only reason these bombs are not blowing up inside rooms, businesses, and convention halls--and causing even more casualties--is that in Israeli, everyone is searched when they enter public buildings. This is a terrible way for people to have to live. At some point it almost begins to approach the atrocity of a concentration camp if people must live this way. 
My own view is that it takes two parties to pursue peace, and both parties must want peace. I had thought up to this point that Yasser Arafat wants peace. I must tell this body honestly, I no longer believe that to be the case. I watched his kiss with a Hamas leader, and I know that when public leaders engage in these kinds of symbolic gestures, it sets forth signals, signals to every Hamas terrorist everywhere, that their actions are, to some extent, condoned by the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, the head of that authority. That is a terrible signal to send if you are going to be seriously engaged in a peace process. 
So I have come to believe that that authority at this stage does not want peace. I have come to believe it when I read that members of the police department were actually engaged in complicity with terrorists to allow a terrorist attack to take place. 
I believe the following: First, that if there is ever a time for the Arab world to come forward and take a united and strong position against Hamas and Hezbollah and any other organization that would carry out these acts, it is now. If there ever was a time for the Arab world to begin to press for the arrest, for the destruction of these terrorist organizations, it is now. Outside of concerted action by the Arab world, I don't see how a peace process can go ahead with any progress whatsoever. 
Second, I believe we should not renew the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act. I believe that all funding should cease at this point. And I must finally say that I personally have very mixed feelings about Secretary Albright's trip to the Middle East. Yes, I believe we should resist terrorism. I am not sure that going to the Middle East at this point in time sends the signal that we do, indeed, resist terrorism. It seems to me that if both parties, Israel and the Palestinians, want to discuss peace and the United States is going to carry out our role as an honest broker, this peace can be brokered elsewhere than on Israeli soil at this point in time. 
When three people move forward to kill themselves and kill others, I only can believe that other attacks are going to follow. If I am any judge at all of the faces, the Israeli faces I saw on television this morning, I would have to say that peace is having a price that free people have a great deal of difficulty in paying, because it means your child can't go to school, you can't shop, you can't walk down a street. You become a hostage, in another sense. 
So I make these comments with very deep concern as one who has tried to work on resolutions passed by this body so that they weren't inflammatory to the peace process, so that Jerusalem, as an issue, could be handled in a way that was not inflammatory, so that the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act could go ahead. But as one Member of this Senate, I am now at the point where I believe that without a major commitment from the Arab world, from Mr. Arafat and from his government, peace is at the weakest point that I have ever seen since the peace process has begun. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from New York for his comments. 
Mr. DAMATO addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others, as an original cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution 46. 
Yesterday two suicide terrorist bombers blew themselves up in the Mahane Yehuda open-air marketplace in the center of Jerusalem. These bombs were clearly timed to do the maximum possible damage. They exploded seconds apart at about 1 p.m. local time, at the height of the lunchtime shopping hour. Initial reports indicate that at least 18 people were killed and over 100 were injured. 
This was a despicable, bloodthirsty act, which all of us stand and condemn in one voice. It is not yet known exactly who perpetrated the bombing, but it bears great similarity to attacks conducted in the past by the Palestinian extremist groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Whoever bears guilt for this terrible crime is beneath contempt. 
We join Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Weizman, and the Israeli people in mourning those who were murdered yesterday, and we offer our deepest condolences to their families. To the wounded, we offer our prayers and hopes for their full recovery. 
Sadly, Israelis have become all too familiar with having their daily routines shattered by the sudden bloodshed and carnage of bombings in seemingly ordinary places--on a bus, in a marketplace, in park or a cafe. On top of all the other tragic aspects of these bombings, the way Israelis are forced to live with the knowledge that their world could be blown apart at any instant is a peculiar kind of torture. 
President Clinton was exactly right when he said yesterday morning that this bomb was aimed not only at innocent Israeli civilians, but also at all those in the Middle East who genuinely desire peace. And I fear that this bombing, because of its timing and location, could be as damaging to prospects for peace as any that we have seen. 
The timing could hardly have been worse. The President's Special Middle East Coordinator, Dennis Ross, was about to travel to Israel to try to breathe new life into the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been suspended for many months, but which were just beginning to show signs of resuming. In fact, there is good reason to believe that this attack was timed specifically to disrupt Mr. Ross's trip and the impending resumption of the peace talks. Now it may be weeks or months before these talks can resume and be productive. For the extremists, the greatest danger is that the talks could make progress, and they are obviously willing to do anything to prevent it. 
This bombing also has ramifications for our work. On August 12, the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act will expire. This act provided the legislative framework for U.S. involvement in the peace process by giving the President the authority to provide assistance to the Palestinian Authority, allow the PLO to operate an office in Washington, and waive other restrictions on United States-Palestinian contacts, if he certifies that the Palestinian Authority is fulfilling its commitments. 
I had hoped that the House and Senate leadership would work with those of us who care deeply about this issue to pass a short-term extension of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, so that it does not expire while the Congress is in recess next month. There are many Members, myself included, who believe that the act needs to be reworked to establish a tougher standard of compliance, before it is extended for the long term. But a short-term extension of 60 or 90 days would give us the opportunity to negotiate a meaningful new version of the law, without this important legislation lapsing for a matter of weeks, or even months. 
Now, under these circumstances, I do not think it will be possible to pass to a short-term extension in the short time remaining before the August recess. I hope that we will be able to negotiate an appropriate replacement for the current Middle East Peace Facilitation Act shortly after the recess in September. 
The location of this bombing also makes it deeply resonant. The Mahane Yehuda marketplace is in the heart of downtown Jerusalem. It is a place where every Israeli has spent time, and many Jerusalemites visit or pass through it daily. It will be difficult to recover from an attack in such a central and symbolic place, and the Israeli Government will find it difficult to engage in peace talks while this memory is fresh. 
What will it take to recover from this bombing? Before anything else can take place, it will take action by the Palestinian Authority. First and foremost, the Palestinian Authority should resume security cooperation with the Israeli government to the full extent that they had cooperated before. At one time, in 1995 and part of 1996, Israeli an Palestinian security cooperation reached unprecedented levels. This cooperation reflected a mutual understanding in the shared stake both sides had in preventing acts of terrorism 
by extremists bent on destroying the peace process. 
That shared stake still exists today, but the Palestinian leadership must recognize it and act upon it. Even if the Palestinians are angered by some Israeli actions, that does not change the mutual interest they have in preventing terrorism. Because if anything will stop the peace process from achieving the aspirations of both Palestinians and Israelis, terrorism will. 
Second, the Palestinian Authority must reinvigorate its efforts to root out terrorist groups in the areas under its control. This effort has been spotty, at best, and Palestinian officials, including Chairman Arafat, have been rightly criticized for giving less than clear signals that terrorism will not be tolerated under any circumstances. This is not acceptable. An unequivocal red light against terrorism and the operations of terrorist groups--a no-tolerance policy--is the only thing that is acceptable. 
Chairman Arafat called Prime Minister Netanyahu shortly after the bombing to condemn the attack, which is the right thing for him to have done. But he must not and cannot stop there. He should condemn publicly in the strongest possible language--in English and Arabic--these bombings and all other acts of terrorism. He should instruct his security forces to dismantle the infrastructure of the terrorist groups, arresting those who are complicit in the conduct of terrorist attacks. He should use his bully pulpit to insist that Palestinian society rejects the elements who believe their aspirations--or martyrdom--can be attained by killing Israelis. If he fails to take these steps, there can be no peace process, and Palestinian aspirations will never be realized. 
Finally, when the security situation is more stabilized, both sides must resume peace talks with a view toward meeting only their own needs, but the needs of the other side as well. If these talks are seen in purely zero-sum terms, they will go nowhere. Both sides must make their demands--on Israel's further redeployments in the West Bank, and on final status issues like Jerusalem, settlements, refugees, and sovereignty--with the understanding that if the other side has no stake in the process, there will be no final status agreement that brings about a lasting peace. 
Clearly the peace process cannot coexist with terrorism. But despite yesterday's tragic and criminal bombing, the logic of this peace process, and the fundamental need for peace between Israelis and Palestinians has not changed. To give up on this effort would condemn future generations of Israelis to controlling a hostile population of over 2 million, to the detriment of Israel's long-term security and well-being. It would also bury Palestinian dreams of self-determination. 
To turn away now from the search for peace would be to reward the extremists for their acts of violence and terrorism. It would be a victory for the barbaric suicide bombers of Mahane Yehuda. It would say to them: `You were right. You win. There cannot and shall not be peace between Israelis and Palestinians.' 
Neither Israelis nor Palestinians--nor the United States--can afford for that to happen.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am proud to support the breast cancer research stamp bill, H.R. 1585, sponsored by Congresswoman Susan Molinari and approved in the House of Representatives yesterday on a vote of 422 to 3. 
I, along with Senators D'Amato, Faircloth, and the original 51 cosponsors of my bill, the breast cancer research stamp Act (S. 726), have worked very hard to give life to this innovative breast cancer research stamp idea, which originated with a physician--Dr. Bodai from my State, and I am happy to see it become a reality today. 
At a time when the National Cancer Institute can only fund 26 percent of applications, a drop from 60 percent in the 1970's, this legislation creates an innovative way for citizens to contribute to breast cancer research. 
Under this bill: 
Postal Service would establish a special rate of postage for first-class mail, not to exceed 25 percent of the first-class rate, as an alternative to the regular first-class postage. The additional sum would be contributed to breast cancer research. 
The rate would be determined in part, by the Postal Service to cover administrative costs and the remainder by the Governors of the Postal Service. 
Seventy percent of the funds raised would fund breast cancer research at NIH and 30 percent of the funds raised would go to breast cancer research at DOD. 
The Postal Service would provide the stamp within a year from the date of enactment. 
Within 3 months prior to the stamp's 2-year anniversary, the bill requires the Comptroller General to evaluate the effectiveness and the appropriateness of this method of fund raising and report its findings to Congress.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also want to thank the Senator from New York for his help on this matter. 
We have had a true bipartisan effort with Ms. Molinari and Mr. Fazio in the House and Senators D'Amato, Faircloth and Feinstein in the Senate. This bill passed the House on suspension. I believe it is an excellent bill. I think it will get the job done in a way in which we can all be proud. 
The bill is slightly different than the bill that we introduced as an amendment on the fiscal year 1998 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill last week. This bill provides for up to 25 percent of the cost of a first-class stamp to be attached, the extra amount added to be used for breast cancer research. Of the amount of funds raised, 75 percent would go to the NIH, and the remainder to DOD. 
It is something that is widely supported by virtually every medical and cancer association in the United States. 
Let me say one thing. Breast cancer is the No. 1 killer for women between the ages of 35 and 52 in this Nation today. It used to be 1 out of 20 women. Today it is one out of every eight women in the United States will come down with breast cancer. It is extraordinarily serious. This is a unique public/private partnership, the first time it has been tried, a pilot, if you will. I know it has been hotlined. I am grateful for the results. I thank the Senator from New York so very much for his work and support and the pink ribbon he is wearing on his lapel, and I believe the women of America, all of us, also thank every Member of this body.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be very happy to. 
One of the problems with the 1-cent stamp is the uncertainty of the post office that the administrative costs will be fully covered by the additional 1 cent. The legislation which passed the House, authored by Susan Molinari and Dick Fazio, on suspension, essentially provides that it can be up to 25 percent --that would be about 8 cents, determined by the Board of Governors--so that the full cost of administering it is covered. The Board of Governors within a short period of time will set the actual amount, whether it is 1 cent, 2 cents, 3 cents or 4 cents, and I actually feel is a much better way of doing it. I think it will end up producing more money. I think it will give the post office fewer ulcers. I think it will be carried out forthwith. This has passed the House, and with the passage here today we can get the show underway. 
The Board of Governors must, within 1 year of the enactment of the bill, issue the stamp.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. No. It allows an optional first-class stamp, up to 25 percent of the cost of a first-class stamp. In other words, it could add 8 cents onto it, on an optional basis. There would still be a 32-cent stamp. Then there would be this breast cancer stamp. All right. The Board of Governors in their deliberation would make a decision of administrative cost and then out of the 8 cents or 4 cents or 6 cents or 2 cents, whatever they decide, those administrative costs would come out of that additional amount.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
Now, if we may turn to something which is of very deep concern. The amendment that I have sent to the desk is on behalf of the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy; the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray; my colleague from California, Senator Boxer; and the two Senators from Nevada, Senators Reid and Bryan. The amendment is an amendment to strike and substitute language. The section we would strike from the bill is section 305, which splits the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on an appropriations bill. 
Mr. President, this legislation which I am presenting serves as a substitute to a nongermane provision of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill for Commerce, State, Justice.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this bill, with no hearing, no due diligence, no consultation with the ninth circuit--any of its judges, attorneys, bar associations within the circuit--splits the circuit, and I would like to show you how it splits the circuit. It creates a twelfth circuit which would comprise Washington, Arizona, Alaska, Oregon, Hawaii, Idaho, and Montana. If you look at the map--separate and distinct, alone--separated from the rest, would be the State of Arizona. The proposal would leave in the ninth circuit only two States--the States of California and Nevada--along with the territories of Guam and the Marianas. 
Now, what is wrong with that? First of all, the way in which it is done, which I will address in detail. But second, it creates two unequal circuits. The ninth circuit and Nevada would have close to 35 million people and the twelfth circuit would have 16 million people. But look at the proposed distribution of the judges. It would distribute 15 judges to the ninth circuit and 13 judges to the remainder--an unequal, unfair distribution of judges. 
Here is what the effect would be. In the ninth circuit, you would have 363 cases per judge. In the new twelfth circuit, each judge would have just 239 cases. So the judges of the ninth circuit would immediately have caseloads 52 percent higher than the judges of the twelfth circuit. 
Mr. President, the real point is that there is already a resolution to this issue. It was passed by the Senate last session, and it has already passed the House. The resolution is legislation that calls for a study of all of the circuits, with special emphasis on the ninth circuit. 
The substitute amendment that I am offering today to form a study commission passed the House of Representatives unanimously in June. This bill is identical to the House-passed bill. The study commission represents, I believe, the only principled approach to dealing with an issue as important and far-reaching as the structure of the U.S. courts of appeals. 
If I may, Mr. President, there has never been a division of a circuit court without careful study and without the support of the judges and the lawyers within the circuit who represent the public they serve. There has never been a division of any circuit in this manner--arbitrary, political, and gerrymandered. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am deeply concerned that the legislation to split the ninth circuit has been included in this appropriations bill with no hearing, no study, no due diligence as to its impact. Section 305 of the bill contains language for this split. It is a misuse, in my view, of the appropriations process. 
Yesterday, Representative Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote a strongly worded letter, which was circulated broadly. I would like to quote from it. 
I understand that this week the Senate is expected to consider S. 1022, the Commerce-Justice-State-Judiciary appropriations bill. Included in the bill is a major piece of substantive legislation, the `Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1997.' This provision of the bill (section 305) would amend Title 28 of the United States Code by dividing the existing Ninth Circuit into two circuits. As you well know, altering the structure of the federal judicial system is a serious matter. It is something that Congress does rarely, and only after careful consideration. 
It is anticipated that an amendment will be offered to replace the circuit division rider with legislation to create a commission-- 
That is what I am trying to do at this time-- to study the courts of appeals and report recommendations on possible change. This legislation, H.R. 908, has already passed the House unanimously on a voice vote on June 3, 1997. A similar bill, S. 956, was passed unanimously by the Senate in the 104th Congress. This is a far superior way of dealing with the problems of caseload growth in the Ninth Circuit and other courts of appeals. I urge your support for the amendment. 
Sincerely, Henry Hyde, Chairman. 
So the House is on record supporting a study. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House writes this letter, and yet this split is in the bill. The administration has issued a strong statement to the Senate Appropriations Committee indicating its support for a study commission and its opposition to the inclusion of such far-reaching legislation in an appropriations bill. 
Mr. President, I hope the President will veto this bill if it should contain an arbitrary split of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--a split done politically, as a form of gerrymandering. 
In a letter dated July 11, Gov. Pete Wilson reiterated his support for the commission study and stated that the present effort to split the circuit involves judicial gerrymandering, apparently designed, and I quote, `to cordon off some judges in one circuit while keeping others in another because of concerns, whether perceived or real, over particular judges' perspectives or judicial philosophy.' 
Less than 2 weeks ago, when Governor Wilson wrote this letter, there was a proposal that would have divided the ninth circuit into three circuits and split California in half. Then there was another proposal that would have left California and Hawaii in a two-State circuit, the first time in history that a Federal judicial circuit would have consisted of fewer than three States. 
In a matter of hours, an amendment was made to the bill, and we have the latest proposal which keeps California whole, teams it with Nevada, isolating a geographical neighbor, Arizona, and placing Arizona with Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Idaho, Alaska, and Montana. Mr. President, I respectfully submit this is not the way to do the people's legal business. This is not the way to restructure the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Let me offer some history. I authored the first proposal to create a commission on structural alternatives for the Federal courts of appeal in the 104th Congress during a markup session in the Senate Judiciary Committee on December 8, 1985. If that had been passed, the job would have been done by now. The Senate ultimately passed legislation to create a study commission during that Congress on March 20. 
As noted above, in the present Congress, a commission bill identical to the one I am offering today unanimously passed the House. So both Houses of Congress have spoken on this issue and both Houses of Congress have said if the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should be split, no due diligence, consult the judges, consult the attorneys who practice before it, look at the precedents, see that there is study, thought and consideration to what would be the best split. None of this has been done. In a matter of a week, four separate proposals have been put forward and changed with no opportunity for anyone who practices law in the ninth circuit, the huge ninth circuit, to indicate what the impact of those proposals might be. 
The House-passed bill was modeled on a proposal I introduced with Senator Reid on January 30, 1997. The House Judiciary Subcommittee Chairman Coble and Chairman Hyde moved the bill with the support and cosponsorship of Representative Berman. The current H.R. 908 represents a compromise that was worked out in the House and endorsed by every House Republican and Democrat. 
I should note that the House-passed bill is very similar to a compromise on a study commission that Senator Burns and I reached together just a few months ago. This all began with Senator Burns. I understand his concerns. He has legitimate interests, legitimate thoughts, and I appreciate them. The last I had heard was Senator Burns signed off on the study commission. So you can imagine the surprise when I heard. My goodness, this is on an appropriations bill. And Members of this body have taken it on themselves to arbitrarily just decide, willy-nilly, how the ninth circuit should be split. 
The House-passed commission study is fully bipartisan, a 10-member commission. The commission would operate for 18 months, at which time it would make recommendations to Congress for any changes in circuit structure or alignment. 
I don't think we should subject something as important as the structure of our courts to political gamesmanship, and that is just what this is. The study called for in H.R. 908 is a responsible method of evaluating the current situation and making recommendations that can provide a sound foundation for Congressional action in the future. 
A study is needed to determine whether this or any proposed circuit division would be likely to improve the administration of justice in the region. That is the fundamental question: Would a split improve the administration of justice, and, if so, what should that split be? Even among those who believe that some kind of split should occur, there is no consensus as to where any circuit boundary lines might be redrawn. 
During the 105th Congress, proponents of a circuit split put forward these four proposals. One would have split the north from the southernmost States of the circuit. The second would have 
chopped the existing circuit into three separate circuits and split California in half. The third would have created a narrow stringbean circuit. That was the same proposal that failed to pass the Senate during the 104th Congress. 
The current proposal, which represents at least the fourth proposal in the 105th Congress, is a modification of the stringbean circuit. Again, no due diligence, no hearings, no study, no testimony--nothing. 
As I noted before, the proposal isolates Arizona. It combines Nevada. It separates coastal States that have common maritime law. And that is why I say it is gerrymandering. I say if it looks like a gerrymander, talks like a gerrymander, it probably is a gerrymander. 
Let's talk about the costs inherent in what is happening here today. If this bill passes and should go into law, splitting the circuit will require duplicative offices of clerk of the court, circuit executive, staff attorneys, settlement attorneys and library as well as courtrooms, mail and computer facilities. According to the ninth circuit executive office, neither Phoenix nor Seattle currently have facilities capable of housing a court of appeals headquarters operation. 
As part of the review of last year's similar proposal to split the circuit, the GSA estimated that it would cost a minimum of $23 million to construct new facilities for a headquarters in Phoenix, and I would be very surprised if it was as little as $23 million. Based on GSA costs, the ninth circuit executive has estimated that building and renovation costs for creating or upgrading new headquarters in Seattle and Phoenix would amount to at least $56 million. Additional combined outlay of another $6 million in startup costs would be needed to outfit both Phoenix and Seattle. 
The CBO last year estimated the cost of duplicative staff positions at $1 million annually. The new proposal calls for two coequal clerks of the court in the twelfth circuit. Assuming each clerk would have the customary deputy clerk and staff attorney, an additional $300,000 in salaries would be added to the total. So the new twelfth circuit would cost an additional $1.3 million annually for duplicate salaries, and minimum of $25 million in Phoenix and an additional amount for Seattle. It is estimated the cost would run in the neighborhood of $60 million. 
This wouldn't be so bad if there just hadn't been approved and spent $140 million to rehabilitate and seismically equip the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the city of San Francisco and Pasadena--$140 million has just been spent. I just visited the San Francisco ninth circuit. It compares with the U.S. Capitol. There is a brand-new library already built in, magnificent chambers, one library that is solid redwood, marble that is incredible, lighting fixtures that go back well over 100 years. It is an amazing and beautiful building. 
Under the configuration of States proposed for the new twelfth circuit, the circuit executive estimates that upward of 50 percent of the space recently renovated in San Francisco and Pasadena at a cost of $140 million would no longer be needed. The space was specifically designed to meet the business needs of the court of appeals. The executive office estimates, `It would cost many tens of millions of dollars to modify the space to make it usable by tenants other than the court of appeals.' 
Let me talk for a minute about the real risk of an impetuous political and gerrymandered split of the ninth circuit. 
Forum shopping: Organizations and entities whose activities cut across State lines, and those who sue them, would be able to forum shop to take advantage of favorable precedents or to avoid those that are unfavorable. And I suspect, frankly speaking, that this is just what is behind this split. Thus, an additional burden would be placed on the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve conflicts that are now handled internally within the circuit. 
Here are some examples provided by the ninth circuit of how dividing it could invite forum shopping: water disputes concerning the Colorado River, which affect California, Nevada, and Arizona; 
commercial disputes between large contractors like Boeing and McDonald--perhaps that is resolved now--or Microsoft and Intel; different legal precedents affecting the shipping industry along the coastline of the continental United States and Hawaii. 
Think of the complications created if different commercial and maritime rules governed the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Tacoma and Hawaii. The ninth circuit includes a vast expanse of coastal area, all subject to the same Federal law on cargo loading, on seaman's wages, on personal injury, and maritime employment. Vessels plying the coast stop frequently at ports in California, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii and the Pacific territories. If the circuit were to be divided, seamen would have an incentive to forum shop among port districts in order to predetermine the most sympathetic court of appeals to hear the case. 
In the commercial law area, all of the States in the circuit have considerable economic relations with California because of its large and diverse population. In a recent case, Vizcaino v. Microsoft, the ninth circuit decided to hear a case en banc concerning whether Microsoft contractors were entitled to the same ERISA benefits and stock options as were regular employees. Microsoft is a large corporation with primary offices in Washington but significant business operations in California. If the ninth circuit were split, Microsoft or its employees might choose to bring a lawsuit in either the ninth or twelfth circuit, in hopes of finding a more sympathetic court. 
The judges and lawyers of the ninth circuit overwhelmingly oppose what is happening in this bill. Let me repeat that. The lawyers and judges in all of the ninth circuit States overwhelmingly oppose what is happening in this State, Justice, Commerce appropriations bill. 
On four occasions, the Federal judges in the ninth circuit and the practicing lawyers in the ninth circuit judicial conference have voted their opposition to splitting the circuit. The official bar organizations of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana and Nevada, and the National Federal Bar Association, all have taken positions against circuit division. No State bar organization in the circuit has taken a position in favor of circuit division or what is happening in this bill. 
Candidly speaking, this is a political decision of Senators of the Appropriations Committee to affect the legal business of 50 million people in the United States with an arbitrary split, gerrymandered, of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Candidly speaking, also, the ninth circuit is large. California alone is predicted to be 50 million people by the year 2025. 
Whether the circuit should be split or not, I can't say. I strongly believe it is a decision that should not be made, however, either politically or in a cavalier fashion. The decision should not be made without study, without hearing, without comment from those lawyers and judges whose clients are affected by it. 
If--and I say if--the circuit is eventually split, it should be the product of diligence, of study, of hearing, of commentary. It should be part of an analysis of how the circuit courts are functioning in the United States. There may well be a better split involving other States. I don't know, and I would hazard a guess that no one in this Chamber knows that either. 
But this does mean a careful study of population should be undertaken. It means an even distribution of caseload by judge, not a rammed-through circuit split that has a 52 percent higher caseload for judges in this new ninth circuit than in the twelfth circuit. On its face, it is patently unfair. Anybody who looks at any split that says you split it so that one set of judges has double the number of cases than the other--that doesn't meet a simple test of fairness. 
There should be a careful study of precedents, of commercial law, of maritime law, of the other aspects of precedents. California now has the largest consumer market in the United States in Los Angeles; the third largest in the San Francisco Bay area. It is a huge consumer market, and it is going to be bigger with all kinds of intercommunication among these States. 
There should be a study of costs. I pointed out the duplication of staff, I pointed out the need for two new courthouses when two already have been refurbished at a cost of $140 million for the taxpayers. All of this is being done without any study, any hearing, any commentary. It is not something of which this great body can be proud. 
I notice that the distinguished Senator from Nevada is here, and if I might ask him, I believe he would like 10 minutes? I will be happy to yield to him.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think the distinguished Senator from Arizona knows I greatly respect him, from working together on other issues. I think we work very well together. 
I want to directly address something that he has said about the fairness of this split, particularly with respect to the size. I say to him, that isn't the issue. The issue is how the judges are split. I say to the Senator, this legislation splits the judges. The way in which it splits the judges is 15 judges for the ninth circuit, and 13 judges for the newly formed twelfth circuit. Now, the caseload means that the ninth circuit court judges have a 50 percent greater caseload per judge than do the twelfth circuit court judges. 
The Senator and I discussed these kinds of issues a year or so ago. I hope you will recall when we were discussing this in the Judiciary Committee. 
There is a letter dated July 18 of this year to Senator Reid from Chief Judge Procter Hug. What Judge Hug points out is: 
Under the bill, the Ninth Circuit is to have 15 judges and the Twelfth Circuit is to have 13 judges. The Ninth Circuit would have a 50% greater caseload per judge than the Twelfth. 
He goes on and shows the total for California, Nevada, Guam, Northern Marianas, with a total caseload of 5,448. 
With 15 judges, the caseload per judge--363 cases, then the caseload for Alaska, 204; Arizona, 891; Hawaii, 204; Idaho, 141; Montana, 175; Oregon, 626; Washington, 871, with a total of 3,112. 
With 13 judges, the caseload per judge--239 cases. That is one of my big objections. One thing I would just bet my life on is, as a product of a study, there will be a fairer distribution of judges.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may just make my quick statement here. 
On four occasions, the Federal judges of the ninth circuit and the practicing lawyers of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference have voted in opposition to splitting the circuits. The official bar organization of Arizona--as recently as July 14, a few days ago--and the bars of California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada, and the National Federal Bar Association, all have taken positions against the circuit division. No State bar organization to this day has taken a position in favor of circuit division, let alone this division. 
Now, let me try to begin to summarize here. 
I believe strongly--and I think the other side knows I do not throw these comments around loosely--that this is really being done for the wrong reasons and in the wrong way. I think some people did not like some of the decisions, specifically in mining and grazing. For some it is being done because they think they will get more judges for their State. I have had Senators tell me that directly. For some, a new courthouse is attractive. 
The point is, the House of Representatives has passed the very bill, the amendment of which I am carrying here in the Senate. This proposal, notwithstanding anything anyone has said, as a member of the Judiciary Committee for the last 4 1/2 years --there has never, Mr. President, in the time you've been there, there has never been a hearing on this split. There has never been a discussion of the ramifications of this split on legal precedent or forum shopping. There has never been input from the judicial council, from the judges, from the bar associations on this split. That is fact, Mr. President. That is fact. 
Yet, an appropriations committee has stolen the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee and moved ahead and proposed a split a few weeks ago--2 days later they had a split which split California in half--the next day that was gone and there was the split we are faced with today. That is why I say it is a gerrymander. 
If this were a map before a court on an electoral district with Arizona floating out here alone, they would say, aha, it is a gerrymander. Yet it can be done by a committee that does not even have authorizing oversight jurisdiction, and, bingo, it is before the full body. I really have a problem with that. I do not think that is right. 
I happen to agree with my chairman, California is going to have 50 million people by the year 2025. We should take a look at whether or not the interests of justice would be carried out by splitting the largest circuit in the Union. I do not have a problem with that. 
What I do have a problem with is worrying, aha, is this being done because Montana does not like a mining decision? Is it being done because Washington does not like a timber decision? Is it being done because someone else doesn't like another decision? Is it being done because a state wants an additional judge? 
I mean, this is a very real and pertinent consideration because never before in the history of the Union has a circuit been split in this manner. So it is indeed very, very important. 
No consideration of costs. I pointed out the Pasadena and San Francisco courthouses; $140 million has just been spent on them. My goodness, I can see the spot done now on television. `They spend all this money.' I believe there is no way you can build new courthouses, and staff them with duplicate positions, and not have it cost at least $100 million in 1997 dollars. And do you know what? This goes into place, Mr. President, in October of this year. 
This is almost the end of July, and then there's August, September, and October 1 this goes into effect. No hearing; no study; no talk; no what do you think, bar of Arizona; what do you think, bar of Nevada; what do you think, bar of Alaska; or what do you think, bar of Idaho? It doesn't meet the smell test. That is the problem for me. 
Now, let me talk----

<TEXT>
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may finish my thought, the point has been made--and the distinguished Senator from Alaska made this point very well--that 28 out of 29 cases of this session were reversed by the United States Supreme Court. Bingo, it is a terrible circuit. Well, let me say that that is only 28 cases out of over 4,480 cases. It is the largest circuit. That is a very small percentage of the cases it successfully adjudicated. 
Let me just go back to Judge Hug's letter because I believe there is something important here. The caseload per judge in the ninth circuit would be 124 cases per judge higher than the twelfth circuit, or 52 percent greater, as I have said, than the twelfth. 
Then he raises this: 
The provision in the bill for coequal clerks in the twelfth Circuit is completely unworkable. How can it be efficiently administered in this way? Is the administration of the circuit to be done in two separate, coequal headquarters? Where would the circuit executive be located? 
These are all questions that need to be answered. This thing would go into effect on October 1. No question is answered. 
Then Judge Hug says in his letter: 
Consider the travel time and expense of the judges. Presumably, the judges from Alaska and Montana will need to travel half of the time to Phoenix, and the Arizona judges will need to travel half the time to Seattle. Presently, the circuit headquarters in San Francisco is equal distance, and the air routes convenient. This would not be the case in the new twelfth circuit. I don't know whether that's good or bad. My point is that it ought to be looked at. If we had been able to move ahead, and the House and the Senate agreed on the study, it would have been done by now. The study would have been done by now. It is a year and a half ago. It would have been done by now. Instead, we are faced with another arbitrary proposal for a split. We are rushing it through. It is an arbitrary split. No one has looked at costs, or at fair distribution of judges; no one has heard from a judge or from a bar association on this split; and no members of any of the bars of any of the States have indicated their support for this--none, zero, zilch, none. October 1, it goes into play. It does not make sense. 
How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would be happy to respond. I am reading from a letter dated July 18, signed by Procter Hug, Chief Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. What he 
points out is--he is using what I believe is current caseload. I would be happy to share this with the Senator. I read this accurately: 
The total caseload filings in California, Nevada, Guam and the Northern Marianas would be 5,448. The filings in Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington would be 3,012. 
The point is, with 13 judges, the twelfth circuit would have 239 cases per judge. The ninth circuit would have 363 cases per judge. That is an unfair allocation of cases per judge.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for his excellent comment. I agree with him 100 percent. This is the wrong way for the wrong reason. The reasons are regional. The reasons are, if we do not like the decision, we don't appoint the judges. 
One-third of the ninth circuit today is vacant. I repeat, one-third of the judgeships on the ninth circuit today are vacant. And I do not believe that there is a plan to appoint another judge to the ninth circuit until we bow to this. What we are bowing to is something that has never been heard, never been studied in the 4 1/2 years that I have been on the Judiciary Committee of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a July 14, 1997 statement of the Arizona bar in opposition to this split, a statement of the California bar in objection to this, a recent letter from the Governor of the State of California in objection to this, a July 22 letter from the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in objection to this, a letter from the chief judge of the ninth circuit in objection to this, and the chief judge's letter on the unfair allocation of judges. I also have in my files letters objecting to the earlier proposals to split the circuit. These include letters of objection from the State Bar of Nevada, the State Bar of Montana, the State Bar of Hawaii, the Los Angeles County Bar, lawyers' representatives of the ninth circuit, and the Judicial Council.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be pleased to answer that question. I was first made aware of the problems that current property transfer laws poses by the sheriff of Riverside County in southern California. The sheriff's office has obtained, by short-term lease, a portion of March Air Reserve Base. The sheriff's office has been using this land for joint law enforcement and fire and rescue training. This legislation will allow the sheriff's office to apply directly to the General Services Administration, which will coordinate the application and approval process with the Department of Justice and FEMA to transfer the necessary property. Once again, I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator Barbara Boxer and I are introducing the Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997. This legislation is nearly identical to H.R. 858 sponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressman Wally Herger and passed by the House last week on a vote of 429 to 1. 
The House vote is remarkable for two reasons: 
First, any legislation involving a controversial issue--particularly on one as contentious as forest management --that receives 429 votes is remarkable in and of itself. 
Second, the process by which this legislation evolved is really, I think, groundbreaking, and it deserves to be recognized. 
I first met the Quincy Library Group back in 1992 when I was running for the Senate, and was then very impressed with what they were trying to do. 
The overwhelming House vote is a real victory for local communities like Quincy which seek to avoid the polarizing--and often paralyzing--battles that have characterized forest management issues for the last decade. 
The Quincy Library Group is a local coalition of timber industry representatives, environmentalists, citizens, and elected officials in Plumas, Lassen, and Sierra Counties, CA, who came together to resolve their long-standing conflicts over timber management on the national forest lands in their area. 
They had seen first hand the seemingly ever present conflict between timber harvesting and jobs, environmental laws and protection of their communities and forests, and the devastation of massive forest fires. They also saw that a practical solution to the conflict between timber interests and environmental interests were both going to be wiped out one day by uncontrollable wildfires. And so they tried to get together and talk things out. 
They decided to meet in a quiet, non-confrontational 
environment--the main room of the Quincy Public Library. Hence, they became known as the Quincy Library Group. 
They began their dialog in the recognition that they shared the common goal of fostering forest health, ecological integrity, an adequate timber supply for area mills, and economic stability for their community. 
So, after a year-and-a-half of negotiation, the Quincy Library Group developed an alternative management plan for the Lassen National Forest, Plumas National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest. 
This legislation is the result. The bill we introduce today implements the Quincy Library Group's plan. 
I know that some environmental organizations had concerns about aspects of this legislation, and some may still oppose it. 
But let me make something very clear: As I stated when I met with the Quincy Library Group, in order to have my support, the legislation had to explicitly state that all activities would be carried out consistent with all applicable Federal environmental laws, both substantive and procedural. The administration made this requirement clear as well. 
The House bill and this legislation do so. 
Another condition for my support, and that of the administration, was that the legislation must authorize sufficient funds to carry out the plan, so that funds will not be diverted from other important programs like wildlife protection, grazing and recreation. 
The House bill and this legislation authorize appropriations to do so. 
With these key provisions in place, I believe this legislation deserves strong support and swift passage. 
Specifically, this legislation: 
Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement the Quincy Library Group's forest management proposal on designated lands in the Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests for 5 years as a demonstration of 
community-based consensus forest management; 
Protects the California spotted owl and riparian areas by excluding all spotted owl habitat in the pilot project area from logging and other resource management activities during the 5-year pilot project, and requiring the Forest Service to follow the scientific analysis team guidelines for riparian system protection; 
Calls for the construction of fuel breaks on 40,000 to 60,000 acres a year; 
Provides for group selection on 0.57 percent of the project area annually as well as individual tree selection uneven-aged forest management; 
Limits the total acreage subject to forest management activities to 70,000 acres annually; 
Requires a program of riparian management, including wide protection zones and riparian restoration projects; 
Requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement prior to the commencement of the pilot project; 
Authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out the Quincy Library Group pilot project; 
Directs the Forest Service to amend the land and resource management plans for the Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to consider adoption of the Quincy Library Group plan in the forest management plans; 
Requires an annual report to Congress on the status of the pilot project, including the source and use of funds, the acres treated and description of the results, economic benefits to the local communities, and activities planned for the following year; and finally, 
Requires a scientific assessment of the Quincy Library Group project to be commenced at the midpoint of the project and submitted to Congress by July 1, 2002. 
At the suggestion of the environmental community, and with the concurrence of the Quincy Library Group, I have added language to the House version of the bill to provide 
additional environmental safeguards. These additions will ensure that there will be no road building or timber harvesting on the lands the Quincy Library Group plan designated as off base, plan designates certain lands as deferred, and require the annual reports and the final report on the Quincy Library Group project to include a report on any adverse environmental impacts of the pilot project. Finally, it is our intention that areas of late successional emphasis identified in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem project report also be protected from resource management activities during the pilot project, and I will seek committee report language on this issue. 
What all this means is that as a result of the Quincy Library Group pilot project: 
The threat of catastrophic forest fires will be reduced, through the clearing of underbrush and thinning of the smaller trees; 
Enough jobs in the forests will be provided to keep the local mills in operation and the communities in existence; and 
Forest health will be improved, riparian areas will be restored, and biological diversity maintained. 
Mr. President, I believe the Quincy Library Group deserves a great deal of credit and respect for approaching a tough issue with the goal of finding common ground. 
There is a lot of common ground. They all live in the area. They all work there. They raise their children there. They all care about both the environment and the industry that provides jobs to the region. They wanted to work out a solution instead of continuing the take-no-prisoners-approach of endless litigation and standoff. 
I believe the solution-based approach demonstrated by the Quincy Library Group should be supported by the Congress, and that is why I committed months ago to introduce legislation based on this group's efforts. 
On an issue like forest management and timber harvesting, many local variables are involved and must be considered to find workable solutions: 
For example, the wildfire threat in Tennessee is not the same as it is in California. 
And the economic impact of the timber industry may be different in Hayfork, CA than it is in Juneau, AK. 
The bottom line is that, as long as certain basic standards of environmental law are met, this pilot project will demonstrate whether a local initiative can be successful in developing a forest management plan that works to protect the old growth trees, endangered species, and jobs for the community. 
And based on that belief I am pleased to support their efforts by sponsoring this legislation in the U.S. Senate.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado. I'm delighted to see the Senator from New York on the floor. I am hopeful that Senator Faircloth will join us here, since the Senator moved this as an amendment to the appropriations bill in committee. I very much appreciate that and have enjoyed working with him on this matter. 
Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment about breast cancer. I think every Member of this body was aware that we unanimously passed a sense-of-the-Senate not too long ago urging that more money be devoted to research for cancer. Also, in the women's community, and, really, I think still the majority population of this country, there is rising and enormous concern about breast cancer. 
The amendment I am making today on behalf of myself and a number of others. I want to mention that just before the recess, in this very Chamber, 51 Senators said they would cosponsor the breast cancer research stamp bill (S. 726) which creates a breast cancer research stamp with 1 cent above the rate of first-class postage. Members thought it was a good idea. Well, I need to move this because I very much fear it will not happen if I don't take the opportunity that we have today to bring this matter forward. 
Let me begin by saying that this is a wellspring from the breast cancer community. This measure is supported by the American Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, Association of Operating Room Nurses, California Health Collaborative, the YWCA, and I could go on and on. 
Representative Fazio in the House has introduced the same legislation with 100 cosponsors in January of this year. It is my understanding that Representative Molinari talked to the Speaker and is putting it on a calendar which will move it rapidly in the House. 
The idea for this legislation came from a physician in Sacramento, CA, an oncologist; and Representative Fazio brought it to the attention of the House as the original sponsor. This oncologist has treated some 1,000 women for breast cancer. And he, like physicians all over this country in the health community, has seen a really startling rise in breast cancer. In the 1950's, 1 in 20 women developed breast cancer. Today, the incidence is one in eight, and growing. It kills 46,000 women a year. Every 12 minutes an American woman dies of breast cancer. It is the leading cause of cancer death for women between the ages of 35 and 52, and it is the second leading cause of death in all women. 
So, today, 1.8 million women in America are diagnosed with breast cancer, and 1 million women, in addition to that, don't know they have breast cancer. This year, 184,300 new breast cancer cases will be diagnosed, and 17,100 of those in California. 
One of the interesting things is that the breast cancer rates differ throughout the United States. The San Francisco Bay Area has one of the highest breast cancer rates in the world. Rates in the Northeastern United States are substantially higher than in the South. Some believe in the medical community that environmental factors may contribute as much as 90 percent to breast cancer. The rates vary among countries. Women in Japan have about five times less breast cancer than women in the United States. And when people migrate they tend to acquire the cancer rates closer to those of the newly adopted countries within a generation. So within a generation, we find that reduced tendency for cancer increases. 
We have invested as a country, about $2 million in breast cancer research. The funding has quadrupled since 1990. There is still no cure. The national commitment to cancer research has been stagnant since 1980. Today, NIH can fund only 23 percent of their applications. The NIH budget is less than 1 percent of the Federal budget. And I believe the latest polls show that 80 percent of the people of this country believe that cancer research and medical research is an appropriate cause of action for the Federal Government. 
The National Cancer Institute in 1996 could fund 26 percent of their applications. That is a drop from 32 percent in 1992. 
So the idea came from Sacramento, from the oncologist who treated 1,000 women with breast cancer. What if we had a unique trial project, an optional stamp of 1 cent above whatever the first class rate was, where breast cancer groups and women all across this Nation who care have the option to buy that stamp, and 1 cent would go for breast cancer research? The administration costs incurred by the post office would be absorbed by that additional 1 cent. 
I have had an occasion to discuss this with the Postmaster General. He is not in favor of it. He is not in favor of it because it has not been done before. And it has not been done because there are those that say, `If we do it for this, why don't we do it for that? If we do it for women, we should to it for men.' 
Well, we are in an era of diminishing resources. We all know that. Everybody has looked at cuts. This is not a cut. This is a unique thing. It is a trial project. If it works, we learn something from it. If it doesn't work, no money is lost from the Federal Treasury, or from the post office. 
One of the things I believe every Member of this body has seen, whether it is in `The Race for the Cure' or the women that come into our offices, is a very unusual resilience in the breast cancer survivor community. They are climbing mountains, they are showing they can survive. They have banded together in support groups. It is a wonderfully unusual thing. They would like this to be done. They are in these Halls lobbying for it. They are in my office. I know they are in Senator Faircloth's office, and they have been in other offices saying, `Give us a chance. We will use this as fundraisers. We will go out and buy first-class stamps for a cent above the rate. We will sell them to our members. We will get our members to do this.' 
I think it is a worthy trial. It is a worthy project. Whether it works, I don't know. They tell me that if 10 percent of the first-class stamps were bought through this option it would produce $60 million. I don't know whether it will or not. I know that there is an enthused, energized community out there. You may see them wearing one design for a breast cancer stamp on their lapels, walking around the Capitol. I know that they care and care very deeply. 
When I first introduced the bill earlier this year, I had some sponsors on the bill. They came to me, and said, `You know, you haven't been working very hard. You only have 6 or 7 co-sponsors.' So because we were on the floor for 3 hours before the Fourth of July break, I went around to each member, and 51 Senators said, `Yes.' They would vote for it. `Put my name down.' And I did. 
They are on this piece of paper in front of me. 
This is an opportunity to cast that vote. This is an opportunity to try something new. 
People will come before us and say, `Oh, my goodness. If we do this for breast cancer, we should do it for prostate cancer.' Well, maybe we should. I don't know. But the proposal out there is this one, and it is all throughout the United States now. 
People will say, `Oh. Why don't we do it for AIDS?' Well, the breast cancer community has made this proposal. They are united about it. They want to try it. 
I have agreed to sponsor it in the Senate. Senator Faircloth has agreed to be a cosponsor, along with Senator D'Amato, Senator Kent Conrad, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Feingold, Senator Johnson, Senator Kerry, Senator Mack, Senator Reid, Senator Thurmond, and Senator Torricelli. I can't put all of the 51 names on this because I didn't specifically say it would be an amendment. I said, a bill. 
So I am told I should call everybody again. But I believe there is the opportunity. I think the case has been made, if you see what happens to women afflicted with breast cancer. And you see this amazing surviver community and what they are willing to do. In a way, this stamp is a tribute to that kind of resolute spirit that can conquer what for many has been a mortal disease. 
So I am hopeful, Mr. President, despite those who I know on the Appropriations Committee that do not want to see this happen. They don't want to do it on this bill. But if it doesn't happen here, perhaps it won't, and we will send out a message to the breast cancer survival community that we will not try anything new. 
If you have a disease, you will try anything to get rid of it. I think this body should try one new thing, and let's see if it works, and let's see if we can produce 60, 70, 80, or 90 million new dollars for breast cancer research. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
As we know, with anything done the first time you never really quite know what it is going to do. I have had estimates. The group supporting this has done some research. I know what they have told me. I cannot make any guarantee to this body that it will produce a lot of money. I do know that it is worth a try, in my opinion. It is important to people. There is a movement behind it. 
The breast cancer stamp now exists as of now and it has no fundraising connected to it. It is simply a first-class stamp. This has the ability, for people that want to do so, to buy for the reason of raising an additional cent. I think every one of us know people immediately close to us that are suffering from breast cancer. I happen to believe the women of America are going to respond to this. I think young women are going to respond to it. I think you are going to see interesting ways that people are going to sell first-class stamps. I think that is good for the post office. It is good for the mail, and hopefully it will be good for breast cancer. 
I know I didn't buy an Elvis Presley stamp. What was the other stamp? I didn't buy the other breast cancer stamp. I will buy these. I think there are many others like me. I don't know how many. But I think it is worth a try. 
I thank the Senator for his comments. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, and I thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity. 
I didn't come to the floor prepared to speak on this amendment. I came to speak on a another amendment. Having said that, I must say I am sorry this sense-of-the-Senate amendment has been raised. I think it would be a big mistake to pass this sense of the Senate that would essentially say to the People's Republic of China, `we are going to isolate you from the rest of the world.' Make no mistake about it, that is what this amendment says. 
Anyone that has had a look at China knows that, historically, China has never wanted to interrelate with the rest of the world. Those of us who were in Hong Kong for the handover heard many comments about the British occupation of Hong Kong as a kind of bounty from the opium wars where Britain forced on China the opium trade, and the whole British control of Hong Kong as a colony developed from that time. 
Having said that, the question is, really, is anything productive solved by forcing China into a position of isolationism, strengthening the hard-liners in China, providing a setback to the development of the rule of law and, most importantly, providing a setback to the economic democracy that is now developing all throughout the eastern seaports of the People's Republic of China? My answer to that is no. My answer to that is it signals to China that, effectively, Senate policy at the very least would be to try to contain China, isolate China, and not allow China to be a normal trading party with the United States of America. Internationally, that signals catastrophe. 
Now, what does it mean for the United States? For the United States, and as a Californian, in my State, with one-third of our economy now dependent on Asia--not necessarily on China, but Asia--it means a loss of jobs. For the rest of the United States, it means a loss of jobs. The Senator from Kentucky just alluded to what it would mean for Hong Kong. He alluded to the fact that we heard no democratic leader say MFN should be denied China. Exactly the opposite. We heard democratic leaders in Hong Kong saying to deny China MFN would negatively impact the people of Hong Kong. 
They estimate it would take economic growth and cut it by half, from 5 percent to 2 1/2 percent. They say that it would cost up to 86,000 jobs in Hong Kong, and that even a partial cancellation, even a 6-month extension, would create a kind of uncertainty that would disturb the market in Hong Kong. 
I think it is misguided to think you can deny a nation as large as China, the largest nation in the world, normal trading relations--not special trading relations, nothing special about it, but normal trading relations--and do anything other than shoot ourselves in the foot, because a whole ripple effect would be felt throughout the United States. And the flip side in China would be the growing isolation, the hard-liners being able to say, `I told you so.' 
Right now in China it is widely speculated that the next premier will be a man whose name is Zhu Rongji. He was at one time the mayor of Shanghai. I know him. He also is the author of the marketplace economy for China. He supported Shanghai as the first independent economic zone, which really was the first of these dynamic economic zones, and then, second, he has supervised an amazing transformation of the marketplace. 
Today, only 50 percent of the companies in China are wholly owned by the central government. It used to be 100 percent of the companies were owned by the central government; 25 percent of these are in private hands today. They are becoming more competitive, more efficient. Sure, it is difficult because the big employers of China are the centrally owned companies. So it takes time. 
In direct response to the distinguished Senator's concern about human rights--because I share these concerns very, very much--I have been trying for 6 years now, almost twice a year, to get the Chinese Government just to sit down with the Dalai Lama, just to try to come to terms with him with respect to cultural and economic preservation of Tibetans within Tibet. So far, I have not been successful. I don't expect to stop trying. 
But during the 6-year period, what I have noticed has been interesting within the rest of China. What I have noticed is a growth in the rule of law. What I have noticed is that the Chinese are now eager to modernize their commercial codes, their criminal codes. The next step needs to be an independent judiciary; by this, I mean independent from party control, a judiciary that is paid well, that is seen to be independent. Qiao Shi, head of the National People's Congress, proposed a limitation of administrative detention today in China--picking up an individual, and holding them in custody cannot be done for more than 30 days. That is a step forward. 
China has lived for 5,000 years under the rule of man; the rule of law is going to take some time. I commend the distinguished Senator for his commitment to this issue. If he had visited China in the late sixties or the early seventies, when Richard Nixon went to China and negotiated the Shanghai communique in 1972, it was a very much more constricted China. No one would have talked to the distinguished Senator. Everybody dressed alike. Everybody marched to the sound of the same drummer. The red books of the Cultural Revolution were still evident on the streets. The music still blared every morning. The controls were evident. 
It is a very different China today. None of that is true today. People will talk. They will say what they think. There is a freer lifestyle. There is an improved standard of living. I believe that if you have an economic democracy, a social democracy will follow one day, just as sure as the sun comes up every morning, because the more people see the economic marketplace, the freedom that trade gives them, the increased educational levels, the benefit it produces, they then enter into the dialog and they learn about other cultures. 
So I believe that from the days of the 1960's, of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath, really lasting up to 1979, 1980, in the ensuing 17 years after 1980, there have been major changes within China. What we need to do is engage China, send working teams over on a regular basis, sit down with Chinese leaders, enable them to understand how our Government works and what our concerns are and what our national interests are and, I think, bring China into the mainstream of world leadership, not isolate it. Nothing sends a message of isolationism and containment for China more strongly than denying normal trading relations. 
Mr. President, I believe this amendment should be defeated. It will not bring about a positive result for the ends that both the distinguished Senator and I would like to see. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
I rise in strong opposition, and I hope it will be robust opposition, to the Dodd-McCain amendment, which would gut the narcotics certification process and replace it with absolutely nothing. 
Mr. President, I just heard the distinguished Senator say `trust General McCaffrey.' With all due respect to General McCaffrey, this is such a volatile and unpredictable area that it is impossible to know what to believe. It is understandable that General McCaffrey could stand before the world and say, `I trust General Gutierrez Rebollo. He is an honest man.' 
Whoops. The next thing we know, he is on the take. My goodness, how can you gut a process and replace it with nothing except trust when we have already found that trust to be wanting. 
Now, let me say for a moment, I want to divide my remarks into three parts. The first is foreign assistance and who should get foreign assistance as a product of this amendment. The second is a certification process and what it has actually done in Colombia. The third is Mexico postsummit and what has not happened. 
This debate is really about whether we should give foreign aid and support development loans to other nations with no strings attached even if we know that the leaders and government of the country do nothing to assist in stopping the flow of drugs to the United States. 
I think we need to clear up a major misconception about the debate here today on the drug certification process. This is not a debate about whether drug certification is a process that hurts our relations with our allies in the hemisphere because we sit and pass judgment on other nations. This is a debate about foreign assistance and under what circumstances the United States should offer assistance to other nations. With the exception of humanitarian assistance, the United States provides foreign assistance not only because America has a great and good tradition of assisting other states, but because we want to encourage certain types of behavior--because we want cooperation on political, security, or economic policy. 
The distinguished manager of the bill, Senator McConnell, has said it very well today again and again. He said, `Foreign aid is not an entitlement program. Just because you received it last year does not mean you should receive it this year. You have to earn it.' 
A nation that does not fully cooperate with our efforts to keep drugs from reaching our schools and our children has not earned the right to receive foreign assistance from the United States. We are not obligated to provide assistance. We provide this assistance because it is in our interest to do so, because it encourages behavior and policies which we support. Before we provide money, we have every right to expect that we will get 
cooperation from those nations to which we provide it. Indeed, we have a duty to our constituents not to send their tax dollars to a country if it is undermining our counternarcotics effort. That, in fact, is why we have the certification process as an instrument for cooperation--not because we want or enjoy the opportunity to sit in judgment on other nations. It is not a policy for faint hearts. I admit that. It is not about rating who we like or who we do not like. It is not about saying you are good and you are bad. 
The current certification process may not be perfect, but it accomplishes something very important. Once a year it focuses the attention of our executive branch and of other nations whose cooperation we need on what is perhaps the most crucial national security issue this country faces. 
If anyone had to ask me what is America's No. 1 national security threat, I would say drugs, drugs, drugs. There is no other. It is my firm belief that without the drug certification process, we would have no debate of this kind. So I am not sorry we have this process. I think it focuses our efforts, and, even when it bruises feelings of other nations, it ultimately produces more cooperation, not less. 
Now, let us for a moment look at Colombia, a country which we did decertify 2 years ago. The evidence is clear. When we decertified Colombia, the reaction was initially very harsh, and then, very quickly, Colombian cooperation began to improve. 
Colombian officials came to my office just a month or so ago, and here is what they told me: In the last year, Colombia has fumigated 20,000 hectares of cocoa, the most ever; destroyed 800 drug laboratories; began working with the United States to develop a radar system to allow the government to secure control of all Colombian airspace, an air control system that allowed them to force down approximately 50 small drug-runner planes--force down 50 small drug-runner planes--which would have otherwise evaded Colombian air traffic control. 
They have begun working with the U.S. Coast Guard to develop strategies for intercepting narcotics traffickers at sea; they have passed tough new laws on asset forfeiture for narco-traffickers, and they are implementing them; they have arrested and convicted at least 5 politicians I know of, and incarcerated them for taking money into their campaign funds from narco-traffickers; they have passed tough new penalties increasing sentences by 4 and 10 times for drug-related offenses; and they have instituted aggressive new proceedings against the Cali and Medellin cartel leaders. The Medellin cartel leaders are all in prison. The cartel is no more. And the Cali cartel is in the process of disintegrating. 
Does anyone honestly believe that Colombia would have taken these steps in this fashion if it had not been for the U.S. drug certification process? I think not. And as a matter of fact, I am of the view that if this continues, Colombia should be recertified, and we should say thank you for working on this problem in the way in which you have. 
Before Colombia was decertified, the powers of the cocaine cartels grew. The number of hectares planted with coca grew. The corruption in the Colombian judicial and political systems grew. But when the United States said `enough' and decertified Colombia, all of a sudden the Colombian Government did an aboutface. I think that this example can affect other nations as well. Unfortunately, much of the trafficking and the transportation of drugs has moved to Mexico, and this is the next frontier of the battle. 
Now, let's compare the situation in Colombia today with that in Mexico today post-summit, post-Presidential visit to Mexico. Still, not a single extradition of a Mexican national on drug charges. I say on drug charges. On other charges perhaps. Despite all of the debate last year, despite the economic summit, not a single extradition of a Mexican national wanted in this country for drug charges has been carried out by the Mexican Government. 
There are continued restrictions on the operations of United States drug enforcement agents in Mexico. Even when working in cooperation with their Mexican counterparts they still cannot protect themselves if they are working on the other side of the border. They still are not allowed to carry weapons. Coast Guard ships in pursuit of trafficking vessels on the sea still need to give Mexico 30 days' notice before putting into port to refuel. There are no air or maritime agreements to forge a joint approach for interdiction of narco-trafficking. There is still massive corruption at all levels of the government, law enforcement and the military, prosecutors killed, judges murdered, and, most recently, the plastic surgeon that did the surgery on Amado Carrillo-Fuentes has reportedly--I cannot verify it, but reportedly--disappeared. 
Drug cartels are running rampant in Mexico. Corruption along the U.S. border--and I will speak for California--has never been worse, never been worse. The cartels are now controlling street gangs in Los Angeles, and this is where I stand up and say `I have had enough.' 
My distinguished colleague and friend from Connecticut read from a number of editorials. You know, I judge stories by the by-line. There is a reporter whom I respect very much. His name is Marcus Stern. He writes for the San Diego Union Tribune. This is a headline on the 12th of this month, `Drugs still flown over the border, say agents.' Let me quote from part of this article:  
But a dozen military and civilian officials directly involved with the counter-drug effort along the California-Mexico border said in interviews during recent weeks that the skies in San Diego and Imperial counties are largely out of control and are still being heavily used by drug traffickers. 
It's pretty much wide open * * * * * * * * 
But the antidrug officials interviewed in recent weeks said military observation posts deployed along the border are spotting a half-dozen planes a week flying into Imperial County alone. The planes are flying low at dusk with their lights out, the officials said. 
This is happening every day on the border. It is the wrong time to do gut the certification process. The administration has agreed to give us a report on September 1 on progress made by Mexico. That is pursuant to our Senate-passed resolution. I, for one, am eagerly awaiting it, to see what progress has been made. At this stage, I know of no real progress that has been made. 
The sponsors of this amendment argue that Mexico fails to cooperate because of the certification process. They argue that Mexican pride and nationalism make it difficult to appear to respond to American threats. That's nonsense. It is baloney. 
President Zedillo, whom we all believe is committed to fighting the drug traffickers, has said repeatedly that drug trafficking is the No. 1 threat to Mexico's national security. Well, either it is or it isn't. If it's such a grave threat to Mexico's national security, they should cooperate with us in their own interests, not because we make demands. Extradite drug pushers, allow U.S. Coast Guard ships to refuel, allow DEA agents working the other side of the border to carry firearms to protect themselves. I believe we have every legitimate reason to make clear we will not accept anything less than full cooperation. 
The whole issue is an issue right now, precisely, I believe, because the administration was not honest in the certification process in dealing with Mexico. As much as I, too, would like to see a more flexible certification process, the situation with Mexico, for me, underscores exactly why we need a certification process. 
I come from a State that is perhaps the most impacted State in the Union with these drugs. Yes, cocaine prices have dropped on the streets of Los Angeles in the last 5 years. It is not because of a certification process. It is because we have not had the guts to do what we should have done and decertify Mexico. I believe that's the reason. To replace a policy which may come to some fruition this next year with nothing is wrong. 
I agree with the idea of a commission. I am happy to have commissions. I learned when I was mayor, if you didn't know what to do, appoint a committee. Better still, appoint a commission. 
But I know what to do. We have to stop those overflights. We have to see that the border is enforced. We have to press for cooperation. We have to have extradition for those for whom there is a bona fide American arrest subpoena or warrant who traffic in narcotics. 
So, I am not prepared to vote for an amendment that leaves us with no plan but simply takes Mexico off the hook: No evaluation this fall, no ability to read the September 1 report presented by the administration and make a decision as to whether there has or has not been any progress, then wait 2 or 3 years for this undefined, ephemeral `something.' 
Respectfully, I can't turn around and just depend on trust when another nation's leading anti-drug official turns out to be on the take. What's wrong with our intelligence? How can that happen? We don't question it even. How can that happen? It did. And that, I believe, typifies our drug policy with Mexico. Frankly, it has been one of spin. I, for one, am not going to buy the spin. I want to see the results on the street. 
When cocaine prices on the street corners of Los Angeles rise, I know something has happened. When I pick up this newspaper and, instead of seeing `Drugs still flown over the border,' I see `Five Planes Downed, Pilot, Copilot Arrested, Two Tons of Cocaine Recovered,' then I know we have something going on on the streets, as they say. So, that is what I am looking for. When I see Mexico say, `Here are the cartel leaders, we are going to bring them to trial, we are going to bust the cartels,' then I know we have something going. 
So, until then, to do away with the certification process, I think, is to say to the people of the United States, `We are going to do nothing for the next 3 years.' I, for one, am not going to be party to that policy.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would greatly appreciate it if my colleagues, the chairman of the appropriations Committee and the ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee would join with me in a colloquy regarding the committee's support for a firefighting demonstrator kit for the UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter for the Army National Guard. It is my understanding that the Army National Guard needs and wants improved capability on its UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter to enable them to more effectively augment the firefighting capabilities of State and local government other Federal agencies. 
To this end, the Army is pursuing a cooperative research and development agreement or CRADA with Sikorsky Aircraft to obtain this demonstrator aircraft. Once received, this modified Black Hawk will be used in a 3-month, National Guard, operational suitability test with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill which expresses the Sense of Congress that U.S. payment for the cost of NATO enlargement is contingent on our NATO allies' willingness to pay their fair share of the costs of NATO enlargement as well. 
I was concerned and surprised to read French President Chirac's statement last week that `France does not intend to raise its contribution to NATO because of the cost of enlargement.' 
Mr. President, we all know that NATO enlargement will cost money. And those costs must be borne fairly by all members. 
If France or Germany or any other member of NATO is unwilling to pay its fair share, then this seems to me to be a faulty foundation for the expansion of NATO. 
Indeed, as an article in the July 14-20 issue of Defense News stated: 
Its decision to admit new members threatens to tear the Western alliance asunder if the European allies fail to shoulder a larger proportion of NATO's future security costs, according to U.S. and European diplomats and analysts. 
The purpose of this amendment is to make clear that the United States is willing to pay its share of the cost of NATO enlargement. No more. No less. 
But this amendment also makes clear that if the Europeans are unwilling to pay their share of the costs, then the United States will not pay either. 
The bottom line is that the costs should be fairly met and paid for by all Alliance members. The United States can not and should not pick up the share of European countries unwilling to do their part. 
This amendment, I believe, sends a strong message to our European allies as we enter into the NATO enlargement process that if we are to enlarge the alliance it must be done fairly, and it must be done right.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns of my colleagues on this issue. I think we all agree that there are few more important foreign policy issues facing the United States then ensuring that the Bosnian peace process succeeds. 
I am pleased with the effort has been made by Senators on both sides of this issue to see that we did not need to vote on a cut-off of funds for our ground forces in Bosnia. 
However, it is precisely because I want to see the peace process succeed that I feel that I must nevertheless voice my concerns about this amendment. 
It is my belief that our presence in Bosnia must be one without any preconditions as to time. We must stay long enough to make sure that the job we started gets done, and gets done right. 
Any effort to set a date to cut off funds, as Senator Feingold proposed in his amendment, or which suggests a firm date for the withdrawal of all U.S. ground combat troops, as Senator Levin's second degree amendment to Senator Feingold's amendment does, telegraphs U.S. policy to those who would oppose us, and to those who oppose the implementation of the Dayton Accords. 
I do not think that there is a single Member of this Chamber that does not wish that 1 year had been sufficient time for the Dayton Accords to be implemented, and that U.S. troops were not still needed in the Balkans. 
But the simple fact of the matter is that there are aspects of the Dayton Accords which have not yet been fully implemented--aspects which require a little more time if they are going to have a chance to take root. 
Earlier this year voter registration began for the municipal elections scheduled for Bosnia this September. True, I wish that conditions existed to hold these elections last year when they were originally planned. But those conditions did not exist then; they do now. 
What sort of signal will we send to those who support peace and democracy in Bosnia if, even as they are preparing for municipal elections, we are telling them that the troops who safeguard the peace process and democracy are on the way out? 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and his Party of Democratic Action have formed a coalition with a number of opposition parties to seek broad-minded support in the municipal elections. This amendment will cut his legs out from under him, and give strength to those who would like to see Bosnia destroyed. 
This fall Serbia will hold a presidential election. It will be a difficult campaign for Milosevic's opponents, but not an impossible one. That Milosevic's grip on power might be lessened would have been inconceivable a year ago. It is not inconceivable now. 
But setting a date for cutting off funds for U.S. forces or for the withdrawal of all U.S. ground combat troops without giving the President flexibility will all but guarantee Milosevic's re-election. 
I do not believe that supporters of this amendment intend it as a boost to Milosevic's campaign, but that is exactly what it will do. 
Right now in the Republika Srpska there is a power struggle going on between President Plavsic and pro-Karadzic hardliners based in Pale. 
How this struggle will play out, and whether the more moderate supporters of President Plavsic can retain control, or whether the pro-Karadzic forces will seize control of the Republic Srpska has profound implications for the future of peace and stability in the Balkans. 
The pro-Karadzic forces, the Pale hardliners, the war criminals, have adopted a wait it out strategy. They think that the United States will be withdrawing next year without any follow-on force to SFOR. If they just bide their time, they believe, come next summer they will be able to overturn Dayton and destroy any hope for Bosnia. 
This amendment will tell them that they have won. 
I do not think that giving support to the Pale hardliners is the intent of the supporters of this amendment, but that is exactly what this amendment does. 
It will tell them that they are right; all they have to do is wait, and that the United States will leave without fully implementing Dayton, without following through on our commitment to create a secure and stable Bosnia. 
After we have done so much we cannot abandon Bosnia now. 
It is true there are still unsettled issues with refugees, with reconstruction, and with indicted war criminals in the former 
Yugoslavia. And again, I would not argue that we did not want or hope that these matters would have been taken care of by now. 
But having said that, setting a date for a troop pullout will not help us to resettle refugees, to speed economic reconstruction, or to apprehend indicted war criminals. 
Instead, it will send a message to refugees that they cannot hope to be safely resettled; to those trying to rebuild their businesses that they should not bother; and to war criminals that they only have to remain in hiding a little bit longer, and then they will be free to commit their ghastly crimes once again. 
The continued presence of U.S. forces is critical in keeping the peace process on track. And the fact of the matter is that the United States-led peacekeeping force is the glue that holds peace process in the former Yugoslavia together. 
Those who suggest we set a date certain for a troop pullout argue that we have already spent a lot of money pursuing peace in the Balkans, and that to continue to stay will cost us even more. 
But to set a date to pull out now will all but guarantee that the peace process will break down, and that all that we have invested in Bosnia in the past year and a half will be wasted. 
Establishing a date certain for a United States pullout will set in motion a clock whereby the forces of nationalism and ethnic hatred in the former Yugoslavia will begin to plan for renewed war. 
And, if war breaks out again in the Balkans and spreads elsewhere in the region, it will be far more costly for the U.S. to have to intervene once again than if we retain the flexibility to maintain our presence. 
Those who suggest we need to set a date for a United States pullout from Bosnia also argue that without this clear end-date there is danger of mission creep, and of Bosnia becoming a quagmire. 
Just the opposite. Anyone who has paid attention to what has happened with the NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia for the past year and a half can only come to one conclusion: SFOR has a clear mandate. There has been no mission creep and there is not going to be any mission creep. 
In fact, concern for the safety of our troops would dictate that we allow the military to continue with planning based on their current mission and deployment, and to pull out on a schedule dictated by the military facts on the ground without having the Senate dangerously compromise their position by telegraphing our plans and intentions. 
In addition, this abrupt U.S. departure will almost certainly doom any effort to create some follow-on force or mechanism to insure the peace process continues. Again, I wish it were not the case. I wish that our European allies would act in a more decisive way without United States having to take the lead--but we are dealing with reality here. 
I fully support the spirit of Senator Levin's amendment: I too believe that Europe should take greater responsibility for Europe, and that a SFOR follow-on force led by Europe in the context of the European Security and Defense Identity should be the next phase of peacekeeping in Bosnia. 
But if the United States precipitously pulls out of Bosnia our European NATO allies may be unable to lead a follow-on force. What if United States ground combat troops are required in Bosnia until August 1, 1998, or even December 1, 1998, to effect a smooth, safe, transition? 
Indeed, under the dynamic set in motion by this amendment, if Europe wanted to lead such a follow-on mission in Bosnia with United States support it would be reasonable of them to question whether or not we would be there to support them. 
Do we really want to set a precedent here of giving our friends and allies reason to question whether the United States will be there to support them when they need our assistance? To send that sort of message would have tremendous implications--and none of them good--for U.S. interests throughout the globe. 
It is my hope, and I think that of many of my colleagues, that a European-led follow-on force to SFOR will take the lead in maintaining the peace in Bosnia come next June. But that follow-on force may require some United States military support and assistance, on the ground, in Bosnia. 
This amendment, by preventing the United States from supporting our European allies, will destroy any chance that such a European-led force could come into being. 
Both the President and the Secretary of Defense have suggested that United States forces will be able to pull out of Bosnia by June 30, 1998. There is no reason to doubt their word or intention. 
But, as my colleagues surely know, the unexpected may occur. There may be good reason to keep some or even a substantial United States force in Bosnia past next June. Or, there may be reason to pull our forces out sooner. The bottom line here is that we cannot and should not put our military in a disadvantageous position by setting a date certain for a pull out. 
It is my belief that if we continue to work the peace process, and give the President the discretion that, as Commander in Chief, he deserves, by the time United States forces prepare to leave Bosnia and Herzegovina, the peace process will have been given sufficient time to develop deep, sustainable, roots. 
To adopt this amendment will risk killing the peace process and all but condemns Bosnia to further bloodshed. 
Again, I would like to extend my appreciation to my colleagues on all sides of this issue who have worked hard to find a compromise. Nevertheless, I feel that I must I oppose this amendment and would urge my colleagues to oppose it as well.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the DOD authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. This is a responsible bill that recognizes the national security threats we face, and properly funds the operations and modernization accounts needed to support the finest military in the world. 
Over the past year, we have been constantly reminded that our military must be able to respond to a variety of threats all over the globe. The United States is unlike any other country in that we can identify important national interests in every region on the Earth, and our military must have the right equipment, training and resources to protect those interests. Our Armed Forces must be prepared for a variety of missions, from peacekeeping, humanitarian, and peace enforcement operations to rapid, full scale deployment. 
This authorization bill recognizes the missions and roles our Armed Forces will face and provides an appropriate level of funding. While the fiscal year 1998 DOD authorization bill is nearly $3 billion higher than the President's budget request, it keeps total defense spending $3.3 billion below last year's inflation adjusted level. Although some of my colleagues may think this a negligible reduction, this is the 13th year in a row where the U.S. defense budget is less than it was the year before. 
I believe this bill takes a significant step forward regarding DOD's depot maintenance policy. It maintains the public/private competition for depot maintenance workloads at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases which can save future taxpayer dollars. If the competitions for these workloads are won by the private sector, hundreds of millions of dollars in savings could be realized by avoiding the costs of new military construction, movement of the workload, and retraining workers at the remaining Air Logistics Centers. Privatization of non-core depot maintenance workloads is supported by Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dr. John White, Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Aerospace Industries Association, Business Executives for National Security, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Public/private competition is a good idea, and I am pleased this bill recognizes its value. 
This bill also moves to address the critical readiness issues by author- 
izing more than $77 billion in near-term readiness funding. This includes an increase of more than $1 billion for high priority programs such as ammunition procurement, flying hours, cold weather gear, and barracks renovation. 
This year's defense bill also recognizes the needs of our men and women in uniform. I believe the committee wisely includes additional military construction projects, adopts a single, price-based housing allowance based on a national index for housing costs, and a 2.8 percent pay raise to better our uniformed military's standard of living. 
I applaud the adoption of Senator Stevens' amendment, to which I was an original cosponsor, to create a position on the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a four-star general to represent the National Guard Bureau. The National Guard is a vital part of our armed services, serving in times of crisis both at home and abroad. A four-star general will give the National Guard, which now comprise 55 percent of our ground forces, equal consideration and input at the real decision making levels in the Department of Defense. 
I do not, however, support all the extra funds that were added to this bill. I felt it important to support of Senator Bingaman's amendment to cut $118 million from the Space Based Laser Program. I believe that a national missile defense is a laudable goal. There is, however, no immediate or even mid-term threat to U.S. security that suggests the need for the immediate development of this space based national missile defense system. Only Russia and China have nuclear-armed ICBM's that can reach the United States and China has no more than a dozen or so of these weapons. There is consensus within the national security and intelligence communities that it is very unlikely that additional countries can or will build ICBM's within the next two decades. 
I will continue to strongly support the funding of critical theater missile defense systems and a national missile defense system that meet projected threats and achieve an affordable ballistic missile defense. Under this scenario, should threats to the United States begin to materialize, we will have sufficient lead-time to respond to those threats, and dedicate higher funding levels to develop and deploy a national missile defense system. 
I also supported the Wellstone amendment to offset cuts in the veterans' health care budget by allowing the Secretary of Defense to transfer up to $400 million from DOD funds. I believe it is imperative that we support our veterans who have fought to guarantee us our freedom. The planned cuts in the VA will certainly have an effect on the availability and quality of health care and other essential services that are available to our veterans. I believe it would be only fair to give the Secretary of Defense the ability to transfer the funds which would offset the VA cuts, especially when this bill authorizes $2.6 billion more than the President's request. 
Finally, Mr. President, I believe the Senate has acted wisely in requiring a comprehensive study of the base closure process before any further base realignment and closure rounds can occur. As the senior senator from California, I have seen firsthand how cumbersome and nightmarish the BRAC process has been. Communities continue to struggle with the base reuse process. In addition, environmental cleanup of closed bases is proceeding much slower and at much greater cost than expected. Finally, there are no reliable figures to show how much the Department of Defense has saved in the prior BRAC rounds, much less reliable estimates for savings in future rounds. I will not vote for further base closure rounds until these problems are resolved.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, July 11, marks the second anniversary of the fall of the so-called safe area of Srebrenica, one of the three eastern enclaves in Bosnia. 
By most estimates, following the fall of Srebrenica over 8,000 Muslim refugees fleeing the Serb forces simply disappeared. Many of these refugees were old men, women, and children, killed in acts of inhuman cruelty. 
Even today, 2 years later, the vast majority of these people are still unaccounted for. 
Others from Srebrenica were luckier--forced to flee their homes as part of a brutal policy of ethnic cleansing. 
I am still haunted by an image from a picture that I saw in the newspaper shortly after the fall of Srebrenica. It was a picture of a young woman, a refugee from Srebrenica, around 20 years old, who climbed a tree, tied a rope around her neck, and hung herself. A photographer captured her lifeless body as it hung from the tree. 
Mr. President, I look at that picture and I think: What kind of nation are we if we can not see to it that the people who practiced rape, practiced genocide, practiced ethnic cleansing, are not brought to justice? We know who these people are. We know where they live. 
The fact is, of the 74 war criminals indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague, only 9 have been apprehended. 
Where is the conscience of the world? 
I first wrote to the President about this issue on September 11 of last year, following a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, at which administration witnesses provided testimony to the effect that there were no capable international or national institutions in Bosnia with both the authority and the ability to apprehend indicted war criminals. 
The President responded to this letter that `although the peace will not be complete until indicted war criminals are brought to justice,' IFOR would not hunt down war criminals, and that U.S. policy would be to `continue our efforts to press all parties to turn over indicted war criminals to the Tribunal.' 
In the months since then we have seen how willing the parties to Dayton have been to turn over indicted war criminals. 
When the IFOR mandate ended and IFOR was replaced by SFOR, I took up this issue with Secretary Perry, writing him on December 4 last year--again, following a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--that I believed that it was essential that the follow-on force have clear, unambiguous authority for apprehending war criminals or to provide more effective support to other authorities in carrying out this task. 
I received a response from the Department of Defense on February 18 of this year that again stated that the administration shared my concern on the importance of this issue, but that no additional efforts to apprehend war criminals would be forthcoming. 
I also took this question up with the other Democratic and Republican women of the Senate. The nine of us sent a letter to the President on March 3 of this year in which we requested that the President: 
. . . look at this problem as a top priority and indicate to us precisely how the international community might ensure the arrest and extradition to The Hague of those responsible for crimes against humanity. 
The President responded to us on April 11. His letter stressed the role of the International Tribunal in `establishing accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity . . .' The President also stated that:  
I share your sense of urgency and my Administration is committed to assisting the Tribunals in the apprehension and extradition of those indictees who remain at large. We are currently examining a variety of options in this regard. 
Frankly, I found the President's response to be inadequate. And in mid-April I wrote to both the President and the Secretary General of the United Nations urging an aggressive stand to see that indicted war criminals are brought to justice. 
As I stated in my April 21 letter to the President, it is my belief that: 
Unless the United States takes a position of aggressive leadership on this issue in the international community, we run the risk that future historians will conclude that the lessons of current U.S. foreign policy are that crimes against humanity, genocide, and the use of rape as an instrument of war are acceptable--and that those who perpetrate these crimes can do so with impunity. 
We would, moreover, put at risk all the gains of the Dayton process if we do not bring these war criminals to justice. 
The President responded to me on June 19, stating that, `My foreign policy team is examining several options to assist and enhance the ability of the Tribunal to bring indicted war criminals into custody.'

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President I rise today in opposition to the Cochran/Durbin amendment to the Defense Authorization bill. The amendment would bar the sale of many types of computers, denying export opportunities for American firms, shifting high-technology sales to international competitors and flooding the Commerce Department with export applications for routine computer sales. 
Rather than impose new restrictions, the Senate should adopt a substitute amendment, offered by Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota and my California colleague Barbara Boxer. The Grams/Boxer substitute would: 
Require the Commerce Department to improve its licensing process and provide more information to exporters, assisting exporters to identify suspicious potential purchasers and avoid questionable sales. 
Require the General Accounting Office to study the impact of proposed export restrictions and the impact of foreign availability of computers on U.S. exports. 
Rather than restrict a broad range of computer exports, the Grams/Boxer substitute amendment will help the administration and exporters distinguish between the potentially damaging sales that place us at risk and the routine computer sales.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support Senator Murray's amendment to repeal the provision of current law that prohibits a woman in the armed services from using her own funds to pay for an abortion in an overseas U.S. military facility. I support this amendment for several reasons. 
First, under several Supreme Court decisions, a woman clearly has a right to choose. A woman does not give up that right or it is not obliterated because she serves in the U.S. military or is married to a U.S. servicemember. 
Second, women based in the United States and using a military facility in this country are not prohibited from using their own funds to pay for an abortion. Barring the use of U.S. military facilities overseas creates a double standard for military women and an undue hardship on women servicemembers stationed overseas. 
Third, women may not have ready access to private facilities in other countries. Abortion is illegal in some foreign countries, like the Philippines. A woman stationed in that country or the spouse of a servicemember would need to fly to the United States or to another country--at her own expense--to obtain an abortion. Most servicemembers cannot easily bear the expense of jetting off to Switzerland for medical treatment. 
Fourth, if women do not have access to military facilities or to private facilities in the country where they are stationed, they could endanger their own health by the time it takes to get to a facility in another country or by being forced to get treatment by someone other than a licensed physician. 
We know from personal experience in this country that when abortion is illegal, desperate women resort to unsafe and life-threatening methods. If it were your wife, or your daughter, would you want her in the hands of an untrained, unknown person on the back streets of Manila or Cordoba, Argentina? Or would you prefer that she be treated by a trained physician in a U.S. military facility? 
These women would have to put themselves at great risk by the obstacles involved, by the possibility of using an untrained, unlicensed person and sometimes by a lack of knowledge of the seriousness of their condition. 
People who serve our country agree to put their lives at risk to defend their country. They do not agree to put their health at risk with unknown medical facilities that may not meet U.S. standards. With this ban, we are asking these women to risk their lives doublefold. 
Current law does not force any military physician to perform an abortion against his or her will. All branches have a conscience clause that permits medical personnel to choose not to perform the procedure. What we are talking about today is providing equal access to U.S. military medical facilities, wherever they are located, for a legal procedure paid for with one's own money. 
Abortion is legal for American women. To deny American military women access to medical treatment they can trust is wrong. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan, and I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, in my 4 1/2 years in this body, I have not seen an effort as egregious, as badly flawed, as unfair as the base closure process. I happen to have great respect for the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Michigan, but I think to adopt this amendment at this time is really only to continue this kind of egregious pursuit. I hope, in the course of my remarks, to at least point out some of the areas where I find the base closure process very wanting. 
The Senator from Arizona spoke of States with big electoral clout, and I would have to plead guilty. No State has bigger electoral clout than California. I also hasten to point out that no State has suffered more base closures than California--29 bases cited for closure to date, and the largest number of jobs lost all across this Nation. In net jobs lost to date, California has lost 123,000 net jobs. The next State in net jobs lost is Pennsylvania at 35,000. So we are more than four times Pennsylvania's job loss. The next highest State in total number of bases closed to California is Texas, then Pennsylvania, then New York, then Illinois. 
If I really believed that this was going to end up being an important cost saving for the U.S. military, I would say, `All right, Dianne, you may represent this State, but, by and large, this is for the best interest of the military.' I don't believe it, and I have seen no evidence to date to corroborate that. I believe strongly that it is much too soon to begin another round without having some of this information. 
We don't know how much the four rounds cost. We don't know how much the four rounds have saved. And we haven't met our commitments to local communities impacted by these closures, despite the letter of the distinguished Secretary of Defense to the contrary. 
The CBO--even the CBO--the 1995 BRAC Commission, they both say wait. CBO recommends waiting until at least 2001 for another round. They say: 
The Congress should consider authorizing an additional round of base closures if the Department of Defense believes that there is a surplus of military capacity after-- 
And I stress the word `after'-- all rounds of BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, however, should follow an interval during which DOD and independent analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have been taken thus far.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like this distinguished body to know that we cannot get a single figure from the U.S. Navy as to what the cost savings actually will be from the closures of the 
Navy bases in the State of California. Not a single figure. They will not give us estimates. And yet we are going to run ahead, pass another round and begin this same procedure again. It doesn't make any sense. 
Let me quote what the BRAC 1995 commission itself recommended: 
. . . the Commission recommends that the Congress authorize another Base Closure Commission for the year 2001 . . . [giving] military services time to complete the current closures in an orderly fashion-- 
Which has not happened, I might allude to-- while ensuring that the Defense Department has the opportunity in the future to make further reductions . . . 
In addition to these new BRAC rounds beginning too quickly, and contrary to what DOD and supporters of this amendment claim, the base reuse process has been cumbersome and has been fraught with bureaucratic nightmares. 
Secretary Cohen's letter of June 24 says that the DOD has assigned `transition coordinators' to each base to solve closure problems and to speed the process. Well, let me say, as one Senator from California, this approach has not worked well. I have had to intervene with DOD for communities in my State numerous times to fight for a community's needs in just this past year alone. 
Let me speak for a moment about environmental costs. I think every Member of this body knows that the costs of environmental remediation are grossly underestimated, grossly underbudgeted. DOD claims it is `empowering communities' by speeding base cleanup, and I would like to give you the results in California of what is termed `speedy base cleanup.' 
Environmental remediation--that is just remediation--is in place at only 29 percent of the Army BRAC sites; 14 percent of the Navy BRAC sites; and 18 percent of the Air Force BRAC sites in my State. Environmental remediation has not been completed at a single base closed in any of the four rounds in the State of California. 
This issue is important, because without clean property, transfers by deed cannot occur and individuals cannot get financing. Therefore, if they don't have the bases cleaned up, they can't be effectively and fully put to use. 
Let me take the four California instances that the Secretary of Defense raises in his letter. First, Castle Air Force Base. That is in California's Central Valley. It was closed by BRAC in 1991. To date, there have been 262 separate sites at this base identified for cleanup; 65 of these sites have not yet even been evaluated to determine what contaminants are in the soil or water; and none of the sites--none of the sites--on this base, held out as a model, have remediation efforts currently in place. 
Second base: Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento was closed by BRAC in 1988. To date, there have been 87 sites identified for cleanup; 15 have not yet been evaluated to determine what contaminants are in the soil or the water; and only 39 of the sites, or 44 percent, have remediation efforts in place. So 55 percent of the sites haven't even begun to be worked on yet. 
Another of these sterling examples, Norton Air Force Base in southern California, closed by BRAC in 1988. To date, 25 sites have been identified for cleanup; 6 have not yet been evaluated to determine what contaminants are in the soil or water; and only 10 of the sites, or 40 percent, have remediation efforts in place. 
None of the environmental cleanup has been completed at any of the bases anywhere in California. These were bases, Mather and Norton, that were closed nearly 10 years ago, and yet they are not close to being clean. No transfer by deed have yet occurred at Norton and a very limited number of these transfers by deed have occurred at Mather. 
Alameda Naval Air Station and Naval Aviation Depot was closed by BRAC in 1993. One of the real problems I had when this was closed was that Alameda had 7,600 units of housing that were going to be vacated. The fleet, the nuclear carriers were to be moved to 
Everett and San Diego. Everett had no housing for the wings. Housing had to be built. MilCon was not included in the cost of closing that base. 
To date at Alameda, there have been 30 sites identified for cleanup. Only one of these sites has not yet been evaluated to determine what contaminants are in the soil or water. But none of the sites have remediation in place. So at Alameda, they have done some identification; they have done no remediation. 
Sacramento Army Depot was closed by BRAC in 1991, and this is probably California's most successful reuse site to date. They have 16 sites identified for cleanup. All cleanup sites have been evaluated, and 12 sites, or 75 percent, have remediation efforts in place. 
It should also be pointed out, there is no deadline for the completion of environmental cleanup at BRAC sites. Let me, once again, make this point clear. Communities can't reuse a base when they don't know when it is going to be clean. The law has been liberalized to allow long-term, interim leases to be granted for dirty property, but these leases are limited in scope, and the potential buyer cannot obtain financing under these circumstances, and this has further delayed and deterred base reuse. 
DOD has given communities estimates as to when their bases will be clean, but DOD will not guarantee these completion dates, and every year, environmental cleanup is underfunded and every year it is delayed even more. 
The Air Force estimates that Castle Air Force Base should have environmental remediation in place by the year 2000 and that it should be complete by 2018. So the total base cannot be transferred into private reuse at Castle Air Force Base until the year 2018. 
The Air Force estimates that Mather should have environmental remediation in place by 1999 and that this should be complete by the year 2027. So it will take to 2027 for the process to be completed and the base to be transferred. 
The Air Force estimates that Norton Air Force Base should have environmental remediation in place by 1999, and that this should be complete by 2012. So, again, one has to wait for the base to be transferred. 
DOD is also far behind on the transfer of base closure property, due in large part to environmental contamination. In my State, and this is the largest State, only 4 percent of the acreage--4 percent of 79,618 acres--have been transferred by deed to new owners. 
So we are contemplating here a new BRAC closure round when only 4 percent of the land covered in California has been deeded to new owners. It does not make sense. If one is thinking about the communities and really means that reuse should work, how can you go ahead with a new round where you have 80,000 acres of land and only 4 percent of them at this stage have been deeded to a local entity? 
Only 19 percent of these acres have been transferred by long-term lease, and a whopping 49 percent are still sitting there with no action on any kind of transfer having taken place. 
So one-half of the acreage that has been closed in California has no plan for a transfer at this stage, and we are still contemplating a new round. 
Many of these base closure communities are working hard to make the best of their misfortune and many are optimistic about the prospects of base reuse. But before we pile on these additional rounds, let us look candidly at some of the difficulties they are facing. 
In Tustin, CA, the community is trying to reuse the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station. After 14 months of negotiations for an interim lease for one of the large blimp hangars and the loss of nine potential film tenants, a lease was approved by the city of Tustin and the Navy's Southwest Engineering Division. When the Pentagon subsequently rejected this lease, the prospective tenant, Walt Disney Productions, simply got fed up and left to lease space elsewhere. 
So here you had a base with a prime potential tenant, and the bureaucratic nightmare that has ensued caused it to be rejected, and Disney walked off and went somewhere else. So that was the 10th one they lost. 
At Norton Air Force Base, the Worldpointe Trade Center project that Secretary Cohen lauds in his June 24 letter will not happen due to a lack of financing. The community has regrouped, though, and now this project will be replaced by an industrial park that will take 5 years to build and yield only 40 percent of the jobs hoped for with the trade center development. 
At Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento, the Air Force and Sacramento County have finally reached agreement on the sale of 1,200 housing units. It took four separate appraisals and 5 years of negotiations to finally reach the price of $4.25 million--the same price as the county's 1993 appraisal. 
At George Air Force Base in southern California, it took 20 months to get a signed economic development conveyance. It was submitted by the community in February 1995 and finally signed in 1996. 
Another EDC at Mare Island Naval Shipyard was submitted in January of 1996--of 1996--and a year and a half later is still pending. They are still waiting for a decision. 
The city of Long Beach just completed a negotiated sale with the former Long Beach Naval Hospital. After 18 months of negotiations, the city will have to pay the Navy $8.6 million to buy back this 30-acre site that the city sold to the Navy in 1964 for 10 dollars. So they sold it to the Navy for 10 dollars and now they buy it back at $8.6 million. To make matters worse, the Navy required that the city provide the Navy with a letter of credit to secure two promissory notes to buy back the property. This cost the city of Long Beach an additional $50,000. 
Finally, the goal of base closures was to save DOD money so that we could modernize our force. If anybody could come in here and say, look, the Navy has saved x dollars in California by closing bases, I would say, OK, now we know either it was cost efficient or it was not cost efficient and we have a sound basis on which to make another judgment. 
But as I said before, the Navy will not give my office a single figure as to what cost savings can be anticipated from closure of major Navy bases in the State of California. Yet, we are going to go about another round today. 
The GAO and the CBO both say that DOD's estimated savings cannot be quantified. GAO and CBO cannot quantify what the 
military says the savings estimates are. 
DOD has not included the total cost of environmental cleanup in its net savings figures. By 2001, DOD claims that it will have saved nearly $14 billion from BRAC. To their credit, they did include the cost of environmental cleanup through 2001. That was $7.3 billion. But they did not include the cost of BRAC cleanup for these sites after 2001. In California alone this will cost another $1.56 billion. 
So, in the costs that have been provided by the military to this body, with California alone it is $1.56 billion shy, short, lacking, not defined, not there; and yet we would go ahead with another round regardless of knowing what the true costs and true savings actually are. 
Let us look at how much additional cleanup funding four of five California success stories will need past the year 2001. 
Castle will require an additional $53.1 million. 
Mather will require an additional $73.8 million. 
Norton will require an additional $1.25 million. 
Alameda Naval Air Station and Naval Aviation Depot will require an additional $73.4 million. 
None of this is counted before we make the decision. And I am just giving you four bases here--not 29. 
The true costs of BRAC should include all of these costs related to closure, not just those funded directly by the BRAC account. Until they do, frankly, I will not vote ever for another round. Just because these costs are funded from other Federal accounts does not mean that they are any less real. 
So what is happening, Mr. President, is that they fund some of this from other accounts and they do not cost them in. So that way the military costs look less, but the Federal costs--it is all the same, it all comes from the same taxpayer, all goes into the same budget, but it is not counted here. 
DOD's Office of Economic Adjustment grants to base closure communities for base reuse planning, $125 million. It is not counted here, not counted as a cost. It is a cost? Of course it is a cost. 
The Department of Commerce, Economic Development Administration grants to base closure communities, $371 million. It is not counted here as a cost. 
FAA grants to establish airports at closed bases, $182 million. It is not counted here. 
It is like MilCon, except MilCon is in the defense budget. These are not in the defense budget. They are necessary, but not counted. 
Department of Labor job retraining grants, $103 million. It is not counted in the cost of base closure. 
So without at least a firm accounting of how much the first four rounds of BRAC cost and how much was saved, I cannot and I do not believe any Member of this body should support a new round. 
We have moved too fast in closing these bases. We need to look at the bottom line. What are these closures costing, not only the Defense Department, but the FAA, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Labor in retraining grants, the Office of Economic Adjustment? What are the costs? And factor those costs in. What are the costs of MilCon for all of the rounds? Factor those costs in as well. 
Later this afternoon it is my understanding that Senator Dorgan will be offering an amendment to propose a study to come up with just this very information. I think to proceed with another round until the study is done and until we have the specific information would really be a major, major mistake. 
We need to look at operations and maintenance. We need to look at military construction, environmental cleanup costs, base reuse costs and economic redevelopment costs also funded by the Federal Government, unemployment compensation costs, military health care costs and force structure costs. All of this should be looked at, I believe, by an independent agency, figures ascertained on which responsible people can depend, and then another decision can be made on another day about another round. 
I think this is ill-advised. It is too fast. And it will simply complicate one flawed procedure with another flawed round. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support legislation introduced by Senator Byron Dorgan and myself--the Safer Schools Act of 1997--which will ensure that students who bring guns to school can be suspended. 
This legislation was originally introduced late last session in reaction to a startling ruling by an appellate court in New York that said a student should not have been suspended from school because the weapon he was carrying was uncovered during a search without a warrant. 
We have reached a crisis in this country--a crisis which makes it difficult for parents to see their children off to school in the morning, for fear they will never see them again. 
Each day in America, it is estimated that 100,000 guns are brought into American schools. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 2 in 25 high school students, or 7.9 percent, report having carried a gun in the last 30 days. In Los Angeles, according to an ACLU survey conducted earlier this year, 49 percent of high school students said they have seen a weapon in school, many of them guns. 
In response to these types of alarming figures, Senator Dorgan and I introduced the Gun Free Schools Act in 1994 to set a zero-tolerance policy to keep America's schools gun-free. The goal of this legislation was to remove firearms from all public schools in the United States. 
Although we still have a way to go to make all schools gun-free, this zero-tolerance policy is working to make our schools safer. A preliminary report recently released from the U.S. Department of Education provides irrefutable proof that this law is well on its way toward meeting this important goal. I am told that a full report on all the States will be due out sometime later this summer. 
The Gun Free Schools Act has been responsible for the expulsions of more than 6,276 students in 29 States caught during the 1995-96 school year for trying to carry guns to school. This means there were 6,276 fewer opportunities for a child to be killed or injured by gunfire at school in the United States. According to the California Department of Education, there were 1,039 firearms-related expulsions in public schools in California during this same period. The entire State of California has 1,043 school districts. Amazingly, this translates into an average of one expulsion for every district in my State. 
Today, each and every one of the 50 States and the District of Columbia have complied with the Gun Free Schools Act by passing laws requiring schools to expel--for at least 1 year --students who are caught carrying a gun. 
But the ruling of an appellate court in New York threatens to undermine the progress we have made in setting a zero-tolerance policy for guns in schools. 
The appellate court in this particular case applied the same evidentiary standards that apply to criminal proceedings in what was a school disciplinary action. The school, however, refused to lift the student's suspension and as a result, their action was upheld by the State Court of Appeals. 
Mr. President, I believe that common sense was cast aside with the appellate court ruling. Incredibly, what the appellate court's decision said was that this student should not have been expelled from school and that his record should be expunged from any wrongdoing in the case. 
Our legislation states very clearly that the exclusionary rule should not be applied in school disciplinary proceedings. What the legislation says is that you cannot exclude a gun as evidence in a disciplinary action in school. 
This common-sense legislation does not violate the constitutional rights of children. This bill does not exonerate school officials who conduct unreasonable or unlawful searches and persons who have been aggrieved will have every right to pursue judicial or statutory remedies available. 
The Safer Schools Act of 1997 will prevent kids who do bring a gun to school from slipping through a school's reasonable disciplinary process. 
Fortunately, last September's court ruling that a gun can be excluded from use as evidence in an internal school disciplinary proceeding was ultimately reversed. But a similar ruling could be made in another State. 
This legislation would send a clear signal that guns have no place in the hands of our children or in the hallways and classrooms of their schools. All children should be able to go to school without fearing for their safety. 
This legislation also would say to school administrators throughout the Nation that it is perfectly legitimate to conduct a disciplinary proceeding in cases where a student has brought a gun to school. The schools can conduct a fair and reasonable proceeding that allows them to ensure the safety of their school grounds. 
The bottom line is that the Gun Free Schools Act has helped reduce the threat of guns from our Nation's schools. With the Safer Schools Act of 1997, we give school officials and teachers much needed flexibility to ensure that America's schools are safe havens so that children can escape the violence that engulfs so many of their lives. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to ask if the chairman can clarify for me whether this bill includes a provision that provides the `brownfields' benefits for supplemental empowerment zones. 
As a former mayor, I am very committed to promoting economic growth in our urban area. The `brownfields' provision will be significant in the City of Los Angeles' effort to turn abandoned, vacant or underutilized industrial or commercial properties back into productive use. Can the chairman confirm that, under the Senate tax bill, brownfields remediation incentives are also extended to supplemental empowerment zones?

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, during the 104th Congress, I was privileged to serve as ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. In that time, while visiting and monitoring events in the South Asia region--which includes India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh--I had the honor of working with a talented and dedicated group of diplomats. I wish to pay tribute to some of them today. 
The South Asia Bureau is the smallest and youngest of the State Department's regional bureaus, having been created by congressional mandate in 1992. Despite its size, it has ably represented American interests in this critical part of the world. This summer, it will undergo its first major transition, as nearly all the ranking diplomats in the bureau will rotate on to other assignments. Before they do, I wanted to take an opportunity to commend them for their service. 
At the top, of course, is Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Robin L. Raphel, the first person to ever hold the position. During the past 4 years, Assistant Secretary Raphel has deftly managed the complex web of issues that encompass South Asia--from Indo-Pakistani tensions to nonproliferation, from human rights to the environment, and from counterterrorism and narcotics to the deadly conflict in Afghanistan. She has also been a trusted and valuable interlocuter with Congress, making the administration's case fairly and straightforwardly to those on all sides of every issue under her purview. 
Assistant Secretary Raphel has been assisted in her efforts by an outstanding team of ambassadors in the field: Ambassador Frank Wisner in New Delhi, Ambassador Tom Simons in Islamabad, Ambassador Peter Burleigh in Sri Lanka, Ambassador David Merrill in Dhaka, and Ambassador Vogelgesang in Kathmandu. Due to a quirk of timing, with the exception of Tom Simons, all of these ambassadors either have or are expected to vacate their posts this summer. 
I want to commend each of these fine diplomats: Frank Wisner, one of the most senior and well-regarded members of the entire Foreign Service, and David Merrill, both of whom have announced their retirements from Federal service: Peter Burleigh, a native of my home State of California and a first-rate linguist, who will next be furthering United States interests as Deputy Permanent Representative at the United Nations; and Sandy Vogelgesang, for whom I have a special, personal regard. 
Last November, when I traveled to Nepal to view United States assistance projects, I was highly impressed by Ambassador Vogelgesang's knowledge of Nepal and her depth of caring for its people, the high degree of respect she enjoyed throughout the country, and the way these traits enabled her to be an effective advocate and promoter of U.S. interests. She is, in short, one of the finest Ambassadors I have ever had the privilege of working with. I hope and expect that our Nation will enjoy the benefit of her service in future posts in the years to come. 
Mr. President, during my tenure on the Foreign Relations Committee, I have developed a high regard for the work of our talented and dedicated Foreign Service personnel. Almost without exception, I have found the people representing our Nation in embassies overseas to be infused with seriousness, patriotism, and professionalism. Sadly, they are too often underappreciated, and occasionally even criticized. As Senators, who are called upon to approve the highly competitive selection and promotion processes, and to confirm appointments to the Foreign Service's most senior levels, it behooves us to take the time to recognize some of our most accomplished diplomats. 
On behalf of my colleagues, I express appreciation and admiration for a job well done to Assistant Secretary Raphel and Ambassadors Wisner, Simons, Burleigh, Merrill, and Vogelgesang. Our country owes them thanks for their able service, and we are grateful for their significant contributions to improving and expanding our relationships with the countries of South Asia.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Biden and myself. 
For 3 years, Senator Biden and I have sent an amendment to the desk which would prohibit the teaching of bomb making. Twice it passed this body by unanimous consent, and twice in conference the amendment was taken out. 
Last year, when we made this amendment and this body graciously and, I believe, wisely accepted it, it was replaced in conference with the proviso that the Department of Justice would do a report to see whether this amendment was well advised and would stand a constitutional test. 
On April 29 of this year, the Department of Justice published a report, and that report was entitled, `Report on the Availability of Bomb Making Information, The Extent to Which Its Dissemination is Controlled by Federal Law, and the Extent to Which Such Dissemination May be Subject to Regulation Consistent with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.' 
The bottom line of the report is that the Department of Justice agrees that it would be appropriate and beneficial to adopt further legislation to address the problem of teaching bomb making directly, if that can be accomplished in a manner that does not impermissibly restrict the wholly legitimate publication and teaching of such information or otherwise violate the first amendment. 
In other words, the question presented by this is, when does the first amendment end and when does conspiracy to commit a felony begin?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I conclude my statement simply with this. This amendment has been put into this bill once before. It has been put into the terrorism bill once. It has been passed by this body twice. It has been reworked to withstand a first amendment challenge. I am hopeful, with the history of what is happening in this country, that Americans all across this land will say there is no first amendment right to be a conspirator and teach someone how to make a bomb to blow someone else up. So I am hopeful that this year it might survive a conference. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their comments, and I thank all the Members for their support of this amendment. 
Essentially, this is the third year that I have submitted this amendment. It has been put on the terrorism bill and on this bill in prior times. It was removed in conference. Part of the terrorism bill asks the Department of Justice to take a look at the situation that exists out there with respect to the teaching of bombmaking and the knowledge and intent that such teaching will be used for a criminal purpose. In fact, the Department of Justice has submitted a report indicating that they believe that the amendment is necessary and will stand a constitutional test, and they have, in fact, approved the drafting of this amendment. I believe it is important and timely. I believe it will stand a constitutional test. I am just delighted that it has been cleared on both sides. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have lent my support to H.R. 1757, the 1998-99 State Department authorization bill, which passed last night. There is much that I support in this bill, and I wanted to take a few minutes today to discuss this bill and my vote. 
With its provisions to reorganize America's foreign policy institutions and to press for reform at the United Nations I think it is fair to say that this bill is one of the most far-reaching and important bills that we will consider this Congress. 
For well over a decade the United States has been steadily reducing the amount of money it devotes to international affairs agencies and programs. When current figures are adjusted for inflation, the cuts in recent years have been significant--50 percent since 1984. 
I was pleased when the administration requested a much-needed increase in funds for international affairs in the 1998 budget request. And I am pleased that this bill has, on the whole, preserved those funds. 
The international affairs budget authorized in this bill will go a long way toward righting the inequities of American international affairs spending of the past decade, and toward creating an efficient framework to support America's global leadership in the millennium to come. 
Just as important as authorizing funds for the conduct of American foreign policy, this bill also takes an historic step in working with President Clinton and Secretary Albright to create a new foreign affairs structure for the 21st century. 
Many of our current foreign policy institutions were created during the cold war, with specific missions and goals in mind. 
The reorganization plan put forward by the administration and supported by this bill reflects the need to preserve the unique skills and capabilities of each of the current agencies with the requirement that our institutional arrangements reflect the new demands guiding the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. 
By the end of 1999 the result of this bill will be a new streamlined foreign policy structure, drawing on the best people and practices of the old agencies, and fully capable of meeting the new challenges of the 21st century. 
Most importantly, from my perspective, this bill preserves some flexibility for the administration in its implementation of the President's plan. 
I opposed the reorganization plan we considered in the last Congress, because it denied the President the flexibility he needs to carry out our foreign affairs. This reorganization plan suffers from no such flaw. 
I would also like to take a little time to express my support for the plan to repay the United Nations the arrears our Nation owes it and for reform of the United Nations that is contained in the bill before us, S. 903. 
I support this package of repayment of arrears and reform benchmarks for one simple reason: because I believe a strong and effective United Nations is fundamentally important to the national interest of the United States. 
I am an unabashed supporter of the United Nations. Now that our colleague, Senator Claiborne Pell, has retired, I believe I am the only Member of this body to be in attendance at the founding of the United Nations in my hometown of San Francisco 52 years ago. I was not a delegate, as was Senator Pell--I was a bit younger then--but I am proud that I was able to help the host city celebrate that important occasion. 
As mayor of San Francisco, I had the honor and privilege of presiding over the 40th anniversary celebrations in 1985, and 2 years ago, I traveled with many of my colleagues to San Francisco for the 50th anniversary celebrations. 
These milestones mean a great deal to me, not because of their historical interest so much as because of their significance in the life of the United States. My own belief is that if the United Nations did not exist, we would have to invent it. 
I am not among the United Nations' major detractors. I do not believe for 1 minute that the United Nations is somehow out to impose its will on the United States, or to intrude on our sovereignty. I reject outright the paranoid fantasies of those who warn of the specter of U.N. taxation or a U.N. army, or the U.N. leading inexorably toward world government. 
The United Nations serves American interests each and every day. Through the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, it feeds and clothes homeless refugees in time of war. Through U.N. development programs, it helps the poorer nations of the world develop their infrastructures. It provides a forum for negotiating multilateral agreements on arms control, protecting the environment, and other matters that affect all nations.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California and the two Senators from Texas for joining me in this coalition. 
I certainly do object to the motion to proceed to the bill. I want to explain why in some detail. These provisions that the Depot Caucus put in not only halts the public-private competitions for depot workload currently underway at both McClellan and Kelly Air Force Bases, but it essentially undermines any effort to do this work in the private sector in a more cost-effective way. 
The option to privatize certain depot workloads was explicitly made available by the BRAC Commission and was a part of the base closure decision. Yes, let their be no doubt, these bases will be closed. We know that. But an effort was guaranteed to be put underway to see if an amount of this workload could, in fact, be privatized. In its report to the President, the BRAC 95 Commission specifically recommended that the department `consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD depots or to private-sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.' 
The President strongly supported the Commission's decision, specifically reinforcing the option of privatization. In his letter to the chairman of the BRAC 95 Commission, the President stated, `I was pleased to learn that * * * you confirmed that the Commission's recommendations permit the Department of Defense to privatize the work loads of the McClellan and Kelly facilities in place or elsewhere in their respective communities. * * * In my communication with Congress, I have made clear that the Commission's agreement that the Secretary enjoys full authority and discretion to transfer workload from these two installations to the private sector, in place, locally or otherwise, is an integral part of the overall BRAC 95 package it will be considering.' The President goes on to say, without ambiguity, `Moreover, should the Congress approve this package but then subsequently take action in other legislation to restrict privatization options at McClellan or Kelly, I will regard this as a breach of Public Law 101-510 (the base closure law) in the same manner as if the Congress were to attempt to reverse by legislation any other material direction of this or any other BRAC.' 
I think that's pretty clear. 
Let me say that I firmly believe if this bill goes forward with the depot language in it, the President of the United States should veto the bill. Not to veto the bill is to say that the BRAC decisions and the decisions made surrounding the 1995 base closure decision are no longer valid. Their integrity is clearly punctuated by this kind of special interest drive. 
Let me go on to say that some have alleged that this privatization process is an attempt to keep McClellan and Kelly open. Let me disabuse my colleagues of that. I want to be very clear. McClellan and Kelly will both be closed in the year 2001. That decision has been made. The property and buildings at McClellan will be transferred by the Air Force to recipients in the local community according to the base reuse plan. 
Two private companies, Boeing and a group led by AAI Corp. and one Air Force depot, Hill Air Force Depot in Utah, have each been awarded $750,000 in Air Force contracts to formulate their bids for the workload package at McClellan. Final bids from these competitors for this workload are due in September of this year. The contract is scheduled to be awarded in January 1998. This aspect of privatization is now underway, Mr. President, and 
essentially what we have in this bill is a special provision which would halt the contracts currently proceeding. It is to this that we strongly object. 
The workload package, currently under development by the Air Force, will be worth approximately $220 million and will affect only 2,300 McClellan Air Force Base employees. McClellan ALC, Air Logistics Center, employed over 8,000 people before the BRAC 1995 round, and currently employs less than 7,800 people. So you can see the workload package we are talking about affects about one-third of the employees that used to work at McClellan Air Logistics Center. 
The Air Force's planned workload package at McClellan will include maintenance and repair of the KC-135 refueler aircraft and A-10 close-air support aircraft. It will also include repair work and maintenance on hydraulics systems, instruments and electronic components and electronic accessories for numerous aircraft systems. Finally, the workload package will include software support activities, parts repair and assembly for the KC-135 and A-10, and the packaging and movement of parts to military customers. 
The public/private competition for this work can save taxpayer dollars. If the competition for this work is won by the private sector, hundreds of millions of dollars in savings could be realized by avoiding the costs of new military construction, movement of the workload, and retraining workers at Hill Air Force Base. Additional savings can come from taking advantage of any potential efficiencies in private industry. 
Let me make another point. Past Federal investments at McClellan should not be ignored. Since 1987, the Department has spent $150 million on military construction projects at McClellan. Outright closure of these facilities before the year 2001 means the U.S. taxpayer not only forfeits this expenditure but also must pay for new military construction at another Air Force base so this workload can be moved. The Defense Department will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to duplicate the facilities now in operation at McClellan. 
As the Defense Department phases out its operations at McClellan and Kelly Air Force Bases, privatization provides a means to reduce overhead costs by bringing defense and commercial work together. If private industry wins the competition for this workload package, they will be able to add commercial products along with their Defense Department workload. This innovative approach will expand employment opportunities at these closing facilities and increase savings to the Department through decreased overhead costs and enhanced efficiency. 
The Depot Caucus' language takes none of these potential savings into account and violates every proven principle that competition reduces costs. The Depot Caucus provision would sole-source billions of dollars of depot maintenance work to government facilities regardless of the cost or the impact this noncompetitive practice would have on DOD's management plans and strategies. In addition, the Depot Caucus' unqualified opposition to privatization goes against a clear national trend. The language ignores not only the lessons learned by industry, but also the guidance of DOD's most respected advisory reports. 
This spring's Quadrennial Defense Review stated that DOD should, `Conduct public-private competitions for depot maintenance work that does not contribute to core capability when other appropriate outsourcing criteria are met. In addition, [DOD] will partner in-house facilities with industry to preserve depot-level skills and utilize excess capacity. Savings will be achieved as a result of these competitions and the reductions in excess capacity.' 
The May 1995 Commission on Roles and Missions [CORM] of the Armed Forces strongly urged increasing privatization. CORM recommended `that the Department make the transition to a depot maintenance system relying mostly on the private sector.' 
In fact, the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure [BRAC] 
Commission Report strongly supported depot privatization, writing, `The Commission believes reducing infrastructure by expanding privatization to * * * DOD industrial and commercial activities will reduce the cost of maintaining and operating a ready military force.' 
The vast majority of private firms are also moving toward increased reliance on outsourcing to become more efficient and remain competitive. The DOD can learn and benefit from the private sector's experience. 
We have an opportunity to save money by allowing the competitions for workload at McClellan AFB to go forward. If the bids made by private industry are not financially feasible, then the contract will be awarded to the public bidder, Hill AFB. But, if a private bidder does win, then we will have our first opportunity to reduce the cost of depot maintenance activities through careful use of private enterprise. 
The General Accounting Office's study of depot workload privatization never considered the question of how much could be saved if this workload was privatized. It only considered the costs of maintaining that workload at Kelly and McClellan as compared to consolidating it into the remaining air logistics centers. The privatization of this workload will not be business as usual. 
Finally, many of my colleagues are concerned that readiness will suffer at the hands of greater outsourcing and privatization. DOD, however, has entrusted our military's readiness to private contractors for years. Currently, several weapons systems, including the KC-10 refueling aircraft, the F-117 stealth fighter, the B-1B bomber, and the software maintenance for the B-2 bomber are completed by private contractors. 
I believe that the leadership of our armed services will continue to ensure that any DOD depot maintenance workload that is outsourced will be maintained appropriately, to DOD's own high standard. Allowing noncore depot workload to privatize simply permits DOD to award work to the most qualified, most reliable contractor, whether that contractor is a public facility or a private company. 
In supporting the defense industrial base, DOD's policy calls for greater reliance on the private sector for appropriate depot maintenance workload. Outsourcing helps preserve private sector capabilities and enhances DOD's ability to capture new technologies that are constantly being developed in the private sector. By introducing greater competition into the mix, outsourcing lowers the cost of depot-level maintenance activities. 
I firmly believe that the Nation will always require a public sector depot capability for certain mission-essential workloads and skills. Unfortunately, the depot language included in the DOD authorization bill will squander essential readiness and modernization funds. The Defense Department has defined public depot maintenance policy for the 21st century. It is time that we move beyond the arbitrary laws defining the policy of the past, and allow public/private competition to move us forward. 
These are the points that I wanted to make today. But, let me emphasize, the Depot Caucus' amendment will eventually cost the taxpayers much more money by duplicating existing facilities. In addition, the contractual process, including the request for proposals has already begun and, at McClellan, two companies--Boeing, AAI Corp., and one Air Force depot, Hill Air Force Depot--have already been awarded $750,000 in Air Force contracts to formulate their bids for this workload. Now the Congress is trying to step in and say, `We are going to stop these competitions midstream.' I think that makes no sense for the taxpayers and it makes no sense for the credibility of the BRAC process. 
I, for one, am delighted to join with my colleagues both in my own State and in Texas to work to see if we cannot come up with some compromise. Absent that compromise, I firmly believe the President should veto this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with my colleagues and the administration to perfect section 1166 of this bill, relating to the inadmissibility of persons supporting international child abductors. 
This section of the bill, which was included at my request in the chairman's mark considered last week by the Foreign Relations Committee, was inspired by the case of Patricia Roush, a constituent of mine whose two daughters were abducted by her ex-husband and taken to his home country of Saudi Arabia 11 years ago in direct violation of the custody order of an Illinois court. 
Since then, she has seen the girls only once for 2 hours. All efforts to negotiate a resolution have been rebuffed by the father. 
This section attempts to address tragic situations like Ms. Roush's. Current law, section 212(a)(10)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, says that any alien who holds a child overseas in violation of a custody order of a U.S. court may not receive a visa to come to the United States until the child has been returned to the parent with rightful custody. 
This new section would expand the visa restriction to three categories of people: Anyone who helped carry out the abduction of the child; anyone providing material support or safe haven to the abducting parent; and immediate family members of the abducting parent. 
Any of these people already in the United States would also be deportable. 
This law would not apply if the child is located in a country which is a signatory to the Hague Convention, which is an international agreement designed to resolve international child abduction cases. 
The goal of this legislation is to expand the circle of people affected when an American child is abducted. There can be no doubt that persons who assist in the abduction of such a child should be subject to the same restrictions as the abductor him or herself. The same goes for those who support and protect the abductor subsequent to the abduction. 
The only area that has raised questions is the provision applying the restriction to immediate family members of the abductor. We decided to proceed in this fashion because of Ms. Roush's experience during the tenure of the previous United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Ray Mabus. 
After years without any progress toward a resolution, Ambassador Mabus implied to relatives of Ms. Roush's ex-husband that he might withhold their visas to the United States unless the case was solved. He never actually threatened to withhold the visas, which he lacked the authority to do, but he hoped to at least get information about the girls' condition and the father's thinking throught this tactic. 
Ambassador Mabus discovered that even the implied threat of withholding visas from family members produced a new spirit of flexibility on the part of the father. By the time he returned to the United States, they had come close to negotiating a resolution, but that fell through after Mabus left. 
But this experience suggests that withholding visas from family members and other associates of the abducting parent is an effective way to put pressure on that parent to negotiate a resolution. 
There is a precedent for withholding visas from family members. In the Helms-Burton law on Cuba passed in 1996--Public Law 104-114, spouses and minor children of officers of corporations doing prohibited business with Cuba were made excludable. 
I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Senator from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, for their cooperation and for helping perfect this amendment.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. President, I very much agree with the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from West Virginia, my colleague from California, and all who have really very sincerely expressed their dismay on the way this bill has been handled. I would like to just take a few minutes and remind my colleagues that this started with a flood in California in January, and it is now June. According to the California Office of Emergency Services, California sustained $1.8 billion in damages during last winter's flooding. In California alone, 9 people died and 100,000 people lost their homes. They were forced to flee from their homes. This was the third 100-year flood in the last 10 years. It gives you the idea of the impact on part of the State. 
Mr. President, 48 out of 58 counties in California were declared Federal disaster areas. Damage to levees, to roads, and other infrastructure was severe. There were over 60 levee breaks in the delta area of California. Many of those breaks have yet to be repaired. These levees do two things. Because the land behind the levee is below sea level, the levees protect homes and agricultural land from the rivers. Now, when the levees break, the land behind the levee is peat, and the peat comes out into the water. That water is the drinking water for two-thirds of the people of the State; that is 20 million people. And when you treat the water for drinking and it has been infested by peat soil, the chlorine throws off carcinogens. So the longer you leave these levees unattended and the longer you have the intrusion of the peat-infested water into the drinking water, you increase problems in California. 
So far, out of this more than $1.8 billion, California has only received $27 million for FEMA, for flood fighting, for debris removal, and for infrastructure repair. Fully repairing the damage to public facilities will take months, if not years. 
I spent 3 days in these areas. I have flown over most of the levee breaks. I saw the extent of the damage. In places where I flew in a helicopter, let's say maybe 300, 400 feet above the ground, you could not see anything that was not flood-affected on either side. As far as your vision could go, flat land, from 300 to 500 feet above the ground, it was all water. You only saw rooftops. 
I talked with people who lost as many as 14,000 trees in their orchard, who were wiped out of their dairy farms, wiped out of their homes. I went into the homes of people who were not farmers. I saw water halfway up the ceiling, everything ruined. Wiring, everything was ruined in the house. If only everyone could see this, I don't think they would want to play these games with this vital piece of legislation. 
Let me remind my colleagues of the emergency relief provision and exactly what is in the bill: $5.6 million, 22 States. According to OMB, the bill allocates $3.3 billion out of new money and existing FEMA funds for disaster aid to California. Additionally, the bill provides another $780 million for disaster-related work in California. This is $200 million for Federal highway work, $176 million for repairs at Yosemite, $300 million for the Army Corps of Engineers, and $47 million for the Department of Agriculture. 
I want, just for a moment, to try to debunk the implication that no family has been denied assistance due to delays in the bill. This might be true for agencies like FEMA, which has the disaster trust fund to draw from. But other Federal agencies responding to the disasters are depending on this funding. 
HUD currently has no CDBG funds to dedicate to disaster recovery efforts, and both the House and Senate bills contained a half a billion dollars for CDBG disaster recovery efforts. So without this bill, there is no money for these efforts. 
Other Federal programs are also waiting for this funding: the Department of Agriculture's Emergency Conservation Program, which assists farmers in rehabilitating flooded farmland and clearing debris from the fields. Without this bill, farmers in the upper Midwest have to delay planting and will see their costs driven up. 
The Watershed and Flood Prevention Program, the Tree Assistance Program--now, this is important. I mentioned losing 14,000 trees. Crops that are permanent, like vines and trees, are eligible for grants through the Tree Assistance Program for replanting. There are no moneys for that without this bill. So it is necessary, if you are going to get the tree in the ground, to get it done as fast as possible. 
Let me talk about one of our Nation's jewels--Yosemite National Park. Delaying this bill closes off parts of this park for millions of visitors, no question. The Park Service is proceeding with the most pressing needs, but funds in this bill are now going to arrive too late to affect this summer. That means that contracts to begin the permanent road widening and the permanent utility repairs need to be let as soon as possible to minimize the impact on the park. If it can't be done soon, we are into winter again and then it is not going to be for another year. 
The President has made no secret about the fact that he will veto this bill when it hits his desk. We all know the problems with the automatic CR. I, for one, believe that this killer provision is really not necessary. We have shown that when we want to work together in a bipartisan way and make the necessary compromises that we can do it. All we have to do is pass appropriations bills on time. Two weeks ago we voted for a balanced budget. I think it is somewhat disingenuous to include the automatic CR in this legislation. 
Let me spend a few moments on another killer issue, because I have spoken to a few Members on the other side about it, and that is the census sampling. I had hoped the conferees would have been able to accept the Senate compromise. The conference report prohibits the use of statistical sampling. This impacts every high-growth State in the United States. I know there is politics in it, let's face it, because lower-income people, minorities, are the most affected if you don't sample. So, if you don't sample, you cut down your numbers in that category. That might be one thing in elections, but let me tell you it is also another thing in funding formula. So by not accepting the sampling, the high-growth States are essentially deprived of vital formula. 
Without sampling, the 2,000 census undercount would reach more than 18 million households, it would miss about 1 million people in California; it would miss 5 to 6 million in other States. 
Let me give you one example. California's share of Federal vocational rehabilitation funds total about 8 to 9 percent of the Federal funds in the program. These funds would be 11 percent going to California if based on an accurate census. If we don't do the sampling, the cost to the State is $70 to $100 million in just this one program alone. You can multiply that all across the board in title I moneys for schools, for poor children, and so every State that has a growth in these numbers, if you don't use the sampling, for political reasons you are sacrificing formula dollars for your State. I might tell you, I find that very hard to do. 
I intend to vote for this bill because the bulk of this bill is money for California. I recognize that the President will veto it. I will also vote to sustain his veto when this comes back. I am hopeful that the rumors I hear about the House are correct, that there will be another bill and it will be a basic disaster relief emergency supplemental so we can get on with other things. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader for calling up these judicial nominations for votes by the Senate, and in particular for calling up Judge Jeffrey Miller, who has been nominated to the U.S. district court for the southern district of California in San Diego. 
It was my distinct pleasure to recommend Judge Jeffrey Miller to the President. I feel strongly he is extremely well qualified for the position. 
Judge Miller has been serving for 10 years as a superior court judge in San Diego, having been appointed by a Republican Governor, George Deukmejian, in 1987. 
Judge Miller previously spent 19 years with the State attorney general's office. 
He earned both his undergraduate and law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in the 1960's. He first devoted himself to public service by working in the Peace Corps for a year. 
During his experience in the Los Angeles attorney general's office from 1968 to 1974, he briefed approximately 60 cases on behalf of the people, urging affirmation of trial court convictions before the court of appeals in more than half of those cases. 
Of those cases, published opinions were issued in 13, all but 1 affirming trial court convictions. 
From 1974 to 1987, Judge Miller supervised attorneys and carried his own caseload in the tort and condemnation section of the attorney general's office, which oversaw the San Diego, Orange, San Bernardino, and Riverside areas. Here he represented the State in matters ranging from class action lawsuits to California Highway Patrol officers sued for false arrest. 
Judge Miller has argued two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Both cases were argued successfully on behalf of the State. 
His lengthy and distinguished experience as a prosecutor prepared him well for his appointment in 1987 as a superior court judge. 
Since then, he has handled many sensitive high-profile criminal and civil cases including two murder cases where the juries rendered convictions with full sentences. 
This has prepared him extremely well for the criminal and civil caseload facing the southern district judges. 
Simply put, Judge Miller is one of the most respected and trusted judicial figures in the San Diego area. He is both fair minded and thoughtful, yet remains tough and decisive. 
His bipartisan support and solid judicial background make him a strong nominee for confirmation. Among those who have endorsed Judge Miller's nomination are those who know the judge's work best: 
Presiding Judge James R. Milliken of the superior court described Judge Miller as `a superb judge' and `a fine, insightful person. He understands legal issues and problems and does an absolutely wonderful job in the courtroom.' 
Judge Anthony Joseph, a colleague on the San Diego Superior Court, wrote: `His positive outlook and pragmatic approach are essential in this era.' 
Judge Daniel Kremer of the U.S. court of appeals noted that Judge Miller `is particularly well known for his ability to handle complex cases efficiently and fairly.' 
Retired Justice Charles Froehlich, Jr., of the court of appeals said: `He is a person of very high ethical standards. He would indeed be a credit to the local district court bench.' 
Judge Judith Haller of the court of appeals wrote: `Judge Miller would be an outstanding selection and one which would be extremely well received by members of our legal community. He is one of those rare individuals who receives unanimous praise from all who have worked with him professionally or who know him personally.' 
Judge Miller is an active member of the California Judges Association. 
He has been elected to the executive committee and served on that committee as supervising judge of the north county branch of the San Diego Superior Court. He has also chaired the joint jury committee and the rules committee.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the compromise reached on S. 610, the legislation to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention. I believe it is very much in our national interests to pass this implementation legislation just as we ratified the CWC. 
Let me first express my respect and appreciation for the distinguished Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden and the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy. They and their staff have really done the heavy lifting in getting this implementing language to the floor. 
I also want to express my respect for the opponents of this treaty, including the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl. I have worked well with Senator Kyl on many issues, including, at the moment, our strong effort to pass a Crime Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution. 
I know that in this debate these Senators are motivated by their genuine and deeply felt concern for America's national security. However, I must disagree with the view that we would be better off without this treaty, or by passing implementation language that renders the treaty meaningless. 
Mr. President, the threat of chemical weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, or being used as a weapon of war by a rogue state, has increased dramatically in recent years. 
One need only reflect on the dangers faced by our military by Iraq's incipient chemical weapons program during the gulf war, or the tragedies our nation has suffered with the bombing of the World Trade Center, the Federal building in Oklahoma City, and the Olympic Park in Atlanta, to fully appreciate the dangers posed by the proliferation of chemical weapons. In each of these cases, the tragedy and loss of life could have been magnified significantly had chemical weapons been used. 
Chemical weapons are among the most barbaric of mankind's inventions. They are so awful, that the United States, by act of Congress, has decided to eliminate our own stocks of these weapons by 2004. They are designed to kill and incapacitate by causing such effects as skin blistering, blindness, lung damage, choking, nervous system disruption, paralysis, or oxygen starvation. Because of the ease of their dispersal over a wide area, chemical weapons are especially useful for targeting civilian populations. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention is the most far-reaching attempt ever by the international community to control the spread of chemical weapons. It bans for the first time the development, production, and possession of chemical weapons and reinforces the international norm against their use. Since we are destroying our own chemical weapons, it only makes sense that we should want other nations to do so as well. 
The convention requires all signatory states to declare and destroy any chemical weapons and the facilities used to produce them. It requires member states to submit annual reports on the 
production and use of certain sensitive chemicals. This information, combined with our own intelligence resources, will significantly improve our ability to monitor and prevent illegal transfers and uses of such chemicals. 
Once the CWC takes effect, it will make it much harder and more costly for proliferators and terrorists to acquire chemical weapons. An intrusive verification system will be set up to detect violations. Sanctions will be imposed against nations that refuse to participate, making it more difficult for them to acquire precursor chemicals for poison gas and easier to monitor their efforts to do so. 
The intelligence-sharing and global verification network that will result from this treaty will increase the chances that terrorist attacks involving chemical weapons can be prevented before they ever occur--a net gain in the security of our troops and our citizens. 
We must start with the proposition that no arms control agreement is 100 percent verifiable. But with the CWC, we will know far more about who is trying to develop chemical weapons, where, and how than we would without the treaty. That is why the intelligence community has consistently testified that, while the treaty is not completely verifiable, they regard it as a highly desirable tool that will enhance our knowledge of chemical weapons programs and our ability to stop them. 
The CWC's verification regime requires routine inspections of all declared facilities working with significant amounts of chemicals listed by the treaty. In addition, any site, declared or not, may be subject to short-notice challenge inspections if there are suspicions that it is being used to produce or store banned chemicals. 
The CWC also establishes significant trade restrictions on precursor chemicals. These restrictions will make it more difficult for nations who are not parties to the treaty to acquire these chemicals, and will provide us with much more information than we currently have about who is seeking to import such chemicals, and in what amounts. 
So the concern about verification, while valid, I believe has been more than adequately addressed. We must go into this treaty with our eyes open, aware that it will not detect every violation. But why would we deprive ourselves of the extremely useful tools and information this treaty would provide on the grounds that they are not fool-proof? It would be incredibly short-sighted to do so. 
Another concern that has been raised involves the potential theft of commercial or trade secrets. Nothing in the CWC or its implementation language require the United States, or any U.S. company, to provide any confidential business information to any foreign party. 
I am concerned about how this issue has been addressed in this implementation legislation. Under this bill, the American taxpayer must pay for the theft of confidential business information by foreign industrial spies. 
I think the better course is for the injured business to first take reasonable steps to seek compensation from the spy who stole the information or from the foreign company which used the stolen information to gain a competitive advantage, before going after the U.S. Treasury. I am hopeful that this issue can be addressed in the conference on this legislation, and I appreciate the commitment of the Senator from Arizona to continue to work with me on this. 
Mr. President, I think this debate really comes down to whether or not one supports international arms control agreements. Many of the criticisms of the CWC and implementation legislation were levied against all previous successful arms control treaties, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the START Treaty. 
Those who worry that the United States will weaken its vigilance in our efforts to guard against the threat of chemical weapons have actually done us a service. I believe the intensity of this debate has helped to ensure that we will never allow ourselves to believe that the treaty by itself is enough. We will follow the course that President Reagan did--a strong national defense and arms control agreements with verification. 
The CWC is not a panacea, and none of its proponents believes it is. It will not by itself banish chemical weapons from the earth, but it would result in the destruction of much of the world's chemical weapons stocks, and provide us with a valuable set of tools that would significantly strengthen our ability to monitor and defend against the threat of chemical weapons. 
I am very pleased that both sides of this debate were able to work together and come to what I feel is, overall, a good agreement. I urge my colleagues to vote for the CWC Implementation Legislation. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished floor leader. I very much appreciate the 5 minutes. 
Madam President, I have watched this debate now for the last couple of hours from my office. I think it is an important debate. In a sense it is a bellwether debate. 
I think the case which the proponents for the Hatch-Kennedy legislation have made is very clear and a strong case. Probably no State would be more helped by the Hatch-Kennedy legislation than my own State, the State of California. 
I had the privilege of working with the Senator from Louisiana as our Democratic leader, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, as a Republican leader on the centrist coalition. Over a period of about a year and a half in that work I have come to the conclusion that the only way to balance the budget is in a bipartisan way; that if it is a Democratic budget, Republicans vote against it; and, if it is a Republican budget, Democrats vote against it. Therefore, it has always seemed to me that the only way you do this is to sit down and work the numbers out together and come up with a plan. 
What do you know, Madam President, that has happened. And it has happened because of the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee. It has happened because of the President. It has happened because of the majority and minority leaders of both sides of this great House giving their imprimatur to the process and participating. After 4 or 5 months of discussions there is an agreement. 
It is not everything that everybody wants, but if you believe, as I do, that the only way to balance this budget is to do this, then this becomes a very significant debate. I would like to vote for Hatch-Kennedy. It would help my State. We have--let me give you the exact figure--1.7 million uninsured children in California. This is a big deal. I would like to vote for it. 
If this bill is taken down, though, it is a major commitment and statement that this body cannot work together, that both sides of this body cannot solve what is a critical problem facing this Nation. Every week, I have a meeting of constituents, about 100, 125 people, who just happen to come by the office, and I show them a small pie of outlays in the year 2003, that if we do not do something, what happens. The result of the small pie is that you have almost 75 percent of the outlays of the Federal Government consumed by net interest on the debt and entitlements. And by then, you could eliminate all discretionary spending and you cannot solve the problem. 
Well, we have not gone the whole way, but this bill before this House goes a major way in solving the problem. 
I stood with the President in Baltimore. I said I would support this, as did a number of people on our side. The Senator from Louisiana was there. We stood and we remarked how close the numbers in this budget bill are to the numbers of the centrist coalition. So we felt in some way that our year and a half, or whatever it has been, I say to the Senator from Louisiana, has been worthwhile. 
I am very concerned. I am very concerned that this bill will be taken down if this amendment is successful. I would like to vote for this amendment. So I am looking for a way, and I hope that both the minority leader and the majority leader might in some way hear this, that there might be a time when we could have a separate vote agreed to on Hatch-Kennedy and move ahead with this budget reconciliation bill at this time.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana very much. It has been a very special privilege for me to work with the Senator on the centrist coalition. 
I am not in the leadership of this body, but I would be hopeful that the leadership would hear this. I think this budget agreement--on our side, we have said every time we have had the debate on the balanced budget amendment, we do not need an amendment to the Constitution. Let us just sit down and do it. Well, we make a mockery of our own statements if we do not sit down and do it right now. And we have that opportunity to do it in this agreed-upon compromise. 
So I would be hopeful that it might be possible to put together some guarantee both for the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Massachusetts, who have worked so hard, both of them. I have never seen the chairman of the Judiciary Committee as passionate as he has been in the Chamber in the last 2 hours. He obviously believes. The Senator from Massachusetts has a long history--the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, other bills, his chairmanship and his ranking status on the Labor Committee. I think we know his commitment and we know he will be there for working families and for children at any time. I hope there can be some appreciation in this body for the need to have an agreement to honor the agreement that was made and to once and for all say to the American public we have come together as two political parties. We have balanced this budget by the end of 5 years, and we can all be proud of working together.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida for this opportunity. 
One of my great pleasures in the Senate has been to chair the Senate Cancer Coalition with Senator Mack, and in that capacity, we have had four hearings. We have listened and heard a great deal about cancer. 
I think, Mr. President, if you ask the American people two questions about Federal spending, in two areas, and if you asked, `How much do we spend as a portion of our budget on foreign operations?' the American people would think it is very high. If you ask them, `What do you think we spend on research for health?' I think they would say it is a great deal. In fact, it is less than one percent of our budget. 
Today, at the NIH only 28 percent of the grant applications are funded. That is down from 30 percent in 1992. We are doing less. Only 20 percent of new grants are funded. 
How would NIH use more funds? They would use the funds in areas that show scientific promise: 
Brain disorders: areas such as neural development, neural degeneration, with emphasis on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 
New Therapies: drugs to combat cancer and AIDS; bioengineering to repair damaged tissues; treatments to improve care at the end of life. 
Genetics: better identification of inherited mutations which contribute to cancer risk; better identification of environmental impact of genetic mutations. 
Now let's turn to the National Cancer Institute. 
The National Cancer Institute in fiscal year 1997 can only fund 26 percent of grant applications. NCI funded 32 percent in 1992. They are down in 4 years from funding 32 percent to 26 percent of grant applications. 
General Norman Schwarzkopf, a prostate cancer patient, said: `During the past decade, Federal funding for cancer research has, after adjusting for inflation, increased only one percent.' 
Mr. President, 7.4 million Americans have a history of cancer; 1.3 million cases will be diagnosed this year and 560,000 Americans will die. But we spend one tenth of one cent of every Federal dollar on cancer research. 
On May 7, NCI Director Dr. Klausner said NCI could use double its current funding. How would NCI use additional funds? First, experts say they could increase the testing and search for causes of cancer. Second, more people could participate in cancer trials. We could increase access of eligible adult cancer patients participating in clinical trials. Today, only 2 percent of eligible cancer patients can participate and we could increase that to 20 percent. NIH could increase the number of cancer centers from 55 to 75. Cancer researchers could improve earlier detection of cancer and expand studies of environmental risk factors for cancer, as was urged by experts at a recent hearing of our Senate Cancer Coalition. NCI could monitor more people to better understand the impact of treatment on cancer patients. Today, NCI can monitor only 10 percent of the American population with cancer, a sample that is too small. More monitoring can yield more information about the outcome of treatments. 
Mr. President, NCI has identified five important new research areas that could realize the large dividends that are described in NCI's `bypass budget.' What is the bypass budget? The Congress requested the National Cancer Institute to annually identify, in their professional judgment, their promising scientific unmet needs. 
Here is what they are: First, Cancer genetics: Within 5 years, the goal is to identify every major human gene predisposing to cancer. Second, NCI could increase animal models of human cancers that would allow testing in animals of early detection, prevention, and treatment strategies. Third, NCI could improve detection technologies, to sharpen the sensitivity of technologies and smaller numbers of tumor cells. Fourth, NCI could improve developmental diagnostics to better understand the difference in and the properties of tumors, how they change, how they respond to treatment and thereby improve the treatments. And fifth, NCI could increase what is called investigator-initiated research by 30 percent, to capitalize on new ideas and talent all across the country. This would increase research conducted in universities and labs. 
With our aging population growing, our research needs will grow. People are living longer. By the year 2000, the number of people aged 75 to 84 will increase by one-third, to 12.3 million people. People over 85, the fastest growing segment of our population, will grow 70 percent, to 4.9 million. One-third of U.S. health care spending today goes to people over age 65. These costs, left unabated, will grow exponentially. The rising aged population will tax Medicare, Medicaid and the health system overall. 
NIH is working on research to delay the diseases and disabilities of aging. Let me give some examples. Mr. President, 4 million Americans today have Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative disorder that can leave people unable to function on their own. By delaying the onset of Alzheimer's for 5 years, we can save $50 billion annually. 
Half of all people over age 65 have symptoms of arthritis. Osteoarthritis costs $8 billion annually. By delaying the onset by 5 years, we can save $4 billion. 
Hearing loss: 30 percent of adults age 65 to 75, and 40 percent of those over 75, have some degree of hearing impairment. Delaying the onset by just 5 years could save $15 billion annually. What is my point? Research is cost effective. 
We need more health research because we have diseases and disorders for which there is no cure. 
AIDS has surpassed accidents as the leading killer of young adults. It is now the leading cause of death among Americans age 25 to 44. 
The prevalence of diabetes has steadily increased over the 
past 35 years. 
Just pick up Time magazine and you see that asthma rates jumped 58 percent, from 1982 to 1992 for children, and asthma is the leading cause of school absences from chronic conditions. 
40,000 infants die each year from devastating diseases, and 20 million Americans have rare diseases for which there are few effective treatments. Seven to ten percent of children are learning disabled. 
The rate of low birth-weight among African-American children is 13 percent, compared to 6.2 percent for white Americans. One condition that increases the risk of premature delivery is bacterial vaginosis, and African Americans have a higher rate. 
So we can alleviate suffering, find treatments, cure diseases, if we have the research, if we devote the resources to it. The irony is that most people, 75 percent of the people in America, would pay higher taxes for this kind of research. 
I contend that increased research will reduce health care costs. Let me give some examples of annual economic costs. Cancer, $104 billion annually; heart disease, $128 billion; Alzheimer's, $100 billion; diabetes, $138 billion; mental disorders, $148 billion; stroke, $30 billion. A 5-year delay in Alzheimer's--again, $50 million savings. Savings in delaying the onset of stroke would be $15 billion. And a delay in the onset of Parkinson's disease would save $3 billion annually. 
For every $1 spent on measles/mumps/rubella vaccine, $21 is saved. For diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine, $29 is saved. This is prevention. And research can bring us prevention. 
Hip fractures, common among the elderly, are a leading cause of nursing home admissions. They account for one in every 5 admissions. NIH research found that estrogen therapy reduces osteoporosis and hip fractures. In 1991, 1 year alone, the reduction in fractures in women taking estrogen replacement saved $333 million in these nursing home admission costs. 
Medicaid and Medicare: 56 percent of nursing home costs are paid by these programs. They total over $44 billion annually. These costs are rising. We all know this from our budget deficit debate. By delaying the onset of chronic aging-related illnesses, spending for nursing home care could be cut by $35 billion. 
What is my point? My point is health research makes sense for many reasons, but we are not doing as well as we could. The scientific community has repeatedly pointed out that we are neglecting research. The Institute of Medicine has described U.S. clinical health research as, `in a state of crisis.' Without adequate support, we will see a serious deficiency of clinical expertise, a reduction in effective clinical interventions, increases in human suffering and disability, and increases in the costs of health care.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Domenici, Lautenberg, Boxer, Chafee, DeWine, D'Amato, and Kennedy am offering the sense of the Senate that would require the Finance Committee to allow elderly legal immigrants to continue receiving SSI during their redetermination period. Under the current budget agreement, all elderly would be cut off of SSI as of October 1, 1997. 
I want to acknowledge the leadership of the bill managers on both sides for their recognition of the devastating impact this budget agreement has on over 400,000 elderly legal immigrants, and encouraging the Senate to provide an important interim provision. 
While I support the budget resolution's broad budget balancing framework, I have expressed over and over again, my deep concerns over its failure to restore SSI for over 400,000 elderly legal immigrants, 30 percent of which are over the age of 75 and who will be cut off from SSI as of October 1, 1997. 
The current budget agreement, falls short of what is needed to keep the elderly immigrants from losing their life supporting benefits. 
The Budget Agreement provides: 
SSI benefits for disabled legal immigrants who are disabled and were in the country as of August 22, 1996. 
SSI benefits for those who became disabled and got on the rolls between August 22, 1996 to June 1, 1997. 
The budget agreement bans: 
SSI for most elderly legal immigrants, even those elderly immigrants who rely on SSI for survival. 
Food Stamps for most legal immigrants. 
Although restoring SSI for the disabled is an important first step to a major flaw in the Welfare Reform bill passed by Congress last year, the elderly legal immigrants who depend on SSI will still lose their benefits under the agreement. 
Under the current agreement, an 83-year-old woman with no family, who speaks little or no English, will be just as homeless as one who is disabled when she loses her SSI benefits. What is she supposed to do, get a job? 
Under Welfare Reform, approximately 725,000 elderly, blind, and disabled legal immigrants could lose SSI benefits on August 22 of this year. Under the budget agreement: 42.5 percent or 307,630 disabled legal immigrants who were receiving SSI as of the date of enactment of the Welfare Bill would continue receiving SSI. However, for 417,360 or 57.5 percent of elderly legal immigrants who are currently receiving SSI would be cut off as of October 1, 1997. 
The President estimates that 66 percent of the elderly legal immigrants who will be cut off from SSI initially could be recertified under the disabled category. 
However, due to what I believe is an unintended mistake, even those elderly legal immigrants who are also disabled would be cut off 
from SSI on October 1, 1997. The elderly would become eligible for SSI only if they requalify after the cutoff. 
CBO estimates that it would take 6 months or longer to rectify all the elderly legal immigrants currently on the rolls. During the recertification period, no elderly legal immigrant would be receiving SSI. How will they survive for 6 months? They will mostly become homeless or fall onto County General Assistance rolls. 
The impact of the SSI ban for elderly legal immigrants will be devastating and immediate, especially in the high immigrant States. 
In California, 163,900 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
In New York, 65,340 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
In Texas, 32,640 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
In Florida, 44,310 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
In Illinois, 13,360 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
In Massachusetts, 13,410 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
Come October 1, 1997, we will see hundreds of thousands of elderly legal immigrants, of which 30 percent are over 75 years old, and who may also be disabled, thrown out into the streets and homeless. 
Under the Budget Agreement, 137,728 or 34 percent of elderly legal immigrants nationwide will lose their SSI permanently because they will not be able to qualify as disabled; 55,726 elderly legal immigrants in California will lose their SSI; 22,215 elderly legal immigrants in New York will lose their SSI; 11,076 elderly legal immigrants in Texas will lose their SSI; 15,065 elderly legal immigrants in Florida will lose their SSI; 4,542 elderly legal immigrants in Illinois will lose their SSI; and 4,425 elderly legal immigrants in Massachusetts will lose their SSI. 
The alternatives for these elderly legal immigrants are bleak--if they do not have family who can care for them, they either end up in a homeless shelter or end up on County General Assistance rolls. 
Senator John Chafee and I have previously introduced a bill that would restore SSI benefits to all elderly, blind or disabled legal immigrants who were receiving SSI prior to the passage of the welfare reform bill. We propose that no current recipient should be thrown off from their SSI benefits. We agree that for those coming into the country after the enactment date, we ban SSI and require instead, the sponsors to be responsible for their family members. 
I believe that this is a responsible action that must be taken by Congress to correct a serious flaw in the welfare bill. 
Allowing the elderly to continue receiving their SSI until they can be recertified is the first step but not the final solution. The final solution is to provide for all elderly and disabled legal immigrants who were on SSI as of August 22, 1996, to continue receiving their SSI. 
As we go forward in the budget reconciliation process and final passage of the fiscal year 1998 budget, I urge my colleagues to support the Chafee-Feinstein provision that protects the elderly legal immigrants who were getting SSI at the date of enactment.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I myself find this a sad day. In a sense, it is a watershed debate, and I very much fear it is the first major legislative thrust to set this Nation back 30 years with respect to freedom of choice. 
I am going to speak about what freedom of choice really means. Essentially, to me it means that Government will not become involved in these most intimate decisions that a woman has to make, not become involved in legislating a woman's reproductive system, what she must do, when she must do it, and how she must do it, but that government will essentially leave those intimate decisions to the physician, to a woman, to her faith, and to medicine. And here we have the Congress of the United States essentially saying that every woman in this country who may find out in her third trimester that she has a horribly, severely deformed child with anomalies incompatible with life, and if that child can be born, even if it is a major threat to her health, she must deliver that child. 
Unfortunately, no Member of this body is going to be present, no Member of this body is going to hold that mother's hand and tell her that it is OK if she jeopardizes her health perhaps for the rest of her life. No Member of this Congress is going to be present in that delivery room and see a child who is incompatible with life, a baby that may not have a brain, a baby that may have a brain outside the head or other major physical anomalies. No Member of this Congress will be there to see that child delivered to live an hour, 6 hours, a day, 4 days and then die, and the woman's health may be seriously, adversely harmed in a major way for the rest of her life. No one will be there. No one will say, `I'm so sorry, I didn't know about you when I cast this vote.' 
We are all accustomed to legislating, and when we legislate, we legislate for a majority, not for the exception. We legislate with some knowledge, or should, of what we are doing. But I think in this case, it is a very skewed knowledge. It is based on a case that the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania put forward of a young woman who I believe could have and would have been born in any event and saying that this one case typifies all mothers that we are talking about. In fact, it doesn't. 
I must express my profound dismay. My father was chief of surgery at the University of California Medical Center. My husband, Bert Feinstein, was a distinguished neurosurgeon. And all 
my life, I have lived in a medical family. As I read the AMA's letter, essentially what they are doing is providing some protection for doctors, but they are doing nothing to see that a woman's health is protected, and I feel very badly about that. Both my husband and my father were members of the American Medical Association. 
I take some heart in letters from the California Medical Association which indicate their opposition to this legislation and clearly state that they believe the amended legislation before us today falls very short of the mark. They indicate their strong opposition to this bill. I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record two letters I received from the California Medical Association.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe the California Medical Association still represents the largest group of physicians anywhere in this Nation. No one seems to care about the Constitution, that this bill constitutes a direct challenge to the Roe versus Wade Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court held that in Roe, a woman has a constitutional right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. It set for the different trimesters, some specific limitations on that right, that before viability, abortion cannot be banned; after viability, the Government can prohibit abortion, except when necessary to protect a woman's life or health.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 6, a resolution expressing concern over the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Afghanistan and calling on the United States and the international community to redouble efforts to bring peace to that war-torn land. 
Indeed, with yesterday's announcement that the Taliban militia have apparently seized power in the northwestern province of Faryab, it is especially fitting that we consider this resolution today. 
I am particularly concerned about the situation in Afghanistan because, with the seizure of power by the Taliban militia, it appears that another tragic chapter in the story of the suppression of women's rights is being written. Worse still, this situation has unfolded with scant international attention, let alone condemnation. 
Afghanistan has been embroiled in an almost constant state of war for close to two decades. 
From 1979 to 1989 the Mujahedeen fought and finally outlasted the invading army of the Soviet Union. Then the Muslim warriors turned on each other. Since 1979 more than 1 million of Afghanistan's 16 million inhabitants have been killed, and millions more have become refugees. The capitol city of Kabul has been obliterated by the factional fighting, with over 45,000 civilians killed, and almost every prominent building damaged or destroyed. 
In the last 2 years of the seemingly endless Afghan civil war the Taliban--who grew from a movement of former religious students and Islamic clerics along the Afghan-Pakistani border --have emerged as the strongest of the five major factions. After beating back its rivals, the Taliban movement now control more than two-thirds of Afghanistan, including Kabul, which they captured last September. 
With the ascendency of the Taliban, Afghanistan is experiencing a new conflict: What some warriors call true Islam, others, including the U.N. General Assembly, say is an abuse of human rights. 
Although the peculiar version of Islamic religious Sharia law espoused by the Taliban has fallen harshly on many in Afghanistan--in Kandahar this past July a man and woman accused of adultery were stoned in public, men have been forced to grow beards, and Taliban militia members harass men in the streets if they do not rush to the mosques for prayers--women, in particular, have come to feel the full brunt of the new extremism. 
Afghani women have been banned from work. 
Women have been banished from school. 
Reportedly, Taliban soldiers have been so threatening that some women have not left their homes for months. 
But there is nothing in Afghan tradition that can account for the Taliban phenomenon. The type of secret-police state that they are fostering and the widespread denial of women's basic human rights has little precedent in Afghan culture or history. 
The new brand of extremism fostered by the Taliban and their gross violations of women's basic human rights have pushed an already war-torn and war-weary Afghanistan to the brink of disaster. 
It is estimated, for example, that close to 500,000 to 800,000 war widows have been forced out of their jobs and have no opportunity to earn money for food, clothing, or shelter for either themselves or their children. In Kabul's stark ruins hordes of children--12,000 according to one estimate--paw each day through the shattered bricks and masonry in search of scrap metal that can be sold. And their mothers, many who previously worked in professional jobs, have been reduced to begging in the hopes of being able to feed their children. 
The ban on women in the workplace has also compounded the already precarious food situation. With the war having killed more than 9 million head of cattle and sheep and destroyed much of Afghanistan's croplands, irrigation systems, and roads, the average Afghan has a caloric intake equal to less than a pound of bread a day. Relief needs are so critical that the United Nations expects to have to feed one in five Kabul residents this year. 
Ironically, many of the relief and other local humanitarian agencies find that they can no longer hire local women--many of whom are highly skilled. An orphanage in Kabul has reportedly lost all but 100 of its 450 employees, decimating its ability to provide food, education, and medical care to thousands of children. In fact, in light of the continuing conflict, U.N. development agencies in Afghanistan have recently put operations on hold until an assessment of the situation is complete. 
It is little surprise that a recent U.N. report on human rights in Afghanistan concluded that `deprivation of basic rights and freedoms' are coupled with `newly emerging threats to basic rights,' especially women's. 
The silence from the world's capitols in light of these systematic abuses has been deafening. Former U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali warned the Taliban that the United Nations objects to the extreme discrimination practiced against women. The European Union's Minister to the U.N. Food Conference expressed `deep concern' over the situation. Theresa Loar, the State Department's senior coordinator for women's issues has assured us that the situation in Afghanistan is `very high on the United States agenda.' 
In the nuanced language of diplomacy, these milquetoast statements are the equivalent of an international shrug of the shoulders. 
Where is the world's outrage? Fully half of Afghanistan's population cannot work for a living or be educated. The world has responded by issuing mild denunciations and turning away. This is unacceptable. 
In calling for the President to monitor the human rights situation in Afghanistan, and the situation of women in particular, this resolution calls on the United States to play a leading role in the international community in raising the salience of respect for women's rights. 
For too long and in too many other tragic circumstances we have remained silent, placing women's rights on a second tier of concerns in our conduct of international affairs. Other Muslim nations with which the United States enjoys good relations and which respect women's rights, such as Turkey and Indonesia, can provide much needed leadership in this area, and assist the 
United States in our diplomatic efforts. It is incumbent upon us to call upon the nations of the international community --regardless of religious persuasion or cultural heritage--to take a strong stand in recognition of fundamental rights of women. 
Because the United States lacks significant influence in Afghanistan, this resolution calls on the administration to urge the other states in the region who do have influence to bring pressure to bear on the Taliban. In particular Pakistan--which has both elected the first female Prime Minister in the Islamic world and provided assistance to the Taliban--should cease to provide patronage to the Taliban and take a position at the forefront of international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. 
This resolution also recognizes that the only long-term solution to the plight of the Afghani people is to help bring an end to the conflict that has created the Taliban, and to begin the long process of rebuilding a stable and prosperous Afghanistan. Food security, let alone the sort of long-term economic redevelopment that will be necessary to repair Afghanistan's battered infrastructure will not be possible unless both men and women are able to take up gainful employment and have equal access to educational opportunities. 
To this end, this resolution calls for the members of the international community to cease activities, such as supplying weapons or financial assistance, to any of the warring factions in Afghanistan and encourages international efforts, especially that of the U.N. Special Mission, in procuring a durable and lasting peace in Afghanistan. 
The treatment of Afghanistan's women should not be ignored. To continue to do so will send a dangerous message to others around the world who might violate the human rights of ethnic or religious minorities, or their own female populations. 
I urge my colleagues to support Senate Concurrent Resolution 6, and send an important message to the Taliban and the entire international community regarding women's rights.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the senior Senator from Georgia for his leadership in this matter. This has been a difficult area, I think, for both of us, because I believe we both respect Mexico. We know that Mexico is an ally, a friend, a neighbor, and we want to see relations become much better and much more fully developed. We do not want to see a rift continuing to develop, so, we have worked with that spirit in mind. Yet, one can want this equal partnership but also continue to point out the facts of what is happening in our States and our region, and particularly along the southwest border. So I thank the Senator from Georgia for his leadership. It has been, as he knows, a great pleasure for me to be able to work with him. It has been a wonderful experience. We will keep it going. 
I also want to extend my thanks to the President and to the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger. Both Senator Coverdell, as he indicated, and I--we have met separately with the administration. We have both made the same request that this report, described by our Senate resolution, be rendered by the administration to this body. 
Let me begin by saying the administration could easily have said no. There is no legislative vehicle that accompanies this request. But they did agree, in our negotiations, to honor this request, and they have kept that commitment and, in effect, will produce the report on September 1. I am heartened by that. As my colleague just spoke, we are heartened because we hope it will be a new day of cooperation between the executive and the legislative branches in what is rapidly becoming the soft underbelly of this Nation as well as the Mexican nation, and that of course is drugs. 
As many know, I have a bill which is now in the Judiciary Committee's bill called the Gang Violence Act. What we have discovered is that drugs are fueling a new extension of gangs working across the States. One of the steps I am hopeful this body will be taking is passage of that bill and, in essence, applying to street gangs, who are organized and moving across State lines, the same racketeering statutes that we would apply to Mafia-type organized crime--expanding the Travel Act, putting in asset seizures and forfeitures, effectively doubling Federal penalties for Americans who participate in major drug trafficking, gun running, and other criminal activity, across State lines. 
So, we will take major steps in this Nation to combat our problem, which is one of demand for drugs. The report that we have asked the administration to produce will deal with Mexico's progress in the following areas: 
Efforts to combat drug cartels--four big Mexican drug cartels are operating with impunity beyond our border; bilateral law enforcement cooperation--we are very interested in a partnership between our Drug Enforcement Administration and Mexican drug authorities, but to have our agents in Mexico unable to arm themselves makes no sense, particularly with the record of assassination that the cartels have established; improved border enforcement--obvious; extradition of Mexican nationals wanted in the United States on drug charges; implementation of money-laundering laws; increased crop eradication; rooting out corruption; and improved air and maritime cooperation. All of these points are elucidated in our Senate resolution requesting this report, and the administration has agreed, unilaterally, to provide it. For that I am very thankful. 
Let me talk about one area, and that area is extradition. This is an area which for me is a litmus test as to whether there is cooperation. I want to give one case that was just written up in the May 13, 1997 Los Angeles Times by Anne-Marie O'Connor. It is not a traditional case, in terms of names like Amado Carillo-Fuentes--well-known cartel names. This case deals with a family by the name of Reynoso: Antonio Reynoso and two brothers, Jose and Jesus Reynoso. They were indicted among 22 alleged members of a vast ring that transported cocaine from Mexico to Los Angeles to Chicago and to New Jersey, using Lear jets, boilers, and canned vegetables. They are named in an extradition request presented by this country to the Mexican Government. Last September, Jose Reynoso pled guilty on a drug-smuggling charge. Both Antonio and Jesus are under indictment for conspiracy to import and possess cocaine with intent to distribute, as well as for money laundering. In the last 2 years, they have built a magnificent home within a stone's throw of the border between San Diego and Tijuana. There is a small picture in the Los Angeles Times, which shows the border fence and then this drug lord's home right across the border fence. I want to describe it to you for a moment. I am quoting from the Los Angeles Times.  
To their profound annoyance, Justice Department officials say, Reynoso, 53, is putting the finishing touches on an ostentatious walled residence that backs right up to the U.S. border. If he wanted to, he could hit a tennis ball into San Diego County. 
The article goes on to describe the mansion: 
Encircled by a forbidding wall that ascends 35 feet, chateau Reynoso rises like a ship over San Diego County, not far from a binational gulch called `Smuggler's Canyon.' [Where I have been.] With its turret, a glass pool atrium and a dazzling green roof worthy of Oz, it is so conspicuous that Border Patrol agents sometimes point it out to visitors. 
U.S. law enforcement officers note its fortress architecture and its protected position at the end of a narrow cul-de-sac. So close to the United States, they complain, yet so far from a San Diego courtroom. 
`I wish we could just tunnel back and grab him,' a Justice Department attorney said. 
Then it goes on to say: 
. . . Reynoso's name has appeared on lists of traffickers given to Mexican authorities by United States Attorney General Janet Reno. But no discernible action has been taken. U.S. officials have no indications that Reynoso is even a wanted man in Mexico. 
This same family was the mastermind behind a huge tunnel, 60 feet below the ground, between Otay Mesa and San Diego. This tunnel had electricity, it had air conditioning, and it was used by this family to smuggle drugs under the border into the United States. It was one of the most sophisticated tunnels, really, ever known. This family spent $1.1 million buying the lot in Otay Mesa where the passage's exit was to be located. 
This is a clear indication, I believe, of what Senator Coverdell and I will be looking for in terms of actions taken by the Mexican Government. We will have another round on 
certification. It is important to both of us, as well as, I believe, to a majority of this body, that there be actions taken in this equal partnership between the United States and Mexico. Let me just summarize. 
The response from a good friend, a neighbor, and an ally that drugs are exclusively a U.S. problem is simply not adequate. We admit that we have a demand problem. We have taken steps to strengthen our laws, to allocate funds for prevention programs. Still, we know we must do more and we are willing to say we will and do it. 
But when Mexican nationals run meth labs throughout California--and over 700 meth labs have been seized by the State Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement in California alone in the last year, 700 of them--and Mexico refuses to enforce its border, the drug problem is not our problem alone.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. When drug cartels are brazen enough to kill Government officials and church leaders in cold blood, the drug problem is not our problem alone. When the cartels are operating with such impunity that they do not hesitate to bribe officials on both sides of the border and, as `Nightline' has just pointed out, to buy up businesses along the border, the drug problem is not our problem alone. So the drug problem is a problem for both sides. What we need is a cooperative effort of both nations acting as full partners. Neither the United States nor Mexico can win this battle alone. 
The report that the President has now committed to provide to the Congress on September 1 will be an important indicator of whether or not Mexico has taken the decision to approach this terrible problem in a cooperative partnership and in a fully committed way. Unless the report can cite significant and demonstrable progress in cooperation, the answer, very sadly, will be that Mexico has not yet taken such a decision. I hope that is not the case on September 1. 
To me, this report is very meaningful. The point I want to make is that I believe the expectation of a majority of this body is that there be tangible and substantial steps taken that are visible, discernible, and real to combat the cartels and to stop the corruption, the bribing, and the sort of total disregard for law which is now characteristic of the situation. 
I, for one, will watch the extradition picture especially carefully.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a substitute amendment to H.R. 1122, which, as I said, is cosponsored by Senators Boxer and Moseley-Braun. The amendment we offer is presented as an alternative to the House-passed bill on so-called partial-birth abortions and as an alternative to the Daschle substitute as well. 
My colleagues and I offer this amendment for one reason: We very much believe that any legislation put forward by Congress that restricts access to abortions or to a particular medical procedure must be constitutional and must contain sufficient protections for a woman's health. The Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun bill provides that protection while instituting a ban on post-viability abortions similar to that in the Daschle bill. 
Our bill does three things. 
First, it prohibits all abortions after a fetus has become viable or able to live independently outside of the mother's womb. 
Second, it provides an exception for cases where, in the medical judgment of a physician, an abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the mother or to prevent serious adverse health consequences to the mother. 
And third, it provides stringent civil penalties for physicians performing post-viability abortions in the absence of compelling medical reasons. 
The penalties are limited to the physician and include for the first offense a fine of $100,000, and referral to a State licensing board for possible suspension of the medical license. 
For the second offense, the fine would be up to $250,000, with referral to the State licensing board for possible revocation of license. 
There is no health exception in H.R. 1122, known as the Santorum bill. And we do not believe that the health exception provided in the Daschle bill is sufficient, nor do we believe that it will meet the constitutional test. 
Let me begin by speaking of my opposition to the House bill. And let me begin by pleading with anyone listening to this debate to read the bill--read H.R. 1122. It is short. It is easy to read. I want to quote from page 2 of that bill to illustrate what this bill does. 
Let me begin on line 9: 
Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both. 
The bill refers to a `partial-birth abortion,' which is a term not existing in medical literature or medical texts. So let us find out what a partial-birth abortion is. And we turn to line 19 of page 2 for that description: 
As used in this section, the term `partial-birth abortion' means an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery. 
The issue here is clear. We heard yesterday on this floor a vivid description of a procedure, a procedure known as `intact D&E.' Nowhere in House Resolution 1122 are `intact D&E' or `intact D&X' or any medical procedure referred to. Instead, we have a term not existent in medical science anywhere called `partial-birth abortion.' 
Now, anyone who is familiar with a woman's physiology knows that this term can be used to deny second-trimester and third-trimester abortions--virtually, I believe, all of them. 
If the concern of the authors of this legislation were truly in fact to prohibit or ban one specific procedure, why would they not spell out what the procedure is in legislative language just as they have graphically spelled out the procedure on the Senate floor? Why? Why not do that? 
I believe there is a reason why they did not do that. And the 
reason is, that I sincerely believe that this bill is meant to do much more, much more than simply ban a procedure known as intact D&X or intact D&E. I believe that this bill is essentially a Trojan horse, a Trojan horse in the sense that it is not at all what it seems to be on the outside. 
If you look on the inside, which means opening the page of the bill, you will see that this bill is the first major legislative thrust to make abortion in the United States of America illegal. 
I stated yesterday on the floor that we are really a product of our live's experiences. And my life's experiences that have caused me to be essentially pro-choice are essentially threefold. 
The first, my days in college at Stanford University, days when I remember a bright young woman who committed suicide because she was pregnant and abortion was illegal in the United States. And I also remember the passing of a plate in a college dormitory so that another friend could go to Mexico for an abortion. I remember that well. 
My second life experience was in the early 1960's at the California Institution for Women, the women's prison in California for women convicted of felonies, where I set sentences and granted paroles to women convicted of providing abortions. I remember this well because the only way a case really came to the attention of the authorities was either through the morbidity or the mortality of the patient. 
And I remember the graphic stories in those cumulative summaries that were given to us prior to term setting, of what happened to women who were victims of illegal abortions. And I remember that the women who provided the abortions would leave and come back and commit the same crime again because of the importunings of other women. 
And the third graphic experience for me was becoming a grandmother and finding out that my daughter in her pregnancy had an unexpected, very serious, potentially life-threatening problem, and realizing how surprised I was not to know that this could happen in this day and age. But it did happen. 
My story--my daughter's story--came out fine because today I have a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and wonderful, light of my life, in the form of a 4 1/2 -year-old granddaughter by the name of Eileen. 
But I learned that there can be unpredictable occurrences, and that when we legislate--in a piece of paper that becomes an abiding law enforced everywhere throughout the United States of America--we ought to legislate with the knowledge that human life and human experience has many permutations that are unexpected and unanticipated. 
I view H.R. 1122 as doing much, much more than banning a simple procedure. That procedure is not mentioned anywhere in this piece of legislation. But it does set up the basis for lawsuit after lawsuit against any physician that might practice and might perform a second-trimester abortion. Every other type of abortion in some way has the head of the fetus coming through the birth canal. And then the case is, at what point is that fetus still living or not living? And so I think it is a potentially very dangerous piece of legislation in that regard. 
I mentioned yesterday that I basically do not believe that intact D&E or intact D&X should be used, that there are other forms of abortion. That is my personal belief. And I believe that the AMA is on its way in a medical venue of taking some steps to limit it. We all know we are talking about less than 1 percent of all of the abortions that take place in this country, in any event. 
So the question is, what do we do? What kind of legislation do we present that recognizes the exigencies, the human trials, the difficulties that a woman can have? 
Yesterday, I mentioned a young nurse; her name is Viki Wilson. When I was a county supervisor and mayor, I worked with her mother, Susan Wilson, who was a supervisor from Santa Clara County. Viki Wilson is a nurse, married to a doctor. In her 36th week she had a sonogram and she found out she had a severely deformed baby with its brain outside its skull. She learned that the contractions she was having were actually seizures that the child was having and that the child was incompatible of sustaining life outside of the womb. 
She went to a doctor and her doctor recommended the particular procedure that is under siege here today, as the procedure, at that stage of her pregnancy, that would be most protective of her health. I cannot tell you whether it was or not. I am not a physician. There is only one physician in this body who might know. Yet, we are going to legislate, in a bill that is drafted to be so broad, that it can impact much more than one procedure. 
The amendment that the three of us present to this body today, we believe, comports with Roe versus Wade. We believe it would not put in jeopardy every second- and third-trimester abortion. We believe it would prohibit every third-trimester abortion unless the life and the health, as defined by serious adverse health consequences to the mother, were at risk, and that this decision would be made by the physician and the woman, which I think is the appropriate remedy for this issue. 
I think this is a very difficult debate because most people have not read the bill before the Senate, H.R. 1122. Most people really do not understand the whole panoply of human ills that can take place in a pregnancy. 
I believe the AMA, in the recent paper they have put forward, very clearly indicates they believe that, with few exceptions, this procedure that is at question should not be used. However, they are not--and I think rightly so--not ready to sacrifice the integrity of the medical profession to say that no doctor, no matter what the situation is, no matter what the physiology of the woman may be, no matter that she may not be able to have another procedure, that she might be adversely impacted healthwise, cannot, no matter what the situation is, have this procedure as a remedy. 
Mr. President, we present to you a bill that we believe is constitutional, a bill that would ban all third-trimester abortions, unless the life and health of the woman, as defined as serious adverse health consequences, were threatened. The bill includes very strong civil penalties, which we believe would be a substantial deterrent to the performance of any third-trimester abortions unless there is a very serious medical need. 
Mr. President, I notice my distinguished colleague, and I ask the Senator from Massachusetts how much time he desires.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to wrap up, if I might. Let me begin by saying that you have just heard on our side from four women Senators and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who is not lucky enough to be a woman, but from four women. All of us have been pregnant; all of us have given birth to a child; two of us are grandparents. And I think among the four of us there is an understanding of the vicissitudes and the problems that are inherent both in our physiology as well as in a pregnancy. It is my contention that the bill before us, H.R. 1122, is about much more than one procedure. 
Let me quote from the only Member among us who is a physician in his comments yesterday on this floor. I am reading from the Congressional Record. 
From the outset, I will admit that it has been difficult for me to imagine how a procedure that is not taught in residency programs where obstetricians are trained--it is not taught today; it is not referenced in our peer-reviewed journals, which is really the substance, the literature through which we teach each other and share information; it is not in peer-reviewed journals--it is a little bit hard for me to understand how people could argue that this is the best procedure available. Really until the recent controversy, many practitioners who you talk to had never heard of this particular procedure. 
In fact, that is the case. I would now like to quote from the AMA report of the board of trustees dated yesterday: 
From a medical perspective the language used in the proposed legislation--H.R. 1122--`partially vaginally deliver a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery' does not refer to a specific obstetrical/surgical technique, nor does it refer to a specific stage of gestation (i.e., pre- or post-viability). In fact, the description in the proposed legislation could be interpreted to include many recognized abortion and obstetric techniques (such as those used during dilation and evacuation (D & E)) or other procedures used to induce abortion. 
This is exactly my concern about H.R. 1122. I think H.R. 1122, as I described earlier, is in fact a Trojan horse. It is not what it seems to be. Not one medical procedure is referenced in H.R. 1122. Rather, a vague definition of what is called partial-birth abortion. Partial-birth abortion is referred to nowhere in any of the medical literature. I believe the reason this bill is drafted that way is because it is much broader in what it intends to do. I believe what it intends to do is essentially stop second- and third-trimester abortions with no consideration for the woman's health. 
Now, you have heard here today, you have heard descriptions by my colleague, Senator Boxer, and by myself, and by the other women, of instances of malformed, seriously malformed, fetuses which cannot sustain life outside the womb. Yet, leaving a woman to have to deliver these babies could present a considerable risk to her health. 
Now, what we are struggling to do is find a way to say we agree there should not be third-trimester abortions, except--except when the life or the health of the mother is at risk. And then we are trying to set a definition of health that will meet the constitutional test of Roe versus Wade. 
What is clear to me is that restrictive definitions of health will not meet the constitutional test of Roe versus Wade. So we have taken the definition that we believe will stand the test of constitutionality, `serious, adverse health consequences for the woman,' and we, more fundamentally in the regulations we prescribe in section 4 of our bill, say, `We are requiring an attending physician, described in section 2(b), to certify to the Department of Health and Human Services that, in the best medical judgment of the physician, the abortion described was medically necessary to preserve the life or to avert serious adverse health consequences to the woman involved.' And then--this is the important language--`and to describe the medical indications supporting the judgment.' So that the physician who makes the decision that the life or health of the mother is dependent on an abortion must support that, must indicate what his medical judgments were, must indicate what the condition of the fetus was. 
One of the big problems in this debate--and I say this respectfully to the Senator from Pennsylvania, because reasonable people can differ--is that conditions of the health of the mother and conditions of the fetus can also vary. We all know there are medical diagnoses. We know that within these medical diagnoses the severity can differ. Conditions have different degrees of seriousness. Severe, serious abnormalities incompatible with life--that is also what we are talking about in this bill. I believe that within the confines of Roe versus Wade, we have developed a constitutional measure which prohibits third-trimester abortions, provides a health and life exception that is constitutional, provides that the medical doctor must give his reasons and his findings as to why, if he does perform a third-trimester abortion, he or she is performing it, and outline these conditions. And we also provide substantial penalties--$100,000 on the first offense plus referral to the State Board of Medical Examiners for possible suspension of the medical license; and on a second offense, up to $250,000 and referral to the State Board of Medical Examiners for possible revocation of licensing. 
These are very hefty sums. I believe they provide a sufficient deterrent to the practice of third-trimester abortions unless the most serious situation is present.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In the findings of this same AMA paper, the American Medical Association board goes on to make this statement: 
The partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. The American Medical Association will use the term, `intact dilation and extraction,' to refer to a specific procedure comprised of the following elements: 
And then they describe the elements: 
This procedure is distinct from dilation and evacuation procedures more commonly used to induce abortion after the first trimester. Because partial-birth abortion is not a medical term, it will not be used by the American Medical Association. [And then it goes on.] According to the scientific literature, there does not appear to be any identified situation in which intact D&X is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion, and ethical concerns have been raised about intact D&X. We have heard these concerns. The American Medical Association recommends that the procedure not be used unless alternative procedures pose materially greater risk to the women. The physician must, however, retain the discretion to make that judgment, acting within standards of good medical practice and in the best interests of the patient. 
I happen to believe that is a correct judgment. I happen to believe that the physician must retain the discretion. And I must tell you, it scares me when this body is prepared to write in the concrete of a law that every State in this Union must abide by their judgments, untrained, unskilled, never, for the most part, having given birth to a child, never, for the most part, being intimately familiar with the physiology of a woman, and, yet, has the gumption to say: We are going to write laws. We are not going to have a health exception. And everybody in the United States is going to have to comply with this. 
I find that somewhat scary, because conditions do vary. Health circumstances do vary. We all know we can have a certain condition, and for some people it will be benign; for others, it can be terminal. And it can be the same condition. In terms of abnormalities, hydrocephalus has been mentioned on this floor. I have visited, in the old days, institutions where children walked around with their head on a crib because the head was so big they could not lift it off the crib. 
Medical science is wonderful. Now hydrocephalus, in many cases--not all--can be handled. So you can't say all hydrocephalics have the same problem. But it is conceivable, and it does happen, that there are serious hydrocephalic implications in some fetuses which make it impossible for them to sustain life on the outside, past any amount of time, or to be delivered in a way that they will not irreparably damage the health of the mother. This is also true. 
But there are variations and there are gradations. This legislation, H.R. 1122, does not take that into consideration. Rather, it says that, wholesale, anything that can come under the rubric of partial-birth abortion is hitherto prohibited. And if you commit it--we do not know what it is, the medical literature does not know what it is--but if you commit it, doctor, M.D., you are guilty of a crime. Can you imagine what this is going to do throughout the United States of America? It is going to have a chilling effect. Not only that. In addition to that, everybody out there can sue. 
I am perplexed why, if one wants to outlaw a particular procedure, why that procedure is not written up. It has been spoken about. It has been described. It is contained in specificity in this Record. But it is not in the legislation. Instead, the legislation has a much more sweeping impact. All one has to do, in my view, is read that legislation. 
Senator Boxer, Senator Moseley-Braun, and I have tried to write a piece of legislation which is very strong, which prohibits as a matter of law third-trimester abortions except when the life and the health of the mother are at stake, and which defines health in a way that it will meet a constitutional test. 
I believe we have done it. And it provides civil penalties that will deter and also say to the physician, as an additional test, if you perform one of these third-trimester abortions, know that you have to put in writing, subject to investigation, and send to the Federal Department of Health and Human Services the conditions, the reasons to justify that abortion. I think that is a sound piece of legislation. 
I do not think we will win because I think, unfortunately, this debate has been so characterized by egregious situations that everything other than the egregious situation has suddenly been washed away. Yet everything other than the egregious situation is out there in America every single day. I submit that, if legislation does not cover what is the real life of people, and the many different things to which they are subjected, you are going to have a much higher rate of both morbidity, which is physical harm to women, and mortality, which is death to women. That is the way it was before, and that is the way it will be again if we set the clock back. 
So I must--I know my colleague from California would like to make some comments--I would like to yield the floor to her. But I must earnestly implore this body, I would be very hopeful that Members will vote for this amendment and vote no on H.R. 1122. 
I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, consistent with my remarks made both on the 14th and today, it will be my intention to vote against the Daschle substitute amendment to H.R. 1122. 
I made the argument that I believe both H.R. 1122 as well as the Daschle substitute are unconstitutional. 
With respect to the Daschle amendment, my reading of it indicates that, even if a severely, horribly deformed fetus were capable of only 1 hour of life outside the womb, a woman would be forced to carry that pregnancy to full term and deliver that child, without consideration of what may be severely debilitating consequences to her health. 
For me that is not enlightened public policy, and I cannot support it.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in decrying the stranglehold that has been placed on Federal judicial nominations by the Senate, including the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member. 
The numbers bear repeating, because they are simply appalling. Last year, the Republican Senate confirmed an abysmally low number of judges--only 17. And none of these was for the courts of appeals. 
Compare this to when the roles were reversed in 1992, the year a Republican President was running for reelection and the Democrats controlled the Senate. That year, the Democratic Senate confirmed 66 Federal judges, including 11 court of appeals judges. 
It was thought that, after the election was over, the Senate would return to the normal course of fulfilling its constitutionally-mandated role in the judicial nomination process. 
Unfortunately, however, that has not proven to be the case. It is now mid-way through May, and the Senate has confirmed just two Federal judges. The Judiciary Committee has only held two nominations hearings. 
California has been especially hard-hit by this slowdown on Federal judges. More than one-fourth of the judges whose nominations are languishing in the Senate are from California--7 out of 26. 
Five of these seven judges were nominated in the last Congress. Let me tell you a little bit about each of them, to put some faces on the nominees whose lives have been disrupted by the Senate's extended failure to act on their nominations: 
Richard Paez is already a respected Federal judge on the district court in Los Angeles. He was nominated by the President to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on January 25, 1996. The Judiciary Committee gave him a hearing on July 31, 1996. However, the committee has never taken any further action on his nomination. 
Tomorrow, Christina Snyder will have been before the Committee for 1 full year, as she was first nominated by the President to Federal district court in Los Angeles on May 15, 1996. Ms. Snyder is a graduate of one of the top law schools in the country, Stanford Law School, for which she has since gone on to serve on the board of visitors. She is a member of the prestigious American Law Institute, and her nomination has received bipartisan support, including endorsements from the Republican mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, and the Republican Sheriff of Los Angeles County, Sherman Block. I am not aware of one whit of substantive opposition to her nomination. 
And yet, Ms. Snyder has been unable to get even a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Already this year, the committee has held hearings on the nominations of four men who were nominated after Ms. Snyder, including one who was only nominated for the first time this year, in 1997. I am optimistic that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee will agree to place Ms. Snyder on the agenda for the committee's next nomination hearing, and again urge him to do so. 
Margaret Morrow actually was favorably reported by the committee last year, unanimously, but her nomination died on the floor. She was nominated over a year ago, on May 9, 1996. Morrow is a graduate of Harvard Law School, was the first woman president of the State Bar of California, and has received numerous awards for her work as a lawyer and her commitment to public service. 
The committee held a second hearing on her nomination this year. But while the three men who were heard along with her have all been favorably reported out of the committee, she has not even been brought up for a vote. Her nomination has been slowed while members of the committee from the other side of the aisle pose round after round of follow-up questions to her, including asking for her view on some of the most controversial issues that have been considered by Californians on the ballot over the last 10 years. This level of scrutiny previously has been reserved for Supreme Court nominees, who shape constitutional interpretation, rather than merely following precedent a district court judge 
does. In my time on the committee, I have never seen this level of scrutiny applied to a male district court nominee. 
Jeffrey Miller is a superior court judge in San Diego, who was appointed to that post by Republican Governor Deukmejian. An accomplished jurist and a veteran of the State attorney general's office, he has been complimented by numerous fellow judges. First nominated last July, his nomination is now on the floor of the Senate. I hope that the majority leader will call up his nomination for action by the Senate. 
William Fletcher's nomination to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has been languishing for more than 2 years, having first been made on April 25, 1995. Fletcher is a professor at the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley, where he has won the Distinguished Teacher Award. He is a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard; he earned his law degree from Yale Law School; he is a Navy veteran, a Rhodes Scholar, and a former clerk on the U.S. Supreme Court. He was favorably reported by the committee almost a year ago, on May 16, 1996. However, the committee has taken no action on his nomination this year. 
This outstanding group of holdover nominees from the last Congress has been joined this year by two more nominees, Anthony Ishii and Lynn Lasry, who have been nominated to the Federal district courts for the Eastern District and Southern District of California, respectively. 
Mr. President, the time has come to act on these nominations. I'm not asking for a rubber stamp; let's hold hearings on those nominees who haven't had them, and vote on all of them, up or down, yes or no. 
California needs these judges. The chief judge of the ninth circuit, Procter Hug, Jr., has said,  
our federal courts here in the 9th Circuit, and particularly our court of appeals, are facing a vacancy crisis of serious proportions. We simply do not have enough active district and appellate judges to hear and decide cases in a prompt and timely manner. 
While filings in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have increased by over 60 percent since 1985, the court currently has 8 vacancies, more than any other circuit in the Nation. 
In the last 5 years, case filings in the Eastern District of California have skyrocketed by 49.7 percent. 
In the Southern District of California, case filings have increased by 94.7 percent since 1991--a pace that more than triples the national rate of increase of 27.5 percent. 
In an editorial last month, the Los Angeles Times put it well: 
[The Margaret Morrow] case is only one of many in a deplorable situation that has gone on far too long. Justice is not served by an empty bench. Nor is society. Whichever party holds the Congress and the White House, gamesmanship over judicial appointments produces no winners. It only leaves a void . . . 
[The Senate's] record of delay, attempts to kill funding for some appellate seats and its harassment of Morrow and other qualified nominees reveals a deeply troubling partisanship. 
Last we looked, the U.S. Constitution grants the President the power to nominate and directs the Senate to `advise and consent,' not stonewall. The 26 nominations now pending would be a good place to start. 
I urge my colleagues, let's end the gridlock on judges. Let's not hold the third branch of government hostage to partisan politics.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, it has often been said that one is a product of one's life experiences. Because this is a bill about so-called partial-birth abortion, and because there is no medical definition of partial-birth abortion, and because most of us believe that what is being referred to is a procedure either called intact D&E or intact D&X--but that is not reflected in the bill--and because the bill affects more than just the third trimester of a pregnancy but also goes into the second trimester, and because it carries with it criminal penalties, I want to share with this body how I am a product of my life experiences with respect to abortion. 
I well remember my early days. In college during the 1950's, abortion was illegal, and I knew young women who were in trouble. I knew one who committed suicide. I knew others who passed the plate to those of us in a dormitory--and this was Stanford University--to go to Mexico for an abortion. 
Later in the 1960's, I spent 8 days a year for 5 years sentencing women in the State prison, and I sentenced abortionists because abortion was still illegal in California in the early 1960's. I remember these cases particularly well. I remember the crude instruments used. I remember women who were horribly damaged by some of these illegal abortions. I remember mortality as well. And I always thought maybe one day we will get past this and not have to go back to it. 
What concerns me about this debate is that I see it as the opening wedge of a long march to take us back 30 years, back to the passing of the plate at Stanford, back to the back-alley abortionists. 
I will never forget one woman because abortion carried with it a maximum sentence of 10 years in State prison at the time. I sentenced this woman--I remember her name, I am not going to say it here--to the maximum sentence because she had been in and out of the State institution. This was her third time. 
Every time she went out I asked her why she continued. She said, `Because women were in such trouble and they had no other place to go, so they came to me because they knew I would take care of them.' That was the reality of life from 1960 to at least 1966 in California. I do not want women, young women, to have to go back to those days again. 
So basically I am pro-choice. I am also a member of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, so I have been present at all of the hearings on this so-called partial birth abortion bill. Essentially, I believe that abortion should be a matter for a woman, for her doctor, for her faith, for medicine, and not for politicians. One of the most perplexing things in my life has always been why men are so desperate to control a woman's reproductive system. 
Nonetheless, about 4 1/2 years ago, I became a grandmother of a little girl who is the light of my life. Her birth was not uncomplicated. My daughter had a pregnancy-related condition. It was a condition that women bleed to death from. You have, essentially, about 20 minutes from the time you begin to hemorrhage before your life is extinguished, and that of the child. 
This case of my daughter's is really only related to this whole debate in that it caused me to really think. I never thought that my daughter would be in a situation of this type. I began to think of the `whens' and `ifs,' and whether one could really predict all of the exigencies that a woman in pregnancy is subject to. I could not with my own daughter, because I never would have dreamt that this would have happened. For her, she was a lucky one. Although at home I am a block and a half from the hospital, they would not let her stay with me. She stayed in the hospital right next to an operating theater, so that for 2 months the baby grew in her womb, and then at 35 weeks she was able to have a C section. And we have a wonderful little granddaughter--bright eyed, bushy tailed--and the story came out OK. 
But I came to a few conclusions. The conclusion is, no matter how all-seeing we think we are, no one can possibly know all of the circumstances one may find themselves in. So, if we are going to pass laws, laws need to be flexible enough to anticipate the circumstances and to provide for a worthy exception. I basically believe that this intact D&E, or intact D&X, whichever one chooses to call it, is a procedure that should not be used. That is my basic belief and I think the AMA is beginning to come to grips with this and set down some precepts, as to when one should consider a late-term abortion. 
I believe that abortions post-viability should not take place except in the rarest of circumstances. And that the only case for a post-viability abortion is either to protect the life and health of the mother or in cases where there is such a serious, severe fetal abnormality that the abnormality is inconsistent with life. In other words, the child could not survive outside of the womb for any period of time. 
So, with my colleagues, Senator Boxer and Senator Moseley-Braun, we will offer a substitute at the appropriate time to the Santorum bill and one that will also be a substitute to the Daschle bill. Our bill will have the following provisions: 
It will prohibit all abortions after viability in a way that will meet the test of constitutionality. The provision for life and health of the mother does just that. 
The health requirement is drawn to correspond with the mandate of Roe versus Wade, to prevent serious adverse health consequences to the mother and not to restrict the judgment of the physician. 
Additionally, the goal is to provide for post-viability abortions only in cases of serious fetal anomalies--or abnormalities incompatible with life. 
The penalties of the bill will be civil but substantial. They will be limited to the physician. The penalty for the first violation will be up to $100,000, along with referral to a State licensing board for possible suspension of the license. For a second offense, a fine up to $250,000 and referral to a State 
licensing board for possible revocation of the license. Unlike the Daschle substitute, we would not withhold Medicaid funds. But we would allow the State to, essentially, register its will. 
I am very much persuaded by the fact that some 41 States have already passed legislation limiting late-term abortions. In Arizona, no abortion may be performed after viability; in Arkansas, same thing; in Connecticut, no abortion may be performed after viability; and on and on. 
So I, for one, have a very hard time understanding why it is necessary for the Federal Government to get involved in this area at this time. But, if we do, I think we ought to do it in a way that does not limit the doctor, that prohibits post-viability abortions, and contains an exception that accounts for those rare cases when the fetus has a severe abnormality that is not consistent with human life. 
So, we would offer this as a substitute for that offered by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, and as a substitute to the Daschle legislation as well. 
I would like to illustrate the ways in which this bill that the three of us would offer would differ from that of the Senator from Pennsylvania. Most profoundly, our legislation would fully comport with the Supreme Court's landmark decision, Roe versus Wade, which affirms a woman's constitutional right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. According to Roe, in the first 12 to 15 weeks of pregnancy, when 95.5 percent of all abortions occur, that procedure is medically the safest. The Government cannot, under Roe, place an undue burden on a woman's right to have an abortion. 
In the second trimester, when the procedure in some situations provides a greater health risk, abortion may be regulated but only to protect the health of the mother. This might mean, for example, requiring that an abortion be performed in a hospital or performed by a licensed physician. 
In the later stages of pregnancy, at the point the fetus becomes viable and able to live independently from the mother, Roe recognizes the strong interest in protecting potential human life. On that basis, abortions can be prohibited, except in cases where the abortion is necessary to protect the life and health of the woman. The life or the health of the woman. Thus, Roe strikes a delicate balance in protecting the fetus as well as the mother. 
Our bill will fully comport with Roe. It applies only to post-viability abortions, not pre-viability abortions. And it contains exceptions to protect the health as well as life of the mother. 
In my humble opinion, the bill before us now, presented by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, is unconstitutional and it represents a direct challenge to Roe. It provides no exception for cases where the banned procedure may be necessary to protect a woman's health. It ignores the viability line established in Roe and reaffirmed in Casey. Although the term `partial-birth abortion' is not a medically recognized term, the bill's focus on a particular procedure means that this procedure will be banned even if performed pre-viability, during the second trimester. Roe does not permit abortions to be banned prior to viability. That is the constitutional framework here. 
I think the proponents of this bill know well the challenges to Roe that this legislation presents. The magnitude of this bill is enormous for the long-term preservation of safe and legal abortion in this country. The Santorum bill would have an immediate and direct effect on the lives of women facing tragic and health-threatening circumstances, even in the second trimester of pregnancy. The bill also holds a doctor criminally liable unless he or she can prove that the banned procedure was the only one that would have saved the woman's life. Not the woman's health, but the woman's life. 
The vagueness of the term `partial-birth abortion' makes the use of criminal penalties particularly troublesome. Doctors will not necessarily know when they are violating the law, since no precise procedure is referred to in the law. 
During last year's hearing before the Judiciary Committee, none of our medical experts who testified had heard of the term partial-birth abortion. Since then, of course, times have changed. But none could point to a medical text that used the term. 
Georgetown law professor, Michael Seidman, stated in hearings last year: 
If I were a lawyer advising a physician who performed abortions, I would tell him to stop because there is just no way to tell whether the procedure will eventuate in some portion of the fetus entering the birth canal before the fetus is technically dead, much less being able to demonstrate that after the fact. 
This is the catch-22 in the bill of the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. It can be applied to much more than just the procedure we think is at hand. The use of criminal penalties in conjunction with a vague term such as `partial-birth abortion' is likely to make the Santorum bill unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, unenforceable. 
Our bill, instead, provides civil penalties for any post-viability abortion performed without sufficient medical justification. I believe that these civil penalties will effectively deter any physician who would perform a post-viability abortion for anything other than the most serious reasons. 
Women's health, I think, should be of great importance to this body, and I would also hope that every woman in the United States would want a Congress to legislate based on what we thought would help their health, rather than create situations which would deny them the opportunity prevent long-term damage to their physical health. 
Late in certain types of highly troubled pregnancies, there are only limited options available to physicians, and I would like to give some examples of rare medical conditions that could necessitate a post-viability procedure for which there are no other alternatives available. 
One example would be a fetus that has a greatly enlarged hydrocephalic head, three times the normal size, the cranium filled with fluid. The head is so large the woman physically cannot deliver it. Labor is impossible because the fetus cannot get through the birth canal. A caesarean may well be impossible for medical reasons. 
Let me give you an actual case, the case of Viki Wilson. She stated:  
Then I had a final ultrasound at 36 weeks, just 4 weeks from my due date, and the world came crashing down around us. Our child was diagnosed with encephalocoele. Most of her brain had grown outside her head, and what did form was abnormal. Abigail could not survive outside the womb, and she was already suffering from seizures. At first I said, let's do a C-section, let's get her out of there! My doctor said, sadly, `Viki, we do C-sections to save babies. I can't save Abigail, and I can't justify the risks of a C-section to your health when you are going to lose your daughter no matter what.' So even though my medical training-- 
And this woman was a nurse-- told us that there was no hope, my husband and I went to several specialists in the desperate belief that there was someone out there with a magic wand who would say, `I can help save your daughter.' No one did, no one could. Finally, we made a decision, based entirely on love, to end the pregnancy. 
This is one of those situations that no one knows beforehand that they may be in. 
There is also a case of a rigid fetus caused by arthrogryposis. This kind of fetus cannot move through the birth canal. It risks rupturing the woman's cervix. With prolonged intense pushing, the mother's heart is placed at risk. 
Other health conditions can prevent a woman from being able to tolerate the stress of labor or surgery. They include cardiac problems like congestive heart failure, severe kidney disease, renal shutdown, severe hypertension, and so on. 
In fact, it is certain health-related concerns that has caused me to part ways with Senator Daschle's approach. In many regards, the bill which we are introducing is similar to Senator Daschle's in several respects, but in one it is different. 
We are alike in that both bills would limit all forms of post-viability abortions. The principal difference is the health exception. Our bill would allow third trimester abortions only in cases where the life of the mother is at issue or where an abortion is necessary to avert serious adverse health consequences to the mother. The Daschle bill, as I understand it, would allow an exception only in cases where continuation of the pregnancy would risk grievous injury to the mother's physical health. Grievous injury is defined as a seriously debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the pregnancy or an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition. 
I believe that the Daschle substitute would not allow the abortion procedure for certain serious conditions that, although they are not caused by the pregnancy, are exacerbated by the pregnancy. I believe the limiting language of this bill could foreclose a doctor's option in certain situations that cannot be anticipated, and that is my concern. Who knows what situation one may be in or if the situation may not arise until labor or delivery? 
For example, one House witness testified that her baby had a brain improperly formed, pressured by a backup of fluid, a greatly enlarged head, a malformed and failing heart, a malfunctioning liver, and a dangerously low amount of amniotic fluid. A physician, we believe, needs the latitude to deal with these complex emergency situations as they are trained to do. 
I also believe it is important to understand, and I hope if I am wrong that the Senator will correct me, that the Daschle substitute makes no provision for a severely malformed fetus incompatible with life, if that baby can be delivered in a live condition even for a matter of minutes or days. 
Roe simply states if the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. 
I think that is a very important constitutional mandate, that any bill passed here in the next day or so must meet the test of constitutionality. 
So we will, at an appropriate time, present a bill that we hope will meet this test. 
Let me just end by saying that everything that I have read, everything that I have seen indicates that post-viability abortions are extremely rare, and that the vast majority, over 99 percent of abortions, are performed very early in pregnancy. The latest data that we have from the Guttmacher Institute, whose figures are relied upon by the Centers for Disease Control, indicates that 99 percent of all abortions are performed before 20 weeks of gestation; 90 percent are performed within the first 12 weeks; and less than 1 percent are performed after 20 weeks. Only four-hundredths of 1 percent performed after 20 weeks are performed during the third trimester. So this means there is a total of about 400 to 600 abortions performed annually during the third trimester of pregnancy. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control, 98.9 percent of all abortions are performed by the simple curettage procedure, which simply involves the scraping of the interior of the uterus. 
So any way you view it, we are looking at a very small number of cases. I guess my plea is for those circumstances which cannot be anticipated, for circumstances where the mother's life and health truly are at risk and--as I learned firsthand with my own daughter--nobody really understands or can have a looking glass to indicate what those circumstances may be. 
As I said, I basically believe that the intact D&E or intact D&X, whatever one may choose, should not be used. I am hopeful that the medical profession will take that view, and I believe that there are ongoing discussions on that subject. 
But I believe that when we pass legislation that affects every single woman in the United States who can possibly be at issue in this case, that to pass a piece of legislation which would mandate that a seriously abnormal fetus, unable over time to sustain life outside the womb, would have to be delivered regardless of the health impacts on the mother, is not a piece of legislation that I, in good conscience, can support. So, Madam President, at the appropriate time, Senators Boxer, Moseley-Braun, and I will present a substitute amendment. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address Senate consideration of the CFE Flank Agreement. 
The Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty [CFE] entered into in 1990 is an outstanding arms control achievement, requiring the destruction of over 50,000 items of heavy weaponry, including tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery pieces, and attack helicopters. The CFE has helped to make the Europe of 1997 a far safer place than the Europe of even just a few years ago, and in doing so has served American national security interests well. 
The implementation of CFE helps guarantee that a destabilizing concentration of military equipment--or a massed military attack in central Europe of the kind that has dominated strategic thinking in Europe through two World Wars and a cold war--will now be next to impossible for any nation or group of nations to achieve. 
But, as the flank agreement underscores, the treaty negotiated between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in 1990 is not adequate to the realities of the new European security environment. 
To begin with, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact no longer exist. There are now Soviet successor states in the Baltics and the Transcaucasus--the flank zones--with very different security and political concerns. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Transcaucasus have been a region of almost singular instability. Russia and the Ukraine, likewise, have different security orientations than did the Soviet Union, as do the states of both central and western Europe. NATO is undergoing a searching debate about the possibility of enlargement. The Europe that the CFE must be relevant to in 1997 is radically different than the Europe of 1990. 
Thus, in ways unanticipated by its original negotiators, the issues raised by the flank agreement touch on some of the most central and the most sensitive security issues of the new European security environment. 
The history of the Transcaucasus since the breakup of the Soviet Union have served as a grim reminder of the deadly subtleties of rapidly changing regional geography. Civil war and ethnic strife has been the rule, not the exception, in Nagorno-Karabagh, Osettia, Abkhazia, Georgia, and, of course, Chechnya. 
Stabilizing the military balance in the Transcaucasus and inculcating confidence and security building measures, as the CFE Treaty does, is critical for peace in the region. 
Although not racked with the violence that has characterized the Transcaucasus, the security concerns of the Baltic States in the northern flank zone will prove to be central to future stability in Europe, and the limits placed on threatening conventional weapons by the CFE Treaty is a critical part of the security architecture of the Baltics. 
Likewise, the flank agreement also touches upon the sensitive topic of Russian-Ukrainian ties, and the political and security relationship between the two, and it addresses the role of Turkey between Europe, the Middle East, and central Asia. 
Last, the flank agreement has profound implications for Russian nationalist sentiment, and may well have an impact on the future of Russian domestic political development, and the dynamics of those domestic factors which may influence either a cooperative or confrontational Russian foreign policy. 
In this sense, the flank agreement is also critical issue for the debate over NATO enlargement that is just now beginning to come to a simmer. In structuring the balance of forces between NATO and Russia, the CFE and the flank agreement--what it says as well as how it is implemented--will be at the heart of Russian perceptions and assessments regarding the potential of an enlarged NATO. 
In short, the CFE will play a central role in determining the future course of peace and stability in Europe. 
Notwithstanding the positive contributions of the CFE to U.S. national security interests--and it is a treaty which I will be voting for--I feel that I would be remiss in my duty as a Senator if I did not also point out some general concerns that I have with the flank agreement, as well as some specific concerns I have with the resolution of ratification for this treaty 
as it was voted out of the Foreign Relations Committee last week. 
As I made clear in the Foreign Relations Committee hearing, I found the way in which the flank agreement was negotiated--opening up an already negotiated treaty for revision because of the reticence of one party to live up to its commitments--deeply troubling. 
Although I would agree with those who argue that it is necessary to revisit international agreements when there has been a material change in circumstances--and few would argue that the breakup of the Soviet Union does not count on this score--treaties, by their very nature, are only worthwhile if they are binding the minute they are signed. 
The post-cold-war world may very well be more turbulent and fluid than the world which we are used to, but I hope that the way in which the flank agreement was opened for renegotiation--with one party not in compliance with a treaty which they had signed--does not set a precedent which will call into question other treaties which, after the fact, a state may wish to change. 
I think that it is important for the Senate to go on the record in support of the binding nature of the treaty obligations which we and other states enter into--obligations which should be opened for renegotiation in only the most extreme of cases--even as we give our support to this agreement. 
Second, in changing the CFE flank equipment ceilings to meet Russian security concerns, we must be careful to make sure that we have not increased the insecurity felt by other states in or bordering the flank zone. 
In its original conception, the CFE Treaty was intended to make Europe safe from the dangers of a big war between East and West. I think that there is general agreement that CFE has been and will continue to be effective in this respect. 
But the CFE Treaty, as revised, must not become part of a European security architecture in which Europe is made safe for little wars, between the large and the small, or as a tool for intimidation used by the strong against the weak. 
If such a situation were to result from the flank agreement revisions, Europe would be less stable and secure, not more. 
Third, as several of my colleagues have already pointed out, the inclusion of condition 9 regarding Senate advice and consent for the multilateralization of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is, I think, unwarranted and unwise. 
It is unwarranted because the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is not connected in any way with the CFE. It is unwise because it calls into question whether the United States may attempt to reopen or substantively change a treaty because some now perceive that it is in our interests to do so. 
There was an attempt to get this same language regarding the ABM inserted into last year's defense authorization bill. That effort failed. On its own, the Senate has already rejected this language. Now there is an attempt to resurrect this language and attach it to this treaty. The consideration of treaties is one of the highest responsibilities of the Senate, and I am disappointed that some of my colleagues have chosen to place petty politics above the interests of U.S. national security. 
The ABM Treaty is the diplomatic foundation of our intercontinental ballistic missile reduction strategy. It was possible to negotiate and ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, and negotiate START II because of the strategic groundwork laid in the ABM Treaty. Abandoning or violating the ABM Treaty would threaten the strategic ballistic missile reductions under these two treaties, which, when implemented, would verifiably eliminate the intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying two-thirds of Russia's nuclear warheads. 
I would have preferred to have had the opportunity to eliminate this condition from the final resolution of ratification, but, unfortunately, it does not appear that we will have this opportunity. 
In addition to these general concerns, I also have one specific concern with the resolution of ratification for this treaty as it was voted out of committee last week, which I hope that we will have an opportunity to change. 
I am concerned that condition 5 (F) of section 2 unfairly singles out Armenia for a report on compliance with the CFE Treaty. In so doing, this condition makes the treaty weaker, and less effective in guaranteeing U.S. security interests in Europe, not more. 
Although some of my Armenian friends might not want me to say this, I do believe that there should be a report on Armenia's compliance with the treaty. There have been some troubling questions raised in the press and in our committee discussions regarding Armenian transshipments of arms from Russia, and whether Armenia is in violation of certain provisions of the CFE. 
As I noted previously, this is a very sensitive part of the globe, and one in which even a relatively small amount of heavy weaponry can have tremendous impact on the balance of power. If Armenia is in violation of the treaty, then appropriate measures should be taken. 
However, it is precisely the volatile nature of this region that dictates that U.S. national security interests demand that we seek compliance reports on the other states in the region as well. There are questions regarding Azerbaijan's compliance with the CFE's Treaty Limited Equipment (TLE) limits, for example, and recent experience with civil war and ethnic strife in Georgia, Osettia, Chechnya, Abkhazia, and elsewhere in the region all suggest that a condition calling for region-wide compliance reports would be in order. 
Indeed stigmatizing and isolating Armenia in this fashion may well prove to be counterproductive. If the CFE Treaty is perceived as a tool of one side or another in an already tense and volatile region, it will have the effect of destroying confidence, not building it, and will contribute to an atmosphere where the states of the region may seek to build their armed forces, not lessen them. 
This would be a grave mistake, and that is why I believe that condition 5 (F) must be changed to call for compliance reports for the other countries in the Transcaucasus as well. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered to make just these changes when we vote on this issue. 
Even with these reservations, however, I find that the treaty merits support. The CFE, with the revised flank agreement, provides an invaluable tool for stabilizing European security and lessening regional tension. I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this treaty.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank you, Mr. President. 
And I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
I rise to support the Byrd position. I believe that to take an automatic cut of an additional $25 billion in real terms with the constraints of this budget would be extraordinarily difficult. 
Mr. President, I have just in the last few days participated in several initiatives with respect to cancer, and appeared before Senator Specter's subcommittee on cancer and heard members on both sides of the aisle speak to the goal of doubling cancer research over the next 5 years. I think if this CR remains, any additional dollars for critical health research is really condemned. 
Additionally, many of us believe that the bipartisan White House-Congress concordat bringing to this body a bipartisan plan to balance the budget was to be without the CR attached. So just a week ago both sides were cheering about this budget deal. Given the optimism surrounding the announcement, I think it is somewhat disingenuous to include the automatic CR in this legislation. 
I think all of us want to avoid another Government shutdown and are willing to do almost anything to prevent a repeat of 2 years ago. But the way to do that is simple. Do what is necessary to pass an appropriations bill on time. And that means compromise. No one wants a Government shutdown. And the fact that a year-long CR was eventually passed following the last shutdown shows that reasonable minds are capable of reaching compromise when there is a will. 
The automatic CR essentially means that we do not have to pass another appropriations bill this year. Conceivably we could all pack up and go home. However, the budget deal struck is going to require some very tough decisions, difficult negotiations, some forced compromises. Not everyone is going to get what they want, but I think we all recognize that in the interest of getting the job done we are prepared to sublimate some of our priorities. 
The President said he would veto this bill if the automatic CR provision is included when it hits his desk. I cannot think of any clearer reason to drop this then from the bill. The emergency funding carried in this bill is simply too important. 
This is a big bill. About $3.4 billion of it goes to California. Additionally, it goes really to people who are just destitute. And we have about 9,000 miles of delta levees, and we have had almost 100 levee breaks, 62 of them substantial. 
You had areas, 15 square miles, flooded, homes up to their rooftops, orchards of 14,000, 15,000, 16,000 trees at a crack just lost, people losing their homes and their livelihoods. 
I really earnestly implore this body not to complicate this bill by attaching the CR. 
If the CR is added, there are other things that happen as well. 
We have a proposal for 500 additional border guards in 1998. That is on hold; 544 FBI agents delayed; the FAA unable to hire 500 air traffic controllers and 173 security personnel; Pell grants cut by $1.2 billion; funding of Goals 2000 cut by $97 million; Title 1 education, which goes to educate the poorest of youngsters at a time when everybody believes education is a top priority, cut by $320 million; and NIH, cancer research or death-inducing disease research could be cut by $414 million. 
So, from the California perspective--I know my colleague and friend, Senator Boxer spoke to this earlier: 48 out of our 58 counties were declared disaster areas--this money is important. It should go. So I am hopeful that the majority will remove the request for the CR. 
I am happy to rise to support the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Reid amendment and really on the subject in general, particularly from a California perspective. 
California has over 6,000 miles of flood control levees. In the last decade, we have had three 100-year storms, in 1986, 1995, and 1997. 
In 1986, four levees failed, three in the delta, one in Yuba County. 
In 1995, 25 levees failed. 
In 1997, there were 62 significant levee breaks, according to the Corps of Engineers. Of these, 40 were federally maintained levees, and the rest were non-Federal. 
On January 2, the Feather River broke through the levee at Star Bend, flooding 15 square miles of farmland and the community of Olivehurst. The breach was 1,500 feet long. 
This flood damage is relevant to the amount of money that is going to California in emergency assistance right now--$3.3 billion. 
On January 4, a Sutter bypass levee failed at Meridian, flooding a 35,000 acre basin with more than 60 homes and businesses. The breach at Meridian was 1,100 feet long. 
On January 4, the San Joaquin River plunged through levees in 14 places near the town of Mendota, flooding about 10,000 acres of farmland on both sides of the river in Madera and Fresno Counties. The biggest levee break, at Firebaugh, was 2,500 feet long. 
On January 5, more levees broke along the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and San Joaquin Rivers, causing flooding near Modesto. Now, the levees are a critical part of California's infrastructure and, in my view, they are the most troubled part of our infrastructure. In an earthquake, in a flood, when these levees go, two things happen. One, the water in these rivers is the drinking water for 20 million people. The soil behind the levees is peat. As the levees break, and the peat land is flooded and then drains, the peat soil drains back into the river. When this water is treated with chlorine for drinking water, it throws off carcinogens. So that has necessitated a change in the water treatment. Additionally, salt water intrusion also contaminates the drinking water supply. 
So, not only do the levees protect farm land, the levees also protect our major source of drinking water. 
Now, the problem here is maintenance of these levees. I spent 3 days talking to farmers. What farmers tell me increasingly is they are not going to maintain the levees because the bureaucratic hassle is so great. To pull out a bush on a levy, they have to go and get a permit. They have to mitigate. They do not have the money to mitigate. Therefore, more and more of the levees are not maintained. If the levees are not maintained and the levees break, the amount of Federal money that goes to California is just going to increase. 
In addition, damage is done to cattle, to dairy cows, to farms, to orchards; homes are under water; and people's businesses are being wiped out. Why? Because in places, levees are not properly maintained because of the Endangered Species Act. I am not saying that these levee breaks are related to the Endangered Species Act, because I do not know. However, I do know from firsthand testimony to me that there are people that are not maintaining the levees because of the bureaucratic hassle they have to go through. 
For example, the slopes of the levees along the Feather River in Sutter County have become overgrown in recent years with trees and vegetation, including elderberry shrubs. This vegetation hides rodent holes and beaver dams which undermine the integrity of the levees. These shrubs on the Feather River levees are habitat for the Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle which is listed as a threatened species under the Federal Endangered Species Act and the State act. U.S. Fish and Wildlife has indicated that if Sutter County tries to eliminate this habitat and maintain the levees, they would require mitigation. Elderberry bushes could only be removed from levees if replacement bushes were planted elsewhere. Sutter County cannot pay for this mitigation and take farmland out of production for habitat. 
The Central Delta Water Agency says the prohibition of dredging and placement of fill for levee maintenance and the creation of shaded riverside aquatic or marsh habitat in areas designated as critical habitat for Delta smelt has been a problem. The agency has been required to spend money on habitat assessments, consultations, inspection, mitigation, and emergency removal--money which the agency believes would be better spent on reducing the flood risks. 
Now, this is the point I want to make and it is important. In 1996, when Yuba County tried to move forward with a Corps of Engineers project to upgrade levees south of Marysville, the Fish and Wildlife Service would not let them proceed with the repair work after October 1 because the garter snake was dormant. If they repaired the levees after October 1, they might disturb a sleeping garter snake. They had to do costly mitigation before they could make these repairs. So the work was not done, and on January 2, a levee broke at Olivehurst, killing three people and flooding 500 homes. 
I am delighted, Mr. President, that the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Kempthorne, is in the chair and he is hearing these comments because, for this Senator, the Endangered Species Act--when it comes to the protection of life and property--really needs a second look. I heard this over and over and over again when I went to Yuba County. As a matter of fact, one family was standing there sobbing and had no place for their children. Their children were taken from them, when their property was flooded, and put in foster homes. When it comes to a garter snake versus somebody's home and property and life and limb, I really think we need to get our priorities straight. That is why I believe these levees should not be included in the ESA, that maintenance should be ongoing, and that repair and rebuilding should be permitted without a major bureaucratic hassle. I thank the Senator for his indulgence. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Boxer, Graham, Snowe, Moseley-Braun, Landrieu, Harkin, Specter, D'Amato, Mack, Johnson, Reid, and Murray would like to introduce the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act. 
In a time of shrinking budgets and resources for breast cancer research, this legislation would provide an innovative way to provide additional funding for breast cancer research. 
This bill would: authorize the U.S. Postal Service to issue an optional special first class stamp to be priced at 1 cent above the cost of normal first-class postage; earmark a penny of every stamp for breast cancer research; provide administrative costs from the revenues for post office expenses; allow 100 percent of the proceeds from the stamp to fund HHS breast cancer research projects; clarify current law, in that any similar stamp would require an act of Congress to be issued in the future. 
If only 10 percent of all first class mail used this optional 33 cent stamp, $60 million could be raised for breast cancer research annually. 
There is wide support for this legislation. Congressman Fazio, along with over 100 cosponsors have already introduced the companion bill (H.R. 407) in the House. 
The breast cancer epidemic has been called this Nation's best kept secret. There are 2.6 million women in America today with breast cancer, one million of whom have yet to be diagnosed with the disease. 
In 1996, an estimated 184,000 were diagnosed with breast cancer. It is the number one killer of women ages 40 to 44 and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 15 to 54, claiming a woman's life every 12 minutes in this country (source: National Breast Cancer Coalition). 
For California, 17,100 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 4,100 women will die from the disease (source: American Cancer Society cancer facts and figures, 1996). 
In addition to the cost of women's lives, the annual cost of treatment of breast cancer in the United States is approximately $10 billion. 
Over the last 25 years, the National Institutes of Health has spent over $31.5 billion on cancer research--$2 billion of that on breast cancer. In the last 6 years alone, appropriations for breast cancer research have risen from $90 million in 1990 to $600 million today. That's the good news. 
But, the bad news is that the national commitment to cancer research overall has been hamstrung since 1980. Currently, NIH is able to fund only 23 percent of applications received by all the institutes. For the Cancer Institute, only 23 percent can be funded--a significant drop from the 60 percent of applications funded in the 1970's. 
Most alarming is the rapidly diminishing grant funding available for new researcher applicants. 
In real numbers, the National Cancer Institute will fund approximately 3,600 research projects, of which about 1,000 are new, previously unfunded activities. For investigator-initiated research, only 600 out of 1,900 research projects will be new. 
The United States is privileged to have some of the most talented scientists and many of the leading cancer research centers in the world such as UCLA, UC San Francisco, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and the M.D. Anderson. 
This lack of increase in funding is starving some of the most important research, because scientists will have to look elsewhere for their livelihood.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to try to bring some uniform coverage of mammography to private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, consistent with the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute guidelines. Joining me as cosponsors are Senators Mikulski, Wellstone and Johnson. 
I am introducing this bill because I believe mammography is our best tool for finding breast cancer early and women will not get mammograms without good insurance coverage. We now have the two leading organizations, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute, agreeing on screening guidelines and we cannot assume that insurance companies will rush to follow those guidelines. In the current highly competitive climate of managed care, with plans and providers reducing services and benefits, with employers cutting back on coverage, only congressional action will guarantee women the health care they need, especially preventive services like this.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senators Mack, D'Amato, Reid, and I are introducing a bill to give citizens two ways to contribute to the Nation's cancer research program. In connection with their annual tax return, taxpayers could make a tax deductible contribution for cancer research of not less than $1 and could check off or designate a contribution of not less than $1 from their tax refund owed them by the Government. 
The bill establishes a Cancer Research Trust Fund and directs the National Institutes of Health to use the funds for research on cancer. It prohibits expenditures from the fund if appropriations in any year for the NIH are less than the previous year so that these funds do not supplant appropriated funds. 
In fiscal 1997, the National Cancer Institute could only fund 26 percent of grants received with appropriated funds. This approval rate dropped from 29 percent in 1996 and 32 percent in 1992. Under the President's budget request for fiscal 1998, the success rate is estimated to drop again, to 25 percent. 
While we do not have a specific estimate for how much our bill for cancer research would raise, a Federal tax checkoff for health research could raise $35 million in revenues for health research, if the average contribution were $2, according to Research America. If taxpayers gave $10, it would raise $410 million. Their study shows that the average contribution would be $23 and at that rate, $1.1 billion could be raised. In 1994, U.S. taxpayers contributed $25.7 million through State checkoffs. 
I believe Americans would be very willing to make a contribution to health research and using the tax return is a very easy way. Sixty percent of Americans say they would check off a box on the tax return for medical research. The median amount people are willing to designate is $23. 
Virtually everyone is touched by disease and has had some experience with incurable diseases. We all fear dreaded diseases. A May 1996 California poll found that 59 percent of my constituents would pay an extra dollar a week in taxes to support medical research. An overwhelming 94 percent of Americans believe it is important that the United States maintains its role as a world leader in medical research and medical research takes second place only to national defense for tax dollar value. 
Cancer mortality has risen in the past half-century. By the year 2000, cancer will overtake heart disease as the leading cause of death of Americans. Over 40 percent of Americans will develop cancer and over 20 percent of us will die from cancers. Cancer is causing twice as many deaths as in 1971. Cancer's total economic costs in 1995, according to the National Institutes of Health, came to $104 billion. 
In my own State of California, in 1996, 125,800 new cases of cancer were diagnosed and 51,200 people died. The incidence of certain cancers, specifically cervical, stomach, and liver, is higher than national rates. The San Francisco area has some of the highest rates of breast cancer in the world. There are areas in my State, such as Alameda County, where prostate cancer incidence exceeds the national rate. In my State, African-American women have a 60-percent higher risk of developing cervical cancer than white women. Hispanic women have the highest risk of cervical cancer in my State. Asian-Americans in California are twice as likely to develop stomach cancer and five times more likely to develop liver cancer than whites. 
We have made great strides in understanding cancer, particularly the genetics of cancer and what makes a normal cell become a cancer cell. Because of research, cancer survival rates have increased for some cancers. But we cannot rest until we find a cure. 
The National Cancer Institute's bypass budget identifies five promising areas of research and with 74 percent of grants going unapproved, the scientific talent is there. As the National Cancer Advisory Board said in its 1994 report to Congress, `Current investment is insufficient to capitalize on unprecedented opportunities in basic science research.' Clearly additional funds can be well used by some of the world's leading cancer researchers. 
By introducing this bill, I do not believe giving taxpayers an opportunity to contribute to cancer research will or should be the mainstay of funding for our national war on cancer. Congress needs to continue increasing appropriations and I am disappointed that the President's fiscal year 1998 budget for the National Cancer Institute represents only a 2.5-percent increase over fiscal 1997. I hope we can do better and I pledge my help in doing that. To insure that these taxpayer contributions generated by this bill do not supplant Congressionally appropriated funds, the bill includes a provision that prohibits expenditures from the cancer research fund if appropriations in any year for the NIH are less than the previous year. 
Twenty-six years of research since the 1971 passage of the National Cancer Act has brought great progress, but some say that the war on cancer has really only been a skirmish. We must escalate that war, we must launch an armada of scientists, we must push vigorously ahead, we must find a cure for cancer. I hope this bill will help to escalate that battle.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise to support the D'Amato-Chafee resolution. I am very pleased to be a cosponsor. I want to point out that two cities in this Nation are impacted more than any other, and that is the city of Los Angeles and the city of New York. In California alone, there are 310,000 legal immigrants currently receiving SSI benefits. Under the present law, they all go off on August 22, regardless of need. 
I want to clear the air somewhat, because the administration 
proposal, accepted by the Budget Committee, does not cover elderly legal immigrants. In other words, if you are 85 years old and monolingual in another language, you cannot get a job, but come August 22, under the agreement, you would be out on the streets. Either you are homeless or else it is a transfer to the local government to be picked up by the counties' general assistance grant. 
This proposal of Senator D'Amato's essentially takes that August 22 deadline and extends it to October 1, giving us time to work with the administration, work with the Appropriations Committee and try to see if there is not a better solution. 
If only disabled are covered, which is currently the case under the proposed bipartisan agreement, this means that only refugees and asylees who have exhausted the 7 years would be eligible for SSI only if they are disabled. This impacts 61,360 people in California; 60 percent of those who are disabled and 40 percent of the elderly would not be affected by this legislation. 
So we have a ways to go in reconciling what is really out there in terms of problems of people who are elderly and the proposal that is part of the bipartisan agreement. The D'Amato proposal extends that deadline by 2 months and gives us an opportunity to work this out. I think it is extraordinarily important that that happen. 
Additionally, I pay my compliments to the Senator from Rhode Island. Senator Chafee and I have a bill which would extend SSI for all of those who are presently covered by SSI, not prospectively, not for newcomers, but for those people already in this country for whom we have certain responsibilities who are unable to have any other source of income to support themselves. Our bill, I think, is the long-term solution that is the most viable. 
So I thank Senator D'Amato--he is also a cosponsor of the Chafee-Feinstein bill--for offering this, and I am very hopeful that a dominant majority of this body will see the wisdom in adopting it. 
Mr. DAMATO addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
I would just like to add to my earlier comments with some of the specific numbers from each of the big States of people that would not be covered by the bipartisan budget agreement. 
These are elderly people. 
In California it is 163,900. In Florida it would be 44,310. In Illinois 13,360; in Massachusetts 13,410; in New York 65,340; and in Texas, 32,640. These are people who are above the age of 65. 
It is my understanding that the administration, with Members in the other House, may have reached an agreement whereby they would agree to try to certify some of these people as disabled. But, nonetheless, these are the people, at least in the statistics of the Social Security Administration, who would be dropped off come August 22 for sure right now. 
I think this is living testimony, in terms of numbers of people, to the argument that Senator D'Amato, Senator Chafee, and I are making that: Let us extend this by 2 months and see what we can do to effect a reasonable system where people will not become homeless or a major transfer onto county general assistance rolls. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I commend Dr. Rolland C. Lowe, the new president of the California Medical Association. Dr. Lowe is the first Asian-American elected president in the organization's 147-year history. 
Dr. Lowe started his distinguished career at the University of California at Berkeley, where he attended undergraduate school. After completing his undergraduate work, he studied medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. He completed a medical internship at San Francisco General Hospital and a surgical residency at UCSF. 
Dr. Lowe has been a trailblazer for many years. In 1982, he was elected the first Asian-American president of the San Francisco Medical Society. For the past three decades, Dr. Lowe has been a distinguished member of the medical community. Since 1965, Dr. Lowe has served on the clinical faculty at UCSF and has practiced medicine in San Francisco's Chinatown. Dr. Lowe is a former chair of the board of trustees at Chinese Hospital in San Francisco and he continues to participate as an active board member. At Chinese Hospital, Dr. Lowe also served as the chief of surgery and the chief of staff. He has worked hard to provide low-income immigrants with high quality health care. 
Dr. Lowe has a long history with not only the medical community, but with the California Medical Association as well. He has been active in the CMA for many years, and has served on the board of trustees of the CMA since 1987, chairing it from 1994 to his election. He has been a tireless advocate of better health care for the Chinese American community. 
Dr. Lowe's goal as president of the California Medical Association is to get physicians more involved in their communities. He has said, `In able to be good patient advocates, doctors need to understand their community.' In this era of managed care, Dr. Lowe's commitment to re-establishing a personal relationship between doctor and patient is especially commendable. Looking at Dr. Lowe's history of service tells us that he is the right man to accomplish this goal. He has devoted his energies not just to medicine, but more broadly to his community. He has worked to provide decent housing for the elderly in San Francisco, through redevelopment of the old International Hotel for use as a senior housing and community center. Dr. Lowe is the founder and Chair of the Lawrence Choy Lowe Memorial Fund, which is a charitable and civic foundation in Chinatown. He has also served in many community organizations and foundations. 
My fellow colleagues, please join me today in honoring my long standing friend, Dr. Lowe. He is a valuable asset to his community and to the State of California. His example of providing high quality health care and his dedication to his community deserve our admiration and our respect.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Chemical Weapons Convention. I believe it is very much in our national interests to ratify this treaty, after we strike five conditions in the resolution of ratification. 
Let me first express my respect and appreciation for the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden. He and his staff have really done the heavy lifting in getting this treaty to the floor, including many long hours of negotiations on the package of 28 agreed conditions. 
I also want to express my respect for the opponents of this treaty, including the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl. I have worked well with Senator Kyl on many issues, including, at the moment, our strong effort to pass a Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution. 
I know that in this debate these Senators are motivated by their genuine and deeply felt concern for America's national security. However, I must disagree with the view that we would be better off without this treaty, or by passing a resolution of ratification that essentially renders the treaty meaningless. 
Mr. President, the threat of chemical weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, or being used as a weapon of war by a rogue state, has increased dramatically in recent years. 
One need only reflect on the dangers faced by our military by Iraq's incipient chemical weapons program during the gulf war, or the tragedies our Nation has suffered with the bombing of the World Trade Center, the Federal building in Oklahoma City, and the Olympic Park in Atlanta, to fully appreciate the dangers posed by the proliferation of chemical weapons. In each of these cases, the tragedy and loss of life could have been magnified significantly had chemical weapons been used. 
The people of Japan know this first-hand. The deadly sarin gas attack carried out in the Tokyo subway system by the Aum Shunrikio cult was testimony to the power of even a relatively small amount of chemical weapons. 
Chemical weapons are among the most barbaric of mankind's inventions. They are so awful, that the United States, by act of Congress, has decided to eliminate our own stocks of these weapons by 2004. They are designed to kill and incapacitate by causing such effects as skin blistering, blindness, lung damage, choking, nervous system disruption, paralysis, or oxygen starvation. Because of the ease of their dispersal over a wide area, chemical weapons are especially useful for targeting civilian populations. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention is the most far-reaching attempt ever by the international community to control the spread of chemical weapons. It bans for the first time the development, production, and possession of chemical weapons and reinforces the international norm against their use. Since we are destroying our own chemical weapons, it only makes sense that we should want other nations to do so as well. 
The convention requires all signatory states to declare and destroy any chemical weapons and the facilities used to produce them. It requires member states to submit annual reports on the production and use of certain sensitive chemicals. This information, combined with our own intelligence resources, will significantly improve our ability to monitor and prevent illegal transfers and uses of such chemicals. 
Once the CWC takes effect, it will make it much harder and more costly for proliferators and terrorists to acquire chemical weapons. An intrusive verification system will be set up to detect violations. Sanctions will be imposed against nations that refuse to participate, making it more difficult for them to acquire precursor chemicals for poison gas and easier to monitor their efforts to do so. 
The intelligence-sharing and global verification network that will result from this treaty will increase the chances that terrorist attacks involving chemical weapons can be prevented before they ever occur--a net gain in the security of our troops and our citizens. 
Now, a number of very serious concerns have been raised about the CWC. I myself have shared some of these concerns. I will not speak to every criticism of the treaty, but I want to address some of these concerns now, because I believe very 
solid answers have been provided to virtually all of them. 
Verification: Critics of the CWC have complained that it is not verifiable, and that it will be easy for nations who sign up to the treaty to cheat without getting caught. 
We must start with the proposition that no arms control agreement is 100-percent verifiable. But with the CWC, we will know far more about who is trying to develop chemical weapons, where, and how than we would without the treaty. That is why the intelligence community has consistently testified that, while the treaty is not completely verifiable, they regard it as a highly desirable tool that will enhance our knowledge of chemical weapons programs and our ability to stop them. 
The CWC's verification regime requires routine inspections of all declared facilities working with significant amounts of chemicals listed by the treaty. In addition, any site, declared or not, may be subject to short-notice challenge inspections if there are suspicions that it is being used to produce or store banned chemicals. 
The CWC also establishes significant trade restrictions on precursor chemicals. These restrictions will make it more difficult for nations who are not parties to the treaty to acquire these chemicals, and will provide us with much more information than we currently have about who is seeking to import such chemicals, and in what amounts. 
So the concern about verification, while valid, I believe has been more than adequately addressed. We must go into this treaty with our eyes open, aware that it will not detect every violation. But why would we deprive ourselves of the extremely useful tools and information this treaty would provide on the grounds that they are not fool-proof? It would be incredibly short-sighted to do so. 
Sharing Defense Technologies: During one of the hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month, the concern was raised that Article X of the CWC would require the United States to share advanced chemical defense technologies with rogue nations like Iran, who may sign and ratify the treaty. If indeed the treaty required that, there would be significant grounds for concern. But I believe the concern is overstated. 
In an April 22 letter to me, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger makes it very clear that Article X of the CWC would impose no obligation on the United States to assist Iran with its chemical weapons defense capabilities.

<TEXT>
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Berger makes clear that paragraph 7 of Article X, which spells out the obligations of States Parties to assist others threatened by chemical weapons, would require the United States to provide nothing more than medical antidotes and treatments to any state we deemed unreliable. We have the option to provide more advanced assistance to those nations we trust, but no obligation. 
The administration is so comfortable with this reading of the treaty, that, in their negotiations with Senator Helms and with the Majority Leader's task force on the CWC, they have agreed to a binding condition (number 15) that would ensure that the United States will not provide any assistance other than medical assistance to any rogue nation that becomes a party to the treaty. 
Another concern about Article X is that paragraph 3, which calls for parties to `facilitate . . . the fullest possible exchange' of information and technology on protection against chemical weapons, would require the United States to share such equipment with rogue nations who sign and ratify the treaty. 
The administration has made clear that the use of the words `facilitate' and `possible' in this paragraph mean that we will determine whether any specific exchange is appropriate, and we will not pursue those we deem inappropriate. In making these decisions, we will do nothing to undermine our national export controls. 
With these assertions in hand, I am satisfied that the United States will in no way be obligated to provide chemical weapons technology to any nation we deem to be untrustworthy. 
Some have also raised the concern that Article X might induce other, less conscientious nations, to supply rogue states with defense technologies. But there is nothing that prevents those sales from taking place today, with no CWC in effect. 
With the CWC, the countries who make exchanges allowed 
in Article X are legally bound by the treaty's overriding principle, stated in Article I, that they can do nothing to `assist, encourage, or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State Party under this Convention.' 
In addition, the CWC would provide us with far more ability to scrutinize any exchanges than we have today. The result is a net increase, not decrease, in our knowledge of defense exchanges with rogue nations, and our ability to address any compliance concerns that may arise from these exchanges. 
Cooperation on Chemical Technology: Another concern that has been raised involves Article XI. Some have suggested that Article XI, which deals with cooperation in chemical activities not prohibited by the treaty, would require the United States to provide other nations with access to our dual-use technologies and manufacturing secrets. Here again, the concern is unwarranted. 
Article XI does aim to ensure that parties to the treaty can conduct legitimate chemical commerce, which is reasonable. But in his April 22 letter, Mr. Berger explains that this article does not require the United States, or any U.S. company, to provide any confidential business information to any foreign party. 
As to the concern that Article XI will undercut export controls, indeed, the reverse is true. Mr. Berger makes clear that the all U.S. export controls now in effect are fully consistent with the CWC. In addition, our allies in the Australia Group, all 28 of them, have pledged to maintain all existing multilateral export controls, which they agree are fully consistent with the CWC. 
Here again, the problem identified by critics of the CWC would actually be worse without the treaty. The CWC will allow us to better monitor chemical commerce that occurs today without our knowledge. It will also provide the basis for further multilateral efforts to control exports, above and beyond our own existing export controls and those of the Australia Group. 
To address the concerns raised about Article XI, the Administration has agreed to a binding condition (number 7) that the President must certify now and on an annual basis that the Australia Group is continuing to effectively control chemical exports and remains a viable mechanism for doing so. 
According to this condition, the President must also certify that nothing in the CWC obligates the United States to weaken our own export controls, and that each member of the Australia Group remains committed to maintaining current export controls. 
With this condition added to the resolution of ratification, I believe concerns about Article XI can be laid aside. 
In fact, the negotiations between the Administration and Senator Biden on the one hand, and Senator Helms and the Lott task force on the other, have been remarkably successful in addressing the concerns that have been raised about the treaty. 
In all, 28 conditions have been agreed to in these negotiations, on subjects ranging from verification and Articles X and XI, to Congressional prerogatives in providing funding for the OPCW; the establishment of an inspector general at the OPCW; safeguards on intelligence sharing; the Senate's role in reviewing future treaty amendments; constitutional protections in the inspection of U.S. facilities; our armed forces' continued ability to use non-lethal riot control agents, such as tear gas; and maintaining robust U.S. chemical defense capabilities. 
With all of these conditions agreed to, there are only five areas remaining in dispute. One would think we were near the point of a virtually unanimous vote to ratify the CWC. 
And yet, we still hear charges that the administration is `stonewalling.' That is simply not the case. Far from stonewalling, the administration has worked very hard to address the Senate's concerns. But it appears that some people simply do not to want to take yes for an answer. 
And so, we have five conditions in this resolution of ratification which the Administration has identified as `killer' conditions. These conditions would make our ratification of this treaty meaningless, because they would either gut central provisions of the treaty, or set up unachievable goals that must be met for us to deposit our instruments of ratification. They should all be defeated. 
Let me briefly address each of these killer conditions: 
Condition 29 would prohibit the United States from ratifying the CWC until Russia ratifies it and takes a series of other actions to comply with past agreements. 
Besides holding United States foreign policy hostage to a group of hardliners in the Russian Duma, this condition ignores the fact that the CWC provides precisely the tools that would be helpful in detecting Russian violations of this and past treaties. It also gives Russia an easy excuse to delay ratification itself. On the grounds of self-interest, this condition shoots ourselves in the foot. 
Condition 30 would prohibit the United States from ratifying the CWC until rogue states such as North Korea, Libya, Syria, Iran, and Iraq have ratified it. By accepting this treaty, we allow these rogue regimes to set the standards of international conduct. It is the equivalent of saying that we should not outlaw drug smuggling because some people will still smuggle drugs. 
By ratifying the CWC, the United States will make it easier to forge international coalitions aimed at eliminating the chemical weapons programs of these regimes, even through military force when necessary. It will also set a standard for those nations to meet if and when their current regimes are replaced by more responsible ones. 
Condition 31 requires the United States to reject all CWC inspectors from countries like Iran and China. This condition is unnecessarily rigid. It would prevent us from allowing suspect states from seeing for themselves that we are not violating the treaty. It would also certainly result in American inspectors being excluded from inspections in these countries. 
A better approach would be to strike this language and enact implementing legislation that would allow Congress a role in determining which inspectors should be barred, which the CWC allows the United States to do on a case-by-case basis. 
Condition 32 would prohibit the United States from ratifying the CWC until Article X is eliminated and Article XI is amended. This is completely unrealistic and completely unnecessary. Articles X and XI were included to reassure countries who signed the treaty that they would not be prevented from developing chemical weapons defenses or engaging in legitimate chemical commerce. 
None of the 160 nations who have signed or 74 nations that have ratified the treaty will agree to renegotiate these provisions at the eleventh hour. It will simply result in our exclusion from the CWC--which is clearly the intent. 
As Gen. Brent Scowcroft, National Security Adviser to President Bush, testified before the Foreign Relations Committee on April 9, 1997: `Starting over. . .is pure fantasy. If we reject this treaty, we will incur the bitterness of all our friends and allies who followed us for 10 years in putting this thing together. . . The idea that we can lead out again down a different path I think is just not in the cards. We have got to deal with the situation we face now, not an ideal one out in the future.' 
The concerns raised about Articles X and XI--which I shared--have been more than adequately addressed by the agreed conditions. This is what I mean about not wanting to take yes for an answer. 
Condition 33 would prevent the U.S. from ratifying the treaty unless the President can certify with `high confidence' that we would be able to detect the production or storage of a single metric ton of chemical agent. 
This is an absurdly high standard. The intelligence community has consistently said it could detect `militarily significant' cheating, but the production of one ton of agent does not qualify. 
But the tools created by the CWC will only enhance our abilities to detect these violations. It would be foolish to kill the treaty with a condition like this that makes the perfect the enemy of the good. This condition is not about verification--it is about killing the treaty. 
Tomorrow, each of these five amendments will be subject to a motion to strike. Failing to strike them would be tantamount to killing the treaty. I urge my colleagues to vote for each motion to strike. Those who do not are essentially voting against ratification of the entire CWC. 
Mr. President, I think this debate really comes down to whether or not one supports international arms control agreements. Many of the criticisms of the CWC--such as that it would lull us to sleep, or that it is not verifiable--were levied against all previous successful arms control treaties, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the START treaty. 
Those who worry that the United States will weaken its vigilance in our efforts to guard against the threat of chemical weapons have actually done us a service. I believe the intensity of this debate has helped to ensure that we will never allow ourselves to believe that the treaty by itself is enough. We will follow the course that President Reagan did--a strong national defense and arms control agreements with verification. 
The CWC is not a panacea, and none of its proponents believes it is. It will not by itself banish chemical weapons from the earth, but it would result in the destruction of much of the world's chemical weapons stocks, and provide us with a valuable set of tools that would significantly strengthen our ability to monitor and defend against the threat of chemical weapons. 
Our failure to ratify this treaty would be a grave mistake. The treaty will enter into force on April 29, with or without us. This is the only treaty that there is, and it requires U.S. leadership to make it work. Only by being a party to this convention can we make it function to its fullest possible extent. 
I believe every Member on this side of the aisle supports this treaty. I urge my Republican colleagues to vote for ratification, after voting to strike the five killer amendments.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the motion to strike condition 32 from the resolution of ratification. 
I strongly support the Chemical Weapons Convention. I believe it is very much in our national interests to ratify this treaty. 
The pending motion is to strike condition 32 from resolution of ratification of the CWC. It is essential that this motion pass, because if it does not, our decision to ratify the treaty will be meaningless. 
During the debate over this treaty, a number of serious concerns have been raised over Articles X and XI. I myself have shared some of these concerns. But I want to address these criticisms of the CWC now, because I believe that very solid answers have been provided to virtually all of them. 
I met at the White House last Friday with National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Special Assistant to the President for Defense Policy and Arms Control Robert Bell, who explained these answers to me in detail, and I found their explanations persuasive. 
Sharing Defense Technologies: During the April 9, 1997 hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the concern was raised by several witnesses that Article X of the CWC would require the United States to share advanced chemical defense technologies with rogue nations like Iran, who may sign and ratify the treaty. 
If indeed the treaty required that, there would be significant grounds for concern. But I believe the concern is unwarranted and unfounded. 
In an April 22 letter to me, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger makes it very clear that Article X of the CWC would impose no obligation on the United States to assist Iran with its chemical weapons defense capabilities.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, April 24th, marks the 82nd anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian Genocide. I rise today to acknowledge and commemorate this terrible chapter in history, to help ensure that it will never be forgotten. 
Eighty-two years ago today, one of the darkest chapters in human history began. On April 24, 1915, Ottoman authorities began arresting Armenian political and religious leaders throughout Anatolia. Over the ensuing months and years, some 1.5 million Armenians were killed at the hands of the Ottoman authorities, and hundreds of thousands more were exiled from their homes. 
On this 82nd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, let us renew our commitment never to forget the horror and barbarism of this event. 
We must remember, we must speak out, and we must teach the next generation about the systematic persecution and murder of millions of Armenians by the Ottoman government. I know that I am joined by every one of my colleagues, by the Armenian-American community, and by people across the United States in commemorating the Genocide and paying tribute to the victims of this crime against humanity. 
As Americans, we are blessed with freedom and security, but that blessing brings with it an important responsibility. We must never allow oppression and persecution to pass without notice or condemnation. 
By commemorating the Armenian Genocide, we renew our commitment always to fight for human dignity and freedom, and we send out a message that the world can never allow genocide to be perpetrated again. 
Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the living. Out of the ashes of their history, Armenians all across the world have clung to their identity and have prospered in new communities. My state of California is fortunate to be home to a community of Armenian-Americans a half-a-million strong. They are a strong and vibrant community whose members participate in every aspect of civic life, and California is the richer for their presence. 
The strength and perseverance of the Armenian people is a triumph of the human spirit, which refuses to cede victory to evil. The best retort to the perpetrators of oppression and destruction is rebirth, renewal, and rebuilding. Armenians throughout the world have done just that, and today they do it in their homeland as well. A free and independent Armenia stands today as a living monument to the resilience of a people. I am proud that the United States, through our friendship and assistance, is contributing to the rebuilding and renewal of Armenia. 
Let us never forget the victims of the Armenian Genocide; let their deaths not be in vain. We must remember their tragedy to ensure that such crimes can never be repeated. And as we remember Armenia's dark past, we can take some consolation in the knowledge that its future is bright with possibility.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to alert this body to a very special event, which took place this past weekend, called NetDay. NetDay, which began in 1996, is a unique partnership between the public, private and educational communities with the common goal of fitting K-12 classrooms with the technological infrastructure needed for the 21st century. 
In the beginning of this year, on behalf of myself, Senator John Warner, Senator Conrad Burns, Senator Charles Robb, Senator Patty Murray, and Senator Barbara Boxer, I introduced Sense of the Senate Resolution 51, celebrating the success of NetDay activities and encouraging all schools to participate in 1997 NetDay activities, including the projects which took place this past weekend. As I did in February of this year, when I introduced the NetDay resolution, I would like to again commend the organizers and volunteers of NetDay, an excellent example of individuals creating a stronger community with the goal of increasing the quality of their schools. 
The success of this weekend was impressive. Although it is still too early to cite official statistics of Saturday's event, NetDay organizers have stated that `schools up and down the State, in isolated towns in the north, farming towns in the central valley, and hundreds in urban communities all participated in NetDay.' In addition, the 38 empowerment zone schools of the Los Angeles Unified School District were involved in NetDay activities and future planning. Last year alone, NetDay was successful in bringing out more than 100,000 Americans, including 50,000 Californians to volunteer in their neighborhood schools. These students, teachers, parents, and friends of the schools, came to wire classrooms and school libraries throughout the Nation. Thousands of individuals accomplished their goal to install communications cables, connect wires and switches to upgrading their schools for the 21st century. 
The success of NetDay is significant. Last year, over 25,000 elementary, junior and senior high schools were wired. I expect these numbers to dramatically increase as NetDay organizer compile results from Saturday's activities. Throughout the United States, volunteers climbed ladders and got on their hands and knees to install the wiring infrastructure needed to connect thousands of elementary and secondary school classrooms with contemporary technology. 
As I have mentioned in earlier floor speeches, NetDay began in California on March 9, 1996. The term was coined by cofounders John Gage of Sun Microsystems, one of the Nation's leading technology companies and Michael Kaufman of KQED, a California public broadcasting station. Mr. Gage and Mr. Kaufman saw this initiative as a day where hundreds of Californians came out to an `old fashioned barn raising for the modern technology age.' 
Just as volunteers would gather in the Nation's early years, with neighbor helping neighbor, to build homes, barns or community buildings, California's NetDay volunteers gather in support of neighborhood schools. Amazingly, and to their surprise, NetDay succeeded in one year in wiring 3,500 schools efficiently and cost-effectively, establishing and improving our classroom information infrastructure up and down the State. 
However, as our classrooms continue to modernize and improve their technological infrastructure there is much work to 
be accomplished, both in California and throughout the Nation. Consider the following: 
According to the Department of Education half of our K-12 schools lack full access to advance technology in the classroom. 
Ninety-five percent of those K-12 schools who want to but are not yet wired, do not have the needed budgetary resources or organized volunteer base to wire their schools. 
Rural areas and regions with high poverty continue to have less access to advanced educational technology compared to their suburban and urban counterparts. 
These few points illustrate that there is still much to be done in our children's classrooms. NetDay organizers are committed to working with under served neighborhoods and ensuring that the appropriate resources, both in volunteers and computer wiring kits, are channels to these communities. In addition, this year's NetDay will focus on communities that did not fully benefit from last years initial set of projects and activities. In all, NetDay continues to save schools and taxpayers millions of dollars in educational technology startup costs, while training and equipping teachers with the knowledge needed to be a successful and integral part of the technical educational experience. 
According to NetDay organizers, this year's relationship between private business, the labor community, and neighborhood schools is stronger than ever. Business sponsors and corporate volunteers will be instrumental in making NetDay a successful reality. The small, and large, companies continue to supply the project the needed computer and wiring equipment, and have also encouraged their employees to work with their children's or neighborhood schools. In addition, the labor community will continue to go into schools across America, where they are committed to work with private partners in ensuring that their local schools have the educational infrastructure needed for a well trained work force for the 21st century. The most valuable asset of NetDay continues to be the commitment of thousands of volunteers who will work in their community schools. 
As the communities throughout America celebrate their NetDay accomplishments and prepare for future activities for this year and beyond, it is my honor to once again, recognize the NetDay cofounders, Michael Kaufman and John Gage, and organizers, Ann Murphy and Teresa Wann, and the dozens of corporate sponsors and business partners, and the thousands of students, teachers, parents, and school administrators for their achievement. The success and commitment they have shown to America and my State of California should be applauded. 
My colleague and cochair on the U.S. Senate information technology caucus, Senator John Warner, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator Charles Robb of Virginia, Senator Patty Murray from Washington, and my California colleague Senator Barbara Boxer join me in supporting the advancement of educational technology by sponsoring this resolution. Together, we urge our Senate colleagues to affirm congressional support for preparing U.S. classrooms with the needed technological infrastructure for the 21st century. 
I invite my Senate colleagues to join this public-private partnership effort and I congratulate all the volunteers who participated in NetDay 1997 and encourage them to keep up the commendable and exemplary work.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, when Congress approved and the President signed the comprehensive welfare reform legislation last year, it was clear to many that it was not a perfect bill. 
I, along with many of my colleagues expressed grave concern about a number of provisions that will have a devastating impact, not only on States and counties in terms of a huge cost shift, but on the lives and well-being of many elderly and disabled people--people who are now dependent upon public assistance for their survival. 
The provision denying supplemental security income [SSI] and food stamps to virtually all legal immigrants who are noncitizens, even those who are elderly and disabled, who cannot support themselves, who have no sponsor or other means of support, such as refugees, in my view, is one of the most egregious flaws in that bill, and one of the main reasons why I voted against its passage. 
Today, Senator Chafee and I, along with Senators D'Amato, Moynihan, DeWine, Lieberman, and Mikulski are offering legislation to correct this flaw. 
The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1997 would grandfather in from the ban on SSI and food stamps: those elderly and disabled legal permanent residents who were receiving SSI and food stamps on or before August 22, 1996 and, those refugees who were in the country as of August 22, 1996. 
This legislation prohibits SSI and food stamps for legal permanent residents who are not refugees and who were not receiving SSI and food stamps as of August 22, 1996. 
This legislation also prohibits SSI and food stamps for all legal permanent residents and refugees coming to this country following the date of enactment of the Welfare Reform Bill, August 22, 1996. 
Mr. President, to not correct this flaw in the bill represents an enormous unfunded mandate to States and counties by simply shifting the cost of caring for the seriously ill, disabled, and elderly legal immigrants who are destitute and have no other way to survive. 
As I speak, SSA is sending out 125,000 SSI ban notices per week, to 800,000 legal immigrants who are on SSI nationwide. SSA estimates that more than 62.5 percent or 500,000 people currently receiving SSI benefits nationwide will lose their benefits under the current law--more than 40 percent, 205,000 of them in California. Many of these elderly and disabled legal immigrants have no family or friends to turn to for support and will become completely destitute. Their only recourse will be county general assistance programs or, at worst, homeless shelters. 
Let me give you an example from my home State: 
My staff met with a 73-year-old legal immigrant on SSI. She was welcomed to this county from Vietnam in 1980. She was a refugee from communism with no family in the United States. She speaks no English and she is suffering from kidney failure. She requires dialysis three times a week. Under this new law, this 73-year-old woman will lose SSI, her only source of support. Her well-being will 
become the responsibility of the county. 
I am the first to acknowledge that prior to welfare reform, there was abuse of the SSI program in this country. Elderly noncitizens could collect SSI, even if they lived with their children, as long as they claimed to be financially independent from the children. 
And the number of noncitizens receiving SSI has skyrocketed at a disproportionate rate to that of citizens. The number of noncitizens collecting SSI increased 477 percent in 14 years, from 1980 to 1994, while the number of U.S. citizens receiving SSI increased 33 percent during that same period. 
Although I strongly support efforts to hold sponsors accountable for the support of legal immigrants they bring into the country, the welfare reform bill passed by Congress simply went too far. It banned SSI and food stamps for virtually all legal immigrants, even those whose sponsors cannot afford to support them, or who have no sponsors at all. 
The current welfare reform bill will not just eliminate fraudulent cases from the SSI rolls. It will eliminate truly needy people like the 73-year-old elderly refugee. Surely, it was not the intent of this Congress to leave elderly, disabled, and destitute people with nowhere to go to except county relief or the streets. 
If we do not revise the welfare ban for legal immigrants the financial costs to States and counties will be enormous, and the human toll even greater: 
Los Angeles County estimates that 93,000 legal immigrants in its county will lose SSI benefits at a cost of up to $236 million a year to 
the county. 
San Francisco estimates that 20,000 legal noncitizens may turn to the county's general assistance program, at a total cost of up to $74 million annually. 
I believe this body must finish what it started last year. In this time of budgetary constraints where tough choices have to be made, we must act with prudence and compassion toward those who truly have no one to turn to, while at the same time preserving portions of the savings needed to balance the budget and enact meaningful reform. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a trusted colleague and dedicated public servant, Chuck Stevens. During his three-and-a-half-year tenure as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of California, he compiled an undeniably strong record. However, what may be most impressive about Chuck is his self-effacing demeanor in a position that often requires being pushed into the limelight. 
Chuck Stevens' career exemplifies the kind of integrity, dedication and skills essential for anyone who seeks to be an effective public servant. His success at the helm of the Eastern District in California so early in his career undoubtedly will be followed by great accomplishments in the future. 
A native of Cranford, NJ, Mr. Stevens moved to California to study law at the University of California, Berkeley where he graduated in 1982. Prior to his current position, he worked as a litigator in complex cases in the private sector and as an Assistant United States Attorney. 
Mr. Stevens returned to public service when he was appointed by President Clinton in November 1993 to be the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of California. I had the honor of recommending Mr. Stevens to the President for appointment. 
Since then, Chuck has succeeded in prosecuting a multitude of crimes--from hate crimes to political corruption to halting health care fraud--with distinction and diligence. He was also appointed by United States Attorney General Reno to serve on her advisory committee representing United States Attorneys across the nation. 
The Sacramento-based Eastern District of California is the tenth largest of the Nation's 94 Federal judicial districts. It covers 34 counties with 6 million residents scattered across 87,000 square miles from Oregon to Los Angeles and Nevada to the coastal range. 
Members of the legal community and Federal investigative agents give Mr. Stevens universally high marks for his job performance. He is credited with having `no ego about himself and his work, unlike most lawyers,' according to Sacramento based Federal Defender Quin Denvir. As anyone who has worked with Chuck knows, his work speaks for itself. 
Recently, Mr. Stevens' office has handled the weighty responsibility of trying the Unabomber case for incidents that occurred in California. Due to Mr. Stevens' leadership, Sacramento was considered as a site for the Federal trial against Ted Kacyzinski. It comes as no surprise that this case has been handled without fanfare, but with the utmost professionalism Mr. Stevens is known for. 
Chuck has always been ready and able to provide valuable advice on some of the State's most troubling problems. He is one of the most practical problem solvers in the criminal justice system. 
Chuck leaves the United States Attorney's office to form his own law firm in California's capitol with his predecessor, former United States Attorney George O'Connell. I am sure this formidable pair will quickly make its mark in the Sacramento legal community. 
Congratulations, Chuck, on the great opportunities that lie ahead and thank you for your outstanding public service to the people of this State and this Nation.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Charles Grassley, I am introducing the Personal Information Privacy Act of 1997. This legislation limits the accessibility and unauthorized commercial use of social security numbers, unlisted telephone numbers, and certain other types of sensitive personal information. 
In November, the news media reported that companies were distributing social security numbers along with other private information in their online personal locator or look-up services. 
In fact, I found that my own social security number was accessible to users of the Internet. My staff retrieved it in less than 3 minutes. I have the printout in my files. 
Some of the larger and more visible companies have now discontinued the practice of displaying social security numbers directly on the computer screens of Internet users. Other enterprises have failed to modify their practices. One problem thwarting efforts to protect our citizens' privacy is that there are thousands of information providers on the Internet and elsewhere in the electronic arena--it is impossible to get a comprehensive picture of who is doing what, and where. 
But one fact is clear, distributing social security numbers on the Internet is only the tip of the iceberg. 
Too many firms profit from renting and selling social security numbers, unlisted telephone numbers, and other forms of sensitive personal information. List compilers and list brokers use records of consumer purchases and other transactions--including medical purchases--along with financial, demographic, and other data to create increasingly detailed profiles of individuals. 
The growth of interactive communications has generated an explosive growth in information about our interests, our activities, and our illnesses--about the personal choices we make when we order products, inquire about 
services, participate in workshops, and visit sites on the Net.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 50 years ago a true American hero walked onto Ebbets Field one afternoon and forever shattered the color barrier with one swing of his bat. His name was Jack Roosevelt Robinson. 
On that day, 7 years before Brown versus the Board of Education allowed school children of all colors to sit in the same classroom, 16 years before Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of his dreams at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial, and 18 years before the Civil Rights Act became the law of the land, Jackie Robinson did more for the equal rights movement and the sport of baseball than had anyone before him. 
Jackie Robinson on April 15, 1947, became the first professional black athlete to play America's pastime, baseball. In his Brooklyn Dodgers uniform, he not only broke the color barrier, but he also broke numerous baseball records during his 10-year professional career. 
By the end of his tenure as a player, Jackie Robinson would become one of America's most celebrated and honored athletes. He became major league baseball's first Rookie of the Year--an award now named after him, the national league's Most Valuable Player, holder of the coveted batting title, a six-time member of Dodgers' World Series teams, a member of the 1955 world champion Dodgers, and a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
As the senior U.S. Senator representing California, I am particularly proud of the fact that Jackie Robinson was from the Golden State, raised in Pasadena, and was a star athlete at the University of California at Los Angeles. At UCLA, Robinson became the first athlete ever to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track. 
Such an amazing and talented athlete, however, was not welcomed into the arms of American baseball fans or of its players back in the spring of 1947. 
Jackie Robinson fought prejudice and harassment with every base he ran, every ball he hit, and every victory he helped win for his team. Players and coaches yelled racial slurs at him, and one team even threatened to strike in protest of Robinson's presence in their city. But Robinson, remembering how his mother refused to sell their family home and move away amid protests from white neighbors, persevered. 
He faced hatred and racism with courage and conviction, proving to teammates, opponents and fans alike that he had earned the right to play professional baseball through his sheer athleticism. Along the way, Robinson became the role model for future baseball icons such as Hank Aaron and Willie Mayes. 
Shortly after his retirement from baseball in 1957, Jackie Robinson helped to further the rights of all African-Americans by becoming a spokesman and fundraiser for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored people [NAACP]. He traveled the country urging black communities to work together for equal rights, educating and encouraging them to participate in the new civil rights movement. He became a role model all over again, this time to millions of men and women who saw inequality and wanted to change it. 
Jackie Robinson represents everything good with baseball, and everything great with America. By commemorating his achievements and his entrance onto the professional baseball fields, his legacy lives on, inspiring yet another generation of fans to realize their dreams and break new ground along the way. 
Jackie Robinson once said, `A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.' By that standard, Jackie Robinson's life was as important as America's greatest heroes throughout history, and we as a nation are all grateful and proud of his accomplishments. 
Major league baseball has recognized Jackie Robinson's achievements by dedicating the 1997 season to his memory. As part of these festivities, last week's opening day games were played in all major league stadiums with a Jackie Robinson commemorative baseball. Just last weekend, the Los Angeles Dodgers paid tribute to the Hall of Famer in a pregame ceremony attended by Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow. 
The Dodgers plan many other activities throughout the year such as a Jackie Robinson poster distributed to all Los Angeles district schools, a special section devoted to Robinson on the Dodgers' official web site, a salute to Jackie Robinson scholarship winners, an historic Robinson display at Dodger Stadium and assistance with the Jackie Robinson Foundation Golf Classic. Additionally, President Clinton will honor his memory with Rachel Robinson in an April 15 ceremony at Shea Stadium during a game between the Dodgers and the New York Mets. 
I salute the memory of Jackie Robinson on this, the 50th anniversary of his becoming the first black baseball player in the major leagues.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I really rise to lament the situation we are in. I believe the people of this Nation sent us to the Senate to work across the aisle, to work in a bipartisan way and particularly on issues of major concern. Whether Mexico is certified or not is an issue of major concern. It is of major concern certainly to Mexico; it is to America; it is to the cities of America; it is to every Representative in the House and to every Member of this body as well. 
I wish to pay tribute to the senior Senator from Georgia, with whom I have worked, with the junior Senator from Texas, with whom I have worked, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, to the administration team, and to many others. I believe we have demonstrated we can, in fact, work across party lines. 
We have developed a resolution which I think is a major achievement; it is law--it is not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution; it is a law--in which we state our concerns; we make findings; we ask the administration to move forward; we ask the President to move forward in his trips to Mexico and other Latin American nations to work in a multilateral way to bring back a new agreement; we indicate 10 areas where we would like to see progress; and we ask the administration to report to this Congress on September 1 on the progress made. 
We did not start here. Senator D'Amato and I began this a year ago. Not many people listened. We said we do not really believe that Mexico has fulfilled the test of a friend and neighbor and an ally who has been fully cooperative as the law calls for to be certified. At that point he and I put forward certain tests that we felt had to be met prior to certification. 
A year went by, and we saw very little progress, if any. And then the President made the decision to certify Mexico. In his mind, he had many good reasons to do so. It was a decision that was spiritedly debated within the White House. It was debated within the Department of State. And that was the ultimate decision of the President. 
There were those of us in this body, myself included, who had a profound difference of opinion with this decision. We thought that the Colombian model was the appropriate model and that Mexico should be decertified but with a national interest waiver as was the procedure with Colombia 2 years ago because we felt certification was not the appropriate vehicle. But it is the vehicle that we have, and therefore Mexico should be treated in the same way Colombia was if the findings were as we believe them to be. 
We have had meeting after meeting after meeting. The senior Senator from Georgia and I find ourselves in real agreement. The Senator from Texas and the two of us have worked together. Democrats came in; Republicans came in; the administration came in; and we forged an agreement which I believe, based on a conversation at least on my side with the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives last night, can be acceptable to the House and can be a clear statement which gives the President certain--not directives--but I think certain clear requests from this body to follow on his trip to Mexico which is upcoming and from which I believe our Nation, our big cities, our streets can derive significant benefit. 
I am profoundly disappointed to find ourselves in this situation and really urge colleagues on my side who are rightly concerned with the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty, rightly concerned, to please let this resolution go, let us have the debate, because absent that debate and given no opportunity in law to express ourselves, you leave us with no choice but to move for decertification because that is the only direct resolution that can come to the floor on an expedited procedure, as the majority leader has just said. 
I cannot tell you how strongly I feel about the cooperation I and others have had from the Republican side of the aisle. I have had an opportunity to work very closely with the senior Senator from Georgia, with his excellent staff, certainly with my excellent staff, with the Senator from Texas, Senators McCain, Kerry, Dodd, Domenici, all of whom came at a very critical time last night into these discussions and played a very helpful role. The administration has agreed in the areas of consensus. I think some things they did not want to be forced to put forward in law they have agreed to. We have agreed to take out something that the administration did not want, which was a September 1 expedited procedure giving us the opportunity to comment again in law on progress made between March 1 and September 1. We removed that. We have consensus. The administration has said the President would sign this; we believe the House will pass it; and we have a strong policy document with which to move forward. 
It would just be tragic if we fragment, if we have to use the only thing we have, which is a decertification, a straight and outright decertification, as the means to express ourselves. So I am very hopeful we would have an opportunity today, now, to bring this resolution to the floor. If we cannot achieve unanimous consent, as the majority leader has just said, it leaves him with no alternative but to call up the decertification resolution, and once that debate begins it would take unanimous consent to stop it, and unanimous consent to bring this resolution up during that 10-hour period, which I see really fraught with great difficulties. 
Once again, I cannot tell you how many hours the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from Texas, I and a number of other people have been involved in this effort. We have consulted the Democratic leader as we moved along. I believe he is pleased with this outcome. 
So I plead with colleagues on my side not to hold this resolution hostage to an agreement on the Chemical Weapons Convention. It is too important. Please, do not do it. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, very much. 
Mr. President, this country has always had a great debate about drugs. Do you fight drugs on the supply side, or do you fight drugs on the demand side? There is no question but that we have a demand problem. But there is also no question that we have a supply problem. My answer to that is that this country has never really done both really well. We have never really engaged in an all-out fight against drugs on both the supply side and the demand side. 
What is before us today is somewhat limited in scope because it has to do with the certification action involving Mexico and whether that action should, in fact, take place; whether Mexico should be certified, as the President said. 
The resolution now before this body, known as the Coverdell-Feinstein amendment, I think is significant. Let me tell you the two ways that I look at this. 
This resolution is either the first step to a new and forceful partnership to fight drugs all out on both the supply side and the demand side, and to join with Mexico in so doing, to accept President Zedillo's statement that drugs are the No. 1 security problem of Mexico, and to add to that the United States statement that drugs are, in fact, the No. 1 security problem for the United States of America, which I believe them to be, or this is the first step in a major battle next year, if this resolution is ignored, to decertify Mexico as being noncooperative in the supply side of the cooperation that goes into the retardation of drug flow into this country. 
Mr. President, I want to begin by once again paying my respects to the Senator from Georgia, the chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Senator Coverdell. He and I share a dedication to the idea that the status quo on United States-Mexican counterdrug cooperation is simply not acceptable, and his leadership on this issue has helped us reach this point. It has been an honor and a privilege to be his partner in this effort. And I look forward to continuing to work with him and his outstanding staff in the fight against international drug trafficking. 
I also want to acknowledge the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, whose contribution to this effort was invaluable. Her State, like mine, shares a long border with Mexico. So this issue hits home to us in a direct and a meaningful way. Other Senators too numerous to list, with names like Dodd, Kerry, McCain, Domenici, as well as others, the majority leader, the Democratic leader, have all weighed in to bring this effort to fruition. And I have appreciated working with each and every one of my colleagues to get to this outcome. 
Just over a year ago, as has been said, Senator D'Amato and I started talking about whether Mexico merited certification as a fully cooperative partner in the war against drugs. Our view was that Mexico had simply not made enough progress in the war on drug trafficking to justify certification. At that time, despite the fact that we laid down 10 specific criteria, no one paid us much attention. 
Well, people have paid attention this year. On February 28 of this year, the President made the decision to certify Mexico as fully cooperating with the United States in the fight against drug trafficking. But it just didn't wash in the Congress. The evidence simply does not support the claim that Mexico met the standard of full cooperation in 1996. 
As all of my colleagues are well aware, Senate procedures made it impossible for us to get a vote on what many of us believed was the best option--to decertify Mexico but allow the President to waive the sanctions based on what is termed a `national interest waiver.' If decertification with a waiver had come up for a vote 
I believe it would have passed the Senate by a large and even possibly veto-proof margin. I do not say that lightly. In the House, it would have passed overwhelmingly. Instead, the House passed with over 250 votes a resolution that decertifies Mexico in 90 days unless specific conditions are met. 
So this resolution, which we will pass today, expresses Congress' deep concern over the lack of progress in key areas of Mexico's counterdrug effort. 
Let me quote from subsection (c) of the amendment. `It is the sense of the Congress that there has been ineffective and insufficient progress in halting the production in, and transit through, Mexico of illegal drugs.' 
This statement has never before been made by this body and the other body in concert. And I believe it will be, and no one should underestimate what that means. 
In short, while we could not decertify Mexico, the Congress rejects the administration's claim that Mexico has fully cooperated with the United States. The evidence I believe is overwhelming. Last week, I tried to lay this case out with some specificity, the case that Mexico has not earned decertification. I will not repeat here all of the facts to prove that Mexico has not met the test of full cooperation. But let me just remind my colleagues of a few of those facts. 
No. 1, cocaine seizures by Mexican authorities in 1996, 23.6 metric tons, were barely half of what they were in 1993 when there were 46.2 metric tons. You see how they have dropped and how they have barely picked up this past year. 
Drug related arrests in 1996 were 11,038, less than half of what they were in 1992. In 1992, what I am saying is that the cooperative effort on arrests was double what it has been this past year. And these are specific measurements that can't be challenged. They are there. You have to look at them. 
Another way of measuring this, for those of us that are familiar with how drugs reverberate on streets, is whether street prices are dropping or rising. If the street prices for cocaine and for heroin drop on the streets, you know there is more supply. 
If they rise on the streetcorners of New York and Los Angeles and Chicago and Dallas and other cities in this Nation, then you know there is less supply. Let us for a moment take a major city, a huge city, over 6 million people in Los Angeles, and let us look at street prices. The street prices of cocaine today, in Los Angeles, are 22 percent lower than they were in 1993. This is for a kilogram, $21,000 in 1993, dropping to $16,000 today. 
Let us take a look at the street value of black tar heroin, almost entirely transferred to the United States from Mexico. Here is the street value of this black tar heroin in California. 
In 1993, per ounce, it was $1,200. Look at it go straight down. Today, it is $400. Part of that is the fact that it is in competition with the pure white cocaine that comes from other places, but still the black tar heroin is heavily used by addicts, and you can see the drop in the street price, which clearly means more supply. 
Then you take the major traffickers. What has happened is that as the Cali cartels of Colombia become less potent in this area, the Mexican cartels have become more potent. Specifically, Senator Coverdell enumerated four of them--the Juarez, Tijuana, Sonora, and Gulf cartels. And our DEA has clearly stated to us in testimony, written and verbal, that the Mexican major drug cartels today are operating with impunity, and even the State Department admits that `the strongest groups such as the Juarez and Tijuana cartels have yet to be effectively confronted.' 
Mexican cartels have assassinated 12 high-level prosecutors and senior law enforcement officers in just the last year. Here is the clincher. None of these murders has been solved. Twelve major Federal and statewide prosecutors, sometimes the head prosecutor, people who want to do a good job, have been assassinated for doing that good job. It has often been said that those they cannot buy, the cartels will kill. 
Corruption is endemic in Mexico's Government, police, and military. The Mexican drug czar was arrested for corruption as was another senior army general just 2 days ago. DEA Administrator Constantine has said `there is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico with whom DEA has an entirely trusting relationship.' 
Mexico has enacted money laundering legislation last year. So far the legislation has not been implemented. Banking regulations were finally issued last week, 2 months late, but they do not take effect until May, and their effectiveness has not yet been evaluated. 
Mexico has failed to adequately fund the Binational Border Task Forces agreed to by the two sides in a much touted bilateral meeting, and as we all know, to this day Mexico has forbidden our DEA agents taking part in these border task forces, if they cross the border from our country to Mexico, to carry sidearms to protect themselves on that side of the border. 
Mexico has refused to allow United States Navy ships patrolling for drug smugglers to put into Mexican ports to refuel without 30 days' notice. 
The reason this is so important is that if you are trailing a ship, whether it is a fishing vessel or another maritime vessel, you may need to pursue it into Mexican waters. More drugs are now coming into our country via maritime channels. Fishing boats, commercial boats, ships, and other maritime transportation devices are today carrying increased tonnage of drugs. If we have a Coast Guard ship tracking one of these vessels, it may have to put into port--and the Mexican traffickers have become very sophisticated about moving out, taking the time so that they know the ship following them needs to refuel. If our vessels have to put in, they cannot because our ships have to give 30-day notice before they refuel. 
Well, of course, one of the biggest tonnages of cocaine transferred through maritime channels actually was a ship leaving Peru which our Navy was able to get to, but the cartels are very smart. They learn how to prevent this from happening. So this is 
an important area. 
And then finally a battle that we have had back and forth--and I still hold fast to this statement--Mexico has never extradited a single Mexican national to the United States on drug charges despite 52 extradition requests, for at least 13 of which the paperwork has been completed. Now they have made advances, they have begun to extradite Mexican nationals on other charges, and I think they should be commended for that. But that is not yet full cooperation. 
So I think the record is clear. It is not credible to make claim that Mexico has fully cooperated with the United States in combating drug trafficking, and that is the standard required by section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act. 
Despite these facts, the claim has been made by the administration that progress has been made, and I respect that. The administration has said that they believe some of the things I have just alluded to are in the process of being corrected. That is why originally we felt it was so important to have this body be able to monitor progress, comment on progress on September 1 in an expedited way, and make a finding if we found the progress inadequate. 
That has been removed from this resolution, but the administration will still report on progress. You can be sure that I and others in this body will come to the floor and make our comments on September 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 on whether we regard this progress as being adequate. 
So as we engaged in negotiations with the administration over the past week on this resolution, it was extremely important to put into place a mechanism by which we could hold the administration accountable. We have compromised here. But we also have 10 specifics. Subsection (d) requires the President to support on progress in 10 specific areas--and I urge Members to begin to look at this. It begins on page 6 of the resolution following this historic statement that `it is the sense of Congress that there has been ineffective and insufficient progress in halting the production and transit through Mexico of illegal drugs.' We say that not later than September 1 the President shall submit to the Congress a report and then we list 10 areas of concern to be addressed in the report. Let me outline those 10 areas. 
The first is effective action to dismantle the major drug cartels and arrest and extradite their leaders. This goes specifically to the two most powerful groups, the Juarez and Tijuana cartels, as well as others like the Sonora and the Gulf cartels. 
Second, better cooperation between the United States and Mexican law enforcement including the funding and deployment of the Binational Border Task Forces and allowing United States agents in these forces to arm themselves for self-defense. That is the implication. By September 1 we will know whether it has been achieved or not. The answer then will be yes or no. 
Third, better enforcement at the border. This means increased screening for and seizures of contraband. It also means, and Senator Hutchison was very effective in incorporating this into our resolution, that we call for the funding and the assignment of an additional 1,000 agents on the border this next year. The administration's budget has funding for 500. Let me say to the administration, from this side of the aisle, that is not adequate. We are asking for 1,000, by official action, incorporated in this legislation. 
Improved cooperation on extraditions--that is the fourth. This goes specifically to the need for Mexico to extradite Mexican nationals who are wanted in the United States on drug charges. A good start would be the 13 such requests pending. There are several dozen more on the way. On September 1, we will see how many extraditions there have been. 
Fifth states easier rules of prosecution of drug traffickers. At the present time, the evidentiary rules in Mexico--and Mexico is aware of this--are such that, in their country it is very difficult to come by a conviction. 
Sixth, full and ongoing implementation of effective money laundering legislation and enforced regulations--for banks and other financial institutions--these are the money-changing houses outside of banks--with penalties and sanctions for those who do not comply and immunity for those who help, so people who turn in money launderers will not be assassinated. We are hopeful--and I commend Mexico for taking action in this regard--we are hopeful that last week's progress in issuing these regulations will lead, now, to effective enforcement. We all know it is one thing to have something on the books, it is another thing to see that something is carried out and enforced. On September 1, Senator Coverdell and I and others will both be looking at these. Are they in place? Have they been effected? Have they been enforced? 
Seventh, increased eradication of drug crops, including marijuana and opium--this is the seventh. We hope and expect that eradication figures will increase this year. I believe our Nation is prepared to play a role in any binational cooperation that the Mexican Government would wish in that regard. 
Eighth, implementation of a comprehensive screening program to identify, weed out, and prosecute corrupt officials at all levels of the Mexican Government, police, and military. This means vigorous screening of candidates before they are hired, not rehiring corrupt policemen after their dismissal, and prosecution of those found to be corrupt. We commend Mexico for firing 1,250 law enforcement officers. The problem is, none were prosecuted. That is the problem. And we are asking for cooperation. 
I think it is worth noting that the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday that 3 percent of the Mexican police tested positive for drug use in a recent survey. This was 3 percent of Federal personnel screened. I think it added up to some 424 Federal law enforcement officers who failed drug tests. We have that same problem in our Nation. So we admit it and we try and screen. We are asking our partner in Mexico to do the same thing. 
Ninth, we have a clause in there regarding support by the United States of Mexico's efforts to combat corruption. I cannot conclude without saying that Mexico has made efforts. I believe Mexico has made efforts. I simply question the adequacy of those efforts. But, for those efforts that have been made, we should provide support, and I believe every Member of this Congress, and certainly this Senate, wants to do so. So, this clause reads, `the rendering of support to Mexico in its efforts to identify, remove and prosecute corrupt officials'--they would ask us for that support, but we would certainly say that support would be forthcoming. 
The 10th and final provision calls for `the augmentation and strengthening of bilateral cooperation.' This is not specific in the law we are writing. It is nonspecific. At the administration's request, we removed a direct reference to air and maritime cooperation. But I think the record should show that 
Congress does expect this report to discuss progress made in areas such as aircraft overflight and refueling rights, aircraft radar coverage, and maritime refueling rights. 
I look forward to receiving this report on September 1. The record will reflect that, and Senator Coverdell and I and Senator Hutchison and others, come September 1, as sure as the sun will come up, we will make an inquiry to see what the progress has been. And if the Congress finds the progress cited by the administration to be inadequate, it will no doubt find ways to respond. 
This report, in essence, in addition to the findings carried up front in this resolution and the two senses of the Senate, urging the President on his visit to put forward this new, multilateral cooperative, hemispheric drive, if you will, reflect a new strategy, a new plan, new bilateral cooperation, and the specific sense of the Senate, and our conclusions as to why we would have to say there has not been full cooperation up to this point. 
I very much hope, in summary, that there will be a very strong vote in this Chamber for this resolution. If it passes, I have been assured by John Hilley of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs and General McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, that the administration will work hard to get this resolution passed by the House. If they do, I believe it will pass the House. John Hilley and General McCaffrey also assured me that the President will sign this resolution as passed by the Senate. 
We, for the first time in history, will have passed a law, not a sense of the Senate resolution, but a law which states a purpose, which states a new effort, which states specifics, and which asks that on both the supply side and the demand side there be a new effort by both the United States of America and the sovereign, independent country of Mexico, to address the drug problem together, both on the demand side here with us and the supply side there with Mexico. 
It is a very important, significant piece of legislation. I believe, I sincerely believe, it can have major, long-term impact. If it does not, the alternative is very clear next year. It is very clear. And it will not be just Senator D'Amato and I next year, or Senator Coverdell and I, and Senator Hutchison and others, and hopefully a majority this year. It will be a full-blown effort to see that this progress is carefully evaluated. And whatever action we must take, we will, in fact, take. 
Mr. President, let me express my thanks to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, for lifting his objection. I know he has very deep and heartfelt feelings about the Chemical Weapons Convention. I have said to him informally, and I will say here, I will certainly do everything I possibly can to provide him with any help I can give, to see that it comes to the floor. But I am very pleased he has withdrawn his objection and we will be able to bring this debate to a conclusion with a vote on this resolution. 
Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on my hour?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank you. 
I would like to thank again the Senator from Georgia. It has been a great pleasure to work with him and Senator Hutchison. We began this effort over a week ago. It has been a very intensive effort. I believe it has resulted in a resolution which will have dominant support from this body, pass the House, and be signed by the President of the United States. 
More importantly, I think this resolution will become the law and will have teeth. And those teeth are: Administration: Report on September 1 the progress that has been made. Here are the specific areas in which we wish you to make progress. If there is inadequate progress made, it leaves no alternative really but to fuel up for a massive decertification battle in a year. 
I want to say one thing about America's demand problem. Because the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, who spoke on this issue, I think had it right. One of the things that I have found is that we have programs in this country that work and programs that do not work. And I would just like to recommend to everybody that might be watching this a program that does work, a program which has no Government funds, a program with whom my colleague from California and I are very well familiar. 
That is a program called Delancy Street in San Francisco which takes the hardest core drug addicts, with about a 4-year stay, and puts them through an intensive program--changes their environment, changes their lifestyle, and does rehabilitate. As mayor, I helped Delancy get some land right on the waterfront. The Delancy people built their own facilities, which are stellar. They run their own businesses. They pay for their program through their labor. 
And I would just like to invite--Delancy does not know I am doing this--anyone, anywhere in the United States that has an interest in replicating a program to rehabilitate American drug addicts that works, to go to San Francisco, to call Mimi Silbert, the director, and take a look at a program that works, does not take dime one of public money and does it all on their own. It is one of the most impressive programs anywhere in the United States. 
If we had more Delancys and more kinds of permeations of Delancy, Delancy Streets for young children, children 14, 15, 16 years old, I think we could turn this Nation around. If we had more programs like Facts on Crack from Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco, we could begin to turn this Nation around. But in the meantime, we have to retard the supply of drugs. And that is a major first step. 
So again, I say thank you to everyone that has participated. I look forward to the vote. I thank the Chair and I yield back the balance of my few minutes. 
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support this simple but strong legislation to protect our children. 
This bill, sponsored by myself, Senator Boxer, and Senator Snowe, would provide three simple protections: 
First, the bill would prohibit list brokers from selling personal information about children under 16 to anyone, without first getting the parent's consent. 
All kinds of information about our children--more facts than most of us might think or hope for--is rapidly becoming available through these list brokers. It is only a matter of time before this information begins to fall into the wrong hands. 
Last year, a reporter in Los Angeles was easily able to purchase parents' names, birth months and addresses for 5,500 children aged 1-12 in a particular neighborhood. The reporter used the name of a fictitious company, gave a non-working telephone number, had no credit card or check, and identified herself as Richard Allen Davis, the notorious murderer of Polly Klaas. When ordering the list, the company representative simply told her `Oh, you have a famous name,' and sent her the information C.O.D. This is simply unacceptable. 
Second, the bill would give parents the authority to demand information from the list brokers who traffic in the personal data of their children--brokers will be required to provide parents with a list of all those to whom they sold information about the child, and must also tell the parent precisely what kind of information was sold. 
If this personal information is out there, and brokers are buying and selling it back and forth, it is only reasonable that we allow parents to find out what information has been sold and to whom that information has been given. 
Finally, this bill would prohibit list brokers from using prison labor to input personal information. This seems like common sense to most of us, but unfortunately the use of prison labor is not currently prohibited. 
Last year when I introduced this bill, I spoke of the plight of Beverly Dennis, an Ohio grandmother who filled out a detailed marketing questionnaire about her buying habits for a mail in survey. She filled out the questionnaire when she was told that she might receive free product samples and helpful information. Rather than receiving product information, however, she soon began to receive sexually explicit, fact-specific letters from a convicted rapist serving time. 
The rapist, writing from his prison cell, had learned the very private, intimate details about her life because he was keypunching her personal questionnaire data into a computer for a subcontractor. Ms. Dennis received letters with elaborate sexual fantasies, weaved around personal facts provided by her in the questionnaire. This bill would have prevented the situation from ever occurring. 
Finally, Mr. President, this year I have included in the bill exemptions for sales to law enforcement organizations, the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and to accredited colleges and universities. We received a great deal of input since we introduced the bill last June, and I believe we have addressed most of the concerns about our bill with these exemptions. 
Schools will be able to get information about prospective students, law enforcement will be able to get the lists to help them find missing kids, and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children will be able to do likewise. 
This bill is really very simple. Some marketing companies may be unhappy that the government is trying to legislate how they do business, but we have to weigh the safety and well-being of our children against the small inconvenience of requiring parental consent in these cases. Given the rapidly changing nature of the marketing business and the ways in which child molesters and other criminals operate, this bill is an important step in protecting our kids from those who would do them harm.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997. I believe that extending the basic term of copyright protection by 20 years is a step in the right direction. 
Perhaps the most compelling reason for this legislation is the need for greater international reciprocity in honoring copyright terms. The European Union has formally adopted a life plus 70 copyright term, and countries currently awaiting admission to the Union will adopt this standard in the future. Several countries outside of the European Union also have turned to the life plus 70 term, and many expect it to become the international standard. 
By extending to life plus 70 years, Congress will help ensure that American creators receive comparable protection in other countries. If we do not act, other nations will not be required to provide American authors and artists with any more protection than we offer them at home. 
And, before the United States is the world's leader in the production of intellectual property, and because the State of California is home to many of the leading copyright industries, this issue is of great importance to me. We could be the net losers if we do not move toward greater harmonization. 
Intellectual property--the collective creative output of America's makers of movies, music, art, and other works--is an enormous asset to the Nation's economy and balance of trade. 
The International Intellectual Property Alliance estimates that copyright-related industries contributed more than $385 billion to the U.S. economy in 1994, with more than $50 billion in foreign sales. 
Many other countries have preferred to appropriate and re-sell American films, music, and computer programs--some of the great exports of my State of California--rather than license American works. 
The United States suffers greatly from illegal duplication of our work. Why, then, should we sit back and allow European companies to legally profit from the use of our works, without paying us in return? 
As Prof. Arthur Miller of Harvard Law School aptly, albeit bluntly, put it: `Unless Congress matches the copyright extension adopted by the European Union, we will lost 20 years of valuable protection against rip-off artists.' Since America is the world's principal exporter of popular culture, extension of the basic copyright term is an important step in the right direction. 
Reciprocity in copyright protection becomes even more necessary in today's global information society, where computer networks span the continents, and intellectual property is shuttled around the world in seconds. 
The world has changed dramatically since 1976, when Congress established the present copyright terms. Many copyrighted works have a much longer commercial life than they used to have. 
Videocassettes, cable television, and new satellite delivery systems have extended the commercial life of movies and television series. New technologies not only have extended but also have expanded the market for creative content. Cable television, which promises hundreds of different channels, has vastly expanded this market. Networked computers add to the demand for content. Interactive television promises to do the same. 
The Copyright Term Extension Act will go far to address the global developments I have mentioned. 
After introduction, I recommend that my colleagues and I further develop the language of the act to ensure that all contributors to the creative process receive benefits from the extended copyright term. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this bill grants permanent residency status to Jasmin Salehi, a California constituent who is currently assisting the LA district attorney with the prosecution of her husband's murderer. 
Mai Hoa Jasmin Salehi is a Korean immigrant who was denied permanent residency after her husband was violently murdered at a Denny's in Reseda, CA, where he worked as manager. Local INS officials in Los Angeles denied Jasmin's application because the law requires legal immigrants be married for 2 years before they become eligible for permanent resident status. Jasmin and Cyrus Salehi were newlyweds who had been married only 11 months before the murder. 
I have previously sought administrative relief for Jasmin by asking the INS if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in Jasmin's case, but the local INS officials in Los Angeles has told my staff that there is nothing they can do. 
Jasmin met and married Cyrus Salehi, an American citizen, in March 1995 and has completed all the paperwork necessary to obtain her green card. But now, Jasmin has been told that she can stay in the United States as long as the district attorney needs her to prosecute her husband's murderer. Despite here assistance in the prosecution, Jasmin would be deported once the investigation and subsequent trial are completed. 
Jasmin has done everything right in order to become a permanent resident of this country--except for the tragedy of her husband's murder 13 months before she could become a permanent resident. I hope you support this bill so that we can help Jasmin begin to rebuild her life in the United States. 
Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the attached news article and the bill be entered into the Record.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Senator Coverdell may well come to the floor during this period. I hope he does. I will be happy to defer, and yield parts of my time to him as well. 
Mr. President, 1 week ago I joined with Senator Coverdell and Senator Helms to introduce resolutions of disapproval, to overturn the President's decision to certify Mexico for antidrug cooperation. 
Last week I went home and I read the State Department's Statement of Explanation, which is just 1 1/2 pages. 
I must say, I read this document with disbelief. At best, this document--which purports to make the case for Mexico's certification--is a fairy tale. At worst, it is a complete whitewash. Today, I would like to take some time and go over parts of it, and indicate my thoughts on some of the subjects mentioned and refute some of the claims. 
Let me begin by saying that section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act requires the President to certify that Mexico has `cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on its own' to combat drug trafficking. Despite the best intentions of President Zedillo and the best efforts of the State Department to put a pretty face on the situation, the Department's Statement of Explanation, I believe, defies credibility. 
The State Department claims that `The Government of Mexico's 1996 counterdrug effort produced encouraging results and notable progress in bilateral cooperation.' The facts tell a different story. 
Let me begin with drug seizures: 
The State Department's Statement of Explanation indicates that `Drug seizures and arrests increased in 1996.' While this is technically true--yes, there was a slight increase in 1996 in both drug seizures and arrests of drug traffickers--that is only because the 1995 levels were so dismal. A larger look of Mexico's record of drug seizures, going back just a few years to 1992, gives a very different perspective. 
The 23.6 metric tons of cocaine seized by Mexico, while slightly higher than in 1995, is just about half of what was seized in 1993. So, you see, in 1993 they seized 46.2 metric tons of cocaine. Look how it has dropped off and leveled off since then. 
Second, drug arrests did increase modestly in 1996 over 1995. But look back a few years and it tells a more compelling picture. In 1992 you had 27,369 drug arrests. In 1996 you had 11,038. That is not a stepped-up effort, it is a stepped-down effort. So, after a precipitous drop, by more than 50 percent, a barely discernible 5- or 10-percent increase, in my view, is not improvement. They are not encouraging results and there is not notable progress. 
Today, Mexico is the transit station for 70 percent of the cocaine, a quarter of the heroin, 80 percent of the marijuana, and 90 percent of the ephedrine used to make methamphetamine, entering the United States. 
These statistics reflect, I believe, more drugs flowing into our cities and our communities. How do we know this now? Just look at some of the street prices. 
According to the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement, in 1993, when Mexican cocaine seizures were near their peak, a kilo of cocaine sold on the streets of Los Angeles for $21,000. Today, that same kilo of cocaine averages $16,500, and I am told that in places you can get it for $14,000 a kilo. 
You can see how these prices have dropped. The drop is even more dramatic if you look at black tar heroin, which the DEA says is nearly the exclusive province of Mexican family-operated cartels, based in Michoacan. The price per ounce has dropped from $1,200 in 1993 to $400 today. 
So today, the street price of black tar heroin has dropped to one-third of its price 4 years ago. 
Unfortunately, demand remains high, so when the prices drop, the obvious conclusion is that you have more supply. The falling price can be attributed to increases in the amounts of cocaine and heroin flowing across our southern border. I hardly consider this to be evidence of `encouraging results and notable progress.' 
When the street prices begin to climb, then I, for one, will begin to believe that the supply is being cut. 
So street prices are dropping despite the fact that stepped up enforcement on the U.S. side of the border has resulted in increased seizures. 
U.S. border agents at the McAllen, TX, border station seized 176,000 pounds of marijuana in 1996, 20 percent more than in 1993. But the burden of combating the increased drug shipments falls disproportionately on United States border agents because Mexico does little to enforce the border. 
United States Customs and Border Patrol officials have said publicly that Mexican traffickers are today going to extraordinary lengths to move their products. They are constructing secret compartments in 18-wheelers. They are saturating areas with hundreds of mules carrying backpacks with 40 kilos of marijuana each, and even sacrificing large loads of marijuana at the border to allow more valuable shipments of cocaine and heroin to slip through behind them. And they have begun to use sea lanes in much greater proportion. 
For the State Department to state that there has been improved performance by Mexico in intercepting drugs at the border is incomprehensible to me. Low seizure figures, low arrest figures, falling street prices in our cities--these are hardly indications of full cooperation by Mexican authorities in combating drug trafficking. 
Let me speak about the cartels in Mexico. The State Department's Statement of Explanation touts the arrests of `several major drug traffickers,' including Juan Garcia Abrego, leader of the Gulf cartel, Jose Luis Pereira Salas, linked to the Juarez and Colombian Cali cartel, and Manuel Rodriguez Lopez, linked to a minor operation called the Castrillon maritime smuggling organization. 
But who the Mexicans fail to capture tells a much more important story. In fact, the State Department admits as much when it says, `the strongest groups, such as the Juarez and Tijuana cartels, have yet to be effectively confronted.' 
Let me repeat that: `the strongest groups * * * have yet to be effectively confronted.' 
So here is the State Department explaining to us that Mexico has fully cooperated with the United States, and yet telling us in the same breath that Mexico has taken no serious action against the organizations and individuals most responsible for the bulk of the drug trafficking. 
This is also not how United States drug enforcement officials describe the efforts in Mexico. Let me share with my colleagues what our own drug enforcement officials say about how fully Mexico is cooperating in antidrug efforts. 
DEA administrator, Thomas Constantine, has described the Mexican drug cartels, in a statement he made to a House committee the week before last, as `the leading organized crime organizations in the Western Hemisphere, and for some reason,' he continues, `they seem to be operating with impunity.' 
His testimony is a chilling account of the extensive operations of the major Mexican drug cartels and how corruption within Mexican law enforcement agencies has allowed the cartels to conduct their deadly trade with virtual impunity. He also described how the Mexican drug cartels are expanding their criminal reach into the United States. 
As we debate whether or not to disapprove of Mexico's 
certification, I hope all of my colleagues will take the time to read Mr. Constantine's testimony. It makes the case better than anything I have seen that Mexico's efforts have, in fact, not met the standard for certification.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do this, Mr. President, because I think this is testimony that is crucial to a decision that will shortly be before the Senate. This is our No. 1 drug enforcement agency in the United States, and I think it is important that the testimony of the head of that agency be read by Members considering this issue. 
Perhaps the most powerful of all cartels today is the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization, also known as the Juarez cartel. This organization operates out of Rancho Hacienda de la Natividad today, near Cuernavaca, Morelos, outside of Mexico City. It runs multi-ton quantities of Colombian cocaine toward Mexican distribution sites and then into the United States. 
The organization runs these drug trafficking operations in Chihuahua, Mexico City, Mayarit, Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Sonora, Jalisco, Baja, CA, Tamulipas, Veracruz, and Zacatecas, among others. 
Despite the `encouraging results and notable progress' cited by the State Department, the Juarez cartel is today as strong as it has ever been. Worse, it is spreading its tentacles into the United States, and this concerns me deeply. One law enforcement official told me it controls a majority of the cocaine in Los Angeles. 
Operations linked to the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization have today been identified in the Texas cities of El Paso, Houston, McAllen, Midland, Odessa and San Antonio, and in California's major cities such as Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento; also, in Nevada's major city, Las Vegas; Illinois' major city, Chicago; the major city in the State of New York, New York City; and Florida's major city, Miami. 
Do we know who the leaders of this cartel are? Yes, we do, and so do the Mexican authorities. Amado Carrillo-Fuentes heads the organization and controls the cocaine, marijuana and heroin transportation to the United States. His brother, Vincente Carrillo-Fuentes, is primarily responsible for the group's marijuana trafficking operation. 
These men are considered by President Zedillo to be Mexico's primary national security threat. Amado Carrillo-Fuentes has been indicted in Florida and in Texas on heroin and cocaine charges. Yet, he has never been tried in Mexico, nor has an extradition request for crimes committed in the United States been honored. 
Have the Mexican authorities taken any action whatsoever that has hampered the operations of the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization? The answer to date is no. In fact, there is ample evidence to show that the Carrillo-Fuentes organization has federal police and government officials on their payroll, 
including the former head of the counternarcotics effort in Mexico, General Gutierrez, who was arrested 3 weeks ago. 
Just a few days ago, Mexico did try to arrest Mr. Carrillo-Fuentes. Let me read from the Los Angeles Times, dated Saturday, March 8:  
In an apparently stepped-up search for alleged drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes, more than 100 troops backed by light tanks commandeered a luxury hotel in Guadalajara late Thursday night. . . . 
Carlton Hotel manager Carlos Hodria said Friday that about 150 soldiers arrived unannounced in trucks and tanks and that the operation lasted about 40 minutes, jarring most of the hotel's personnel and 296 guests. He quoted military officers as saying they were `searching for a person.' 
Obviously, when you roll tanks up to a hotel, whomever you are looking for is going to know that and be long gone. To my knowledge, no arrests were made. 
The other major cartel at work in Mexico is the Arellano-Felix organization, also known as the Tijuana cartel. This organization transports multiton quantities of cocaine and marijuana and large quantities of heroin and methamphetamine into the United States where it is distributed by agents employed by the cartel in this country. 
The cartel has its base of operations in Tijuana, but it is active in Sinaloa, Jalisco, Michoacan, Chiapas, Baja California Norte and Baja California Sur. It is of particular concern to me because Southern California is the primary entry point of most of the drugs trafficked by this organization. 
The Arellano-Felix organization has spread its influence deep inside American cities, often recruiting street gangs to do its distribution and enforcement work. Orders are given to these agents in U.S. cities directly from Tijuana through sophisticated telecommunications networks. 
Do we know who the leaders of the Arellano-Felix organization are? Again, we do, and so do the Mexican authorities. 
Alberto Benjamin Arellano-Felix is the leader of the organization and has overall responsibility for management of the cartel's drug-trafficking operations. 
His brother, Ramon Eduardo Arellano-Felix, is responsible for the group's security operations, which include well-trained paramilitary-style forces who assassinate rivals and traitors. 
Has any action been taken by the Mexican authorities to rein in the operations of the Arellano-Felix organization? Have there been any arrests of its senior leaders? 
No, the State Department informs us. This cartel has `yet to be effectively confronted.' Is this an example of the `encouraging results and notable progress' cited by the State Department? 
The Amado Carrillo-Fuentes cartel and the Arellano-Felix cartel, to the best of my knowledge, are operating with absolute impunity. But even the smaller cartels are hardly touched by Mexican authorities. 
I think two recent incidents illustrate just what sort of cooperation the United States is receiving from Mexico with respect to the cartels. 
On February 26 of this year, the Washington Post published an hour-long interview--hour-long interview--with Miguel Angel Caro Quintero, leader of the Sonora cartel, who is under indictment in the United States for crimes committed in the United States and for whom the United States has requested extradition.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as he told the Post: 
I go to the banks, offices, just like any Mexican. Every day I pass by roadblocks, police, soldiers, and there are no problems. I'm in the streets all the time. How can they not find me? Because they're not looking for me. 
According to law enforcement, the Sonora cartel cultivates, smuggles, and distributes heroin and marijuana to the United States, as well as transporting Colombian cocaine. It has operations reaching into Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, California, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana. 
The Washington Post found him, but the Mexican police, up to the last few days, were not even looking for him. Perhaps the State Department would explain how this qualifies as `full cooperation' with the United States. I do not see it. 
The other incident was a typical February story. I sometimes wish February would last all year round because the pressure of the March 1 certification decision seems to produce all kinds of results that we are unable to get the rest of the year, but on March 2, frequently it is business as usual. 
Just hours before the President's decision on certification was to be made public, the Mexican Government announced with great fanfare the arrest of Humberto Garcia Abrego, a leader of the Gulf cartel. 
Leave aside the question of why Mexican authorities were unable to arrest this man the rest of the year but miraculously found him on February 27. What happened next is critical to the integrity of the effort. 
Only hours after the decision to certify Mexico was announced, Humberto Garcia Abrego simply walked out of custody. The Mexican Attorney General's office called his release `inexplicable.' You could not write a script that would illustrate our problem with Mexico's inability to deal with the cartels any better than this incident. 
Yet, the State Department assures us that there have been `encouraging results and notable progress.' Not with respect to the cartels. I sincerely do not believe that the cartels' operations have been altered, reduced or impeded at all. 
Those officials whom the cartels cannot buy they kill. 
The cartels have unleashed a reign of terror on honest Mexican law enforcement officials. The DEA reports that 12 prosecutors and law enforcement officers have been assassinated in Mexico in just the last year alone, most of them in connection with the Tijuana cartel. 
Let's start with an incident on February 22, 1996, just about a year ago. Approximately 40 Juarez municipal police opened fire on agents from the Mexican Attorney General's office, resulting in the death of one commandante and one agent. DEA suspects the local police were providing protection for drug traffickers. 
On February 23, 1996, Sergio Armanda Silva, a former operations chief of the Baja federal police, was assassinated. 
On April 17, 1996, Mexico City's previous top prosecutor, Arturo Ochoa Palacios, was gunned down while jogging. 
May 1996, Mexico City's top prosecutor, Sergio Moreno Perez, was kidnapped with his adult son in Michoacan state. Their bodies were later discovered in a car in Mexico City's suburbs. 
June 27, 1996, drug agency commandante Daniel Beruben-Jaime was assassinated in Jalisco. 
July 19, 1996, Isaac Sanchez Perez, the former Baja federal police commander, was shot in the back of the head and killed in Mexico City. 
August 17, 1996, Tijuana prosecutor Jesus Romero Magana was gunned down outside his home. He was investigating the Arellano-Felix organization. 
September 14, 1996, Baja federal police commander Ernesto Ibarra Santes, two of his bodyguards and a cab driver were machine-gunned down in Mexico city.  
Ibarra had vowed to go after the Arellano Felix brothers and to purge the federal police ranks of any corrupt federal agents who stood in his way. He held his post for 28 days. 
September 21, the body of Hector Gonzalez-Baecenas, assistant to Garcia Vargas, was found in the trunk of another car. Also tortured. 
September 23, 1996, the body of 43-year-old Jorge Garcia Vargas, Tijuana district chief of the Federal antinarcotics agency was found in the trunk of a car along with the body of Miguel Angel Silva Caballero, a former Federal police commander. Both showed signs of torture. 
November 3, 1996, a former prosecutor named Martin Ramirez-Alvarez was murdered in Tijuana. His wife reported that an unknown number of individuals stopped them in a vehicle utilizing red and blue police strobe lights. They dragged Ramirez-Alvarez out of the vehicle and shot him point blank six times. It is believed the Arellano-Felix organization is responsible for the assassination. 
On January 3, 1997, 27-year-old State Prosecutor Hodin Gutierrez-Rico was assassinated in front of his wife and children at his residence in Tijuana. Gutierrez-Rico was investigating the murder of a Tijuana municipal police chief and Presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. More than 120 spent shells were found on the ground, and his body was deliberately run over several times by a van. 
And so it goes. These murders are, to me, the most compelling because their message is undeniable: `Get too close, and you are dead.' And not one of these cases has been solved to date. This is why the corruption of the military general placed in charge of the counternarcotics effort is so paralyzing. The question remains: If the highest military man can be corrupted, then who is left? 
But Mexico's failure to combat the cartels effectively is having an alarming spillover effect into American cities. Robert Walsh, special agent in charge of the San Diego office of the FBI told my office that all of the major Mexican cartels have members of United States gangs working for them. 
These agents distribute the drugs shipped in by the cartels and ship the cash generated from drug sales back to Mexico. They also carry out revenge murders on orders from Tijuana or Juarez. 
Prof. Peter Lupsha of the University of New Mexico, who has studied the cartels for decades, says, `I don't believe anyone in La Cosa Nostra could order a murder 2,000 miles away and expect it to be carried out. Carillo-Fuentes can do that and much more.' 
That is why the State Department's utter denial that the problem is getting worse is so dangerous. As much as these cartels are destroying Mexico, their reach is expanding. They have agents in many of our large and mid-size cities. Their drugs are reaching our children. The gangs they hire kill ruthlessly to protect their turf in our cities. 
It is no exaggeration to say that the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans are literally at stake in the war against the cartels. And the State Department's refusal to face up to facts does not protect a single child from the bullets of a drug-running gang or a driveby shooter. 
Let me speak about money laundering. 
The next item of progress in the State Department's statement of explanation is that `the Mexican Congress passed two critical pieces of legislation which have armed the Government of Mexico with a whole new arsenal of weapons to use to combat money laundering, chemical diversion, and organized crime.' 
Let us see how good the new money-laundering law is. 
It is true that in May 1996, the Mexican Congress adopted a law that for the first time specifically identified money laundering as a criminal act. At that time, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz Martinez committed to develop the regulations that would implement this law by January 1997. 
The draft of these regulations, which would require banks and other institutions to report suspicious transactions of currency, were due in January. Well, it is now March and the regulations have not been forthcoming. 
No doubt, the implementation date of these regulations, now scheduled for June 1997, will slide, as will the issuance of a second set of regulations, governing the reporting of large-scale transactions. 
These regulations are essential to combating money laundering. Reporting requirements discourage would-be money launderers, tip off law enforcement officials to unlawful activity, and create a paper trail that can be a powerful investigative tool. 
But until Finance Minister Ortiz issues the regulations and they are implemented, it is business as usual. To date, not a single Mexican bank or exchange house has been forced to alter its operations. 
And until the regulations have been issued, we have no real way of evaluating the impact of the law. Any law is only as good as its implementation. It is a giant leap of faith by the State Department to cite the passage of a money-laundering law as a sign of major progress when, to date, it has been neither implemented nor enforced. 
There are some key questions that must be answered: 
Will the regulations prevent bank employees or ministry staff from tipping off drug cartels about investigations? 
Second, will the regulations provide immunity for employees who report a suspicious transaction and are acting in good faith? If not, they may be reluctant to report transactions as required, or killed if they do. 
Third, will the regulations contain exemptions for any industries? They should not. 
In addition, there is a major weakness in the new law in that it does not provide for sanctions against banks and financial institutions that fail to comply with reporting requirements. Without such sanctions, Mexico's money-laundering laws will remain woefully inadequate. 
Now, there is a report today in the Financial Times of London that Mexico will introduce its antilaundering regulations this week. We shall see. Those regulations will need to be evaluated. But why has it taken Mexico until mid-March, and a crisis over certification, to get to this point? That 
is not a sign of a fully cooperating country. 
Meanwhile, massive money laundering continues in Mexico unabated. And it is spilling across the southwest border. 
California State Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement Chief George Doane testified last March that `at a money counting and shipping house in the Los Angeles area, agents located $6 million in cash and financial records in a residence occupied by three Hispanic nationals, indicating that $75 million had been counted, packaged, and shipped from the residence via a commercial bus company to Mexico.' 
An analysis done by the DEA of all transactions between the San Antonio Federal Reserve and area depository institutions showed a currency surplus of $2.96 billion in 1995--a clear sign that cartels have successfully laundered money to their final destination in Mexico. 
The DEA's Donnie Marshall told Congress in September that a DEA investigation known as Zorro II in the Los Angeles area `resulted in the arrests of 156 people, the seizure of approximately 5,600 kilograms of cocaine, and over $17 million in U.S. currency. The majority of this $17 million was seized as it was being prepared for shipment to Mexico or seized from vehicles that were en route to Mexico.' 
Marshall also described cambios, or exchange houses outside the banking system, located along the borders of Texas and California, which are a significant factor in the laundering of drug proceeds where Mexican traffickers intermingle cash derived from drug sales with legitimate exchange business. My staff recently visited 22 of these exchange houses. 
So the State Department sees encouraging results and notable progress in the area of money laundering as well. I say that today there is no effective effort to deter the laundering of drug money anywhere in Mexico.  
CORRUPTION 
The State Department's statement of explanation sees progress even where--by its own admission--none exists. This is how the Department describes Mexico's so-called progress on combating corruption: 
In an effort to confront widespread corruption within the nation's law enforcement agencies, former Attorney General Lozano dismissed over 1,250 federal police officers and technical personnel for corruption or incompetence, although some have been rehired, and the Government of Mexico indicted two former senior Government officials and a current Undersecretary of Tourism. 
Now, the sentence, in a sense, refutes itself. When you say that some have been rehired, of course, if they were innocent, we would want them to be rehired. But if they were guilty, we would want them to be prosecuted. So let's look and see what happened. 
According to the DEA, of the 1,250 officers dismissed for corruption, not a single one was successfully prosecuted--not one. 
The rash of murders of prosecutors and law enforcement officers in Tijuana is a case in point. These assassinations have been made possible in large part because the Tijuana police have been so thoroughly corrupted by the Arellano-Felix organization. 
According to the Los Angeles Times on March 3, 1997, court papers recently filed in United States district court by the Mexican Government in an extradition case contain testimony to the effect that--and let me remind you that this is from court papers submitted by the Mexican Government--`the state attorney general and almost 90 percent of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges in Tijuana and the State of Baja California . . . are on the payroll' of the Arellano-Felix organization. 
In the same San Diego court documents, a former presidential guard, army lieutenant Gerardo Cruz Pacheco, told how he recruited soldiers to unload drug shipments and helped Tijuana cartel gunmen assassinate Baja federal police commander Ernesto Ibarra Santes in September. 
The Federal judicial police have been so corrupted by the cartels that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between them and the criminals. That is why some were encouraged by the prospect of increased participation of the Mexican military, which has not been so tainted by corruption, in the anti-drug effort. 
But that's why the startling revelation about Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the head of the National Institute to Combat Drugs--Mexico's top counternarcotics official--who is a 42-year veteran of the armed forces, has cast grave doubts upon that hope. 
When the Mexican Army planned a raid of the wedding of the sister of Amado Carrillo-Fuentes, the drug lord had been tipped off in advance, some say by General Gutierrez himself. As a result, he escaped arrest by leaving early or not attending. But Mexican troops found federal police providing protection for drug traffickers at the wedding. 
And most concering to me is that corruption is spreading rapidly across the border into the United States. For example: 
In Calexico, CA, former INS inspector Richard Felix admitted to FBI agents that he pocketed up to $500,000 in bribes for permitting loads of cocaine and marijuana to pass uninspected through his port of entry lane. 
In El Paso, former Customs and INS inspector Jose Trinidad Carrillo gave drug traffickers a price list for his help in getting drugs through his border-entry lane: $10,000 per car, or $40 per pound of marijuana and $250 per pound of cocaine. 
Stories of officials of U.S. border towns being bribed are now surfacing. Some of this I heard myself in the testimony of a border rancher to the Judiciary Committee last year. 
President Zedillo appears to be trying his best to fight drug trafficking, and he has honest people on his side, like Elvira Ruiz, one of the few female police chiefs in Baja, whose life has been consistently threatened by the cartels. 
But the efforts of these people are unfortunately being completely overwhelmed by the uncontrollable tide of corruption. 
The arrest of General Gutierrez has been cited by the administration as evidence of the Mexican Government's commitment to fight corruption. But the way in which this situation was handled raises serious questions about Mexico's willingness to cooperate with the United States. 
On February 6 of this year, Defense Secretary Enrique Cervantes Aguirre confronted General Gutierrez, asking him to explain how he came to live in an apartment that was beyond the means of his salary. The general began suffering a heart attack and was placed in the hospital. After 12 days of investigating, on February 18, Defense Secretary Cervantes had Gutierrez placed under arrest for accepting bribes from the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel. 
Yet during that entire 12-day period, the Mexican Government gave no indication to the United States that it suspected that its top drug official was corrupt. In that time, U.S. officials continued regular contacts with Gutierrez' National Institute to Combat Drugs, not knowing that its operations were directed by a man in the pocket of drug kingpins. 
General Gutierrez had been in Washington shortly before he was first questioned about his spending habits. He met with our drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who called him a man of absolute, unquestioned integrity. Why would Mexico allow Gutierrez to visit Washington when he was suspected of corruption, and why--at the least--would they not alert the United States side? 
Our own drug enforcement officials have been forced to conduct damage assessments to determine how much and what kind of intelligence was provided to the general, and perhaps passed right onto the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes. We are left to worry that the lives of our agents in the field and our informants have been placed in jeopardy. 
So we can praise the Mexican Government for arresting Gutierrez, but their delay in notifying the United States of their suspicions about the general begs an important question: Is this a sign of the full cooperation for which Mexico has just been certified?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. T.J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union which represents nearly 5,000 Border Patrol agents, told my staff on March 4, 1997: 
The level of trust for Mexican authorities is almost non-existent. He said that `the lack of cooperation includes failure to provide assistance, aiding and abetting criminal activity, and even acts of aggression against Border Patrol Agents.' He described U.S. agents observing Mexican officers who were clearly escorting aliens and drug smugglers. 
The police chief of El Centro, CA, Harold Carter, told my staff that his officers are very leery of who they can trust in Mexico. 
These are the views of our law enforcement officers. But the question of whether Mexico is fully cooperating with the United States can also be easily answered by looking at Mexico's policies on working with DEA agents. In this area, there have been three significant failings. 
One was the failure of the Mexican Government--the same one that has just been certified as fully cooperating--to adequately fund and staff the binational border task forces that had been agreed upon by the high level contact group. 
What good are high-level meetings that produce agreements on cooperation if one side then fails to live up to its end of the agreement? 
Second, Mexico has hampered the ability of the United States military to contribute to interdiction efforts. Mexico refuses to allow United States Navy ships on patrol for drug smugglers in the Pacific to put into Mexican ports to refuel without 30 days notice--and without paying cash. As the cartels increasingly turn to sea-routes to smuggle their drugs, this policy seriously hampers our ability to stop them. 
Also, overflights by U.S. reconnaissance aircraft are still under negotiation. These flights would enhance the ability of both sides to find and disrupt drug shipments. 
The third major failing has been Mexico's refusal to allow United States drug enforcement agents to carry sidearms to protect themselves while on the Mexican side of the border. As a result, Mr. Constantine had no choice but to suspend operations in which DEA agents cross the border, because they cannot protect themselves. 
In the last several days, there has been a flurry of meetings between American and Mexican officials. Did the United States gain any concessions? Well, Mexican officials were quoted as saying that `the rules have stayed exactly where they are'--which means no sidearms. There you have it. Full cooperation.  
EXTRADITIONS 
The State Department's statement of explanation makes another astonishing claim on the subject of extraditions. It says: 
The Government of Mexico established the important precedent of extraditing Mexican nationals to the United States under the provision of Mexico's extradition law permitting this in `exceptional circumstances.' 
Here is my understanding of the actual facts: 
First, Mexico says it has changed its policy to allow the extradition of Mexican nationals to the United States. Of course, we are talking about Mexican nationals who are wanted for crimes committed here in the United States. 
Second, to my knowledge, the Mexican government has sent three Mexican nationals to the United States. One was Juan Garcia Abrego, head of the gulf cartel, but he was expelled, not extradited, because he held American as well as Mexican citizenship. The other two were for murder and sexual abuse, not for drug charges. 
Third, to date, Mexico has never--never--extradited a single Mexican national to the United States on drug-related charges. That, I believe, is a fact. 
Now the Mexican Government says, and the State Department apparently believes, that Mexico is prepared to extradite Mexican nationals on drug charges in `special circumstances.' 
If this is truly a change of policy on the part of Mexico, let us see results. There are 52 outstanding extradition requests for Mexican nationals wanted on drug charges. Mexico should honor these requests now. 
It should be pointed out that these extradition requests are for crimes committed in this country. How can a good friend, ally, and neighbor deny extradition of 52 people wanted for drug-related crimes committed here, and the statement still be made that they are fully cooperating in our antidrug efforts? 
A good place for Mexico to start would be with Francisco Arellano-Felix of the Tijuana cartel, who is currently in custody in a Mexican prison and wanted on narcotics charges here in the United States. Another good start would be Miguel Caro Quintero, who walks the streets of Sonora without fear of arrest and grants interviews with the Washington Post. He has four indictments pending against him in the United States. 
Mexican nationals wanted on drug charges is clearly the highest priority. These include many of the drug kingpins. But there are other sensitive cases as well that need to be resolved. 
John Riley Henrique was indicted by a Federal grand jury in the eastern district of California for trafficking at least 150 kilograms of cocaine from Mexico to the United States. Henrique, an American citizen, is thought to be connected with Miguel Angel Felix Guillardo, the mastermind of the 1985 murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena. 
Law enforcement sources told my office that John Riley Henrique was detained by Mexican law enforcement and then suddenly released without warning. He is still believed to be in Mexico. The Mexican authorities should find him, apprehend him, and extradite him. 
T.J. Bonner of the National Border Patrol Council testified before the Senate Banking Committee on March 28, 1996, about the tragic fatal shooting on January 19, 1996, of a Border Patrol agent, our agent, Jefferson Barr. Agent Barr was killed while intercepting a group of marijuana smugglers along the border near Eagle Pass, TX. 
Before he died, Agent Barr wounded one of his assailants. The FBI interviewed the suspect, a Mexican national, in a Mexican hospital, and the United States later charged him with murder and sought his extradition. The Government of Mexico sentenced the individual to 10 years in prison on a narcotics-related charge but has refused to extradite him. 
For the State Department to say that Mexico is fully cooperating on the issue of extraditions under these circumstances dishonors the memory of Agent Jefferson Barr. 
America's law enforcement officers know how serious the problem is. I would like to quote from a March 2, 1997, press release put out by the National Border Patrol Council, local 1613, of San Diego. It reads: 
The certification of Mexico is a clear blow to the efforts of U.S. Border Patrol agents in their daily efforts at thwarting the massive amounts of illegal drugs entering the country every day. Additionally, this certification is a disgrace to the memory of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Jefferson Barr.

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last year we approved the most comprehensive welfare reform this Nation has ever known. Because the changes were so comprehensive, this body approved the bill with much reservation, particularly on the provision for the elderly and disabled legal immigrants. 
Today, I correct one of the major challenges left over from the welfare reform last year that if uncorrected, will have a devastating impact on the States and counties by shifting the cost of caring for the seriously ill and destitute disabled and elderly legal immigrants who have absolutely no other means of support. 
I am here to offer the Elderly and Disabled Legal Immigrant Support Act with Senator Boxer as the cosponsor in the Senate, and Congressman Campbell and Congresswoman Lofgren as sponsors in the House of Representatives. 
The Elderly and Disabled Legal Immigrant Support Act of 1997 would exempt from the current ban on SSI, those elderly, disabled and/or blind legal immigrants, who came to this country prior to passage of the welfare bill--August 22, 1996, who can demonstrate that they have no family and have no other source of support. This legislation prohibits SSI for all legal immigrants coming to this country following the date of enactment of the welfare reform bill, 
August 22, 1996. 
This legislation corrects what I believe is a grave mistake in the Federal welfare reform law--a blanket denial of SSI to all legal noncitizens, no matter how elderly, disabled, destitute and ill they may be. 
Over 20 California county supervisors, both Republican and Democrat, have spoken out, in one voice, that the legal immigrant provisions of the welfare law will be disastrous for California counties and this legislation is critical for the Counties and for the country. 
In California alone, 200,000 to 326,000 people may lose SSI by August 22, 1997. 
Los Angeles County estimates that eliminating benefits for 93,000 legal immigrants in its county could cost up to $236 million a year. 
San Francisco estimates that 20,000 legal noncitizens may turn to the county's general assistance program, at a total cost of up to $74 million. 
Many top immigrant States and counties will also bear the burden of caring for the elderly, disabled, and blind legal immigrants who are banned from SSI. 
New York--126,860 legal immigrants may lose their SSI, costing the State approximately $240 million annually. 
Florida--77,920 legal immigrants may lose their SSI, costing the State approximately $300 million annually. 
Texas--59,160 legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
Illinois--25,960 legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
New Jersey--25,500 legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
Massachusetts--25,140 legal immigrants may lose their SSI. 
The Republican Governors who supported the welfare reform bill now realize that the new law, as written, will result in a huge financial cost-shift to their states. 
President Clinton has also recognized that legal immigrants who become disabled after entry should not be banned from SSI and food stamps and has allocated $13.7 billion in the 1998 budget for this population who have nowhere else to turn. 
As we speak, 125,000 SSI cancellation notices are going out to elderly, disabled, and blind legal immigrants every week. Many elderly and disabled legal immigrants have absolutely no family or friends to turn to for support and will be destitute. They have no one to turn to, except county relief programs or, at worst, homeless shelters. Effective August 22 of this year, all legal immigrants currently receiving SSI will be cut from the rolls regardless of their circumstances. 
I know that prior to welfare reform, the door was open for sponsors to bring in their parents and then neglect to support them or, if they are unable to support them, to know that legal immigrants were eligible for SSI. The number of noncitizens collecting SSI had increased by 477 percent in the 14 years from 1980 to 1994, while for citizens the numbers increased by 33 percent during the same period. Clearly, one can extrapolate from these statistics that legal immigrants were using SSI at 15 times the rate of citizens. 
I hold the sponsors accountable for the support of legal immigrants they bring into the country who they have pledged to support. But the Federal welfare reform banning SSI for virtually all legal immigrants--even those whose sponsors cannot afford to support them, or those refugees who have no sponsors at all--will create extreme hardship for those elderly, blind, and disabled legal immigrants who are unable to support themselves. 
Let me tell you the story about a 73-year-old legal immigrant in San Francisco on SSI. She was welcomed to this county from Vietnam in 1980. She was a refugee from Communism with no family in the United States. She speaks no English and she is suffering from kidney failure. She requires dialysis three times a week. Under this new law, this 73-year-old woman will lose SSI, her only source of support. Her well-being will become the responsibility of the county. 
I urge my colleagues to seriously consider and support this limited exemption from the current ban on SSI by allowing those elderly, blind, or disabled individuals, who were in the country prior to August 22, 1996, and who have no other means of support, to continue on SSI. The ban on SSI would apply to those coming into the country after August 22, 1996.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Georgia. I am pleased to join with him in this joint resolution, disapproving the certification of Mexico. 
Mr. President, my disappointment in the administration's decision to certify Mexico's antidrug efforts last week, I think, was known to all. I believe that decision was a mistake, and I said so. 
The decision to certify Mexico in the face of what I consider to be an overwhelming lack of cooperation undermines the integrity of the certification process itself, as well as damaging the credibility of the United States in our dealings with other countries with whom we seek cooperation. 
I rise today to join with the Senator from Georgia and a number of my colleagues in introducing this resolution. But I do so with some regret. I regret the need for the resolution for two reasons. First, Mexico is a neighbor, a friend, and an ally of our country. Second, I very much regret the need to disagree with my President on this issue. I believe he made what he believes to be the right decision, but I respectfully disagree with him. 
Our intention is clear: We believe that the evidence overwhelmingly supports decertification of Mexico, and then if the President sees fit, invoking a vital national interest waiver. For that reason, Senator Coverdell has introduced a second resolution that allows the President to waive the sanctions on grounds of vital national interest after we enact our resolution of disapproval. 
Last week, a bipartisan group of 39 Senators sent a letter to the President urging that this be his decision.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act requires the President to certify that Mexico has cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on its own to combat drug trafficking. It's just not tenable to claim that Colombia did not meet that standard, but Mexico did. Let me read one sentence from the decertification of Colombia in 1996. It reads: 
Critical to the U.S. judgment that the Government of Colombia did not fully cooperate on counternarcotics in 1995 is the assessment that corruption remains pervasive, despite the efforts of some dedicated Colombians to root it out. 
That is no different from the situation in Mexico today. There are dedicated efforts in Mexico, but the corruption is pervasive. 
I think the events of last week are an example in point. 
Just hours before the President's decision on certification of Mexico was to be announced, Mexican officials were touting the arrest of a reputed cartel leader, Humberto Garcia Abrego, brother of Juan Garcia Abrego, who was expelled from Mexico during last year's certification process. 
Then, just a few hours after the decision to certify was announced, guess what? Garcia Abrego simply walked away from Mexican custody a free man. The Mexican Attorney General's office claimed responsibility for setting him free. His release was `inexplicable,' they said. 
Mr. President, this is just one example of the kind of cooperation the United States has received. It has tightened up just before certification and then, just after certification, it's business as usual. 
With 70 percent of the cocaine, a quarter of the heroin, 80 percent of the marijuana, and 90 percent of the ephedrine used to make methamphetamine entering the United States from our southern border, Mexico's drug problem is America's drug problem, and the problem is getting worse, not better. 
Last year at this time, Senator D'Amato and I compiled a list of actions we considered necessary for the Mexican Government to take in order to show progress on their antidrug efforts. Regrettably, I believe the evidence shows there has been little or no progress on nearly all of the items on this 
list. 
Some of these failures are due to inability; others are due simply to a lack of political will. 
For example, some questions: Has Mexico extradited one Mexican national on outstanding drug charges? The answer is no. I was puzzled because the Secretary of State, in her statement on certification, made this statement: `Mexico has set a precedent by extraditing its own nationals.' One might conclude that this includes Mexicans wanted on drug charges. Yet, to the contrary, both the Department of Justice and the DEA tell me that not a single Mexican national has been extradited to this country on drug-related charges. 
If the State Department has information that Mexican nationals are being extradited on drug-related charges--and there are 52 of them on the extradition list--I ask them now to make that list public. Tell us which Mexican nationals have been extradited on drug-related charges. 
Francisco Arellano-Felix of the notorious Tijuana cartel is currently in custody in a Mexican prison and wanted on narcotics charges here in the United States. I say to Mexico, why not show good faith and extradite him? 
Mexican authorities tell us that there has been an agreement in principle on extraditing Mexican nationals, but there has been no change in their actions. 
Question 2: Has Mexico implemented new laws aimed at curbing the rampant laundering of drug money? No. 
Nearly a year ago, the Mexican Parliament passed criminal money laundering laws. But the new laws are a far cry from the stronger legislative action sought by U.S. officials. The new laws do not even require banks to report large or suspicious currency transactions. Promises to enact such regulations have, so far, gone unfulfilled. 
To my knowledge, not one money exchange house in Mexico has changed its operations. 
Have Mexican authorities significantly increased their seizure rate of cocaine or their arrest of drug traffickers? Let's take a look at it. 
The answer to that clearly is no. Cocaine seizures by Mexico, which increased slightly last year, are barely half of what was seized in 1993. 
Here are seizures in 1993--46.2 tons. Here they are in 1995--22.2 tons. And they are just slightly above that in 1996. Actually, instead of 22.2 tons, in 1996 they are 23.5. 
So that is the record. It has been effectively downhill, and then a straight line, and a small little jog up. 
Let's take a look at drug-related arrests in Mexico. Drug-related arrests last year are less than half of what they were in 1992. Here are the figures. In 1992, 27,369; down in 1993; down in 1994; and way down in 1995, all the way to 9,700. We don't have 1996 on this chart yet, but the 1996 figures are 11,245. That is a startling drop since 1992. 
So here is a country being certified as fully cooperative, and drug seizures have gone down and drug arrests have gone down in the last 3 years. 
One has to ask then: What is `full cooperation"?

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is correct. I thank him very much for that comment because he is absolutely right. The jog up is so small when you compare it with the drop which is so steep and pronounced. So I thank the Senator very much. 
It leads me to the conclusion that the situation with Mexico has never been worse. DEA has suspended American agents going into Mexico because, just last month, Mexico forbade United States drug agents from carrying weapons on the Mexican side of the border. 
I understand that there may be some agreement again to enable our agents to be armed, and then they will go in again. However, it should be pointed out that death threats against our agents are up. 
I would like to ask that all Members, if they would be willing, to simply read the testimony provided by Thomas Constantine, Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal Justice Subcommittee, last week. It was played about three times on C-SPAN over the weekend. I heard it. I also read the remarks. And the remarks are really very, very profound. 
In this report, Mr. Constantine points out again: 
Since 1993, 23 major drug-related assassinations have taken place in Mexico. Virtually all of these murders remain unsolved. Many of them have occurred in Tijuana, or have involved victims from Tijuana in the last year. Twelve law enforcement officers, or former officials, have been gunned down in Tijuana, and the vast majority of the 200 murders in that city are believed to have been drug related. 
The Administrator also points out that of the 1,200 firings 
firings of Government officials for corruption made by President Zedillo, no successful prosecutions of these individuals have ever taken place. So of the 1,200 Government officials fired for corruption, there has not been a single successful prosecution. 
The arrest last month of Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo brings, I think, the level of drug-influenced corruption in Mexico into some glaring relief. It is frightening. But, as I have pointed out, it is just the tip of the iceberg. 
In September, a federal police commander, Ernesto Ibarra, who had vowed to take down the Tijuana cartel, was murdered, and some of the assailants were his own officers. 
That should tell us a great deal about the level of corruption. 
The celebrated army raid of a wedding last month of the sister of Amado Carillo-Fuentes, Mexico's most powerful cartel leader, seems to be an elaborate charade. The raid, which was organized by General Gutierrez, who we now know was on the Carillo-Fuentes payroll and the target of the raid, was tipped off in advance and either never did come to the wedding or escaped. Federal police were found to be protecting the drug traffickers at that wedding. The federal police were protecting drug traffickers. I find that just amazing. 
As former DEA Administrator Robert Bonner said, `It would be hard for anyone to say with a straight face that the Mexican Government is taking effective action against the major drug traffickers at this juncture.' 
Yet, they were just certified as so doing. 
The purpose of section 490 was not to deliver merit badges to nations whose leaders have good intentions. The world is filled with leaders who have good intentions. The act was designed to measure uniformly the actions taken by countries to assist the United States in antidrug efforts. 
Colombia was decertified last year and again this year because their efforts were ineffectual. 
How Mexico cannot be held to the same standards I have a hard time understanding. To certify Mexico in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary undercuts the certification process. 
So I ask all of my colleagues to join the distinguished Senator from Georgia and myself in voting to disapprove the President's decision on certification of Mexico but to allow him, if he sees fit, to enact a national-interest waiver. 
Then we should work with the President to devise conditions under which Mexico would be eligible for recertification.

<TEXT>
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the amendment I have just sent to the desk essentially differs from the Senate Joint Resolution 1, the majority balanced budget amendment, in just four ways. I would like to quickly summarize the distinctions and then go over each one of them and explain why I believe this amendment will stand the test of scrutiny. This substitute approach, in my view, represents how we need to address the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, we have just had quite a bit of debate on the Reid amendment. The arguments have been made as to why the Social Security trust funds, should be removed from the unified budget. This amendment would allow Social Security trust funds to continue to remain as part of the unified budget up to the point Congress achieves balance, which has been estimated at 2002. The administration and Congress have both indicated a commitment to balancing the budget by 2002. This amendment respects that goal. 
The amendment would require that 1 year after enactment, whenever the amendment is ratified by three-quarters of the legislatures of the States, the amendment would go into effect and be binding. If the amendment becomes effective in 2002, the year in which bipartisan consensus exists for balancing the budget, the year in which Social Security would be excluded would be 2003. This provides an opportunity to transition away from our current reliance on the Social Security trust funds to offset deficit spending in other areas and reach balance under a balanced budget amendment. 
As Senator Hatch will recall, last year when the amendment was on the floor, we held some negotiations to try to reach agreement. Many of us feel very strongly that Social Security should not be part of balancing the budget. We had some negotiations to review whether we might agree to a balanced budget, that excluded the Social Security trust funds, by the year 2008. The majority did not support the approach and the response to the offer was that it is too difficult to balance the budget if you withdraw Social Security trust funds from the unified budget. I have given that considerable thinking and believe that if we use it up to the point of balance, and then separate it out, that gives time to adjust to this withdrawal of Social Security. My amendment prohibits the use of the Social Security trust funds after Congress has reached balance and would prohibit the use of the trust funds thereafter. 
My amendment's second point would retain restrictions on lifting the debt limit. However, it would require a majority vote, rather than a three-fifths vote, as the majority balanced budget amendment provides. 
The third point of the amendment would permit Congress to respond to serious economic emergencies or major national disasters. Without that, a bailout for a California earthquake would have to be paid for within the confines of balanced outlays and expenditures. A savings and loan bailout would have to be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget, balancing revenue and expenditures. This balance, if the Nation faced an economic emergency or major natural disaster, would be much more difficult to achieve in the outyears. 
Fourth, this amendment would clarify that passage of the amendment would not prohibit Congress from developing a capital 
budget. It does not mandate a capital budget, but as has been made clear by Senator Torricelli and others, the majority amendment would essentially prevent the Federal Government of the United States of America from ever developing a capital budget. A capital budget has been a useful budget structure for many of the States, as you know from experience, Mr. President, and many of the cities, as I know. These cities and States have capital budgets separate and distinct from their operating budgets. They fund these capital budgets for physical assets, like buildings, bridges, and highways, in a multiyear funding mechanism. This structure could make sense for the Federal Government as well, and we should not close the door on this option. Unfortunately, the majority balanced budget amendment does precisely that. 
So these are the four points of difference. I would like to elaborate on these concerns. 
Let me just tell you why I feel so strongly about Social Security. To begin with, Social Security is already separate and discreet. Every worker, workers in your family and in my family, have 6.2 percent of their paycheck deducted every month for FICA taxes. This is matched by 6.2 percent from every employer in the country for a total of 12.4 percent FICA contribution. Workers are told that this money goes into a trust fund to be used for their retirement, invested by the Federal Government, so it will be there when they retire for their Social Security benefits. 
This I view as a solemn pledge. The workers are never told that the 12.4 percent FICA contribution is actually part of the unified budget. They are never told their payments, in fact, support the purchase of a battleship, or the payment of a lawyer's salary, or the payment of a clerk's salary, or the building of a highway or for any other activity of our Government's general operations. 
Now, this is also wrong because of the looming retirement of the baby boom generation. Analysts concluded Congress needed to increase FICA taxes a while back to be able to provide for the retirement of our large baby boom generation. Well, the taxes were increased, but, again, the funds are part of the unified budget and they support a battleship, a lawyer, a clerk, recreation programs, and so on and so forth. 
I think that is wrong. I also think the Congress recognized it was wrong when this House, virtually unanimously, enacted the Hollings resolution in 1990. As you know, the Hollings resolution said, henceforth, we will not include Social Security as part of the unified budget. 
The majority amendment essentially enshrines in the Constitution, for all time, the use of Social Security trust funds as part of the unified budget. The funds will be used to pay for every soldier, every battleship, every highway, every clerk, and every park employee of the Federal Government. 
I think this is wrong. I think it is wrong morally, I think it is wrong ethically, and I think if it were ever tested, it would be found to be wrong legally, as well. But we have been using the Social Security trust funds and we are in a budget hole as a result. It is really a catch-22 situation. The only way out is to amend this majority balanced budget amendment, and this is what I propose to do. 
Now, let me give you some idea of the challenge Social Security faces. This chart represents the Social Security trust funds, between 1996 and 2002. According to the Social Security Administration data, we use approximately $570 billion of these surplus trust funds to balance the budget. Between 2002 and 2019 we use $1.8 trillion of Social Security trust funds part of the unified budget. My amendment represents a compromise, if you will. The amendment recognizes how difficult it is to balance the Federal budget without the Social Security trust funds. We will only use the $570 billion up to 2002, and after 2002, these funds will be separated out from the unified budget. These Social Security receipts will remain in a separate and discreet trust fund. They will not be used to pay for a battleship or a soldier or a clerk's salary or a lawyer's salary or anything else. That is $1.8 trillion that will essentially be saved to pay for retirements. This restriction makes the task of shoring up the long-term solvency of Social Security, which the majority balanced budget makes more difficult, a lot easier to achieve. 
As a former mayor, I know that one of the things you do to really assess spending at any government level is look at outlays. Outlays are dollars the government actually spends. If you look at outlays, you will see in 1995, more than 50 percent of all of the money spent by the Federal Government was essentially spent for entitlements, like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and welfare, 
and 14 percent was dedicated to pay interest on the debt. Interest, which buys nothing, has doubled since 1969. Therefore, if you do nothing by the year 2003, almost 75 percent of all of the outlays of the Federal Government are effectively Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, welfare, and interest on the debt. The spending trends are what really motivates me, and I hope others, to accept a constitutional balanced budget amendment. 
These spending priorities will run into each other and it becomes more difficult to balance the budget under any balanced budget amendment. One has to understand what we are going to protect. I think Social Security is critically important to protect for a number of reasons. 
If we look at the funding patterns for Social Security, Social Security revenue, payroll taxes and interest that has built up a surplus, begins to drop around 2019. As soon as these funds begin to drop, Social Security outlays begin to exceed our Social Security revenue. Under the majority balanced budget amendment, total expenditures and the outlays meet. When outlays exceed our revenue, Congress either has to increase taxes, cut Social Security payments or cut other programs or in some way find revenues so that those outlays and expenditures match. This is the significance of the Congressional Research Service memo that has been discussed by several Senators. So as it goes straight down, every year you have to either make deeper cuts, in Social Security or somewhere else, or you have to increase taxes just to pay these Social Security checks. 
Now, is this fair? Is this what we want to do? Is it fair in these outyears to place Social Security recipients so deeply at risk? I have come to the conclusion that it is not fair, that it is not the right thing to do. Therefore, my amendment would permit the use of the Social Security trust funds up to 2002 and remove it from the unified budget thereafter. 
Critics suggest this amendment creates a big problem in the year 2003. However, this amendment would also provide the ability to develop a capital budget. Our Nation has significant capital needs, yet we are underinvesting in this important area. In 1965, the United States invested 6.3 percent of its budget in infrastructure spending. We built the Nation's highways, we built bridges, we built other major projects which benefit this Nation. This is not a nation whose population is going down. It is a nation whose population is increasing and a growing population has infrastructure needs. However, by 1992, our investment in capital infrastructure declined to 3 percent of the budget. When push comes to shove, Congress reduces capital spending, dropping those things that enable us to provide a decent quality of life for our citizens, such as the ability to get to a job without gridlock or the ability to travel over a bridge on a Federal highway that is not going to fall down. Our infrastructure has been decaying and it needs adequate funding. 
More than one-third of the major highways of the United States, representing one-quarter of a million miles, are in poor or mediocre condition and need to be repaired. Approximately 25 percent of our 570,000 highway bridges are described as structurally deficient, or functionally obsolete. What does this say? We are becoming capital poor in infrastructure. 
Those of us that have been Governors and mayors know that one of the prime responsibilities of government is infrastructure, something that is not very sexy for the public. Our responsibilities are the streets, keeping potholes off of streets, keeping bridges and roads in good repair and minimizing the risk of accidents for people. I contend we cannot do that under the restrictions of this balanced budget, unless, at some point in the future, Congress has the ability to enact a capital budget and to fund long-term capital improvements on a multiyear basis rather than in cash up front as is done now. 
If you take 2 percent of GDP as your measure of investment, it would be about $160 billion right now. Congress could create a limit based on a percentage of GDP. I think we spend about $140 billion now. So if you wanted to ratchet it up, to permit a higher level of investment, you would simply set a limit at a higher percent of GDP. 
The limit would operate similar to a kind of bond limit, as we use in States. The Government would have a certain bonding capacity and you would stay within the limit of that bonding capacity, which would reflect our economic strength, interest payments, and payback schedule and similar factors. 
I think it makes tremendous sense. I think that without providing for a capital budget, we undermine our Nation's ability to do and carry out one of the most important responsibilities of a Federal Government, the providing of safe and adequate Federal infrastructure for the future of our people. 
Now, let me speak about the economic emergency. The majority amendment does not provide for an economic emergency. In an economic emergency, it is important that the automatic stabilizers be able to function. It is important that we be able to respond to extreme and serious national emergencies, whether this be a major depression or, I might say, a savings and loan crisis, that develops in the future, or another crisis. Congress was forced to spend an additional $135 billion to clean up the fiscal mess of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980's and 1990's. These costs weren't anticipated and they weren't projected. Yet, we had to honor the United States' commitment to protect depositors. 
If Senate Joint Resolution 1 were in place, Congress would have been forced to cut the budget by $66 billion in 1991, to meet its savings and loan bailout obligations in that year, by cutting education, cutting highways, cutting crime fighting and other priorities in order to pay off depositors. Now, is that really the situation we want to place ourselves in for, not just 10 or 15 years, but in perpetuity, forever and ever and ever? 
If you asked me in the 1960's or 1970's, would I ever think that these savings and loans would default, the answer would have been no. But the fact of the matter is that they did. The fact of the matter is that the cost to the Federal Government was $135 billion, and in 1991 this Congress ponied up $66 billion. Now, that is $66 billion that would be pitted against the purchase of a new battleship or soldiers' salaries or their cost-of-living raise, or a clerk in the Agriculture Department, or a lawyer in the Justice Department. That is the inescapable truth of budgeting. 
Therefore, the majority amendment prohibition on the development of a capital budget, even if this or a future Congress believes it would be necessary or prudent or wise to enact one, I think, is a major error. Consequently, my amendment would permit Congress to develop a capital budget in the future. 
Now, let me briefly address extending the debt limit. A three-fifths vote in Government is something you do when you really want the minority to control the process. We are a representative democracy. We represent the people, and the bulk of votes in a representative democracy are a majority. The majority speaks. All of you down there, Mr. and Mrs. America, how many of you favor 
more police on your streets? The hands go up. A majority. How many favor more firefighters? Hands go up. A majority. We reflect those views when we come back to the Congress. We generally know what the majority believes. It is very hard to know what a minority really believes, and this gives inordinate power to a minority. 
People often argue it is easy to receive a majority vote. That is wrong and let me try to show you how wrong it is. Since 1990, no budget resolution or conference report has received a three-fifths majority. Since 1990, no vote to raise the debt limit has received a three-fifths majority. 
In 1985, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law was adopted in the Senate by a vote of 51 to 37. 
The 1990 budget reconciliation bill was passed with a budget vote of 54 to 45. 
The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act was passed with a vote of 51 to 50. 
The 1995 budget reconciliation bill was adopted on a vote of 52 to 47. 
The 1995 temporary debt limit increase was adopted on a vote of 49 to 47. 
If that doesn't demonstrate that majority votes even are tough to get, I don't know what does. 
Now, the issue here is, what happens if the debt limit isn't extended, and what happens if we permit 41 people to make that determination? Well, we just saw that. The Government shuts down. We default on our obligations. The full faith and credit is cast in doubt. 
I think it is a huge mistake to put forward a balanced budget amendment that would permit a minority in Congress to hold the Government hostage, shut it down, bring it to the brink of default, risk the loss of our full faith and credit, and the respect that goes with it. This gives 41 Senators and 179 House Members the power to hold this Nation's credit hostage during budgetary disagreements. So I think it is a big, big mistake. 
In closing, I am pleased to submit this amendment on behalf of Senators Torricelli, Durbin, and Cleland. 
Essentially, this amendment keeps Social Security as part of the unified budget up to the point we reach balance. As I mentioned, approximately $570 billion will be taken from the trust funds and used to balance the budget by 2002. The amendment separates Social Security out at the point of balance and is able to retain $1.8 trillion of Social Security trust funds outside of the unified budget for the future. This means Social Security will remain financially viable much longer. 
Social Security is critical for many recipients. Fourteen percent of people on Social Security today are totally dependent on it. Social Security prevents abut 57 percent of beneficiaries from falling into poverty. It is important to protect it. It is the one Government program, beyond all others, that guarantees that people in their golden years will have an opportunity for a decent quality of life. 
Second, this amendment provides for a national economic emergency. I have spoken about the savings and loan bailout, an unpredictable event, which cost the Treasury $135 billion, a $66 billion appropriation in 1991, alone. Emergencies occur and will need congressional attention. The majority amendment will undermine our ability to address emergency needs. 
Third, this amendment does not mandate a capital budget, but it would say that the Constitution does not prohibit the development of a capital budget if a majority of the Congress desires to develop and implement one. 
Fourth, this amendment would change the restrictions on extending the debt limit from three-fifths to a majority vote. I am a member of the Judiciary Committee and attended the hearings and listened to the testimony. I sincerely believe, that my amendment is a balanced budget amendment that will stand the test of time and has an opportunity to be ratified by three-fourths of the State. The Senate should adopt this amendment. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor for the moment.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to answer that question. I want to read my amendment's specific language. The language does not talk about any specific capital budget plan. All the language says is `Nothing in this article shall preclude the authority to enact and implement a separate capital budget for those major capital improvements which require multi-year funding and which would be excluded from the requirements of section 7.' That is the requirement that outlays and expenditures balance. 
I will tell the Senator what I would develop a capital budget. I would set a basic amount of capital. Whether that amount would be anything above $5 million, $10 million, $15 million, or $20 million would be up to the Congress. But you set the basic amount for major capital purchases, for bridges, office buildings, or a battleship, whatever you want that to be. Also, because you float debt to be able to fund these items, you would also set a debt limit. That would most likely be a percentage of our Gross Domestic Product. For example, 2 percent of GDP would provide about $160 billion, 3 percent would be more, and so on. 
As I mentioned, we have dramatically dropped our infrastructure spending. It was 6 percent of the budget in the 1960's. It is now down to 3 percent of the budget.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. I respectfully direct the Senator to the amendment. It simply says, `Enact and implement a separate capital budget.' 
With every constitutional amendment, as the Senator well knows, the Congress would enact enabling legislation. The Congress would sit down and develop a capital budget if one was desired. My amendment does not mandate one, but if they felt that a capital budget was worthy and desirable and needed by this Nation, they would sit down and discuss the legal parameters and develop the legislation. 
All this does is permit it. That is all.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No, I disagree. Under the majority amendment it could not be done because, in the majority balanced budget amendment expenditures must equal outlays in every year. Therefore, you could not provide multi-year financing of major capital projects by floating debt. You have to meet the 
expenditures. Every opinion we have had says that the development of a capital budget would be prohibited.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much. Perhaps one way of answering this would be to place in the Record a letter sent to Senator Daschle by the Secretary of the Treasury on February 3. Let me simply read one sentence. Referring to the majority amendment, the Secretary writes:  
The amendment as drafted does not distinguish between capital investment and current spending. Outlays are defined as `all outlays in the United States except for those for repayment of debt principal.' Even if Congress were to create a separate capital budget by statute, outlays from that budget would still be `outlays of the United States.' Under the majority amendment, a capital budget would be prohibited.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It does permit a separate capital budget for major capital improvements. I believe it would be foolish to put strictures in the Constitution of the United States. It seems to me that the Constitution of the United States should provide general concepts, and the specifics of those concepts should be worked out by the Congress of the United States.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, let me try and sum up what I have presented here, and then speak specifically in answer to some of the concerns of the opposition. 
Essentially, the amendment that I have on the floor differs from the majority amendment in four ways. 
The first and most important way this amendment differs is that it continues to use Social Security trust funds as part of the unified budget up to the point where we reach balance. According to Social Security Administration data, that represents about $570 billion, cumulatively, of Social Security trust funds that would be used to offset other spending by 2002. For 1996, we used about $77 billion of the surplus. 
Once Congress balances the budget, we would remove Social Security trust funds from the unified budget. That would essentially save for Social Security recipients a cumulative total of about $1.8 trillion and, therefore, maintain the integrity of the Social Security system. 
Additionally, unlike the majority amendment, it would not enshrine in the Constitution that Social Security is part of the unified budget forever, which, reneges on a major commitment to senior citizens in our country. 
As I pointed out earlier, Social Security is not funded from the income tax. Its revenue is not supposed to go into general operations of the Government. Social Security is funded from a specific FICA payroll tax. A worker pays 6.2 percent, matched by the employer who pays 6.2 percent. The 12.4 percent is supposed to go into a separate trust fund held for the retirement of workers. Social Security taxes have one purpose and one purpose only. That purpose is to provide a safety net for our Nation's seniors with supplemental income when they retire. 
Social Security deserves its unique treatment. Social Security is our largest single Federal program. It has more than 43 million beneficiaries, with 1996 spending of $350 billion. Additionally, Social Security plays a critical role in reducing poverty among seniors. Without Social Security, the poverty rate of the elderly would be 53 percent rather than the current 14 percent. For 38 percent of all retirees, Social Security is the difference between poverty and no poverty. If those statistics do not speak eloquently for the need to keep Social Security intact, I do not know what does. 
So this amendment, with regard to the point of Social Security, is a compromise. We meet the majority's concern that if we take Social Security trust funds out of the unified budget right now, it is too difficult to balance the budget. My amendment would continue to use the trust funds up to the point of balance and then separate them out after that. The practice of using Social Security trust funds to offset other spending is not enshrined in the Constitution forever and ever as a way of doing business. 
Second, we provide in this amendment for a serious economic emergency and for major natural disasters. I can tell this body that the probability of a major earthquake in Southern California, according to seismic experts, has gone up. If that should happen--I should say when that happens--the State's disaster needs are going to be tremendous. Passing the majority's balanced budget amendment tells California that the Federal Government will have no way of meeting these disaster needs. This is a critical difference. 
Let me speak about other economic emergencies. Earlier, I mentioned the savings and loan bailout. I was not here for the savings and loan bailout. I do not know how many Members of this body or the other body actually predicted it, but I never would have thought it would have happened. The total costs were $135 billion of taxpayer's moneys to maintain the full faith and credit of the Federal Government's guarantee to depositors. In 1 year alone, 1991, the cost to the Treasury was $66 billion. 
I would really be concerned about providing for an economic emergency. Last month, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report, citing the sensitivity of the budget deficit to the economy. They indicated this: 
If economic growth was one-half percent lower, it would increase the deficit by $50 billion in FY 2002. And these effects would continue to grow over time. 
So you see, this kind of even economic change impacts the deficit tremendously. 
If the economy fell into recession and growth were five-tenths of a percent below its forecast, a budget thought to be in balance, would develop a $50 billion deficit or higher. Under Senate Joint Resolution 1, the budget deficit would need to be eliminated in that fiscal year. 
As you can see, even a drop of five-tenths of a percent in the economy would create an additional $50 billion shortfall in the estimates of that fiscal year which Congress would have to eliminate. To close a $50 billion budget deficit, Congress would have to eliminate the equivalent of nearly the entire defense procurement budget in that year. 
Let me give you another example as to why providing for economic emergencies would be necessary. 
Economists estimate that a ticket shock triggered by higher oil prices similar to those of 1973 and 1974 and 1979 and 1980 could trigger a 1- to 2-percent drop in our economy. That would necessitate budget cuts of $100 to $150 billion that year. It would be devastating to an economy. I do not know if anyone here remembers what it was like when those prices of oil rose. Economists state it was the major reason for the economic downturn. No one can guarantee, that such a situation would not happen in the future. 
So the majority's balanced budget amendment does not address economic risks that face the Nation. I think that is a major weakness in the amendment. Our amendment would suspend the amendment in the event of a serious economic emergency or major natural disaster. This would have to be enacted by a constitutional majority of both bodies. 
We also permit a capital budget. My thinking is that when Social Security is withdrawn from the unified budget, we will need to be able to review our budget structure and proceed in a way that does not have a dramatic impact. One way is through the enactment of a capital budget. 
Now, the Constitution is not a document that should carry enabling legislation. The Constitution should be worded in general words subject to interpretation and also subject to enabling action by the Congress. 
Our amendment reads: `Nothing in this article shall preclude,' which means prevent, `the authority to enact and implement'--that would have to be done by congressional enactment and implementation--`a separate capital budget.' 
The amendment defines a capital budget: `Those major capital improvements.' Congress would have to determine what is a major capital improvement, which would require multiyear Federal funding. Those would be excluded from the provisions of this constitutional amendment that requires the strict expenditures must meet outlays. 
This means that for, say, Federal office buildings that would maybe run $40, $50, $80, $100 million or more, or a major transportation systems which could run $200 or $300 million, a multi-year financing program could be established. The interest on those programs would be paid out of operating capital, and the amount of interest would probably be limited every year. 
The amount of debt would be strictly limited. Perhaps the Congress would limit debt by using a percent of gross domestic product, of GDP. As I said, 2 percent would be about $160 billion. If you had 3 percent, it would be more, and still more at 4 or 5 percent. An effective limit would probably be somewhere between the 2 percent and, say, 6 percent, 7 percent, or 8 percent of GDP. 
Now, is this necessary to do? Even without a balanced budget amendment, spending for infrastructure since the 1960's has dramatically dropped. It was 6 percent in the 1960's. It is 3 percent today, 3 percent of the budget. 
We have 250,000 miles of Federal highways that are in disrepair. We have more than 100,000 bridges in disrepair, unable to be repaired in the present day situation. I think at some point the Congress may wish to look at a capital budget. All this 
amendment does is enable that review to take place. 
We mentioned what it means to be controlled by a minority. The fourth area where this amendment differs from the majority is with respect to the debt limit. I have tried to show this body how difficult it is to even raise a majority vote. 
Since 1990, no budget resolution or conference report has received a three-fifths vote of this body. 
Since 1990, no vote to raise the debt limit has received a three-fifths majority. 
The 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, was passed by 51 to 37. 
The 1990 budget reconciliation bill was passed by 54 to 45. 
The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act was passed by a vote of 51 to 50, just one vote. 
The 1995 budget reconciliation was passed by 52 to 47. 
The 1995 temporary debt limit increase was passed by 49 to 47. Consequently, last year, we reached our apex of minority rule when the Government was shut down not once, but twice while trying unsuccessfully to prove a point. 
Allowing a minority to block an effort to extend the debt limit essentially jeopardizes the full faith and credit of this country, something that those of us who have held executive office know is the true measure of the financial acumen of your city or your State. If you get a bad bond rating by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the full faith and credit of the bonds you float is dramatically affected. 
But a minority in pique, pouting, desirous of showing their enormous clout, can effectively jeopardize the full faith and credit of this Government and put this Government into default. I must tell you, I think that is absolutely dreadful as a matter of public policy. 
Those are the four issues in this amendment. 
Social Security: Congress can use it up to 2002 to reach balance, but afterward, we must separate it out. This step will preserve $1.8 trillion in the trust funds for retirees. 
Economic emergency: Congress should treat spending for serious economic emergency or major national disasters just like it treats military emergencies. 
Capital budget: Congress should at least enable it, rather than prohibit it, which the majority amendment does. 
Debt limit: Please, have some sense and address it with a majority vote. 
These four issues are the only way this amendment differs from the majority amendment. 
Perhaps the majority has their votes. Perhaps they know they have 67 votes. If they do not, I respectfully submit to them, maybe this is worth looking at and reviewing. 
Maybe it solves a major problem. 
Maybe it provides some kind of constitutional flexibility to meet what might develop in the future. We could face another savings and loan crisis, or another shock from oil prices. We could face a major earthquake in southern California, the probability of which has been increased, or a major flood in the Mississippi River basin, a major earthquake rift zone in the center part of our country. 
We could face a range of emergencies and people will need Federal help. That is what we are here to do. We are here to protect the welfare and well-being of our citizens, and not the least among them are seniors. For many seniors, Social Security is the difference between a life of poverty and a life of being able to eat and pay the rent. 
I think this is a worthy amendment. I have given it a lot of thought. 
My distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee is present on the floor. I have listened to the hearings, heard the testimony of Secretary Rubin and really thought about whether your amendment could be improved. I decided that it could, but for some reason the balanced budget amendment is frozen in stone. I do not know who drafted the majority amendment. It was drafted, I assume, by the majority, but it has become the be-all and end-all: `If you do not support us, you cannot be for a balanced budget amendment.' I cannot accept that. 
I represent a big and deeply troubled State. I hazard a guess that the State of California will never ratify this balanced budget amendment. I cannot speak for any other State, but I think I can for California. And they will not do it because they know about serious economic emergencies. 
They know about a capital budget. We have 40 million people currently on Social Security, and it's going up every day. The people want this protected. 
So this is a compromise with Social Security, economic emergency, capital budget permitted, debt limit by a majority. I would hazard a guess that if this became the amendment of the majority, not only would it pass both bodies, it would be ratified by three-quarters of the States. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would add very quickly, Mr. President, that there is one, deep, soft underbelly in the majority balanced budget amendment. You cannot use Social Security trust funds and spend the money on operating expenditures, whether it be for a battleship or a satellite, and save those moneys for someone's retirement. 
I rest my case. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to read into the Record a letter that I have just sent to the President of the United States, urging decertification of Mexico: 
Dear Mr. President: I am writing to urge you to deny certification that Mexico has taken sufficient actions to combat international narcotics trafficking when you report to Congress on the anti-narcotics efforts of major drug producing and drug-transit countries. I believe a reasonable examination of the facts leads to no other decision. 
Last year at this time, Senator D'Amato and I compiled a list of actions we considered it necessary for the Mexican government to take to beef up their anti-narcotics efforts. This list is attached. Regrettably, I have concluded that there has been insufficient progress, or no progress, on nearly all of the items on this list. Some of these failures are due to inability; others are due to a lack of political will. But all have set back the urgent effort to end the plague of drugs on our streets. 
I want to bring to your attention a number of the most significant examples of Mexico's inability and unwillingness to deal with the drug trafficking problem effectively: 
Cartels: There has been little or no effective action taken against the major drug cartels. The two most powerful--the Juarez Cartel run by Amado Carillo Fuentes, and the Tijuana Cartel, run by the Arellano Felix brothers--have hardly been touched by Mexican law enforcement. Those who have been arrested, such as Hector Palma, are given light sentences and allowed to continue to conduct business from jail. As DEA Administrator Constantine says, `The Mexicans are now the single most powerful trafficking groups'--worse than the Colombian cartels. 
Money Laundering: Last year, the Mexican parliament passed criminal money laundering laws for the first time, but the new laws are incomplete and have not yet been properly implemented. These laws do not require banks to report large and suspicious currency transactions, or threaten the banks with sanctions if they fail to comply. Promises to enact such regulations--which prosecutors need to identify money-launderers--have so far gone unfulfilled. Mexican officials said that such regulations would be developed by January, but they were not produced. To my knowledge, not a single Mexican bank or exchange house has been forced to change its operations. 
Law Enforcement: While there have been increases in the amounts of heroin and marijuana seized by Mexican authorities, cocaine seizures remain low. Although slightly higher than last year's figures, the 23.6 metric tons seized in 1996 is barely half of what was seized in 1993. A modest increase in drug-related arrests brought the total to 11,245 in 1996--less than half of the 1992 figure. 
Cooperation with U.S. Law Enforcement: Our own drug enforcement agents report that the situation on the border has never been worse. Last month, the Mexican government forbade U.S. agents to carry weapons on the Mexican side of the border, putting their lives in grave danger. Recent news reports indicate that death threats against U.S. narcotics agents on the border have quadrupled in the past three months. Some U.S. agents believe that all their cooperative efforts are undone almost instantly by the corrupt Mexican agents with whom they work. 
Extraditions: Despite the fact that the United States has 52 outstanding extradition request on drug-related charges, not a single Mexican national has ever been extradited to the United States on such charges. 
Corruption: Mexico's counternarcotics effort is plagued by corruption in the government and the national police. Among the evidence are the eight Mexican prosecutors and law enforcement officials who have been murdered in Tijuana in recent months. There has been considerable hope that the Mexican armed forces would be able to take a more active role in the counternarcotics effort without the taint of corruption. But the revelation that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, Mexico's top counternarcotics official and a 42-year veteran of the armed forces, had accepted bribes from the Carillo Fuentes cartel, casts grave doubts upon that hope. 
Recent news reports indicate that U.S. law enforcement officials suspect judges, prosecutors, Transportation Ministry officials, and Naval officers of corruption, and there is persuasive evidence that two Mexican Governors--Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera of Sonora and Jorge Carillo Olea--are actively facilitating the work of drug traffickers in their respective states. The National Autonomous University of Mexico estimates that the drug lords spend $500 million each year to bribe Mexican officials at all levels, and many consider that figure to be a gross under-estimation. 
Mr. President, I believe the evidence is overwhelming and can lead to no decision other than the decertification of Mexico. It would send a strong signal to Mexico and the world that the United States will not tolerate lack of cooperation in the fight against narcotics, even from our close friends and allies. Accordingly, I urge you to establish a clear set of benchmarks by which you will judge if and when to recertify Mexico for counternarcotics cooperation. These benchmarks must include, but not be limited to: effective action to dismantle the major drug cartels and arrest their leaders; full and ongoing implementation of effective money-laundering legislation; compliance with all outstanding extradition requests by the United States; increased interdiction of narcotics and other controlled substances flowing across the border by land and sea routes; improved cooperation with U.S. law enforcement officials, including allowing U.S. agents to resume carrying weapons on the Mexican side of the border; and a comprehensive program to identify, weed out, and prosecute corrupt officials at all levels of the Mexican government, police, and military. 
You may feel that U.S. interests in Mexico, economic and otherwise, are too extensive to risk the fall-out that would result from decertification. That is why Congress included a vital national interest waiver provision in Section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act. But other vital interests are not a valid reason to certify when certification has not been earned. If you feel that our interests warrant it, I urge you to use this waiver. But an honest assessment of Mexico's cooperation on counternarcotics must fall on the side of decertification.

I thank the President. I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the Reid amendment to the majority resolution to provide a balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
As everyone in this body knows, the Reid amendment would exclude Social Security trust funds from the balancing requirement of the proposed constitutional amendment. This exclusion is the only matter in which the Reid amendment differs from the majority's balanced budget amendment. I think the amendment addresses a fundamental question to all of us who are in this body: Will we accept the responsibility to bring the Federal budget in balance without placing at risk the funds our constituents depend on for their retirement? 
It must be remembered that every American worker pays 6.2 percent of their paycheck, matched by 6.2 percent from the employer, for a total 12.4 percent, which is paid into Social Security for their retirement. 
What has happened is that the Social Security trust fund has been incorporated as part of the unified budget. Therefore, those moneys actually go into balancing the budget, and the majority amendment would freeze this practice into the Constitution for all time--for all time--so that forever Social Security trust funds are used to pay the salary of a clerk or a lawyer or build a highway or buy a battleship or do any number of the myriad of things the Federal Government does through its operating budget. I believe that this is the soft underbelly of this constitutional amendment. This is the Achilles heel. Even if this amendment passes both of these bodies, I do not for a minute believe that three-quarters of the people of each legislature in our 50 States will ratify this amendment. 
This morning we had signatures from 890,000 Social Security recipients, urging our opposition to any balanced budget amendment which does not protect Social Security. Those signatures represent just the current recipients today. People like my daughter, who is in her midthirties, is working and providing that money said to me, `Mother, you know that isn't going to be there when I retire. Why don't you just let me have the money now. There are better things I can do with it. I could use it right now.' 
Social Security is a sacred trust with the public. 
If I may, let me make the picture for not enshrining it into the Constitution with this chart. 
What this chart does is show the amount of Social Security surplus--that is all of this--that goes into balancing the budget. Up to 2002 it is in the vicinity of $500 billion. 
By 2013, it is $2 trillion that is utilized cumulatively to balance the budget. From 2002 to 2019, the amount that Senate Joint Resolution 1 takes from the trust fund to balance the budget is $1.8 trillion. 
Now, what happens after the year around 2019 when the surplus begins to fall? When Social Security revenue drops below Social Security outlays to beneficiaries, according to the Congressional 
Research Service report, that is when this body will have to raise taxes or cut Social Security payments or cut some other Federal programs and find some way to balance the budget. 
Under the majority's proposed constitutional amendment, outlays must match revenue in the fiscal year. If Social Security revenue falls, the revenue needs to be made up through higher taxes or we have to cut spending through reduced Social Security payments or spending reductions elsewhere in the budget. 
The majority's amendment is unfair because it enshrines in the Constitution, the principle that Social Security receipts and Social Security payments to beneficiaries are at risk. Because, at some point along the way, push is going to come to shove, expenditures are going to exceed outlays, and then there is going to be a problem. 
There are some in this body who will say, `Well, that forces us to reform Social Security.' That may be and it may not be, I don't know. But it is not the right thing to do. 
In 1990, adopting the Hollings amendment, which Senator Hollings has so eloquently described, this body said we are not going to include Social Security as part of the unified budget anymore. The votes were virtually unanimous. Yet, voila, the Federal Government continues to include Social Security as part of the unified budget. I think that is wrong. That is the soft underbelly, that is the Achilles heel. It is just plain wrong. 
I support the Reid amendment. The Reid amendment's only difference from the majority resolution is the exclusion of Social Security from the balancing requirement. 
In the event that the Reid amendment is not successful, tomorrow morning I will propose another version, along with Senators Cleland, Torricelli, and Durbin. This amendment would say: All right, we lost in our effort to take Social Security out of the balancing requirement for the very reason that it is too difficult to achieve balance. We all admit that, that there needs to be some time to adjust to the removal of Social Security from the unified budget. So I will propose an amendment which essentially would do the following. It would say that Social Security will be used up to the year 2002. After the year 2002, when balance is achieved, Social Security will be withdrawn from the unified budget and, therefore, $1.8 trillion will be preserved for retirees. The integrity will be saved. It will not be an IOU. It will be saved. Additionally, my amendment would change extending the debt limit from the three-fifths requirement of the majority balanced budget amendment to a constitutional majority of both bodies. It would also provide an exception for an economic emergency, and that way the stabilizers can function, and it would also clarify that the amendment will not prohibit the enactment of a capital budget as well. 
So, I believe that, in the year 2002, Congress would have the opportunity to develop a capital budget. At 2 percent of GDP, that capital budget would be around $160 billion a year. We utilize about $140 billion a year now, so it would make some sense and it would fill the gap. 
If there is an interest in having a balanced budget amendment, this might be a way of going about it and correcting some of the problems. The Reid amendment, which I have voted for in past years, indicates that the enshrinement of Social Security into the Constitution of the United States is not something that this body is going to do. We are not going to take those trust funds and use them to buy battleships or provide park services or pay the salaries of 96,000 workers at the Department of Justice, or to provide anything else. It will be invested as trust funds, as it should be, separate and discrete and held for the retirement of every person who pays that FICA tax every year. 
I yield the remainder of my time. 
Mr. President, may I ask to spend a few minutes as in morning business to introduce a matter?

<TEXT>
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Madam President, and I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont. 
I rise to support his arguments, to indicate my support for House Joint Resolution 36. Madam President, I recently returned from a few days in Nepal. If you go to Nepal, you will see that about 35 percent of the children die before the age of 5, and they die before the age of 5 because they are impoverished. They don't have enough food, and they die. This is true in many areas, particularly undeveloped countries, all around the world. 
I think that one of the most important and effective components of U.S. foreign assistance has been our family planning programs. I believe these programs reduce poverty, I believe they improve health, I believe they raise living standards around the world, and they enhance, certainly, the ability of couples and individuals to determine the number and spacing of their children. 
I think many of us in this country take that opportunity for granted. Most of us have had the freedom to make choices about how we live our lives by planning the size of our families. But in poorer countries where contraceptive options are not available, women have much higher birth rates, and the more children they have, the higher the poverty rates. Children are malnourished, many get sick, many die. 
UNICEF estimates that 34,000 children under the age of 5 die every day--every day--in developing countries. And it is not just children. UNICEF further estimates that 600,000 women die of pregnancy-related causes each year and that unsafe abortions are responsible for 75,000 of these deaths. By giving women the opportunity to plan their pregnancies, lives are saved--the lives of women and their children. 
So the need for these family planning programs could hardly be clearer. Unfortunately, because of this dispute between the House and the Senate last year, the compromise the Senator from Vermont referred to was reached, but that delayed the release of family planning funds until July 1, or March 1, if the President found the delay was harming these programs and Congress agreed. 
The President has made the finding, arguing, I think, persuasively that the delay thus far has forced many programs to suspend or defer their operations and that further delay, until July, could cause them to shut down. 
Already, programs serving over 700,000 people annually in Bolivia, the Philippines, Ecuador, and elsewhere, have been suspended. 
Two weeks ago, the House voted 220 to 209 to agree with the President's finding. So the vote in the Senate is crucial. 
If we concur with the President and the House, we can release these life-saving funds only 5 months late instead of 9 months late. The difference is critical. 
Some have tried to draw a connection between our family planning programs and abortion. But no connection exists. Since 1973, U.S. law has prohibited any USAID funds from being used to pay for abortions as a method of family planning or to coerce any person to have an abortion. All our programs are voluntary and they involve contraception, not abortion. Programs are rigorously monitored to ensure strict compliance. 
So the argument that these programs cause an increase in abortion is simply a red herring. It is actually worse than a red herring in a sense because it is patently and demonstrably false. In fact, it stands the truth on its head. It is the delay in our family planning programs that is actually causing an increase in abortions. 
The evidence is clear. When family planning options are available, fewer unintended pregnancies occur, and abortions decline. 
In Russia where the average Russian woman used to have a stunning seven or eight abortions in her lifetime, family planning has made a huge difference. With United States assistance, organizations like the Russian Family Planning Association have raised the rate of contraceptive use from 19 percent to 24 percent from 1990 to 1994. Even that modest increase produced results. In the same period, the Russian Department of Health reported that the total number of abortions performed dropped from 3.6 million to 2.8 million. That is 800,000 fewer abortions. This is specific, irrefutable, documented, statistical proof that family planning moneys drop and lower the rate of abortion. 
The story repeats itself over and over. In Mexico, in Colombia, wherever USAID has funded family planning, this is the case. 
So facts are facts. And the link is clear. As our esteemed former colleague, Mark Hatfield, who was and is a proudly pro-life Senator, reminded us each time we voted on this issue, family planning assistance prevents abortion. 
So this vote is about one thing and one thing only--it is about giving women in the developing world a chance to make their lives and the lives of their children better, safer, healthier, and more fulfilling. 
I believe we have every reason and every interest to give them that chance. I hope every Member of this body does as well. So I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator John Warner, Senator Conrad Burns, Senator Charles Robb, Senator Patty Murray, and Senator Barbara Boxer, I rise today to reintroduce a Senate resolution acknowledging the achievements of NetDay and affirming NetDay's commitment to wire our local K-12 schools to the information superhighway. I wish to commend the organizers and volunteers of NetDay, a nationwide public-private partnership. 
Last year, NetDay was successful in bringing out more than 100,000 Americans, including 50,000 Californians to volunteer in their neighborhood schools. These students, teachers, parents, and friends of the schools came to wire classrooms and school libraries throughout the Nation. Thousands of individuals accomplished their goal to install communications cables, connect wires and switches to upgrading their schools for the 21st century. 
Their success was significant. Over 25,000 elementary, junior, and senior high schools were wired. Throughout the United States, volunteers climbed ladders and got on their hands and knees to install the wiring infrastructure needed to connect thousands of elementary and secondary school classrooms with contemporary technology. 
In recognition of the NetDay effort, I am very proud to submit a Senate resolution commending all of the more than 100,000 volunteers for their hard work and dedication to ensure that schools throughout America have the needed technological infrastructure for the 21st century. 
NetDay began in California on March 9, 1996. The term was coined by co-founders John Gage of Sun Microsystems, one of the Nation's leading technology companies and Michael Kaufman of KQED, a California public broadcasting station. Mr. Gage and Mr. Kaufman saw this initiative as a day where hundreds of Californians came out to an old-fashioned barn raising for the modern technology age. 
Just as volunteers would gather in the Nation's early years, with neighbor helping neighbor, to build homes, barns, or community buildings, California's NetDay volunteers gather in support of neighborhood schools. Amazingly, and to their surprise, NetDay succeeded in 1 year in wiring 3,500 schools efficiently and cost effectively, establishing and improving our classroom information infrastructure up and down the State. 
The NetDay effort is an important one to California. Despite the State's tremendous resources, opportunities, and wealth of technology companies, California still ranks at the bottom of States in funds spent per student on computers. The cost today of providing a computer for each student, from kindergarten to high school, is approximately $6 billion for 1,159,565 computers in California. NetDay activities are one way to ease some of the financial burden. 
With our current budget deficit, we have been doing everything to encourage local, volunteer solutions to difficult problems. NetDay activities across America have and will continue to save schools and taxpayers millions of dollars in technology start-up costs by providing equipment, computer time, and training for teachers through the school's corporate partners. Business sponsors and corporate volunteers have been instrumental in making NetDay a successful reality. 
But we should also note that NetDay was not just about saving money. The most valuable asset of NetDay was the commitment of thousands of volunteers who worked in their community schools. The relationships formed between schools and their communities will extend beyond 1996. NetDay volunteers have the continued goal of stimulating and facilitating communities in the United States to participate in their local schools. Parents and neighbors who had previously never visited or been involved in their children's school are now motivated to come back to the classroom and work to improve their child's learning environment. 
NetDay organizers tell me that communities across the Nation are already planning to organize future NetDay activities, building and expanding upon earlier achievements. Further, in April of this year, NetDay organizers will be focusing resources on schools and communities that are often underserved. 
We all agree our children deserve the finest preparation possible to face the demands of the changing information-based economy. We need to provide the next generation with the proper training for high-technology, well paying jobs. This will only happen if we include all our neighborhoods. NetDay will help meet these challenges, stressing educational opportunity for everyone by reaching out to rural and lower income communities where current technology may be inadequate or incomplete. Even if students don't have computers at home, at least students can have access at schools to explore, develop skills, learn, and grow. Congress should encourage these important goals. 
With this resolution we can support the overall effort of ensuring that our classrooms are equipped with effective and constructive learning tools. As students move from elementary school to high school and then into college or the work force, it is imperative that these individuals are adequately trained to use contemporary technologies. This resolution will help motivate our communities, both volunteers and businesses, to provide donated resources, to build upon the success of the NetDay experience and to ensure that the children in all our towns and cities reap the benefits of an advanced learning environment. 
I would also like to take this time to congratulate this administration for making the improvement of our classroom's technological infrastructure a priority. This administration deserves great credit for advancing education and technology. Last year, President Clinton and Vice President Gore joined thousands of Californian volunteers in fulfilling this goal. They also support the expansion of NetDay activities nationwide to increase the level of technology in our classrooms to enhance our children's ability to learn. 
It is my pleasure to submit this resolution commending the NetDay co-founders, Michael Kaufman and John Gage, the dozens of corporate sponsors and business partners, and the thousands of students, teachers, parents, and neighbors working in community schools throughout California and the Nation. The success and commitment they have shown can serve as a positive model, this year and in future years. 
My colleague and cochair on the U.S. Senate Information Technology Caucus, Senator John Warner joins me in cosponsoring this resolution. In addition, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator Charles Robb of Virginia, Senator Patty Murray from Washington, and my California colleague Senator Barbara Boxer join me in supporting the advancement of educational technology by sponsoring this resolution. Together, we urge our Senate colleagues to affirm congressional support for preparing U.S. classrooms with the needed technological infrastructure for the 21st century. 
In today's global economy, America's students will face challenges on an international scale. Students must graduate with the skills needed to face today's changing workplace. Computers and technology can enhance the educational experience of children and provide a valuable complement to traditional teaching tools. Technology is not the complete solution to our complex education needs, but it is an important area that needs both our attention and our support. 
I invite my Senate colleagues to join this public-private partnership effort.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we begin the 105th Congress with a sober recognition of the fact that the Federal Government cannot solve all problems. Anyone who questions this premise need only look at painful choices that must be made in order to balance the Federal budget, our first and most difficult task this session. 
Having said that, the clearest message, I think, sent to us this past November was that the people of America want Republicans and Democrats to work together to solve real problems. I have been very concerned and I might even say dismayed by statements made by Members of this body and the House, that under no circumstances will there be any changes, no matter how meritorious, no matter how necessary, to the welfare bill which passed last year. 
Mr. President, when this body debated and approved the historic welfare reform bill last year, I outlined to my colleagues what I saw as some of the major flaws in the drafting of that bill, and as a result, the impact that this legislation will have on the largest State in the Union--California. I want to take an opportunity this afternoon to update those comments. 
The impact of this bill on California is huge. At this stage, it really is not fully known or even understood. Some estimate that California will absorb about $17 billion of the $55 billion saved by this bill. That is a body blow to our safety net. It could have a catastrophic impact both financially and in terms of human lives. I voted, because of this, against that welfare bill. 
I am not alone in my concerns. Even the Republican Governors, many of them poster-children for the reform effort, are looking at the fine print now and saying, `How is my State going to pay for these costs? How are we going to provide the necessary care? How are we going to meet these requirements without turning people out on the streets?'--for some, in large numbers. Even the Republican Governors are asking for changes. 
A headline in the Washington Post 2 days ago said it pretty clearly: `After getting responsibility for welfare, States may pass it down,' something that I, as a county supervisor and a mayor for some 18 years, recognize that it is exactly the way it goes. The buck usually stops with the lowest rung of a government. That is just what is going to happen with this bill. In California, a proposition 13 State, there is no way for local governments to raise their taxes or their revenue potential to deal with the problem. 
In the months since the passage of the welfare bill, I directed my staff to examine how this bill would impact California counties. To date, my staff has met with the welfare directors of 22 out of California's 58 counties. Their pleas were nearly universal. I will share them with you. The work requirements, they say, as currently outlined in the bill will most probably not be attainable even under the most optimistic of circumstances. The child care funds in the bill for California are not enough to satisfy the requirements of the bill. The legal immigrant provisions denying food stamps and SSI, particularly to the elderly, the sick, and the disabled, will have a devastating impact on county general assistance programs. The biggest impact will be on the largest county in the State, Los Angeles County. And the counties tell me they have no computer ability to track and monitor recipients under the new rules. How do they comply? 
Some of the changes asked for by these counties are technical in nature, such as increasing the time permitted for job search to be more realistic for areas where the average search even for nonwelfare recipients is twice as long as that permitted under the bill. Other changes are more fundamental, such as restoring some assistance to the elderly and disabled legal immigrants. I know President Clinton shares many of these concerns, and will propose a number of changes in his budget soon to be released. 
I hope the door is not closed to at least looking at what the facts are. I believe it would really be unconscionable, and in a 
sense, the height of irresponsibility, to arbitrarily say we will not look at any problem or any misdrafting in that bill. I will point out one area in my remarks later where I think it is simply a case of misdrafting. 
Let me speak for a moment about legal immigrants. There are 500,000 elderly and disabled noncitizens nationwide who will lose SSI by August 22, 1997. Of these legal immigrants 205,000 are in California--more than 40 percent. That is a very real problem. Many of these individuals are seriously ill and completely destitute, with no family capable of supporting them. In Los Angeles County alone, there are 93,000 such people, and the ultimate transfer to the county will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. When they lose their benefits they will turn to the counties. 
Just last week, California's State legislative analyst's office estimated the ban on SSI and food stamps will cost California $5.8 billion over 6 years. Now, either this is a massive cost-shift or the homeless in America and in California are going to be greatly adding to their numbers. In Los Angeles County alone the nonmedical costs of supporting elderly and disabled legal immigrants could top $236 million annually. 
San Francisco also estimates that 20,000 legal noncitizens may turn to the county's general assistance program, at a total cost of up to $74 million annually. 
Let me give an actual example from my hometown legal immigrants. My San Francisco staff met with a 73-year-old legal immigrant on SSI. She was welcomed to this county from Vietnam in 1980. She was a refugee from communism with no family in the United States. She speaks no English and she is suffering from kidney failure. She requires dialysis three times a week. Under this new law, this 73-year-old woman will lose SSI, her only source of support. Her well-being will become the responsibility, somehow, some way, of the county. 
During the welfare debate I proposed an amendment to make this section of the bill prospective. I understand the majority's concern that the legal immigrants' use of SSI was increasing at a higher ratio than U.S. citizens' use of SSI. I understand wanting to slow that number down. The way to do it is to say that in the future, everyone coming to this country following the date of enactment, which was August 22 last year, know that when you come to the United States of America as a legal immigrant, you are not eligible for SSI. For the people here before that time, what I propose is that there be an amendment to the bill that would say SSI could be continued for those who have no other verifiable source of support. These are the elderly, they are monolingual, they are destitute, and many of them are ill. 
Let me speak for a moment, Mr. President, about the work requirements of the bill, because counties throughout California are really concerned. 
Under the new welfare law, 25 percent of single-parent families on welfare and 75 percent of two-parent families on welfare must be engaged in work activities this year. By 2002, the requirements rise to 50 percent of single-parent families and 90 percent of two-parent families. 
California's economy is recovering, but our unemployment rate is still 1 1/2 points above the national rate. It is 6.8 percent. The national rate is 5.4 percent. So some 1 million Californians are still on unemployment. 
Let me give you some examples of how unrealistic the work requirements of the welfare bill are on certain counties in California. 
In Tulare County, the heart of the great Central Valley, the heart of the area that has the largest agriculture producers in the United States, the unemployment rate is 16.3 percent, more than 10 percentage points above the Nation, and one-third of the county is on public assistance--one-third of the county. There are no jobs for people. 
In Merced County--again in the Central Valley--unemployment is even higher at 16.8 percent. Thirty-five percent of the population there receives some type of public assistance. 
Here are others: Imperial County, 27 percent unemployment; Madera, 15.9; Monterey, 10.6 percent; Stanislaus County, 17.3 percent; and Sonoma County, 14 percent. 
And these are not small population areas. In some of the cases, the population of these counties is actually more than the population of some of the States. These are larger areas. 
With 2.7 million families in California on welfare, counties fear that the work requirement, as defined in the new welfare law, simply is not realistic for the State to be able to meet. 
California is simply not creating jobs fast enough, and the kinds of jobs that the State is creating are high-technology, biotech, highly skilled jobs, and jobs in the import-export business; jobs that relate to Asia; jobs that have a level of educational requirement that can produce a high skill level. 
In Riverside County in southern California, their GAIN Program, which is their welfare-to-work program, is the most successful program of its kind in the Nation. It is 12 years old. It has been the model for other programs all throughout the United States. Yet, in that time, only 14 percent of single-parent families currently meet the work requirement as set under welfare reform. And only 15 percent of two-parent families meet the work requirement. That is after 12 years of trying. If Riverside County can't meet the requirements, how many counties and States nationwide will actually be able to do so? 
That is why I urge that the President and Members of Congress to allocate some new funds--countercyclical moneys--that would apply particularly in counties where the unemployment rate is at a certain amount. You might want to make it over 1 percentage point from the national average, particularly in areas where there is a high welfare load, which gives testament to the fact that you can't produce jobs in that county. 
I feel that Congress should amend the welfare law in significant ways to make it easier for States to meet the work requirements. And I would like to suggest some of them. 
Doubling the time allowed for job search activities from 6 weeks to 12 weeks. That is what they say it actually takes and where there is success. 
Expand the welfare law's definition of `work' to include 2 years of vocational education instead of 1. That is what they say it requires to be employable. 
Include people who--this is a glitch, I think, in the drafting of the bill and one of the reasons that I am so concerned that the announcement has been made that even technical changes 
will not be made to the bill. The way the bill is drafted, it does not include people who leave welfare for work and those who are immediately placed in a given month as part of the State's total number of people moving from welfare to work. So, In other words, the way the bill is drafted, you don't get credit for the people that month you place in jobs. I think that this is a technical glitch. I think it is a drafting error. I think it is easy to correct. But if we have this policy of nothing no matter whenever it is not going to get corrected. 
I would suggest creating a countercyclical funding program for the next 6 years, and I suggest targeting counties with high unemployment and high welfare caseloads. 
Child care funding increases: Under the new welfare law, the money is insufficient to accommodate the increasing demands. Currently, my State subsidizes child care for 205,000 low-income children. But there are 1.8 million children on welfare in California--1.8 million. The State currently only has funds to subsidize 205,000. 
In order to accommodate the increases in the work requirements which are required by this bill from 25 percent in 1997 to 50 percent in 2002 for an individual recipient, I would propose adding an additional $1.43 billion in child care funding over the next 6 years. 
I would also propose exempting parents with children under the age of 12, instead of 6, from the work requirement if they cannot find child care. 
This bill--mark my words--will be known as the `latchkey mandate bill' if people can't find work. And there is no reason for any child in elementary school be left home alone without any adult supervision. 
Let me speak for just a moment on the reporting requirements. 
When Federal welfare reform was enacted, little attention was paid to the 15 new reporting requirements that the law imposes on the States--everything from welfare recipients' race and citizenship status, to other Federal benefits they receive, to unemployment status and earnings. 
California, like many other States, has no computer system in place to track and report all of this data. And without effective tracking and reporting, the Nation's largest State has no hope of enforcing the time limit and preventing welfare fraud. Contra Costa County's welfare director said that his county's ability to meet the reporting requirements of the bill is `literally zip.' This is a big county. 
I think that the welfare law's reporting requirements are important, and I do not advocate relaxing them. But I do believe that the counties are going to require additional support in the form of computer assistance that is greater than that which is provided in the bill today, and that we ought not to be so fixed that we cannot take a look at it. 
I make these comments at this time in the hope that someone might read them, or even see them, or take notice of them, and that this statement that there will be no amendments to this bill can perhaps be changed to `Well, we will carefully consider amendments.' 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, with my distinguished colleague, Harry Reid, I am introducing S. 248, a bill to establish a Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals. 
The Commission proposal emerged last year during a debate over a controversial bill to divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. As a result of that discussion, it became clear to me and the majority of my colleagues that there was no consensus on how best to resolve the problem of caseload growth in the U.S. courts. The idea of a study commission gained broad support and has independent merit. 
Legislation to form a study commission was approved twice by the Senate in the 104th Congress: in March 1996 as a stand-alone bill, and later in the session as part of the Senate amendments to H.R. 3610, the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997. Although the Senate amendment was not included in the final version of H.R. 3610 signed by the President on September 23, 1996, the initial funding for the Commission was appropriated therein. The authorizing legislation deserves a speedy enactment by the 105th Congress. 
The Commission legislation we are offering today is evenhanded, fair, and genuinely bipartisan. It will consist of two members appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States, two members appointed by the President, two members appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, two members appointed by the minority leader of the Senate, two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and two members appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives. 
The object is to have a balanced group of individuals who will examine the issues fairly and give full consideration of all relevant perspectives. With a balanced membership, we can be confident that the Commission's recommendations will be given due weight by all three branches of the National Government.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise, for Senator Boxer and myself, to introduce legislation that amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to allow the Federal Government to transfer to State and local governments surplus Federal property for use for law enforcement or public safety purposes. This bill expands current authority which restricts this type of property transfer to State and local governments for use only as correctional facilities. 
Our law enforcement and public safety officials need the flexibility that this legislation provides. While continuing to allow prisons to be built, this legislation provides communities with the options they need to establish or expand needed law enforcement training facilities, fire fighting academies, and the like given an area's particular need. 
The one thing communities need after a military base closure is the flexibility to reuse bases to fulfill their greatest local needs. This bill will continue to facilitate the successful reuse of base realignment and closure sites, like March Air Force Base in California, for civilian and public safety purposes. Fighting crime continues to be a top priority for communities throughout the Nation. It makes sense to allow communities to put former military bases to use in that fight. 
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. Our communities affected by base closures deserve all options to facilitate successful reuse.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in support of President Clinton's nomination of former Senator William Cohen as Secretary of Defense. I truly believe that Senator Cohen has an extraordinary grasp of all defense matters, especially issues of concern to the Navy, and will be an asset as Secretary of Defense. 
I have always found Senator Cohen to be a fair and thoughtful public servant who takes the time to understand all issues. In fact, I am happy to say that when Senator Cohen speaks on matters of our national defense and foreign policy, I turn up the volume on my television so that I can catch every word. 
Since coming to the Senate, I have stressed the need to be more bipartisan in all that we do. This is especially true when considering what is necessary for our Nation's security. I am convinced that with the Senator's nomination as Secretary of Defense our ability to work together as Democrats and Republicans will be enhanced as will Congress' ability to work with the executive branch. The value of this cooperation cannot be underestimated. 
I am also pleased that Secretary-designate Cohen has a keen understanding of international security issues across the board. He is particularly knowledgeable about the Asia-Pacific region and has traveled there many times. Secretary-designate Cohen supports continuing Secretary Perry's strong policy of engagement with China, including extensive military-to-military contacts. This kind of one-on-one relationship with our Asian counterparts is vital to the continued progress in our foreign policy relationship. We, however, must continue to maintain a strong military presence in the Pacific to protect our interests. I am convinced that Senator Cohen will continue to support this effort during his tenure as Secretary of Defense. 
Eliminating sexual harassment and all forms of discrimination in our Armed Forces is another issue to which I know the Secretary-designate will dedicate his efforts. He was a leader during the scourge of Tailhook and I am confident that he will continue to monitor the Army's investigations into sexual harassment and assault inside its ranks. 
Finally, I know that the Secretary-designate and I will have the opportunity to discuss and to work on those matter on which we do not see eye to eye. As a Senator, Secretary-designate Cohen had differing views on the administration's current Department of Defense privatization efforts. I look forward to working with him as we continue to explore the best ways to preserve the readiness needs of our military and the most cost-effective means to support our military's depot maintenance activities. I am positive that we will have, as we have always had, the ability to discuss these differences openly and honestly. 
In closing, I was pleased to hear that Senator Cohen mentioned the problem of access to bombmaking information on the Internet during his testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee today. This is a widespread problem for which I have been seeking a solution and I am pleased that the Secretary-designate understands its gravity. 
I am happy to give my support for the nomination of former Senator William Cohen to the office of Secretary of Defense. I am positive he will be an asset to the Clinton administration and to our Nation as a whole.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Federal Gang Violence Act of 1997 which was introduced yesterday by Senator Hatch on behalf of himself and this Senator from California. I also believe my sentiments and cosponsorship are joined by Senators Harkin, Reid, and D'Amato. 
Mr. President, this legislation makes the Federal Government a much more active partner in the war on criminal activity that, I am regretful to say, has become violent and deadly and is perpetrated by organized street gangs. This bill was introduced with some differences in the last Congress, but the need for the legislation has only increased, and today I hope to lay out the case for the need for the legislation. 
Gang violence has become a problem in the United States of America of epic proportions, and I think few people really understand the degree to which street gangs are crossing State lines and perpetrating violence. 
Today, the Department of Justice reports that in the United States there are some 25,000 different street gangs. There are more than 652,000 members of these gangs. And they are not loosely organized. They are not the street kids glamorized in West Side Story. 
Today's gangs are very different. They are organized. They are sophisticated. They are traveling crime syndicates much like the Mafia. They regularly cross State lines to recruit new members. They traffic in drugs and weapons, they smuggle illegal aliens, they steal, and they murder. In just one city, Los Angeles, consider this: Nearly 7,300 of its citizens were murdered in the last 16 years from gang warfare--7,300 citizens. This is more people than have been killed in all of the fighting in Northern Ireland. 
Gangs were responsible for 43 percent of all homicides in Los Angeles in 1994. They were responsible for 41 percent of homicides in Omaha, NE, in 1995; more than half of all violent crimes in Buffalo, NY, in 1994. In Phoenix, gang-related homicides jumped 800 percent between 1990 and 1994. In Wichita, KS, drive-by shootings jumped from 8 in 1991 to 267 in 1993. That is a 3,000 percent increase in just 2 years. And this is a smaller city--300,000 people. A Justice Department survey found that gang problems are worsening in 48 percent of the responding communities. 
These are just a few examples of the alarming rise in gang terror. The problem is we have become numb to it. Let me give you an example. In Los Angeles, on a Monday last February, with Mayor Dick Riordan, I announced this legislation at a news conference. The Los Angeles city councilwoman who is in charge of the public safety committee, Laura Chick, reported that just that weekend six people had been murdered by gangs on the streets of Los Angeles, and you know what? Not one was reported in the press. We have become so numb because this kind of violence has become so commonplace all across the United States. 
Last September, a member of the Crips from Los Angeles was arrested in Dayton, OH, with two other men for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Police seized approximately $1 million in cash in the raid. 
A 1995 study of gang members by the National Gang Crime Research Center found that three-quarters of all gangs exist in more than one geographic area. One-half of gang members belong to gangs that did not arise locally but arose with contact from a gang outside the area. One-half of gang members had contact with the same gang in another city. And this is the clincher: 61 percent of gang members indicated their gang was an official branch of a larger national gang. 
Sergeant Jerry Flowers of the gang crime unit in Oklahoma City captured the migration instinct of these gangs when he said, `The gang leaders realized that the same ounce of crack cocaine they sold for $300 in Los Angeles was worth nearly $2,000 in Oklahoma City.' 
Let me now tell you about the size and scope of some of America's most prominent street gangs. The Los Angeles Times recently conducted one of the most intensive investigative reports of major gang activity ever conducted by a newspaper in the United States. 
Let me begin with the 18th Street Gang and the picture the L.A. Times painted. The 18th Street Gang has as many as 20,000 members in southern California alone--20 times the size of the notorious Bloods and Crips. 
The 18th Street Gang is so influential in narcotics trafficking that the gang now deals directly with Mexican and Colombian drug cartels. The 18th Street Gang actually rents street corners to nongang dope peddlers, forcing them to pay so-called taxes of up to $1,000 a day. 
The gang is growing and spreading. They have become the largest and fastest growing gang in Oregon, where they gunned down a 15-year-old member who wanted out of the gang. Utah officials say the 18th Street Gang has arrived there with a vengeance. 
Even internationally, the 18th Street Gang is fighting for turf. In El Salvador, 18th Street is warring with rival gangs. Honduran authorities have sought advice from Los Angeles law enforcement on the gang. 18th Street has a cell in Tijuana, where they often flee to escape arrest and prosecution. On the average, someone in Los Angeles County is assaulted or robbed by the 18th Street Gang every single day of every month of every year. 
While currently the deadliest and most prolific on the streets in southern California today, the 18th Street Gang is not the only gang. Let us talk for a moment about Bloods and Crips. 
The Bloods and Crips that originated in Los Angeles in the late 1960's are the Nation's two largest street gangs. They are also continuing to expand, and you see this expansion as they move across the United States. Local police and the FBI have traced factions of these gangs to more than 119 cities in the West and Midwest. Some of those cities are on this map. They have more than 60,000 members nationally. According to the FBI, narcotics trafficking is their principal source of income. 
Let me give another one, the Chicago-born Gangster Disciples. The Gangster Disciples, according to the authorities, is a Chicago-based, 30,000-member, multimillion-dollar gang operation spanning 35 States. They traffic in narcotics and weapons and are said to operate much like a Fortune 500 company, with two boards of directors, one in prison and one outside, a layer of governors and regents, a tax collector, and some 6,000 salespersons. Their income is estimated by Chicago authorities to be $300,000 daily. 
Let me talk for a minute about Russian gangs. Russian organized crime activity in the United States has been expanding for the past 20 years, but its most significant growth has occurred during the past 5 years. Mr. President, 29 States now report activities by Russian crime groups. FBI Director Louis Freeh stated that more than 200 of Russia's 6,000 crime gangs operate with American counterparts in the United States, so they flow from Russia to the United States and back. 
Russian gangs tend to be more loosely organized than other gangs, but they have formed networks that operate and shift alliances to meet particular needs. The California attorney general indicates that the most common activities by Russian organized crime gangs are fraud schemes involving fuel taxes, insurance, and credit card fraud. But they also engage in more common organized crime activities: extortion, loan sharking, drug trafficking, auto theft and prostitution. 
Asian gangs: The Department of Justice indicates that among ethnic gangs, Jamaican and Asian gangs are considered by law enforcement officials to pose the largest threat. Asian gangs have been identified as major threats in more than 17 cities. In Los Angeles alone, there are more than 100 Asian gangs with 10,000 members. Illegal activities include alien smuggling, murder, kidnapping, extortion, home-invasion robberies, high-technology heists, and firearms trafficking. 
Vietnamese gangs, in particular, have become a serious threat in many of our cities. They tend to be very violent. They are more sophisticated organizationally, and they specialize in stealing multimillion-dollar quantities of computer chips. At least 400 Silicon Valley companies in my State that deal in computer chips have been hit in the last year and a half. That is almost one a day. And they are losing tens of millions of dollars. Computer firms lose as much as $1 million a week in thefts, according to the Justice Department. 
The legislation Senator Hatch and I have introduced does this: It doubles the sentence for any member of an organized criminal gang who commits a Federal crime. It expands the scope of gang-related criminal acts to include activities such as carjacking and drive-by shootings, and significantly increases penalties for those crimes. It checks the growth of gangs by making the recruitment of minors into criminal gangs a Federal offense with stiff penalties. 
Specifically, this legislation doubles the actual sentence for any member of an organized criminal street gang who commits a Federal crime. Current Federal law increases the penalties for organizers, leaders, managers and supervisors of criminal activity, including gang leaders. However, members of known criminal street gangs currently are not subjected to higher penalties when a Federal crime is committed. Many prosecutors and law enforcement officials indicate that gang members, in addition to the leaders and supervisors of gangs, should see their penalties increased to provide a stronger deterrent for children to stay away from street gangs. 
This legislation amends the sentencing guidelines so that individual gang members convicted of felonies would have their sentencing level approximately doubled. For example, currently, if a first-time offender who is a member of a gang is convicted of trafficking in 30 stolen guns, he or she would receive a minimum sentence of 4 3/4 to 6 years in jail. Under this legislation, that sentence would be increased to 9 to 11 1/4 years. 
This legislation makes it a Federal offense to engage in a pattern of criminal gang activity, subject to severe and certain penalties. Under this legislation, if a person commits two or more predicate gang crimes, which include carjacking, drive-by shooting, drug dealing and obstruction of justice, in furtherance of a criminal street gang's activities within a 5-year period, that gangster is engaging in a pattern of criminal gang activity and he can be prosecuted federally. This is the Federal-local partnership we envision, to get at gang activity that crosses State lines. And this individual, if convicted, will be sentenced to at least 10 years in prison, up to life imprisonment for a first conviction of this offense; will be sentenced to at least 20 years imprisonment up to life imprisonment for a second or later conviction of this offense; and would be subject to asset seizures and forfeitures. 
This legislation expands the definition of criminal street gangs in Federal law to better reflect modern-day gang activity. So it broadens the definition of criminal street gangs in title 18 of the criminal code to include State crimes such as drive-by shootings, rape, torture, carjacking, kidnapping, and assault with a deadly weapon. 
It doubles the penalties for interstate gang-related crimes, and it expands the Travel Act to respond more effectively to the growing problem of highly sophisticated, mobile and organized street gangs. As most of us know, the Travel Act was written in 1961 and it had Mafia-style activity in mind. While the Travel Act as it is now written allows prosecutors to target some gang activities such as drug trafficking, the list is not complete. Law enforcement leaders and prosecutors, including U.S. attorneys, have recommended to us that the act be modernized to better reflect current crimes by gang members.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, under this legislation, the list of unlawful activities in the Travel Act will be expanded to include the following crimes: drive-by shooting; robbery; burglary; assault with a deadly weapon; intimidation of witnesses, victims, jurors or informants; assault resulting in bodily injury; possession and/or trafficking of stolen property; alien smuggling; and firearms trafficking. 
In addition, the maximum penalties would be doubled, from 5 to 10 years, for those who commit nonviolent violations of these provisions. A conspiracy provision is also added to the statute. 
We double the base offense levels under the sentencing guidelines for traveling in interstate or foreign commerce in aid of a street gang. This is to get at those gangs that come from other countries and States and operate back and forth. So traveling in interstate or foreign commerce in aid of a street gang would increase from 6 to 12 in sentencing levels, which increases the base sentencing range from a low of 0 to 6 months and a high of 12 to 18 months, to a new low of 10 to 16 months and a new high of 30 to 37 months. Committing violent crimes in aid of a street gang or racketeering activity would increase from 12 to 24, which increases the base sentencing range from a low of 10 to 16 months and a high of 30 to 37 months, to a new low of 51 to 63 months and a new high of 100 to 125 months. 
One of the most insidious tactics of today's gangs is the way they target children to do their dirty work, and they indoctrinate them into a life of crime. Let me give you an example. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, the 18th Street Gang, which I described earlier, `resembles a kind of children's army,' with recruiters who scout middle schools for 11- to 13-year-old children to join the gang. The gang's real leaders are middle-age veteranos, long-time gang members who direct this criminal activity from the background. 
Chicago's Gangster Disciples recruit not just at high schools, but even at elementary schools. One of the gang's members told a Federal court about his preference for children 17 and under as armed guards, `because they can go to jail and get out quicker.' 
This pattern is not unusual. A report by the National Gang Crime Research Center found, `The term `youth gang' is itself somewhat of a misnomer when it comes to the major gangs in America today * * * the real leaders at the top of these major gangs are in fact older adults, many in their forties and even older * * * 84.8 percent'--85 percent--`of the gang members in our sample indicated that their gang does in fact have such older adult leaders.' 
Current Federal law contains no penalty for recruiting minors to participate in gang activity, and this is a critical part of our legislation. This legislation makes the recruitment or solicitation of persons to participate in gang activity subject to a 1-year minimum and a 10-year maximum penalty, or a fine of up to $250,000. If a minor is recruited or solicited, the minimum penalty is increased to 4 years. 
In addition, the person convicted of this crime would have to pay the costs of housing, maintaining and treating the juvenile until the juvenile reaches the age of 18. 
This act also makes violation of this section a predicate offense under the racketeering statutes, known as RICO statutes. 
It is now a crime to knowingly transfer a firearm to be used to commit a violent crime or a drug trafficking crime. This legislation adds a mandatory minimum penalty of 3 years if the gun to be used in crime is transferred to a minor. 
This legislation increases penalties for transferring handguns to minors. The Youth Handgun Safety Act, passed by Congress as part of the 1994 crime bill, does not contain sufficient penalties against juveniles who possess handguns for criminal purposes. In fact, one provision of this act requires only probation for first-time juvenile offenders who possess a handgun. 
Such a weak penalty has meant that prosecutors don't bother to 
target and prosecute gang members. I have been told this by U.S. attorneys and by district attorneys, and we aim to correct that problem with this language. In addition, current law sets different penalties for juveniles and adults who transfer a weapon to a minor. The Federal Gang Violence Act toughens the penalties against juveniles and adults who transfer a firearm to a minor--and subjects juveniles and adults to the same penalties for violating this law. 
This legislation changes the Youth Handgun Safety Act by: 
First, setting a one-year minimum sentence for anyone--adult or juvenile--who provides a minor with a handgun. 
Second, holding juveniles accountable when they unlawfully give another minor a firearm by applying the same 5-year maximum sentence now given to adults. 
Third, setting a 1-year minimum sentence and applying the same 10-year maximum sentence to adults and juveniles who give a firearm to a minor and should have known the gun would be used in a crime of violence. Currently, the 10-year maximum sentence only applies to adults. 
Juveniles under 13 years old, however, would not be subject to these mandatory minimum sentences. 
The Armed Career Criminal Act provides that if a person has three or more prior convictions for certain crimes--is a `career criminal'--and he possesses, ships, transports or receives a gun or ammunition--is armed--he will be subject to a mandatory minimum 15 year penalty and fine of up to $25,000. 
Serious drug offenses are already in the list of crimes which count toward the three-conviction minimum; this bill would allow juvenile convictions for serious drug offenses to also count toward that three-conviction minimum. 
This would not apply to nickel-and-dime possession offenses, but to drug dealing which is punishable by 10 or more years in prison. 
Many police officers around the country are confronting heavily-armed gang members who are wearing bullet-proof vests. 
This legislation increases Federal sentences if a person wears body armor in the commission of a Federal offense, by directing the Sentencing Commission to provide for a sentencing enhancement under the Guidelines of at least two levels. 
Presently, a 30-day time limit exists for bringing juveniles to trial. With crimes being committed by juveniles becoming increasingly violent and complex, prosecutors need additional time to adequately develop cases. This legislation increases the time limit to 45 days. 
This bill adds firearms trafficking violations to the list of crimes that can be attacked by prosecutors under RICO. Currently, firearms violations are not RICO predicate acts. Prosecutors and law enforcement officials indicate an increasing use of firearms by criminal street gangs to commit home robberies, business invasions, and attacks on rival gangs. 
Since most of the firearms have moved in interstate commerce--and because firearms are such an integral part of the gang's activity--law enforcement officials have suggested that firearms violations become predicate acts under RICO. 
Finally, this legislation authorizes $100 million over the next 5 years for hiring additional Federal prosecutors to prosecute violent youth gangs. 
I don't mean to go into detail, but I really want this body to understand that in this Senator's opinion, and I think Senator Hatch's and our cosponsors', this Nation's No. 1 criminal threat comes from organized street gangs now moving vociferously across State lines and across international lines. If we don't move now, I think we surrender the independence of this Nation to a kind of underground world of street gangs connected in Russia, connected in Asia, connected in Japan, connected in Latin America. and Central America. 
What we aim to do is up the penalties and create some new penalties which can really be effective in dealing with crime. The 
addition of the RICO statutes, the use of asset seizures and forfeitures, treating street gangs today the way mafia organized crime was treated 10 to 15 years ago can make a big dent and deter gangs. Most important to me is that it becomes a Federal offense for anyone to go out there and recruit a member of a gang that moves their stolen goods, illegal immigrants, drugs, guns, murder, extortion, witness intimidation across State lines. 
Mr. President, I would like to make one last comment on another subject before I yield the floor.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this morning, on my way to work, on Connecticut Avenue, I ran into the fact that another bomb had been placed at a Planned Parenthood center. This is just January, and the number of these bombings and attempted bombings are already over six. 
I rise today really to deplore these acts, and I rise today to say to the right-to-life movement: Please, make clear that terrorism is not part of your agenda. If you fail to do so and fail to do so now, I believe we are in for a terrible siege this year, if the month of January is any indication. 
I am also hopeful that the Attorney General will join in the investigation and the subsequent prosecution as our legislation of the last session provides. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished chairman for his comments and also for the speed with which he processed this nomination. I think it is very important and significant that he has done that, and it certainly speaks for the best interests of bipartisanship. 
Mr. President, as the only woman on the Foreign Relations Committee, I consider this to be a historic appointment indeed. I rise to say that I am proud to indicate my very enthusiastic support for Madeleine Albright to be confirmed before this body as Secretary of State. 
I want to commend President Clinton because he was certainly faced with an array of very qualified candidates. But I think he chose one of the very, very best. Anyone who heard her thoughtful responses to some 6 hours of questioning during her confirmation hearing would have been impressed by her knowledge, her eloquence and her skill. I fully expect Ambassador Albright to be a truly superb Secretary of State. 
I look forward to working with her as various foreign policy issues come before the Senate of the United States. It is difficult to imagine a background and a body of experience better suited to the person we call on to be our Nation's chief diplomat and the President's chief foreign policy advisor. Madeleine Albright knows firsthand the `streets' of foreign policy, how actions by governments affect the lives of individuals. Her enormous intellect, her personal experience, her plain speaking, I think, will be huge assets. 
As the United States approaches the 21st century, I believe it is crucial that our foreign policy be conducted in a bipartisan manner. The practice of reinventing the wheel of foreign policy every 4 years or at least with every change of administration has been difficult on our allies and weakens American credibility as the strongest nation on Earth. 
Madeleine Albright holds a unique opportunity to cement a bipartisan foreign policy. If she can accomplish this, her legacy to this Nation and the world will be significant. One of the most complex issues that she will face, and the largest single area that I believe needs focused attention, is the entire Pacific rim. With 60 percent of the people of the world now living on the shores of the Pacific and American trade with the Pacific rim nations three times that of the Atlantic, the administration's No. 1 priority in foreign policy should be to maintain a strong and 
positive presence in Asia. 
As part of this effort, the United States must build our most important, but still largely undeveloped, bilateral relationship--that with the People's Republic of China--into one of partnership and cooperation in our many areas of mutual interest. 
Ambassador Albright's qualifications to be Secretary of State are unimpeachable. For the past 4 years she has served with distinction as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, a member of the President's Cabinet, and a member of the staff of the National Security Council. 
She has also headed one of Washington's foremost think tanks, served as professor of international affairs at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, and holds a doctorate from Columbia University. And, I might add, she served as a staff member for one of the true giants of the U.S. Senate, Edmund Muskie, who himself went on to serve as Secretary of State. 
Beyond her professional accomplishments, her life--having fled Czechoslovakia at the dawn of the Second World War--provides a lesson in the values that we as Americans hold most dear and for the role in the world that America, at its best, can play. 
As the first woman to serve as Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright's nomination will open up new doors for all women, not just in this country, but around the globe, in places unaccustomed to seeing women in high office. Whenever a woman crosses a threshold into an area that has been predominantly held by men, and performs effectively, the doors open for women everywhere. 
I take particular pride in casting my vote for Ambassador Madeleine Albright. It is a tremendous step forward in our country for a woman to be named the Nation's top diplomat. As consequential as that is, in Madeleine Albright's case it is really a secondary consideration, because she is so eminently qualified for the job. 
Although I am sure it is unnecessary to do so, I take pride in urging all of my colleagues to support this outstanding nomination. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator Snowe and I are introducing S. 87, a bill to set up a toll-free service so that people with life-threatening diseases and the medical community can find out about research projects on new treatments. 
There are thousands of serious and life-threatening diseases, diseases for which we have no cure. For genetic diseases alone, there are 3,000 to 4,000. We are familiar with diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. But there are thousands of others that are not so common, like cystinosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Wilson's disease, and Sjogren's syndrome. Indeed, there are over 5,000 known rare diseases, diseases most of us have never heard of, affecting between 10 and 20 million Americans. 
Cancer kills half a million Americans per year. Diabetes afflicts 15 million Americans per year, half of whom do not know they have it. Arthritis affects 40 million Americans every year. 15,000 American children die every year. Among children, the rates of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma, bronchitis and sinusitis), heart murmurs, migraine headaches, anemia, epilepsy and diabetes are increasing. Few families escape illness today. Every family fears it.
