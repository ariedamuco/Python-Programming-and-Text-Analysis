    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask to print in the RECORD a letter from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets strongly supporting the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. 
   The act provides certainty for over-the-counter swaps and authorizes a new financial product, the ``security future,'' to be traded under a regulatory scheme that protects investors against fraud, market manipulation and insider trading. 
   The act contains three principal components. It would provide legal certainty that specified types of swaps which are traded over-the-counter are not regulated as futures. The Report of the President's Working Group on Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act, issued in November 1999, strongly recommended that Congress enact legislation to provide OTC swaps with legal certainty in order to ``reduce systemic risk in the U.S. financial markets and enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. financial sector.'' 
   In addition the act would authorize trading in futures on single stocks and narrow-based stock indices. These are new investment products which, until now, have been prohibited from trading by the Shad-Johnson Accord, which this act would repeal. By authorizing  securities futures, the act would allow financial markets to increase the number of products they trade and give investors additional investment options. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission negotiated the proposed regulatory regimen over securities futures, which is designed to protect investors against fraud, insider trading and market manipulation. The regulatory regimen will call for joint regulation by both the SEC and CFTC of these markets and the intermediaries that trade in them. Imposing strong investor protections is absolutely necessary if we are to allow trading in these new investment products. 
   The act also contains regulatory relief provisions for the futures markets that would codify recent CFTC regulations. 
   I would like to highlight certain important aspects of titles III and IV of the act. 
   Title III addresses the SEC's authority over security-based swap agreements. It carefully carves out products traditionally viewed as securities in exclusions from the definition of swap agreements. It is important to note that title III does not eliminate the SEC's existing authority to regulate products that are securities. 
   Title III applies anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the Federal securities laws to securities-based swap agreements, including those entered into by banks. Title III amends section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its anti-fraud protections to apply to ``any securities-based swap agreement.'' In extending these protections, the act makes explicit that rules promulgated under section 10(b) to address fraud, manipulation, or insider trading apply to securities-based swap agreements. Thus, current and future anti-fraud rules will apply to swap agreements to the same extent as they do to securities. This will enhance protection for investors and for the financial markets, and will permit the SEC to respond as necessary to developments in these markets. 
   Title III states that existing judicial precedent relating to various securities statutes and rules is applicable to securities-based swaps to the same extent as it is to securities. Thus, for example, cases interpreting these statutory provisions which establish theories of liability and private rights of actions would apply directly to securities-based swaps. 
   Title IV, Legal Certainty for Bank Products Act of 2000, clarifies the current law, under which the CFTC does not regulate traditional banking products. Such products include deposit accounts, CDs, banker's acceptances, letters of credit, loans, credit card accounts, and loan participations. When a question arises, title IV provides a mechanism for determining whether a product is an ``identified,'' or traditional, banking product. To qualify as an identified banking product, section 403 requires two conditions to be met: (1) that the product cannot have been either prohibited by the Commodity Exchange Act or regulated by the CFTC on or before December 5, 2000, and (2) that the bank has obtained a certification from its regulator that the bank product was commonly offered by any bank prior to December 5, 2000. The latter test requires that the product was actively bought, sold, purchased, or offered by or to multiple customers and is not just a transaction customized for a single client or handful of clients. 
   Section 405 excludes a hybrid product from the Commodity Exchange Act if under a ``predominance test'' it is primarily an identified banking product and not a contract, agreement or transaction appropriately regulated by the CFTC. The act dictates how to resolve disputes about the application of this test. 
   The bill's definition of ``security future'' does not include products excluded under title IV and other sections of the Commodity Exchange Act, e.g., certain swaps, identified banking products, etc. Thus, the new grants of authority of this act to the SEC would not extend to these products. However, these exclusions do not limit the definition of ``security'' or the SEC's jurisdiction under existing statutes. For example, the SEC has, and will continue to have, jurisdiction over all over-the counter options. 
   The act will have a significant impact on the futures markets as well as on the securities markets and investors. The United States investment markets are the envy of the world. This act is intended to strengthen those markets as it provides legal certainly for over-the-counter swaps, authorizes the trading of futures on single stocks and narrow-based stock indices, and gives regulatory relief for the futures markets. 
   The letter from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets follows:  
   December 15, 2000. Hon. PAUL S. SARBANES,  Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President. I am pleased to see that we are passing this bipartisan piece of housing legislation today. While there are provisions that were not included in the bill, which I thought were worthy of passage, on the whole, the ``American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000'' is a bill that should become law. I would like to highlight just a few parts of this legislation that we worked particularly hard on over the last two years. 
   First is the manufactured housing bill, that has been incorporated into this legislation. This bill establishes a national minimum installation standard for manufactured homes, ensuring that the home as installed performs as advertised. We have created a dispute resolution program, so that owners, many of whom are lower-income, are not mistreated when they are trying to have a defect in their home corrected. This bill also updates the safety standard setting process for the manufactured housing industry, which will allow new innovations in technology to be incorporated into homes more quickly, making them safer, more efficient, and cheaper for homeowners. Passage of this portion of the bill would not have been possible without the help of Senators KERRY, EDWARDS, BAYH, and SHELBY, and their respective staff, namely Lendell Porterfield and Josh Stein. I would like to thank all of these individuals for their contributions throughout the process of writing, negotiating, and passing this legislation. 
   I also want to associate myself with the remarks made by Chairman LEACH and Congressman FRANK in the House of Representatives on October 24, 2000 regarding the contracting language in this bill. Their colloquy clarified the intention of this section. 
   The legislation includes language taken from S. 2733 designed to increase the supply of low-income elderly and disabled housing by expanding available capital for such projects. We allow service providers in federally assisted elderly and disabled facilities to include eligible residents in the surrounding neighborhood in their programs, expanding their service to the community as a whole. 
   In addition, there are provisions which will allow Rural Housing Service to refinance guaranteed loans, reducing costs for low income rural homeowners, and a new program to expand housing opportunities to Native Hawaiians and Native Americans. Both of these changes will make a big difference in the lives of low income families. 
   Finally, the legislation reauthorizes a number of agency reports under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee which would otherwise have expired this year. These reports include the Federal Reserve's Semiannual Report on Monetary Policy, the Economic Report of the President, the annual reports of the federal financial regulatory agencies, and a number of other significant reports in the area of consumer protection. These reports are vital to the exercise of the Banking Committee's oversight function, and I am very pleased that the House and the Senate were able to reach agreement on their reauthorization. 
   I reiterate my approval for the substance of this bill. I am glad to see us pass these portions of different pieces of legislation this session, though I regret that a low-income housing production program was not included.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to pass legislation that has been sent to us by the House of Representatives that would change the name of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. This is one, small step we can take to honor a colleague who devoted his life to public service, particularly service on behalf of the most disadvantaged Americans. 
   Bruce F. Vento has been one of the most effective advocates on behalf of homeless people throughout his career. Mr. Vento was one of the first Members of Congress to bring the plight of the nation's homeless to the public's attention. In 1982, Bruce introduced legislation in the House of Representatives to create the Emergency Shelter Grant Program. He attached an amendment to a housing bill to provide matching grants to repair vacant buildings to be used as temporary shelters. This became the first national legislation to provide federal assistance for emergency homeless shelters. 
   Throughout the 1980s, Mr. Vento worked repeatedly, with his colleagues on the House Banking Committee, to raise the profile of this issue and to build the coalitions necessary to enact comprehensive legislation to help the homeless across this nation. In early 1987, Representative Vento worked to pass an aid package that included $100 million for a program of emergency shelter grants to help charitable organizations and state and local governments renovate buildings for the homeless and succeeded in enacting the legislation into law. 
   In that same year, Congressman Vento was an original author of a larger, more comprehensive measure that became known as the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the first and only coordinated federal initiative directed toward the problem of homelessness and the only social program that was passed during the Reagan era. The McKinney Act seeks to meet some of the immediate needs of the homeless: shelter, food, health care, education, job training services, and transitional housing through programs at HUD, FEMA, HHS, and the Education and Labor Departments. This legislation continues to be at the heart of the federal government's response to the ongoing problem of homelessness in America. 
   It is indeed fitting to honor Bruce Vento by joining his name with that of his friend and colleague, Stewart B. McKinney, on this legislation. In 1987, after Representative McKinney's passing, Bruce took a leading role in seeking to name the programs that would serve persons who are homeless as the McKinney Act because of Stewart McKinney's ``close association and concern and compassion that he espoused and reflected throughout his service'' in Congress. We all recognize how well these very 
   same words, which Mr. Vento used to describe Stewart McKinney, embody the work and career of Bruce F. Vento himself. 
   Shortly after taking office, President Clinton asked then-speaker of the House Tom Foley to organize a Task Force to look into the problem of homelessness. In February of that year, Mr. Vento was appointed as the Chairman of that Task Force, which issued a comprehensive, nationally recognized report to the Speaker one year later. 
   During the past few years, Mr. Vento continued to work hard on the McKinney Act. He added language that improved prevention planning and activities so that people do not become homeless due to lack of foresight or planning. The Vento prevention language added discharge planning requirements for persons who are discharged from publicly funded institutions, that is, mental health facilities, youth facilities and correctional facilities, so that people are not merely discharged to the streets. 
   Mr. Vento also introduced the ``Stand Down Authorization Act.'' Created by several Vietnam veterans, Stand Downs are designed to give homeless veterans a brief respite from life on the streets. The Stand Down bill would, in conjunction with the grassroots community, expand the VA's role in providing outreach assistance to homeless veterans. In this Congress, H.R. 566 gained the strong support of over 100 bipartisan cosponsors, the VA, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and the Disabled American Vets (DAV). 
   Bruce Vento worked throughout his entire career to improve and save the lives of homeless men, women and children around this nation. In the tradition of Minnesota's great leader, Hubert H. Humphrey, Bruce has always believed that we are elected to formulate and enact policies which improve the quality of life of our citizens. I have had the pleasure of working with him these many years to do just that. That is why I urge you to join me in enacting into law this legislation to rename our nation's fundamental homeless statute the McKinney-Vento Act. This act will duly honor a colleague who has worked long and hard for the most vulnerable Americans, people who are without a home to call their own. 
   Mr. President, while this legislation deals with homelessness, I want to make it clear that Mr. Vento's interests and accomplishments go far beyond this important area. He was one of the strongest proponents of FHA in the Congress. He understood how FHA has been a crucial tool in helping millions of families attain the dream of homeownership in America. 
   Mr. Vento played an active role in helping craft the bipartisan public housing reform legislation that passed in 1998. He was a leader in the effort to preserve affordable housing that has been threatened by expiring use restrictions or rental assistance contracts. Important progress as made on this front last year. He was a strong supporter of the effort to increase and strengthen community-based non-profits in their efforts to develop affordable housing and revitalize our communities. 
   Mr. Vento has been a longstanding supporter of the Community Reinvestment Act, CRA, because he understood how access to capital for homeownership and small businesses is the key to ensuring equal opportunity for all Americans, regardless of the neighborhoods they live in or their economic status. I was privileged to work closely with him to preserve CRA during the debate on financial services modernization legislation. 
   Finally, Mr. Vento was a strong supporter of consumer protection laws, from the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, to the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act. 
   Renaming the McKinney Act is one small way that all of us can honor Mr. Vento's memory. Mr. President, Bruce Vento will be sorely missed in the Congress of the United States. I want to join President Clinton, my colleagues, and many others in expressing my deepest sympathies to Mr. Vento's family and friends.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank Senators BOND and MIKULSKI for their good work on this year's VA-HUD appropriations bill. Also, I would like to congratulate Secretary Cuomo on the hard work he has done to raise awareness of the critical housing needs many Americans are experiencing around the country. 
   As the ranking member on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, I have a very keen interest in the portion of this bill that funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
   This year's budget is a strong step in the right direction. The bill contains increases in spending for many of the critical housing programs that serve middle- and low-income families. 
   It includes funding for nearly 80,000 new section 8 housing vouchers. These vouchers will provide additional housing resources for families experiencing critical housing needs. 
   Funding for the HOME and CDBG programs has been increased by $200 million and $300 million over last year's levels respectively. These are programs that local governments and non-profits rely on to build and rehabilitate affordable housing, as well as revitalize communities. 
   The Committee has also provided for an increase in the homeless budget, which includes emergency shelter, permanent housing, counseling, and job training services. For the approximately 500,000 people that are homeless in this country on any given night, this additional money will mean a better chance to find a bed in a shelter, a soup kitchen at which to eat, or a permanent home. 
   They also took the important step of providing a stream of funding to renew Shelter Plus Care vouchers. This will enable local providers to continue to build up the infrastructure they need to serve this vulnerable population. 
   This year's budget builds on the public housing reform legislation we passed two years ago by increasing the public housing operating and capital funds, enabling local public housing authorities to maintain and invest in their properties. 
   Also included is a two year extension of The Federal Housing Administration's Down Payment Simplification Program. This will allow the FHA to continue using the simplified formula to extend homeownership to more American families. 
   Additionally, there is an increase in spending for the Lead Paint Hazard program, a very important program for cities trying to abate the poisonous lead paint found in their housing stock. 
   Lastly, I want to thank Senators BOND and MIKULSKI for their efforts in pushing one provision that did not make it into the bill, that is, a new housing production program. While I am disappointed that we were unable to achieve this in the end, I appreciate their acknowledgment of the housing crisis our nation is experiencing. 
   The long-term answer to this problem will have to be the dedication of new resources to building additional housing. While the nearly 80,000 new section 8 vouchers will help to alleviate the severe housing crunch that many working American families experience, I hope we will be able to revisit the topic of production again next year. 
   All in all, this is a very good bill. I am very pleased and again congratulate my colleagues on a well thought out, well funded, piece of legislation.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to reauthorize the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park Commission. The current authority for the Commission expires in January of 2001, and this bill would extend that authority for another 10 years. Joining me in introducing this legislation are Senators MIKULSKI, WARNER and ROBB. 
   Mr. President, the C&O Canal National Historical Park is one of the most unique in this Nation and one of the most heavily visited. It begins in this great city, the Nation's Capital and extends 184 miles to its original terminus in Cumberland, Maryland. As you can imagine, the development of plans for the preservation and use of this park is a major undertaking. It is no easy task to protect and preserve a park which averages 100 yards in width but is 184 miles long. 
   The work of the Commission is not finished. The Commission is composed of representatives of the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of West Virginia, the District of Columbia, the counties in Maryland through which the park runs, and members at large. The passage of this  bill will permit the Commission to complete the rational process begun so many years ago to ensure that this unique part of America's natural and historical heritage is properly preserved. 
   I encourage those who are interested in the C&O Canal to join in sponsoring this legislation, and it is my hope that it can be enacted in this Congress.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate and welcome to our Nation's Capitol the two middle schools and two high schools from Maryland that have been named Blue Ribbon School Award winners by the United States Department of Education. These schools are among only 198 middle and high schools nationwide to be honored with this award, the most prestigious national school recognition for public and private schools. 
   The designation as a Blue Ribbon School is a ringing endorsement of the successful techniques which enable the students of these schools to succeed and achieve. Over the past few years, I have made a commitment to visit the Blue Ribbon Schools and have always been delighted to see first hand the interaction between parents, teachers, and the community, which strongly contributed to the success of the school. I look forward to visiting each of these four schools and congratulating the students, teachers and staff personally for this exceptional accomplishment. 
   According to the Department of Education, Blue Ribbon Schools have been judged to be particularly effective in meeting local, state and national goals. These schools also display the qualities of excellence that are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of the next century. Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools which have strong leadership; a clear vision and sense of mission that is shared by all connected with the school; high quality teaching; challenging, up-to-date curriculum; policies and practices that ensure a safe environment conducive to learning; a solid commitment to family involvement; evidence that the school helps all students achieve high standards; and a commitment to share the best practices with other schools. 
   After a screening process by each State Department of Education, the Department of Defense Dependent Schools, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Council for American Private Education, the Blue Ribbon School nominations were forwarded to the U.S. Department of Education. A panel of outstanding educators from around the country then reviewed the nominations, selected schools for site visits, and made recommendations to Secretary of Education Richard Riley.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Protection Act of 2000. It is critically important that the Congress soon pass this legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and to continue the progress made since the Act was first passed in 1994. 
   I am proud to have been a cosponsor of both the original Violence Against Women Act, VAWA as well as S. 2787 and other legislation introduced in the 106th Congress to reauthorize VAWA. Through a $1.6 billion grants program, VAWA has provided hundreds of thousands of women with shelter to protect their families, established a national toll-free hotline which has responded to innumerable calls for help, and funded domestic violence prevention programs across the Nation. Most importantly, VAWA has provided a new emphasis on domestic violence as a critical problem that cannot be tolerated or ignored. 
   In my own State of Maryland, the funding provided by VAWA is essential to the continued operation of facilities like Heartly House in Frederick, Maryland, which provides shelter to battered women, accompanies rape victims on hospital visits, and assists women in crisis in numerous other ways. In Baltimore City, VAWA funds have helped create a dedicated docket in the District Court which has effectively increased the number of domestic violence cases prosecuted. In Montgomery County, Maryland, VAWA funds provide victims with legal representation in civil protective order hearings. Importantly, the staff for this program is located inside the Courthouse, making it easy and safe for victims to get the help that they need. VAWA funds are being used creatively in Garrett County, where the Sheriff's Department purchased a four wheel drive vehicle so that their domestic violence team can travel to remote areas of the county--overcoming the feelings of isolation many victims feel, particularly in the winter months. 
   Programs like these are working in Maryland and all across the country to reduce the incidence of domestic violence. And, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, VAWA is working. Intimate partners committed fewer murders in 1996, 1997, and 1998 than in any other year since 1976. Likewise, the number of female victims of intimate partner violence declined from 1993 to 1998; in 1998, women experienced an estimated 876,340 violent offenses at the hands of a partner, down from 1.1 million in 1993. 
   But despite these successes, clearly the incidence of violence against women and families remains too high. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV), over 50 percent of all women will experience physical violence in an intimate relationship, and for 24-30 percent of those women the battering will be regular and on-going. Additionally, the NCADV reports that between 50 and 70 percent of men who abuse their female partners also abuse their children. 
   Even though strides have been made, we still have a long way to go before domestic violence is evicted from our homes and communities. It is critically important that we not allow VAWA to expire, and that we take this opportunity to reauthorize VAWA and build upon its success. The Violence Against Women Protection Act of 2000 will authorize more than $3 billion over five years for VAWA grant program and make important improvements to the original statute. For example, S. 2787 will authorize a new temporary housing program to help move women out of shelters and into more stable living accommodations. S. 2787 will also make it easier for battered immigrant women to leave their abusers without fear of deportation, and target additional funds to combatting domestic violence on college campuses. Finally, the legislation will improve procedures to allow states to enforce protection orders across jurisdictional boundaries. 
   VAWA has made real strides against domestic violence, and the Violence Against Women Protection Act will continue the important work begun in 1994. I am proud to report of the valuable programs all across Maryland combatting domestic violence thanks to VAWA, and I urge Senate leaders to bring S. 2787 to the floor for consideration as soon as possible. We have an invaluable opportunity to make a statement that domestic violence will not be tolerated, and that all women and children should be able to live without fear in their own homes.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4444, which would provide for the extension of Permanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, to the People's Republic of China. 
   The proponents of this measure would have us believe that the decision to support PNTR is completely one-sided, with all the benefits going to the United States and none to the Chinese. If that analysis were correct, one would have to believe that the Chinese are either naive or simply being charitable to the United States. I don't think either of those propositions is true. 
   In my view, it would not only be counter to the trade interests of the United States to grant PNTR to China, but it would undermine other important bilateral U.S. interests with that country, including national security, foreign policy, human rights, religious freedom, labor rights, and environmental protection. We should be seeking permanent normal relations with China 
   which would link all of our diverse interests with China into an integrated policy, but I do not support Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China in the absence of achieving permanent normal relations. In other words, we should not separate out the trade relationship alone without addressing these other important matters that are at issue between us. 
   Let me address then why I do not think it is in the U.S. national interest to grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China at this time. 
   The decision to grant PNTR to China is linked to China becoming a member of the WTO, the World Trade Organization. Under the rules of the WTO, member countries are obliged to grant unqualified most-favored-nation treatment to each other. In the view of the supporters of PNTR, the United States must grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China so the United States will be able to utilize the dispute resolution mechanism of the WTO to enforce compliance by China with trade agreements. In fact, the WTO agreement has been characterized as being completely one-sided in favor of the United States. A summary of the arguments in favor of the agreement prepared by the Administration stated:  
   This is not a trade agreement in the traditional sense. This is a one-way deal. We would simply maintain the market access policies that we already apply to China.  
   I believe this assertion overlooks some very important considerations. Until now, the United States has been free to link trade to any of our other concerns with China--national security, foreign policy, human rights, religious freedom, labor rights, environmental protection. With the exception of national security, granting PNTR to China would effectively end the ability of the United States to link trade with any of our other concerns with China because it would violate WTO rules. Even national security, for which the WTO has an exemption, would be subject to challenge and review within the WTO. Further, within the trade area itself, the United States would not be able to use U.S. trade laws to enforce compliance by China with its trade commitments. 
   If one stops and thinks about this for a moment, it seems clear that China is achieving a fundamental strategic objective which, from its point of view, is enormously in its self-interest. The proponents of granting PNTR to China want the decision to be viewed through the narrow prism of trade relations because on that basis they believe the agreement is defensible. Even on those terms, I believe extending PNTR to China is an unwise decision, but it completely ignores the broader and more fundamental interests the United States is abandoning by granting PNTR to China. 
   I will review the U.S. trade relationship with China and why, even from the narrow perspective of trade, granting PNTR to China is not in the U.S. national interest. I will then review the broader interests the United States has at stake in this decision, some of which are underscored by the amendment that is now pending. 
   Let me turn first to the bilateral trade relationship. Our bilateral trade relationship with China is our most one-sided significant bilateral trade relationship. We have been running a steadily increasing trade deficit with China for nearly two decades. In 1985, we had a trade deficit of $9 million. Since then, it has set a new record every year, rising from $1.6 billion in 1986 to $10.4 billion in 1990, to $29.4 billion in 1994, and $56.8 billion in 1998. In 1999, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit with China reached a record $69 billion. This chart shows very clearly this incredible deterioration in the trade relationship as it takes a downward plunge in terms of our trade balance. 
   The trade balance has continued to deteriorate in 2000. The Commerce Department reports that the U.S. trade deficit with China for the first 6 months of this year is over 23 percent higher than over the first 6 months of last year. In fact, it is very close to becoming the largest single bilateral trade deficit of the United 
   States. At the moment, it is surpassed only by Japan. 
   This chart traces back to 1975. These are U.S. exports to China which have risen a bit, but not very much, and these are U.S. imports from China which, of course, are ascending at a very steep pace, and the difference gives us, of course, the trade balance which was shown in the previous chart. On this very small amount of trade, $95 billion--there is $13 billion in exports from the United States to China and $82 billion in imports from China--we now are on our way, I think, to where we will shortly have our largest trade deficit with China. 
   It is important to appreciate this point because it underscores how important our trade relationship is with China and, in my judgment, therefore, underscores the necessity of not putting this trade relationship to one side, which would prevent us from trying to solve the other problems in our relationship. 
   What is not fully appreciated, however, is that relative to the size of the overall volume of trade with China, the U.S. trade relationship with China is far more one-sided than with any other country in the world. For example, in 1999 we had a trade deficit with Japan of $74 billion. That was based on a total volume of trade with Japan of $189 billion. In contrast, the $69 billion U.S. trade deficit with China was based on a  total volume of trade of $95 billion. With Japan, we have twice as much trade and almost the same deficit, a little more than we have with China. With China, the trade relationship is virtually a one-way street, and we need to understand and appreciate that. 
   This pattern is repeated to an even greater extreme with other large U.S. trading partners--Canada, the European Union, and Mexico. This chart shows U.S. exports as a percent of bilateral trade with China, with Japan, with Canada, with the E.U., and with Mexico. As one can see, even with Japan, exports make 30 percent of the total volume of trade--a little above 30 percent. With Canada and Europe and Mexico, it is in the mid-40 percent. With China, it is at 14 percent. The trade relationship with China is virtually a one-way street. It is Chinese exports coming to this country; it is not American exports going to China. 
   Even if one compares it with the Asian countries, we find the same situation. 
   U.S. exports to China as a percent of bilateral trade is, again, at about 14 percent. As you can see with Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore, it ranges anywhere from under 40 percent to almost 50 percent. 
   One may say: Well, maybe China has this kind of trade relationship with everybody. So let's briefly examine its trade relationship with Japan and the European Union as compared with the United States. 
   China's total trade volume in 1999 with the United States, $95 billion; with the European Union, $73 billion; with Japan, $69 billion. Yet the surpluses that China ran with us were by far the largest relative to the overall amount of trade with these countries. So you can see that once again the trade relationship with the United States is extremely one sided.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators KERRY, GRASSLEY, LEVIN, and ROCKEFELLER in introducing the Clinton/Gore administration's International Counter-Money Laundering and Foreign Anti-Corruption Act of 2000 (``ICMLA''). Money laundering poses an ongoing threat to the financial stability of the United States. It is estimated by the Department of the Treasury that the global volume of laundered money accounts for between 2-5 percent of the global GDP. 
   The ICMLA is designed to bolster the United States ability to counter the  laundering of the proceeds of drug trafficking, organized crime, terrorism, and official corruption from abroad. The bill broadens the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury, ensures that banking transactions and financial relationships do not contravene the purposes of current antimoney laundering statutes, provides a clear mandate for subjecting foreign jurisdictions that facilitate money laundering to special scrutiny, and enhances reporting of suspicious activities. The bill similarly strengthens current measures to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for personal gain by corrupt foreign officials and to facilitate the repatriation of any stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such assets belong. 
   First, section 101 of the ICMLA gives the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other key government officials, discretionary authority to impose five new ``special measures'' against foreign jurisdictions and entities that are of ``primary money laundering concern'' to the United States. Under current law, the only counter-money laundering tools available to the federal government are advisories, an important but relatively limited measure instructing banks to pay close attention to transactions that involve a given country, and full-blown economic sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (``IEEPA''). The five new intermediate measures will increase the government's ability to apply well-calibrated pressure against targeted jurisdictions or institutions. These new measures include: (1) requiring additional record keeping/reporting on particular transactions, (2) requiring the identification of the beneficial foreign owner of a U.S. bank account, (3) requiring the identification of those individuals using a U.S. bank account opened by a foreign bank to engage in banking transactions (a ``payable-through account''), (4) requiring the identification of those using a U.S. bank account established to receive deposits and make payments on behalf of a foreign financial institution (a ``correspondent account''), and (5) restricting or prohibiting the opening or maintaining of certain correspondent accounts. 
   Second, the bill seeks to enhance oversight into illegal activities by clarifying that the ``safe harbor'' from civil liability for filing a Suspicious Activity Report (``SAR'') applies in any litigation, including suit for breach of contract or in an arbitration proceeding. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (``BSA''), any financial institution or officer, director, employee, or agent of a financial institution is protected against private civil liability for filing a SAR. Section 201 of the bill amends the BSA to clarify the prohibition on disclosing that a SAR has been filed. These reports are the cornerstone of our nation's money-laundering efforts because they provide the information necessary to alter law enforcement to illegal activity. 
   Third, the bill enhances enforcement of Geographic Targeting Orders (``GTOs''). These orders lower the dollar thresholds for reporting transactions within a defined geographic area. Section 202 of the bill clarifies that civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and its regulations also apply to reports required by GTO's. In addition, the section clarifies that structuring a transaction to avoid a reporting requirement by a GTO is a criminal offense and extends the presumptive GTO period from 60 to 180 days. 
   Fourth, section 203 of the bill permits a bank, upon request of another bank, to include suspicious illegal activity in written employment references. Under this provision, banks would be permitted to share information concerning the possible involvement of a current or former officer or employee in potentially unlawful activity without fear of civil liability for sharing the information. 
   Finally, title III of the bill addresses corruption by foreign officials and ruling elites. Pursuant to a sense of Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the financial services regulators, is mandated to issue guidelines to financial institutions operating in the United States on appropriate practices and procedures to reduce the likelihood that such institutions could facilitate proceeds expropriated by or on behalf of foreign senior government officials. 
   The ICMLA addresses many of the shortcomings of current law. The Secretary of Treasury is granted additional authority to require greater transparency of transactions and accounts as well as to narrowly target penalties and sanctions. The reporting and collection of additional information on suspected illegal activity will greatly enhance the ability of bank regulators and law enforcement to combat the laundering of drug money, proceeds from corrupt regimes, and other illegal activities. 
   Mr. President, the House Banking Committee passed the identical antimoney laundering bill by a vote of 31 to 1 on June 8, 2000. I hope that we can move this legislation expeditiously in the Senate.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my support for the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act introduced by Senator KERRY. Establishing a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a necessary and timely legislative initiative. 
   The number of families in our country who live in substandard housing, or pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing costs--the factors considered in determining worst case housing need--is staggering. Recent studies show that 5.4 million American families have worst case housing needs. This is 100,000 more families than were classified as worst case housing needs just last year. 
   In addition, no family making minimum wage can afford the fair market rent for a two bedroom apartment in any metro area in the country. On average, a person needs to earn over $11 to afford an apartment in any American metro area, but this number is even higher in many parts of the country. For instance, in Baltimore a person must earn over $12 an hour, or $24,000 a year to afford the rent on a two bedroom apartment. 
   Traditionally, the government has helped families who do not earn enough to afford a place to live with section 8 vouchers. However, in today's booming real estate market, a section 8 voucher is no guarantee of finding a place to live. 
   Currently, families in Maryland wait upwards of 31 months to get a section 8 housing voucher. Once they receive the voucher, they face a new challenge: finding an apartment that is affordable for them. 
   Recent articles in the Washington Post have highlighted the trials of poor working families attempting to find affordable housing both with and without federal assistance. One Fairfax, Virginia woman working full time and living in a shelter called over 30 landlords, none of which had vacancies that she could afford. Another social worker commented that the voucher holders she counseled had to call close to 100 different developments to find a unit. The reality is that there are simply not enough affordable housing units in our country to meet the needs of low income Americans. 
   This situation is simply unacceptable. The working poor of our country deserve decent places to live. Adequate housing is an essential need for all Americans. It is the anchor that allows families to thrive. 
   Children can't learn if they are forced to attend 3 or 4 schools in a single year as their parents move from friend to friend because they cannot afford the rent. Workers can't find jobs or get training if they spend their days fighting to put a roof over their kids' heads. A sick person will not get well if she spends her days huddled on a grate, waiting for a bed in an emergency shelter. 
   Senator KERRY's bill would address our country's severe affordable housing crisis by establishing an Affordable Housing Trust Fund that will support the construction of additional affordable housing. 
   The Trust Fund is designed to create long-term affordable, mixed income housing developments in areas where low-income families will have access to transportation, social services, and job opportunities. It is also designed to help in areas where local governments are committed to revitalization. These priorities are explicitly laid out in the legislation. 
   The bottom line is that we need to provide more resources to states, local governments and non-profits who are working to build more affordable housing. Unless we build more affordable units we will not be able to solve the housing crisis we have today. 
   This bill is an opportunity for us to take advantage of our booming economy to do this. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Colonel Bruce Berwick, Commander of the Baltimore District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Col. Berwick is moving on to a new assignment at the Pentagon and I want to express my personal appreciation for the outstanding work that he has done. 
   The Baltimore District is one of the Corps' largest districts encompassing five States and the District of Columbia. It is responsible for twenty-three military installations, three major watersheds including the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac and Susquehanna Rivers, 14 dams and reservoirs, numerous navigation projects--large and small, and the public water supply for the Washington metropolitan area, as well as certain overseas activities. Managing the District's considerable and diverse workload presents a special challenge--a challenge that Col. Berwick met with great success. During his three-year tenure as Commander of the Baltimore District, Col. Berwick has distinguished himself as an exceptional District Engineer and a dedicated and tireless advocate for the mission of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Under his leadership, numerous military construction and civil works projects were initiated or completed including the $1.1 billion Pentagon renovation project, the $147 million Walter Reed Army Institute for Research, phase one of the Poplar Island beneficial use of dredged material project and the storm damage restoration work at Ocean City and the north end of Assateague Island National Seashore, to name only a few. The Colonel worked to ensure that these projects remained on cost, on schedule and were built to the highest standards. Similarly, he directed and oversaw the successful completion of numerous environmental restoration projects including the fish passageway at the Little Falls Dam on the Potomac River, wetland restoration along the Anacostia River, the planning and design for the rewatering of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the protection of Smith Island, as well as the Chesapeake Bay oyster recovery effort. 
   I have had the pleasure of working closely with Col. Berwick over the last three years on these and other initiatives throughout Maryland and the mid-Atlantic area. I know first hand the exceptional talent, ingenuity, and energy which he brought to the Baltimore District and to the Corps of Engineers. One of our most significant cooperative efforts and one which, in my view, underscores the exceptional leadership and commitment of Bruce Berwick was the repair of the Korean War Memorial. Just three years after the memorial was dedicated it was clear that it was not functioning as originally designed and was plagued by problems: the water in the fountain no longer flowed, the grove of Linden trees died and had to be removed, there were walkway and safety hazards and the lighting for the statues was failing. Col. Berwick made it a personal mission to fix these problems and ensure that the monument was repaired in time for the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War. As a result of his determined efforts, our Korean War Veterans now have a memorial for which they can be proud, one that is a fitting and lasting tribute to their service to our nation. 
   In recognition of his outstanding work in the Baltimore District and his other assignments throughout the world, Col. Berwick has been the recipient of numerous awards and decorations including the Legion of Merit, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Parachutist Badge. Perhaps more significantly however, his efforts and accomplishments have earned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues and others with whom he has worked. It is my firm conviction that public service is one of the most honorable callings, one that demands the very best, most dedicated efforts of those who have the opportunity to serve their fellow citizens and country. Throughout his career Bruce Berwick has exemplified a steadfast commitment to meeting this demand. 
   I want to extend my personal congratulations and thanks for his hard work and dedication and to wish him and his family the best of luck in his new assignment.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing, ``Credit Watch,'' a bill that will authorize the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to identify lenders who have excessively high early default and claim rates and terminate their origination approval. This legislation is necessary to protect the FHA fund and take action against lenders who are contributing to the deterioration of our neighborhoods. 
   A recent rash of FHA loan defaults have led to foreclosures and vacant properties in a number of cities around the country. In Baltimore, the effects of high foreclosure rates are acute. In some neighborhoods, there are numerous foreclosed homes, now abandoned, within just a few blocks of each other. This can often be the beginning of a neighborhood's decline. It creates a perception that the property and the neighborhood is not highly valued. In turn, these neighborhoods become physically deteriorated and often attract criminal activity. 
   It's like a rotten apple in a barrel. The rundown appearance of one home spreads to the surrounding neighborhood. Neighborhoods that are struggling to stabilize and revitalize find their efforts undermined by the presence of abandoned homes. 
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), community activists, and local law makers have come together to examine the loans being made in neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates. 
   In Baltimore and other cities, these groups found that careless lenders are offering FHA insured loans to families who cannot afford to pay them back. Early default or claim of these loans frequently leads to foreclosure of the home. A foreclosed property can easily turn into an uninhabited home, which can either begin or continue a cycle of decline. 
   In an effort to reduce the number of loans that end in foreclosure, the FHA developed several new oversight methods. One of which is ``Credit Watch.'' 
   ``Credit Watch'' is an automated system that compares the number of early foreclosures and claims of lenders in the same area. This legislation authorizes FHA to revoke the origination approval of lenders who have significantly higher rates of early defaults and claims than the other lenders in the same area. FHA is currently targeting lenders with default rates over 300% of the area average. They estimate that in Baltimore this threshold would allow them to terminate the origination privileges of three major lenders that account for 40% of early defaults and claims. 
   The legislation accounts for differing regional economies by ensuring that lenders are only compared to others making loans in the same community. It also provides a manner by which terminated lenders may appeal the decision of the FHA, if they believe there are mitigating factors that may justify higher rates. 
   When lenders make loans with no regard for the consumer or the health of the community, the FHA must be able to take action in a timely manner. This practice is a costly abuse of the FHA insurance fund. Quick action not only protects the health of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) fund, but it protects neighborhoods from the detrimental effects of high vacancy rates and consumers from the pain of foreclosure and serious damage to their credit. 
   Lenders that offer loans to individuals who cannot afford them should not be able to continue making those loans. It is a bad deal for taxpayers. It is a bad deal for neighborhoods. It is a bad deal for the families who take out the loan. 
   Credit Watch is an effective and efficient way that the FHA can prevent these unfortunate foreclosures from happening. While we need to address the larger issue of predatory lending in our communities, ``Credit Watch'' is an obvious and immediate solution to one part of the problem.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with several of my colleagues, including Senator CHAFEE, Senator MACK, Senator BIDEN, and Senator LEAHY in sponsoring this Sense of  the Senate amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. I am also very pleased that agreement has been reached for the amendment to be accepted. The amendment calls on the Senate to support full authorization and funding for international debt relief. I worked with Senator MACK last year in introducing the ``Debt Relief for Poor Countries Act of 1999,'' and am glad to work with him again on this important issue. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to highlight one of the major shortcomings in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, as reported out of Committee, which only included $75 million for the purposes of debt relief. That allocation falls far short of what the Administration has requested and what is needed to meet our obligations to the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) trust fund and bilateral debt relief commitments. The Administration has requested $210 million for FY 2000 for HIPC and $225 million for FY 2001 ($150 million to HIPC and $75 million for bilateral debt relief). This money is necessary for us to meet our commitments to the HIPC trust fund, estimated at $600 million over the next three years, and our commitments to bilateral debt reductions, estimated at $375 million over the same period. 
   The Administration has also requested an authorization from Congress to support use for HIPC debt relief of the full earnings on profits from IMF off-market gold sales. 
   Why is debt relief so important? Many poor countries are saddled with large debt payments. All too often, payments on the foreign debt--which account for as much as 70 percent of government expenditures in some countries--mean there is little left to meet basic human needs of the population, such as health, education, nutrition, sanitation, and basic social services. 
   As a group, HIPCs post some of the world's lowest human development indicators: one in ten children dies before their first birthday; one in three children is malnourished; the average person attends only three years of school; half of all citizens live on less than $1 dollar a day; HIV infection rates are as a high as 20 percent. 
   In effect, debt service payments are making it even harder for the recipient governments to enact the kinds of economic and political reforms that the loans were designed to encourage, and that are necessary to ensure broad-based growth and future prosperity. 
   Last year, President Clinton pledged to cancel all $5.7 billion of debt owed to the U.S. government by 36 of the poorest countries. Canceling the debt will not cost the full $5.7 billion because many of the loans would never have been repaid and are no longer worth their full face-value. It does not make economic sense to keep these loans on the books. 
   Additionally, I believe U.S. leadership is at stake. As the richest country in the world and as one that has long been interested in the development of poor countries, we risk losing our moral authority in the international arena if we cannot, especially during our country's time of prosperity, alleviate the crushing debt burden of many poor countries.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, together with my colleagues, Senators WARNER, ROBB and MIKULSKI, to reauthorize and enhance the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Program office. This office, which was first established in 1992 pursuant to Public Law 102-567, serves as the focal point for all of NOAA's activities within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and is a vital part of the effort to achieve the long-term goal of the Bay Program--restoring the Bay's living resources to healthy and balanced levels. 
   As the lead Federal agency responsible for marine science, NOAA has played a critical role in the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay and its living marine resources. Since 1984, when the Agency first signed a Memorandum of Understanding with EPA to participate in the Chesapeake Bay Program as a full Federal partner, NOAA has supported scientific investigations and conducted other important activities ranging from fisheries stock assessments to monitoring of algal blooms and tracking changes in tidal wetlands. This research has been essential to improving our understanding of the impacts of climate, harvest and pollution on the decline of anadromous fish, oysters and other marines species in the Bay and helping to develop management strategies for restoring living resources. 
   In order to better integrate NOAA's diverse efforts in the Bay region and provide a clear focal point within NOAA for Chesapeake Bay initiatives, in 1991 I introduced legislation to create a NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office or NCBO. The legislation authorized $2.5 million a year for the program and prescribed the office's principal functions as coordination, strategy development, technical and financial assistance and research dissemination. That legislation was incorporated in an overall  NOAA authorization bill and became Public Law 102-567. To implement the initiative, NOAA established an office in Annapolis under the administration of the National Marine Fisheries Service and has been funding peer-reviewed research directed at the Bay's living resource problems, providing scientific expertise and technical assistance to Bay Program partners, working to involve other relevant NOAA elements in the Bay restoration and participating in a wide variety of Bay Program projects and activities. During the past eight years, the NCBO has made great strides in realizing the objectives of the NOAA Authorization Act of 1992 and the overall Bay Program living resource goals. Working with other Bay Program Partners, important progress has been made in surveying and assessing fishery resources in the Bay, developing fishery management plans for selected species, undertaking habitat restoration projects, removing barriers to fish passage, and undertaking important remote sensing and data analysis activities. 
   NOAA's responsibilities to the Bay restoration effort are far from complete, however. Some populations of major species of fish and shellfish in Chesapeake Bay such as shad and oysters, remain severely depressed, while others, such as blue crab are at risk. Bay-wide, some 16 of 25 ecologically important species are in decline or severe decline, due to disease, habitat loss, over-fishing and other factors. The underwater grasses that once sustained these fisheries are only at a fraction of their historic levels. Research and monitoring must be continued and enhanced to track living resource trends, evaluate the responses of the estuary's biota to changes 
   in their environment and establish clear management goals and progress indicators for restoring the productivity, diversity and abundance of these species. Chesapeake 2000, the soon-to-be-signed new Bay Agreement, has identified several living resource goals which will require strong NOAA involvement to achieve. 
   The legislation which I am introducing would provide NOAA with additional resources and authority necessary to ensure its continued full participation in the Bay's restoration and in meeting with goals and objectives of Chesapeake 2000. First, this measure would move administration and oversight of the NOAA Bay Office from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to the Office of the Undersecretary to help facilitate the pooling of all of NOAA's talents and take better advantage of NOAA's multiple capabilities. In addition to NMFS there are four other line offices within NOAA with programs and responsibilities critical to the Bay restoration effort--the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, National Ocean Service, National Weather Service, and National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service. Getting these different line offices to pool their resources and coordinate their activities is a serious challenge when they do not have a direct stake or clear line of responsibility to the Chesapeake Bay Program. Placing the NOAA Bay office within the Under Secretary's Office will help assure the coordination of activities across all line organizations of NOAA. 
   Second, the legislation authorizes and directs NOAA to undertake a special five-year study, in cooperation with the scientific community of the Chesapeake Bay and appropriate other federal agencies, to develop the knowledge base required for understanding multi-species interactions and developing multi-species management plans. To date, fisheries management in Chesapeake Bay and other waters, has been largely based upon single-species plans that often ignore the critical relationships between water and habitat quality, ecosystem health and the food webs that support the Bay's living resources. There is a growing consensus between scientific leaders and managers alike that we must move beyond the one-species-at-a-time approach toward a wider, multi-species and ecosystem perspective. Chesapeake 2000 calls for developing multi-species management plans for targeted species by the year 2005 and implementing the plans by 2007. In order to achieve these goals, NOAA must take a leadership role and support a sustained research and monitoring program. 
   Third, the legislation authorizes NOAA to carry out a small-scale fishery and habitat restoration grant and technical assistance program to help citizens organizations and local governments in the Chesapeake Bay watershed undertake habitat, fish and shellfish restoration projects. Experience has shown that, with the proper tools and training, citizens' groups and local communities can play a tremendous role in fisheries and habitat protection and restoration efforts. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation's oyster gardening program, for example, has proven to be highly successful in training citizens to grow oysters at their docks to help restore oysters' populations in the Bay. The new Bay Agreement has identified a critical need to not only to expand and promote community-based programs but to restore historic levels of oyster production, restore living resource habitat and submerged aquatic vegetation. The NOAA small-grants program, which this bill would authorize, would complement EPA's Chesapeake Bay small watershed program, and make ``seed'' grants available on a competitive, cost-sharing basis to local governments and nonprofit organizations to implement hands-on projects such as improvement of fish passageways, creating artificial or natural reefs, restoring wetlands and sea-grass beds, and producing oysters for restoration projects. 
   Fourth, the legislation would establish an internet-based Coastal Predictions Center for the Chesapeake Bay. Resource managers and scientists alike agree that we must make better use of the various modeling and monitoring systems and new technologies to improve prediction capabilities and response to physical and chemical events within the Bay and tributary rivers. There are substantial amounts of data collected and compiled by Federal, state and local government agencies and academic institutions including information on weather, tides, currents, circulation, climate, land use, coastal environmental quality, aquatic living resources and habitat conditions. Unfortunately, little of this data is coordinated and organized in a manner that is useful to the wide range of potential users. The Coastal Predictions Center would serve as a knowledge bank for assembling monitoring and modeling data from relevant government agencies and academic institutions, interpreting that data, and organizing it into products that are useful to resource managers, scientists and the public. 
   Finally, the legislation would increase the authorization for the NOAA Bay Program from the current level of $2.5 million to $6 million per year to enhance current activities and to carry out these new initiatives. For more than a decade, funding for NOAA's Bay Program has remained static at an annual average of $1.9 million. If we are to achieve the ultimate, long-term goal of the Bay Program--protecting, restoring and maintaining the health of the living resources of the Bay--additional financial resources must be provided.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated and respected leader in public transportation, Ronald L. Freeland, Administrator for the Mass Transit Administration of the Maryland Department of Transportation. Ron has recently been chosen to be President of the Board of the National Conference of Minority Transportation Officials, COMTO, and I would like to express my appreciation for the work he has done for Maryland, and my congratulations and best wishes as he assumes his new leadership responsibilities. 
   Throughout his career, Ron Freeland has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to ensuring quality transportation in Maryland. Since 1997, Ron has overseen the Mass Transit Administration, MTA, which operates the bus, light rail, Metro, and MARC systems throughout the Baltimore-Washington area--systems that provide transportation services to 355,000 people every day. Prior to his service at MTA, Ron was Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Administration, where he made key reforms in that agency's operations, including improvements in the operation of the Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program. His public service also includes tenure as Director of Operations at MTA, membership on the Board of Directors for the Maryland Transportation Authority, and membership on the Board of the Canton Railroad. Well-maintained highways and reliable transit systems provide safe travel daily for millions of Americans, and I want to commend Ron for his dedication to improving transportation services in Maryland. I have known Ron for many years and have had the opportunity to work closely with him on many issues affecting transportation in Maryland. I have found him to be a dedicated public servant and a steadfast ally to the friends of public transportation. 
   In addition to his work for the people of Maryland, Ron has fought tirelessly for equality within the transportation community. He is about to assume leadership of the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials, a national organization founded in 1971, which now boasts over 2,000 members and over 25 local chapters throughout the United States. Ron has been working with COMTO for almost twenty years, and has demonstrated unyielding devotion to COMTO's dual mission of achieving inclusion and upward mobility for minorities and women within the industry, and advocating for citizens and groups who are underserved by existing transportation services. His leadership and integrity in this pursuit inspired the members of COMTO to choose Ron as National President--and they could not have made a better choice. I am confident that, as President, Ron will inspire his colleagues across the country to dedicate themselves to ensuring minorities and women equal access to transportation jobs and services. It is the courage and hard work of people like Ron Freeland that will make certain no one is left behind as the transportation industry evolves to meet America's growing needs in the 21st century.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000, Senator KENNEDY's amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill. As a cosponsor of Senator KENNEDY's Hate Crimes Prevention Act, I believe that it is past time for Congress to act to prevent future tragedies.  
   While as a Nation we have made significant progress in reducing discrimination and increasing opportunities for all Americans, regrettably the impact of past discrimination continues to be felt. Far too often, we hear reports of violent hate-related incidents in this country. It seems inconceivable that, in the year 2000, such crimes can still be so pervasive. Statistics from my own State of Maryland unfortunately indicate that the incidence of bias-motivated violence may be on the rise. The number of reported incidents of hate or bias-motivated violence in Maryland rose by 11.6 percent in 1999. Of the 457 verified incidents of bias-motivated violence that year, 335 were committed against individuals on the basis of their race (approximately 73%), 63 on the basis of religion (14%), 38 on the basis of sexual orientation (8%), 17 on the basis of ethnicity (4%), and 4 on the basis of the victim's disability (1%). 
   Data gathered under the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act is also sobering. Beginning in 1991, the Act requires the Justice Department to collect information from law enforcement agencies across the country on crimes motivated by a victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. Congress expanded the Act in 1994 to also require the collection of data for crimes based upon the victim's disability. The Department of Justice has reported that, for 1998, 7,755 bias-motivated crimes were committed against 9,722 victims by 7,489 known offenders. 
   Beyond these stark statistics, stories of heinous crimes continue to make headlines across the country. In 1998, James Byrd, Jr., an African-American man, was walking home along a rural Texas road when he was beaten and then dragged behind a pickup truck to his death. Later than same year, Matthew Shephard, a gay University of Wyoming Student, was beaten, tied to a fence, and left to die in a rural part of the state. And just last year, a gunman entered a Jewish community center in California, opened fire on workers and children attending a day care center, and later killed a Filipino-American postal worker. 
   It is nearly impossible to imagine such crimes occurring in a country that is said to lead the world in equal opportunity for its citizens. Franklin Delano Roosevelt once described America as a ``nation of many nationalities, many religions--bound together by a single unity, the unity of freedom and equality.'' But, as the stories of James Byrd, Matthew Shephard, and the California Jewish community center all too clearly show, we are not living up to President Roosevelt's vision of America. The Federal government cannot ignore the thousands of hate crimes that are committed in the United States each and every year as long as people are afraid to walk down our streets because of their religion, or the color of their skin, or their sexual orientation. 
   I had the great honor of serving, during my time in the House of Representatives, with Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to Congress, who said: ``Laws will not eliminate prejudice from the hearts of human beings. But that is no reason to allow prejudice to continue to be enshrined in our laws to perpetuate injustice through inaction.'' 
   Senator KENNEDY's amendment includes crucial provisions designed to help the Federal government stop bias-motivated crimes. This amendment would extend Federal law to prohibit crimes committed against victims because of their gender, sexual orientation, or disability. Moreover, the amendment would also remove requirements of existing law that prohibit Federal government action unless the crime victim is engaged in certain ``federally protected activities.'' 
   It is true that this legislation will not drastically increase the number of crimes subject to Federal prosecution. Criminal law is a matter largely enforced by the states, and the sponsors of this amendment have been careful to ensure that the Federal government will only step in and prosecute a crime if a state cannot adequately do so itself. And certainly, as Congresswoman Chisholm eloquently stated, we cannot erase the hatred and bigotry in people's hearts by passing this amendment today. But the balanced approach of Senator KENNEDY's amendment will allow the Federal government to intervene in the small number of hate crimes cases where a Federal prosecution is necessary to insure that justice is served. 
   Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting the Kennedy hate crimes amendment. We have an invaluable opportunity to make a statement that the United States government will not tolerate crimes motivated by bigotry and prejudice, and that the ``the unity of freedom and equality'' binds together all Americans--regardless of their race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to bring to the floor of the Senate this conference report of S. 761, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, along with my colleagues from the Commerce and Judiciary Committees. 
   First and foremost, the success of this effort is the result of the leadership of Chairman BLILEY and Chairman MCCAIN. Their commitment to working in a bipartisan manner ultimately carried the day. 
   I also want to thank Senator HOLLINGS, Senator LEAHY, Senator WYDEN, and Representative DINGELL. Without the leadership exhibited by these 4 members, and the long hours, hard work, and dedication of their key staff (Moses Boyd, Kevin Kayes, Julie Katzman, Carol Grunberg, Consuela Washington, and Bruce Gwinn) we would never have reached this agreement. 
   Finally, the Administration, through its representatives from the Commerce and Treasury Departments (Andy Pincus and Gary Gensler), as well as the White House (Sarah Rosen-Wartell), played a crucial and constructive role in putting together the package we have before us. 
   Mr. President, I support this bipartisan conference report. This new law creates a solid legal foundation upon which electronic commerce can grow and prosper, with benefits for many consumers and businesses. 
   It is apparent to all of us that more and more business will be done on-line in the future, and that this will be true both for business-to-business commerce and for consumer transactions. 
   We need to be mindful, however, that while this trend will likely continue, many Americans do not today participate in the electronic world. Indeed, they cannot participate in this world in any meaningful way. 
   To make this point, I want to share with my colleagues the findings of a July, 1999 Commerce Department report entitled ``Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide.'' 
   First, about 70 percent of Americans do not yet have access to the internet; 
   Urban households with incomes of $75,000 and higher are more than twenty times more likely to have access to the internet than rural households at the lowest income levels and they are more than nine times more likely to have a computer at home; 
   Whites are more likely to have access to the internet from home than Blacks or Hispanics have from any location; 
   Regardless of income level, Americans living in rural areas lag on internet access. At the lowest income levels, those in urban areas are more than twice as likely to have access than rural families with the same income. 
   These facts are alarming. More distressing, is the fact that, as bad as these numbers are, the trends are moving in the wrong direction. The Commerce Department reports that the digital divide is actually growing. 
   For example, the gap between white and minority households has grown 5 percentage points in just one year, from 1997 to 1998. 
   The gap, based both on education and income increased by 25 and 29 percent in the past year, respectively. 
   These dramatic and disturbing findings underline the importance of ensuring that, as we move to an electronic world, we make sure that longstanding consumer protections survive the transition. Many of us made clear from the  beginning that our goal was to ensure equivalent consumer protections for transactions conducted in the paper and electronic worlds. We have largely achieved that goal. 
   First among these protections is the common sense provision incorporated in the report that consumer consent to engage in electronic commerce be given electronically. This is a protection against unscrupulous and abusive practices as well as inadvertent mistakes by well meaning vendors. 
   Electronic consent will greatly enhance the consumer confidence to do business on-line, without resulting in additional burden on businesses--they are, after all, already committed to communicating with the consumer electronically. 
   The best demonstration of the importance of electronic consent is the fact that the initial conference draft that was provided to Conferees was circulated via e-mail. Yet, despite the fact that our staff is more technologically sophisticated than the average American consumer, many of them were unable to download the document and had to have paper copies hand delivered. 
   Now, imagine if that was a notice of change in mortgage servicing, or a notice that health insurance benefits are being cut back, or that auto insurance is being cancelled. That family could very well find itself with a sick child on no health insurance. 
   Electronic consent would have avoided that problem by ensuring that the consumer is able to read the records provided. 
   Electronic consent is not, as some people have sought to portray it, relevant only for a transitional period. Compatibility among systems is always important to check, given the significance of the records being transmitted. In addition, the U.S. mail is free to receive and comes to your door. You do not need a computer to receive the mail. You do not need to pay for an internet service provider, and you do not need to go to a public library to fain access to a computer if you don't have one at home. For all these reasons, electronic consent will be as important in the future as it is today. 
   Other concerns I had have also been addressed in this report. 
   We have provided both federal and state agencies with the authority to interpret and issue guidance on the proposed law. Providing this interpretive authority will provide businesses with a cost-effective way of getting guidance in how to implement the new law. Without this authority, these questions would have to have been answered by the courts, after extensive and expensive litigation. We have avoided that problem. 
   the conference report gives law enforcement agencies of federal and state governments the authority they need to detect and combat fraud, including the ability to require the retention of written records in paper form if there is a compelling governmental interest in law enforcement. 
   Let me raise one specific example, among many, of where this provision ought to be exercised. The Securities and Exchange Commission should use this provision to require brokers to keep written records of agreements required to be obtained by the SEC's penny stock rules. Investors in the securities markets have been the victims of penny stock abuse for more than a decade. The SEC must exercise every tool at its disposal to fight this kind of fraud. 
   Finally, we narrowed the scope of the legislation to ensure that certain notices that simply cannot effectively be made electronically, such as documents carried by vehicles hauling hazardous materials, will continue to be in paper form. 
   As many of you know, it was not at all clear that we were going to be able to deliver this bipartisan, largely consensus product to the floor. There were many times when negotiations threatened to unravel. 
   But we stuck to it; we continued to show a willingness to consider and reconsider many issues that came up, even after agreement on many of those issues was achieved. Eventually, we were able to close the few remaining gaps and come to a final compromise. 
   Mr. President, these changes make this a good piece of legislation worthy of our support. I urge all my colleagues to do so, and, once again, commend the leaders who brought this effort to a successful conclusion. 
   Finally, I ask unanimous consent to insert for the RECORD some more specific observations on a number of provisions of the legislation on behalf of Senator HOLLINGS, Senator, WYDEN, and myself. I think this will be helpful given the fact that no statement of managers was included with the final legislation.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr President, I come to the floor today in support of the Affordable Housing for Seniors and Families Act introduced by Senators KERRY and SANTORUM. 
   This bill expands upon critical housing programs for both elderly and disabled Americans. The Nation's population of elderly is growing rapidly. Between 1980 and 1997, the number of people over the age of 65 grew by 33 percent. AARP estimates that by 2030, 20 percent of the population will be over 65 years of age, compared to only 13 percent of the population today. We need to have programs in place to assist growing numbers of seniors. 
   AARP also estimates that there will be 2.8 million elderly people who, by 2020, will have difficulty performing a number of basic functions such as eating, bathing, and dressing. As American's age, traditional housing will have to change to accommodate the unique needs of those in their golden years. This bill will ensure that additional housing opportunities exist where these Americans can receive the services they need. This legislation allows  traditional elderly and disabled housing to be converted to assisted living facilities, to meet these growing needs. 
   We must not only work to ensure that adequate services are available, we must work to increase the affordable housing stock. A recent study conducted by HUD indicates that 1.7 million low-income elderly are in urgent need of affordable housing. Nearly 7.4 million elderly households pay more than they can afford on housing, and there are more than eight elderly people waiting for every unit of assisted elderly housing. 
   In addition, HUD estimates that 1.4 million disabled Americans have worst case housing needs, meaning they pay over half of their income for housing or live in substandard housing. The Consortium for Persons with Disabilities conducted a study in 1998 which showed that there was not one housing market in the U.S. where a disabled person receiving SSI benefits could afford rent based on federal guidelines. 
   The federal government is not doing enough to meet the needs of these low-income people. This legislation assists us in meeting these needs. It expands access to capital from both federal and non-federal sources for elderly and disabled housing programs, helping to create new housing opportunities for these communities. Providers of elderly and disabled housing will be able to link with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, a crucial source of affordable housing funding, and other private funds. 
   This bill also ensures that the affordable housing which exists in this country is maintained. This crucial stock of housing will be preserved through a matching grant preservation program authored by our colleagues, Senators KERRY and JEFFORDS, which will reward States and localities spending resources to preserve affordable housing by giving them federal dollars to assist in their efforts. This provision will help to ensure that as we increase the stock of affordable housing on the front end, we are not losing units on the back end--our goal is to increase available housing, not maintain the status quo. 
   This bill is a step in the right direction towards providing necessary housing opportunities for those Americans that are too often forgotten. And many people in this nation enjoy the benefits of a prospering economy, so too are many Americans being left behind. This legislation will ensure that more Americans have the opportunity to live in safe and decent housing.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an accomplished and respected steward of our National Park System, Marc Koenings, Superintendent of Assateague Island National Seashore. Marc has recently been selected to head Gateway National Recreation Area in New York and New Jersey and I want to wish him well with this important new assignment and thank him for the terrific job he did in managing Assateague over the past seven years. 
   Throughout his 29-year career in public service, Marc Koenings has distinguished himself as a leader in natural and cultural resource management and conservation at the local, national and international levels. Beginning with the Peace Corps in 1971, Marc also served for nine years in a variety of positions with the Heritage Recreation and Conservation Service before joining the National Park Service. He quickly advanced to top management jobs in four Parks including Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Point Reyes National Seashore and Virgin Islands National Park where he made substantial contributions to improving park facilities, protecting park resources and developing highly professional work forces. 
   I came to know Marc in 1993 shortly after he came to Maryland from Virgin Islands National Park. I had invited Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to join me on a tour of Assateague Island and to officially dedicate the Beach-to-Bay Indian Trail as a National Recreational Trail. Marc served as host and Master of Ceremonies for the visit and I was immediately impressed not only by his professionalism, but by the knowledge and vision which he had for Assateague after such a short period on the job. Over the past seven years, I have had the opportunity and privilege to work closely with Superintendent Koenings and members of his staff at Assateague in efforts to restore the north end of the island, construct a new pedestrian/bicycle bridge, protect the seashore from encroaching development, and develop the new Coastal Ecology Teaching and Research Laboratory. I know from personal experience that these initiatives would not be taking place, but for his persistent efforts, energy and innovation. In addition to these projects, under Marc's leadership, Assateague's barrier island visitors center was expanded and improved, a new Administrative facility was constructed, and new partnerships were formed to develop water trails and promote other eco-tourism opportunities in the area. 
   The efforts of Marc Koenings throughout his career in the National Park Service have had a lasting effect not only on the parks he has worked to protect, but on the people with whom he has come in contact. He has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues in the Park Service as well as the visitors and citizens in the local communities surrounding the parks. It is my firm conviction that public service is one of the most honorable callings, one that demands the very best, most dedicated efforts of those who have the opportunity to serve their fellow citizens and country. Throughout his career Marc Koenings has exemplified a steadfast commitment to meeting this demand. I want to extend my personal congratulations and thanks for his many years of hard work and dedication to the principal conservation mission of the National Park Service and join with his friends and coworkers in wishing him and his family well with his new endeavors.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to offer my congratulations and  very best wishes to all those gathered at the 50th Anniversary celebration of the University of Maryland University College (UMUC) serving the United States military in Europe. I am pleased to take part in recognizing the longstanding tradition that this institution continues to uphold in ensuring quality higher education for our servicemembers overseas. 
   It has always been my firm belief that a democracy cannot prosper and grow without an educated populace, and therefore the education of the individual is one of the most important tasks in our society. The success and growth of UMUC is a critical testament to the importance of educational opportunities for our military personnel in Europe. From its inception, this institution has viewed higher education from a global perspective, an approach which has put UMUC at the forefront of the larger higher education community. 
   Following World War II, when the United States military invited American universities to provide higher educational programs to servicemembers at military installations throughout Europe, UMUC was the only institution to respond. This began a historic 50 year partnership with the military in Europe and starting in 1956, in Asia as well. The noted British scholar Arnold Toynbee wrote that the UMUC program in Europe is ``an American achievement from which the rest of the world has much to learn.'' 
   Since the first year, UMUC has offered educational opportunities to hundreds of thousands of our men and women overseas. Even now, it is wonderful to hear that this tradition continues in many locations at long established military installations in Germany, Britain, Italy, and Spain including temporary facilities in Kosovo and Bosnia. 
   I commend the University of Maryland University College for its 50 year history of unparalleled service and success in the field of education and I look forward to a continued close association with this exemplary institution.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to address a very serious problem facing our nation: millions of low- and moderate-income Americans lack adequate access to basic financial services. I am pleased to introduce the First Accounts Act of 2000 (``FAA''). This bill, which has been proposed by the Administration, establishes a pilot program within the Department of the Treasury designed to promote access to financial services for the millions of low- and moderate income persons currently facing barriers to affordable and convenient banking services. Joining as original co-sponsors in the introduction of this legislation are the Senate Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, and my fellow Democratic members of the Banking Committee--Senators DODD, KERRY, BRYAN, JOHNSON, REED, SCHUMER, EDWARDS, and BAYH. 
   Access to basic banking services is essential for Americans seeking to participate fully in our increasingly complex financial and economic system. Unfortunately, recent studies show that millions of families lack access to affordable banking accounts and safe and secure ATMs, and do not have adequate knowledge of beneficial financial services and products. The lack of information and access to such financial services limits economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons, steers them toward high cost services offered by fringe operators in the financial services industry, reduces their ability to manage their finances and plan for the future, and may even place these individuals at a risk to their personal safety. Under the bill, the Treasury Department is authorized to partner with financial institutions, community organizations, and financial services electronic networks to improve access to mainstream financial services in four ways: affordable banking accounts, safe and secure ATMs, extensive financial literacy, and research and development efforts.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Science Foundation, an institution that has served as a driving force behind the Nation's scientific and technological development. 
   The National Science Foundation's roots can be found at the close of World War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested a report from the government's wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development outlining how the United States should support scientific research in the postwar era. The resulting report, Science--The Endless Frontier, authored by Vannevar Bush, made the case for the establishment of a National Research Foundation and legislation based upon his findings was introduced by Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington. After five years of deliberation in the Congress, President Harry S. Truman signed legislation creating the National Science Foundation on May 10, 1950. Since that day, NSF has played a vital role in maintaining America's leadership position in scientific discovery and the development of new technologies, securing the  nation's defense and promoting the nation's health and prosperity. 
   Over the past 50 years, NSF-funded research has led to numerous scientific breakthroughs that have impacted the lives of every one of us. This research has resulted in projects and initiatives that include the development of the Internet, Doppler Radar, the American Sign Language Dictionary, DNA fingerprinting, MRI technology, barcodes, the identification of the Hanta Virus, and the discovery of the weather pattern known as El Nin 6o/La Nin 6a. This research has been responsible for creating new industries relating to communications, biotechnology, agriculture, and other important sectors of our economy. In turn, these industries have resulted in greater employment opportunities, economic prosperity and an improved quality of life for Americans and citizens around the world. 
   NSF funds support the work and research of almost 200,000 people, including teachers, students, researchers, post-doctorates, and trainees. In fact, researchers and educators from each of the 50 states and all U.S. territories have been allotted NSF funding in the form of competitively awarded, grants, contracts and cooperative agreements. Almost 40% of the funding for research grants is awarded to our nation's students and researchers, providing support for more than 61,000 post-doctorates, trainees and graduates and undergraduate students. These are the individuals who will carry on the critical mission of NSF into the 21st century. 
   The work undertaken by NSF researchers has not gone unnoticed. NSF-supported researchers have been the recipients of numerous awards and honors. More than 100 of these researchers have been awarded Nobel Prizes in fields that include physics, chemistry, physiology and economics. NSF researchers have also been awarded the National Medal of Science, National Medal of Technology, the Waterman, the Draper, the Presidential Early Career Awards in Science and Engineering and the Career awards, to name a few. 
   I want to commend the men and women who have worked for NSF and received support from NSF who have contributed incalculably to the efforts that have established the United States as the leader in scientific and technological innovation and I want to recognize the outstanding leadership of the current Director of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Rita Colwell, in this regard. I urge my colleagues to join with me in commending NSF on this important occasion and wishing them continued success in the years ahead.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is the ninth reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Regrettably, the reauthorization, as reported by Committee, is not in my view in the best interest of our Nation's children. Established as part of President Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty, the original bill offered Federal support, for the first time, to schools in low-income communities. It underscored the importance of ensuring that all American children have access to quality education. 
   As the time has come to again reauthorize this important legislation that provides opportunity and hope to so many citizens, the negotiations have taken a drastically partisan turn. Members of the Majority have argued that, because states have paramount responsibilities for education, the role of the Federal Government should be diminished. However, that argument ignores our Nation's interest in ensuring an educated citizenry which is vital to the strength of our country, the continued health of our economy, and our ability to compete internationally. 
   On previous occasions, we have worked together to provide the Federal Government's 7 percent share of elementary and secondary education funding to the citizens of our country. We came together, despite our differences, to provide for the less fortunate in society. We came together to make progress on strengthening and improving public schools in every community, while ensuring that the Federal Government retained its mission of targeting the neediest communities. 
   The Congress and the President showed leadership in the last reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and with the passage of the GOALS 2000 legislation, which established a new benchmark in setting higher standards and moving our educational system in a new direction. Now, after years of tested programs and studies, the Majority wants to go back to the days of block grant funding to states and remove the Federal Government's ability to ensure that we have a targeted and responsible use of our citizens' tax dollars. 
   At a time when the Nation is enjoying remarkable economic prosperity, we should be working to increase the Federal investment in education to help states, communities, and schools meet the demands of higher standards of achievement, and address the challenges of diversity, poverty, and the lack of technology advancements in some communities. We need to do all we can to target resources to the neediest communities so that the most disadvantaged students get a good education. 
   During the last two years, we have been able to come together as a Congress and support the President's proposal to provide more teachers to the classrooms to lower class sizes. Over $2.5 billion 
   has been provided for the purpose of recruiting, hiring, and training teachers. Now the Majority would have us retreat from this critical effort to provide more qualified teachers and reduced class sizes. And it is well settled that smaller class sizes enhances student achievement. Smaller classes enable teachers to provide greater individual attention and assistance to students in need. Smaller classes enable teachers to spend more time on instruction, and less time on discipline and behavior problems. In smaller classes, teachers cover material more effectively, and are able to work with parents more effectively to enhance their children's education. 
   Mr. President, the Majority's centerpiece for this legislation, the so-called ``Straight A's program'', whether in the 50-state or the 15-state form--abandons our commitment to help the Nation's most disadvantaged children receive a good education through proven and effective programs. The bill before  us would give states a blank check for over $12 billion--and then turns its back on holding states accountable for results. 
   In addition, the Majority undermines the cornerstone of our education reform by making Title I funds ``portable.'' Portability dilutes the impact that Title I funding has on individual public schools that serve all children. Supporters go to great lengths to avoid admitting that this funding could be used for private, religious, or for-profit services in the form of vouchers, but indeed, this is the case. Vouchers threaten to drain public schools of greatly needed public tax dollars and send the message that when public schools, which educate 90 percent of American children, do not work, they should be abandoned rather than fixed. 
   As we confront a world that is increasingly complex both technologically and economically, it is critical that we continue to meet the educational needs of our Nation's young people. It is in my view imperative that we maintain strong Federal support to ensure the successful continuation of education programs serving our country's young people. The legislation as submitted by the Majority diminishes the Federal role and does not provide accountability for education standards. This is an unfortunate departure from years of bipartisan support and movement towards higher achievement for all of our young people. 
   Mr. President, I have a longstanding and deep commitment to the goal of ensuring a quality education for all citizens. The bill before us would retreat from that goal by sharply reducing the Federal role in education--a role, that while narrow in scope, is critical to ensuring reform in our schools and real improvements in student performance, particularly among our neediest students and in our neediest communities.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to spotlight the significant achievements of all those who make up our Nation's public workforce. 
   This week, from May 1st to the 7th, is Public Service Recognition Week, organized by the Public Employees Roundtable. The Public Employees Roundtable was formed in 1982 as a nonpartisan coalition of management and professional associations representing approximately one million public employees and retirees. The mission of the Roundtable is to educate the American people about the numerous ways public employees enrich the quality of life throughout our Nation and advance the country's national interests around the world. 
   I am indeed proud to join the Public Employees Roundtable in their ongoing efforts to bring special attention to the dedicated individuals who have chosen public service as a career. While we should all appreciate the efforts of public employees throughout the year, this week-long celebration is an invaluable opportunity to honor their contributions and learn about the vast array of programs and services public employees provide every day. For four days, starting today, a wide variety of organizations will sponsor exhibits on the Mall to spotlight the work public employees perform. This year, among the numerous agencies represented, will be the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps; and the Social Security Administration. 
   These exhibits sponsored by civilian and Department of Defense agencies will showcase the amazing variety of public employees that make ours the greatest Nation in the world--at the Federal, state, and local government levels. This year, I was also pleased to join with several of my House and Senate colleagues in circulating to every Congressional office a videotape entitled ``Salute to Excellence,'' produced by the Public Employees Roundtable. In a brief 10 minutes, the video clearly demonstrates that our Nation's public servants are hard-working individuals who perform vital work for the country each and every day. 
   The total impact of the work of public employees is impossible to measure. Without them, senior citizens would wait in vain for Social Security checks, cities would not have the funds and assistance to improve their highways, and our entrepreneurs could not protect their new inventions. In short, all of our citizens would suffer.  
   Initiatives to improve government services have encouraged the development of creative solutions and programs to better serve our citizens. Several of these innovative ideas were recognized at the ``Breakfast of Champions'' held this Monday honoring winners of the 2000 Public Service Excellence Awards. These honorees--and public employees everywhere--are finding ways to do their work better, more professionally, and in a way that meets the community's needs. 
   As I have said on many occasions, I believe very much that the United States will only continue to be a first-rate country if we have first-class public servants. Our Nation is experiencing unprecedented growth and unemployment rates, and has unquestionably benefited from the many achievements of Federal employees. In setting aside this week to acknowledge our Nation's public servants, we all have an opportunity to give these employees the thanks and recognition they so greatly deserve. I am very pleased to extend my appreciation to such a worthy and committed group of men and women and encourage them to continue in their efforts on behalf of all Americans.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to address a very important issue: the protection of every American's personal, sensitive, financial and medical information which is held by their financial institutions. I am pleased to join Senator LEAHY, the chairman of the Senate Democratic Privacy Task Force, and Senators DODD, KERRY, BRYAN, EDWARDS, ROBB, DURBIN, HARKIN, and FEINSTEIN in co-sponsoring the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act. 
   This bill, submitted to us by the Clinton-Gore Administration, seeks to  protect a fundamental right of privacy for every American who entrusts his or her highly sensitive and confidential financial and medical information to a financial institution. 
   Every American should at least have the opportunity to say `no' if he or she does not want that nonpublic information disclosed. Every American should have the right to have especially sensitive information held by his or her financial institution kept confidential unless consent is given. Every American should be allowed to make certain that the information to be shared is accurate and, if not, to have it corrected. And these rights should be enforced. 
   Mr. President, the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act would accomplish these objectives. 
   Few Americans understand that, under current Federal law, a financial institution could take information it obtained about a customer through his or her transactions, and sell or transfer that information to an affiliated party without the customer being able to object. And that customer has no right to get access to or to correct that information. 
   The amount of information that could be disclosed is enormous. It includes, for example: 
   Savings and checking account balances; 
   Certificate of deposit maturity dates and balances; 
   Checks an individual writes; 
   Checks deposited into a customer's account; 
   Stock and mutual fund purchases and sales; 
   Life insurance payouts; and 
   Health insurance claims. 
   Today's technology makes it easier, faster, and less costly than ever for institutions to have immediate access to large amounts of customer information; to analyze that data; and to send that data to others. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies are increasingly affiliating and cross-marketing and, in the process, they are selling the products of affiliates to existing customers. This can entail the warehousing of large amounts of highly sensitive customer information and selling it to or sharing it with other companies, for purposes unknown to the customer. While cross-marketing can bring new and beneficial products to receptive consumers, it can also result in unwanted invasions of personal privacy. 
   Surveys show that the public is widely concerned about privacy. Major corporations have bumped up against privacy concerns when expanding their marketing services. Citizen groups have expressed serious concerns about the privacy implications of financial institutions' sharing or selling the information they collect without the knowledge of the party involved. 
   Along with medical records, financial records rank among the kinds of personal data Americans most expect will be kept from prying eyes. As with medical data, though, the privacy of even highly sensitive financial data has been increasingly put at risk by mergers, electronic data-swapping and the move to an economy in which the selling of other people's personal information is highly profitable--and legal. 
   On January 19, 1999, I introduced the Financial Information Privacy Act of 1999 (S. 187) to provide consumers with important privacy protections for their financial information. Some of these protections are reflected in this bill, including a right for consumers to object, or opt out, of their financial institutions sharing with affiliates customer information, such as account transactions, balances and maturity dates as well as rights for the consumer to have access to and to correct mistakes in information that would be shared. 
   The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted last November, contained some limited federal financial privacy protections for consumers. While an important beginning, these protections failed to meet the expectations of Americans and did not contain the important protections that I have just referred to. 
   When the President signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, he observed that the privacy protections contained in the new legislation were inadequate. In his State of the Union Address this year, the President reiterated the need for stronger privacy legislation. Last Sunday, the President announced a proposal for improved financial privacy protections. He said, ``We can't let breakthroughs in technology break down walls of privacy.'' I agree and applaud the Clinton-Gore Administration's proposal as an important step forward. 
   The Financial Privacy Protection Act reflects the Administration's proposal and contains important financial privacy protections. 
   The Act would provide an ``opt out'' for affiliate sharing, allowing customers to object to a financial institution's sharing customer financial data with any affiliated firms. 
   It also would provide an ``opt in'' for sharing some types of ``sensitive information.'' A financial institution would need to have a consumer's affirmative consent before releasing his or her medical information or personal spending habits, reflected on checks written and credit card charges, to either an affiliate or an unaffiliated third party. 
   The Act also provides consumers with rights of access and correction. A consumer would be able to see the information to be released and correct material errors. 
   The Act also requires financial institutions to make privacy notices available to consumers who request them and makes other important improvements to the law. 
   As we proceed in an age of technological advances and cross-industry marketing of financial services, we need to be mindful of the privacy concerns of the American public. I ask myself the question, ``Whose information is this, the individual's or the institution's?'' I believe it is the individual's. 
   Consumers who wish to keep their sensitive financial and medical information private should be given a right to do so. The passage of the Financial Information Privacy Act would be a step toward that goal.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing appreciation to Senator WELLSTONE for arranging for this period this morning to give us a chance to send a message to Mike, and to talk with him, as it were, long distance for just a few minutes. 
   I was struck as I listened to my colleagues as they spoke about Mike's attributes. His kindness, his warmth, which I think everyone who came in contact with him would subscribe to. 
   I still remember him on the staff back row here in the Chamber with, I guess one might call it, a mischievous smile on his face, and his generosity with his counsel. 
   Presumably Senator WELLSTONE was aware and gave a special dispensation to all of us to contact Mike, even though he was working for PAUL, for his counsel and advice on matters that were before the Senate. 
   I took advantage of that opportunity on many an occasion, and always benefited from it. 
   He has been spoken about by many of my colleagues as an institution in the Senate, and I think that is very true. 
   But I want to make this point in talking about Mike as an institution, and the impact he had on this body. I  think we are also paying a tribute to all of the loyal and hard-working staff in the Senate who make it possible for this institution to function and to play its proper role in the American constitutional system. 
   He and Senator WELLSTONE developed a very close relationship. As some have noted, they were like family--like brothers towards one another. But Mike's family is also all of us because he was such a caring friend. 
   So this is a trying time. Mike, we want you to know that you are very much in our thoughts and in our prayers, and as the Chaplain said this morning when he opened the Senate and pronounced his blessing we also hope that you will derive some peace and harmony from this conversation. 
   I want to talk for a moment about Mike Epstein as a thoroughly committed fighter for progressive principles. 
   As others have noted, when he finished law school in 1961 at Boston University where he graduated with honors and was an editor of the Law Review, he came to Washington and went to work for the Justice Department. That was headed at the time by another Kennedy. Mike enlisted in that effort and served with great distinction in the Department of Justice for almost 10 years. 
   He then came to Capitol Hill and held a number of very significant responsibilities in the Senate: Counsel to Senator KENNEDY; then Counsel to the special committee to investigate intelligence activities, the Church committee. He was counsel to the Select Committee on Intelligence; counsel to the Democratic leader. For more than two years, he was chief counsel to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which is where I got to know him best. I had that wonderful opportunity to work closely with Mike and I still treasure the close relationship we developed. 
   Consistently throughout all these responsibilities, Mike reflected his abiding commitment to the U.S. Constitution. 
   He understood the significance of the Constitution in our political system, and Mike, again and again in carrying out your responsibilities, your determination that we should pay appropriate respect and deference to the Constitution constantly came through. 
   Secondly, I was struck by Mike's commitment to American democracy. It is a complicated business to make American democracy work--We are a very diverse, pluralistic nation. We are now getting up towards 300 million people. Mike understood the importance of opportunity and fairness for the workings of the American political system and was constantly committed to those goals and to those objectives. 
   He had an abiding commitment to working people. As Senator KENNEDY noted, there are hosts of people across the country who never met Mike Epstein and don't know his name, but lead better lives today because of the work and the commitment of Mike Epstein here in the Halls of the Congress for now almost three decades. 
   So Mike, we want to take this opportunity to just talk with you and tell you how much you have meant to all of us. 
   I want to close with one final observation. Mike, throughout all of this commitment and tough fighting for principle and for causes, you consistently reflected a civility and a decency and a respect for others which I think, explains, why you have come so much into the hearts of so many people. 
   I join others in expressing my gratitude to you for all you have meant to us, and in wishing you the very best now in this difficult and trying time, and in saying a very heartfelt thank you for being our friend.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, together with my colleague, Senator MIKULSKI, to enhance fire safety and protection in the United States Capitol and the buildings within the Capitol Complex. 
   Last year, in response to a request made by congressional employees under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, the General Counsel of the Office of Compliance conducted a fire safety inspection of the Capitol Complex. The resulting report, the Report on Fire Safety Inspections of Congressional Buildings, outlined an alarming number of fire code violations in the U.S. Capitol, as well as the House and Senate Office Buildings. The report identified significant fire code violations existing throughout every one of these buildings, including, but not limited to, ``lack of fire barriers to retard the spread of fire and smoke, inadequate exit signs and exit capacity, deficient emergency lighting, limited sprinkler coverage, and dangerous storage of flammable and toxic materials.'' Furthermore, in March, the Office of Compliance issued eight citations ordering the Architect of the Capitol, who is responsible for fire safety and protection within the Complex, to take action to increase fire alarm and sprinkler systems testing and improve the training of staff in the handling of hazardous materials. 
   My legislation seeks to address these fire code violations by improving upon the expertise and accountability of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol with regard to fire safety. The measure establishes a position to be appointed by and responsible to the Architect to meet his responsibility for fire safety and protection within the Capitol Complex. The Director of Fire Safety and Protection will work to ensure that all properties under the jurisdiction of the Architect, including the U.S. Capitol, House and Senate Office Buildings, Library of Congress, U.S. Botanical Gardens, and the Capitol Power Plant, meet the applicable codes and standards established by the National Fire Protection Association. The Director will be responsible for conducting regular inspections of the properties, as well as their fire alarm and protection systems, and training employees of the Architect of the Capitol in the proper use and maintenance of these systems and the storage of hazardous chemicals and materials. This legislation would also require the Director to make semiannual reports to the Congress on the progress of his or her efforts in making the Capitol Complex fire-safe. 
   As a longtime advocate for historic preservation, I want to stress that this legislation recognizes the historic nature of the buildings under the jurisdiction of the Architect and provides the Director with the flexibility necessary to ensure that the properties are preserved and rehabilitated in such a manner to retain their historical and architectural significance. 
   Mr. President, the United States Capitol Fire Protection Act is an important step in addressing a critical situation. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator HOLLINGS, in introducing, by request, the Pipeline Safety and Community Protection Act of 2000 proposed and announced yesterday by Vice President GORE. This legislation is an important step forward in improving safety and environmental protection in oil and gas pipelines. 
   Mr. President, last Friday night, the State of Maryland experienced a major oil spill--one its worst spills in many years. More than 110,000 gallons of No. 2 oil leaked from a pipe at Pepco's Chalk Point Generating Station into Swanson Creek in Prince Georges County. Bad weather and high winds exacerbated the problem and spread the spill into the Patuxent River. It has now affected some 8 miles of shoreline, acres of sensitive wetland habitat, and dozens of wildlife in three counties along the Patuxent. 
   Six federal agencies--EPA, the U.S. Coast Guard, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board--are on site coordinating clean-up activities and investigations into the causes of the leak. The Maryland Departments of the Environment and Natural Resources have taken steps to protect and rehabilitate impacted wildlife and to restrict harvesting in clam and oyster beds in the area. Pepco crews and contractors have recovered more than 70,000 gallons of the spilled oil. But recovering or cleaning up the remaining oil will be much more difficult and its cumulative impact on the environment will not be known for months, if not years. The Federal and State agencies have an important responsibility to ensure that Pepco does everything possible to clean up the spill and remediate the environmental and economic damage. But an aggressive clean-up effort must be accompanied with a comprehensive program to prevent such spills from occurring in the first place. While the precise cause of this oil leak is not yet known and is still under investigation, steps can and must be taken to help detect problems before pipelines fail and to minimize the environmental and other consequences of a failure. 
   The Pipeline Safety and Community Protection Act being introduced today would reauthorize and enhance the U.S. Department of Transportation's pipeline safety program by increasing inspection and testing of pipeline integrity. It would require pipeline operators to take extra precautions in populated or environmentally sensitive areas, such as the area where the Pepco spill occurred. It would strengthen enforcement authorities by expanding penalties for violations and compliance monitoring by Federal and State investigators. It would expand research into new technologies for monitoring pipelines and detecting leaks. Finally, it would strengthen Community-Right-to-Know and reporting requirements on releases and authorize additional funding for the Department's and State pipeline safety activities. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is strongly supported by the State of Maryland and represents a constructive step forward in enhancing safety and environmental protection in pipeline transportation. I look forward to working with the members of the Commerce Committee as they consider this and other proposals to reauthorize the pipeline safety program.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Predatory Lending Consumer Protection Act with Senators DODD, KERRY, and SCHUMER. This legislation is a companion to an identical bill being introduced by Representative LAFALCE in the House of Representatives, along with a number of his colleagues. 
   Representative LAFALCE has demonstrated his strong commitment to a banking system that takes into consideration the credit needs of all Americans, including those that have been traditionally locked out of the market or are less sophisticated. I thank him for his leadership. 
   Homeownership is the American Dream. It is the opportunity for all Americans to put down roots and start creating equity for themselves and their families. Homeownership has been the path to building wealth for generations of Americans; it has been the key to ensuring stable communities, good schools, and safe streets. 
   The predatory lending industry plays on these hopes and dreams to cheat people of their hard-earned wealth. These lenders target working and lower income families, the elderly, and, often, uneducated homeowners for their abusive practices. To my mind, nothing can be more cynical. 
   Let me briefly describe how predatory lenders operate. They target people with a lot of equity in their homes; they underwrite the property without regard to the ability of the borrower to pay the loan back. They make their money by charging extremely high origination fees, and by ``packing'' other products into the loan, including upfront premiums for credit life insurance, or credit unemployment insurance, and others, for which they get significant commissions but are of no value to the homeowner. 
   The premiums for these products get financed into the loan, greatly increasing the loan's total balance amount, sometimes by as much as 50 percent. As a result, the borrower is likely to find himself in extreme financial distress. 
   Then, when the trouble hits, the predatory lender will offer to refinance the loan. Unfortunately, another characteristic of these loans is that they have prepayment penalties. So, by the time the refinancing occurs, with all the fees repeated and the prepayment penalty included, the lender/broker makes a lot of money from the transaction, and the owner has been stripped of his or her equity and, oftentimes, his or her home. 
   The problem is, most of these practices, while unethical and clearly abusive, are legal. There is a widening sense that this is a serious problem. Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve Board has recognized this as an increasing problem, as have the other banking regulators. For example, the FDIC is considering raising capital standards for all subprime lending; the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) has published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) asking for information and views on these very practices; HUD Secretary Cuomo and Treasury Secretary Summers have convened a Task Force on this issue. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have developed a number of products that are intended to reach out to homeowners with somewhat impaired credit in order to bring them into the financial mainstream. These companies have also announced that they will not buy loans with single premium credit insurance financed into the loan, one of the problems highlighted by this legislation. 
   Clearly, there is already some action to address the problem of predatory lending. But we need to do more. This legislation will outlaw the most abusive practices, and enable the marketplace to eliminate the others. This is a very important point. Let me give you an example. The bill prohibits the financing of more than 3% of a loan in fees for high cost loans, because it is the financing of fees and premiums on extraneous products that literally strip the equity out of a person's home. However, the bill would not prohibit additional fees from being charged, so we are not regulating profit. 
   We want to make sure that the loan is affordable to the borrower. Tying the lender's return to the loan's successful repayment is the best way to assure this. Now, some people have raised concerns that limiting the financing of fees will push up interest rates. This may be true, but it is also better to see the return to the lender reflected in the interest rate because it is much easier for people to shop on the basis of the interest rate. As a result, the market will help to keep rates down. Moreover, higher rate mortgages can always be refinanced as borrower's credit standing improves. 
   Mr. President, this legislation has the support of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the American Association of Retired People, the National Consumer Law Center, the Self-Help Credit Union of North Carolina, Consumers Union, Consumers Federation, ACORN, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, U.S. PIRG and others. 
   I want to make clear that this bill is aimed at predatory practices. There are many people who may have had some credit problems who still need access to affordable credit. They may only be able to get subprime loans, which charge higher interest rates. Clearly, to get the credit, they will have to pay somewhat higher rates because of the greater risk they represent. We want them to be able to get these loans. 
   But these families should not be stripped of their home equity through financing of extremely high fees, credit insurance, or prepayment penalties. They should not be forced into constant refinancing, losing more and more of the wealth they've taken a lifetime to build to a new set of fees each and every time. 
   This legislation will keep credit available, while discouraging or prohibiting these worst practices. The bill allows lenders to recover the costs of making their loans, while always leaving the door open to borrowers to repair their credit and move to lower cost loans. 
   Taken as a whole, predatory lending practices represent a frontal assault on homeowners all over America. Today,  we are coming to their defense. We must stop the American dream of homeownership from being distorted into a nightmare by these unscrupulous practices. We want to ensure that all borrowers, whether in the prime or subprime market, are treated fairly and responsibly. That is what this legislation is intended to do, and I urge my colleagues' consideration and support.

    Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, this week from April 9-15 we are celebrating the 42nd anniversary of ``National Library Week.'' As a strong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives to strengthen and protect libraries, I am pleased to take this opportunity to draw my colleagues' attention to this important occasion and to take a few moments to reflect on the significance of libraries to our nation. 
   When the free public library came into its own in this country in the 19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because of its commitment to the same principle of free and open exchange of ideas as the Constitution itself. Libraries have always been an integral part of all that our country embodies: freedom of information, an educated citizenry, and an open and enlightened society. They are the only public agencies in which the services rendered are intended for, and available to, every segment of our society. 
   It has been my longstanding view that libraries play an indispensable role in our communities. From modest beginnings in the mid-19th century, today's libraries provide well-stocked reference centers and wide-ranging loan services based on a system of branches, often further supplemented by travelling libraries serving outlying districts. Libraries promote the reading of books among adults, adolescents, and children and provide the access and resources to allow citizens to obtain reliable information on a vast array of topics. 
   Libraries gain even further significance in this age of rapid technological advancement where they are called upon to provide not only books and periodicals, but many other valuable resources as well. In today's society, libraries provide audio-visual materials, computer services, internet access terminals, facilities for community lectures and performances, tapes, records, videocassettes, and works of art for exhibit and loan to the public. In addition, special facilities libraries provide services for older Americans, people with disabilities, and hospitalized citizens. 
   Of course, libraries are not merely passive repositories of materials. They are engines of learning--the place where a spark is often struck for disadvantaged citizens who for whatever reason have not had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge available. I have the greatest respect for those individuals who are members of the library community and work so hard to ensure that our citizens and communities continue to enjoy the tremendous rewards available through our library system. 
   As we celebrate National Library Week, it should be noted that the Library of Congress will be 200 years old on April 24, 2000. The Library of Congress represents the oldest federal cultural institution in America. As we approach this birthday celebration, we should recognize that all libraries represent the cornerstone of knowledge in our local communities. 
   My own State of Maryland has 24 public library systems providing a full range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long tradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. This policy has been enhanced by the State Library Network which provides interlibrary loans to the State's public, academic, special libraries and school library media centers. The Network receives strong support from the State Library Resource Center at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, the Regional Library Resource Centers in Western, Southern, and Eastern Shore counties, and a Statewide database of holdings totalling 178 libraries. 
   The State Library Resource Center alone gives Marylanders free access to approximately 2 million books and bound magazines, over 1 million U.S. Government documents, 600,000 documents in microform, 11,000 periodicals, 90,000 maps, 20,000 Maryland State documents, and over 19,000 videos and films. 
   The result of this unique joint State-County resource sharing is an extraordinary level of library services available to the citizens of Maryland. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding service by borrowing more public library materials per person than citizens of almost any other State, with 67 percent of the State's population registered as library patrons. 
   I have had a close working relationship with members of the Maryland Library Association and others involved in the library community throughout the State, and I am very pleased to join with them and citizens throughout the nation in this week's celebration of ``National Library Week.'' I look forward to a continued close association  with those who enable libraries to provide the unique and vital services available to all Americans.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the amendment offered by Senators DURBIN, SCHUMER and KENNEDY to fully fund the President's firearms law enforcement initiatives. 
   Clearly, the gun violence facing our Nation is a complex problem, and there is disagreement in the Congress about the need for additional firearms legislation. However, many of my colleagues--both Democratic and Republican alike--are heeding the call of their constituents and advocating more stringent enforcement of our existing gun laws. With our Nation experiencing unprecedented fiscal health, we now have the opportunity to provide law enforcement with the resources it so urgently needs to enforce those laws. The Administration recognized that opportunity, and included in its proposed budget approximately $284 million to fund the largest national gun enforcement initiative in our history. 
   Mr. President, the Republican budget resolution does not include this $284 million for gun enforcement measures and, as a result, jeopardizes programs that have begun to make a real impact and helped to reduce firearms violence. For example, in my own State of Maryland, our United States Attorney, Lynne Battaglia has utilized Project DISARM--a cooperative effort between Federal, State, county, and local law enforcement officials that targets violent and repeat offenders for prosecution under Federal firearms laws. Similar to Richmond, Virginia's well-known ``Project Exile,'' Project DISARM was initiated in 1994 and has real potential for reducing firearm violence across the State. 
   Despite the initial success of Project DISARM--and tough Maryland laws that also prohibit felons from possessing firearms --the program simply does not have the resources to prosecute every person who violates these Federal laws. Project DISARM works with a limited staff, which is also responsible for prosecuting complex drug and money laundering cases. Simply put, for Project DISARM to effectively reduce further gun violence, additional prosecutors are needed. The President's $284 million gun control and enforcement initiative would add 500 new Federal ATF agents and over 1,000 new Federal, State and local prosecutors; $14.5 million of these funds would be used to create 163 positions--including 113 attorneys--to bolster firearms prosecution efforts like Project DISARM. 
   The resources provided in the President's budget are critical to Maryland's efforts to prevent gun violence, and could save lives in my State. Whatever our views on new gun control measures, we must work to ensure that our existing laws are enforced to their fullest extent--which will not occur unless law enforcement agencies have the resources to investigate and prosecute crimes. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to fully fund the President's gun control and enforcement initiative. This is a simple proposition that we should all agree on--the enforcement of our existing gun laws is a necessary step in reducing crime and making the Nation a safer place for us all.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Majority's budget resolution pending before the Senate--a budget that, in my view, will take the country in the wrong direction. 
   We meet at a time when the Nation is enjoying remarkable economic prosperity. Thanks to the strong economy and the fiscal discipline begun in 1993, the country is in a fiscal position no one thought possible even a few years ago. In 1997, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and nearly everyone else were predicting substantial budget deficits far into the next decade--as high as $159 billion in FY2000, $153 billion in FY2002 and continuing into the foreseeable future. Instead, the Nation is enjoying the longest economic expansion in its history. Since 1993, 20.8 million new jobs have been created, real wages have increased by 6.6 percent, the median family's income has grown by 12 percent, and the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 30 years. 
   I am proud to have been a part of the effort in 1993 that helped to create this positive economic climate. Working together, the President and Congressional Democrats crafted a package that finally brought the Federal deficit under control. By making difficult but critical decisions to cut Federal programs and raise revenues, we tamed the deficits that plagued the Nation throughout the 1980's, placed enormous pressure on important Federal initiatives, and hampered our economic growth. Most Republicans argued at the time that this responsible package would ruin the economy and send markets tumbling. They were dead wrong. 
   When you look at the choice we face for our economic future, we are at a sort of fork in the road. We can continue down the path of fiscal discipline begun in 1993, shoring up Social Security and Medicare, paying down the debt, investing more in our people--or we can take the other fork in the road embodied by irresponsible and unrealistic tax cuts that have been passed by the Majority in the Budget Committee, a path that will eventually eliminate any projected surplus, cause deep cuts in funding for critical education, health care, environmental or other programs, and put us back on a path toward deficits. 
   In my view, we have a tremendous opportunity right now with the strongest economy in history to move our country in the right direction--to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, to shore up education and address the issue of the digital divide, to expand access to health care and provide a meaningful prescription health benefit, to clean up the environment, to bring down the crime rate, and on and on. We can build on this effort and use this opportunity to secure a bright and prosperous future for our Nation and its citizens, or we can squander it with irresponsible decisions. 
   It is my strongly held view that any surplus realized in the near future should be seen as an opportunity to pay down the Nation's debt, invest in our Nation's future, and shore up vital programs. I am deeply concerned that much like the budget proposal put forward by the Majority last year, this year's budget resolution fails to take advantage of an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that the Federal government will meet its obligations after the baby boomers retire and beyond. 
   I am also concerned because the budget resolution before us would endanger our hard-won progress and shortchange national priorities that the American people want to see addressed. This is an opportunity for us to think seriously about our Nation's needs and priorities as we look into the 21st century, and chart an appropriate course for the future. The Republican budget resolution is less a forward-looking policy blueprint than a political document aimed at short-term gain. Let us take a balanced approach, and continue the fiscal discipline that has allowed our Nation to prosper. 
   The Democrats proposed a responsible budget resolution to the Committee. That alternative covered ten  years and would have reduced $330 billion in debt over ten years, while providing almost $300 billion in targeted tax cuts. Unlike the Republican budget resolution, it proposed realistic levels of discretionary spending, including the President's full requests for education and defense spending. It also reserved funding for very important programs, such as health coverage for uninsured Americans. Unfortunately, the Democratic alternative was defeated on a party-line vote. 
   We have come far economically and must be very careful as we move forward about how we use any budget surplus. In my view, we must emphasize paying down the national debt, protecting Social Security and Medicare, increasing spending for programs important to our Nation's future, and providing targeted tax cuts for working Americans. The Republican budget before us, in contrast, contains a $150 billion tax cut--enough to consume almost 98% of the non-Social Security surplus over the next 5 years. This leaves nothing for prescription drug coverage, education increases, and other initiatives critical to the future well-being of our Nation. 
   Mr. President, the Republican priorities evident in this resolution simply are not shared by most of the American people. The Majority's budget proposal falls far short of the mark in almost every respect and would take our country in the wrong direction. I strongly oppose this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National Digital Empowerment Amendment to be offered by my colleague, Senator MIKULSKI. Let me begin by expressing my deep thanks to Senator MIKULSKI for her leadership in the Senate in crafting this initiative. And I should mention that she has not only worked with her Senate colleagues on this, but has reached across to the House of Representatives, joining with the members of the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses, to ensure that it addresses the digital divide in a comprehensive and extensive way. She has also sought out the opinions of parents, teachers, children, business people and working people all across our State and the Nation to ensure that every community can reap the benefits of technology. 
   Moreover, I am pleased that members of the technology sector of our economy are participating so fully and have played such a key role in helping to develop this initiative. With the technological giants joining us in this effort, we are off to a great start in helping to ensure that every man, woman and child in our country will have the opportunity to access the Internet. 
   I believe we have a tremendous opportunity right now, with our economic prosperity, to begin closing this digital divide. We have the lowest unemployment rate and the lowest inflation rate in our country in more than 30 years. In our African-American and Hispanic communities, unemployment has fallen to some of the lowest levels in history. 
   And to help sustain this economic recovery, we must provide the tools to enable our people to obtain the skills necessary to compete in a global economy--an economy that is growing by leaps and bounds in part due to the technology sector and the opportunities it presents. 
   We are the world's leader of this technological revolution and our children are on the cusp of enjoying the full benefits of what it has to offer. In order to assist them in this endeavor, we must move forward to empowering each and every community with the technological skills and resources it requires. We can take a major step in this regard by passing this legislation--America's future deserves no less. So I lend my strong support to this amendment and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending Robb amendment to prevent the Majority from spending almost all of the non-Social Security surplus on tax breaks instead of prescription drug coverage for senior citizens. 
   Ensuring that older Americans have access to prescription drugs should be one of our top priorities, but the Majority is clearly more interested in enacting deep and unwarranted tax cuts. The Majority's FY 2001 Budget Resolution includes a deadline for consideration of their tax cut plan, but no date is set for establishing a prescription drug benefit. With this amendment, we would clarify that funding a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries will be given a higher priority than tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy. 
   Prescription medication is now essential to quality medical care, but many senior citizens cannot afford the  medicine they need because Medicare does not cover the cost of prescription drugs. When Medicare was created, it was modeled after a health care delivery system focused on inpatient hospital care. Today, drugs are as important as a hospital bed was in 1965, but over 13 million seniors have absolutely no assistance covering the cost of prescription medication. Medicare must be updated to include a prescription drug benefit. 
   Seniors need prescription drug coverage more than the average citizen because they generally live on fixed incomes and suffer from chronic diseases requiring drug therapy. To make matters worse, the cost of prescription drugs has been rising dramatically over the past few years. In addition, older Americans without any prescription drug coverage pay significantly more than HMOs, insurance companies, Federal health programs, and other favored customers for the same pharmaceuticals. 
   Currently, seniors can obtain some coverage for drugs by joining Medicare HMOs. But, these HMOs are not available in many parts of the country, particularly in the rural areas. Moreover, Medicare HMOs are sharply cutting back on the drug benefits they offer. 
   Medicare beneficiaries may also purchase drug coverage through Medigap insurance policies. However, these plans are extremely expensive and generally provide inadequate coverage. In addition, for most Medigap plans, the premiums substantially increase with age. Thus, just as beneficiaries need drug coverage the most and are least able to afford it, this drug coverage is priced out of reach. This cost burden particularly affects women who make up 73 percent of people over age 85. 
   Employer-sponsored retiree health plans generally offer adequate drug coverage. However, only about one quarter of Medicare beneficiaries have access to such plans. In addition, health care coverage for retirees is declining dramatically. According to a recent study, only 23 percent of Maryland firms now offer retiree health insurance. 
   During the Budget Committee's mark-up of the Majority's budget resolution, I supported an amendment to make $40 billion available for a prescription drug benefit. This amendment, which was adopted, will hopefully inspire action on this issue during the remaining months of this Congress. But, in the meantime, we must ensure that there will be funds available for this benefit by preventing the Majority's unreasonable tax cut plan from consuming the entire on-budget surplus first. 
   I urge my colleagues to take this opportunity to address one of the most widespread problems facing older Americans today by guaranteeing our seniors access to prescription medications instead of squandering the on-budget surplus on excessive tax cuts.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending Bingaman amendment to increase funding for education programs in the FY2001 budget resolution--programs that have been proven to increase student performance. Few of the problems facing us today are as important as the challenge of educating our children to meet the demands of the future. Yet, the budget resolution put forward by the Majority does nothing for key priorities like funding for high-quality teachers, smaller class sizes, modern and accountable schools, and expanded and improved technology in the classroom. In fact, total discretionary spending for education, training and social services programs in the Republican budget plan before us is $4.7 billion below the President's budget request, reducing discretionary education funding to below FY2000 levels. 
   I strongly supported an amendment offered during the Budget Committee markup to provide increased funding for smaller class sizes, school construction and renovation, and teacher quality--initiatives that are critical to ensuring an educated citizenry. I regret that Republican members of the Committee opposed this amendment, resulting in its defeat, and I would strongly urge my colleagues to support the pending amendment. 
   Mr. President, the quality of teachers and principals is essential to student achievement. Research indicates that high-quality teachers are the single most important determinant in how well students learn. Likewise, research has shown that students attending small classes with qualified teachers in early grades make more rapid educational progress than students in larger classes. This amendment would increase funding in these critical areas, as well as in other areas such as after-school programs and school modernization, offset by reducing the irresponsible tax cuts included in the Majority's proposal. It would also make higher education more affordable and accessible by increasing the maximum Pell Grant, and increasing funding for the TRIO and GEAR-UP programs. 
   Throughout my service in the United States Senate, I have been committed to the goal of ensuring a quality education for all our Nation's citizens. This amendment would move us in the direction of that important goal and I again urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very brief because Senator JOHNSON is going to handle the time on this side. He has been very intimately involved in shaping this legislation and has done an outstanding job and I think made a major contribution. 
   The bill that is now before us is a consequence of a unanimous consent agreement that was reached last year. Much discussion took place within the committee. As a consequence, we were able to move considerably closer on many of the issues that divided Members when we first addressed S. 2097. In fact, I think it is fair to say, with the exception of the issue Senator JOHNSON will raise on the floor, we have a consensus product before us that we can move through in short order. 
   We seek a loan guarantee program that will provide comprehensive television service for the American people at the best possible price. We are particularly concerned about rural Americans who have either no access or inadequate access to local television service. We seek to obtain that for them at an affordable price and yet, at the same time, protect the American taxpayer as we move forward with the loan guarantee program. Obviously, you have to strike the right balance among these objectives. I think the bill, with the Johnson amendment, with the proposal of the very able Senator from South Dakota, would accomplish that. 
   The chairman has gone over some of the specific provisions of the bill. I think it is important to note that the board we are providing, which will grant the loan guarantees, is made up from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Department of Agriculture. The day-to-day administration of the program would be done by the Rural Utilities Service, which would also write the regulations, subject to the approval of the board. The Rural Utilities Service is the most experienced agency in the Federal Government in dealing with this type of investment in rural areas. Therefore, we think they have a clear understanding of what is involved. 
   The guarantee level provided in the legislation is 80 percent. That differs, of course, from the House bill. It is designed to provide some additional safeguards. We also worked to ensure that the legislation would give priority to the projects seeking to provide services to areas in this country that are unserved and underserved, as we move toward trying to provide a universal service. 
   Senator JOHNSON led the effort on our side. We were markedly assisted by Senator BAUCUS, Senator HARKIN, and many others. I know there are a number of Senators on the Republican side of the aisle, too, who come from rural areas who are very deeply concerned about this issue. 
   Let me touch on the one important improvement that I hope will be made to this legislation, and that is the  Johnson initiative. The bill, as it is now before us, requires that the lenders involved in this program be FDIC insured. That is the requirement in the bill as it now stands. Many believe this is unnecessarily restrictive, that there are a number of other lenders and, in particular, the National Rural Utilities' Cooperative Finance Corporation, the CFC, which would be barred from participating in the program as the bill now stands. 
   Senator JOHNSON is intending to address that issue. Actually, the lender we are talking about--the Cooperative 
   Finance Corporation--is extremely well capitalized. It has over 11 percent shareholders' equity capital, which is better than 9 of the 10 largest banks in the country. The credit rating agencies rate CFC's debt as high as any of the largest federally insured banks and higher than most. So by these market standards, they are an extremely strong and well-managed financial institution. I see no reason to exclude it from the program. I think we can adjust to accommodate this issue. 
   I think we can achieve a broad, if not total, consensus on this legislation. I think, in fact, including lenders of this nature in the program will help to encourage the participation of organizations, such as rural cooperatives that have the most experience in doing business in rural areas and therefore make it more likely that the program will reach its ultimate goal of universal service in rural areas. 
   So I am supportive of the legislation with this change that we will seek to make. I think it meets all the questions and concerns that have been raised in a balanced and straightforward manner. Again, I thank Senator JOHNSON for his leadership on this issue, and I commend all the members of the committee, the chairman and all the members on his side, and on our side, who worked closely together to try to work out agreeable solutions to most of the concerns that have been expressed. 
   I think if we can address this one remaining concern on the floor in a positive and constructive way, we will have done a good piece of legislative work and will be able to move this issue forward. 
   Mr. President, I will yield the floor. Senator JOHNSON will manage the remainder of the time of the debate on this side of the aisle.

   Mr. SARBANES. I just want to make the point that in our committee, we agreed to an 80-percent guarantee, which I think was, in the end, accepted by everyone on the committee, although there were differing views about that question. I think it does provide an important measure of safety in considering this matter.  
   Secondly, is it correct that if these institutions, which amendment No. 2898 addresses in terms of qualifying--if this amendment carries, the board that is being established under this legislation would still have to approve any loan guarantee made by such an institution, is that correct?

It does not mean they can then go ahead and do these loan guarantees simply on their own. They have to obtain board approval in order to do that; that is, this board of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Department of Agriculture. Is that correct?

   Mr. SARBANES. Thirdly, I just make this observation. We are allowing FDIC institutions to do this. But, of course, in a sense, that creates an extra exposure that one of these institutions would not have because the Government, the taxpayer, would be exposed on the loan guarantee. But, in addition, if the institution itself were to run into serious trouble, there would be taxpayer exposure on the Federal deposit insurance for the depositors of that institution. Is that correct?

I think the limitations have a great deal of difficulty connected with them, which the Senator has outlined in his statement. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 835, the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1999. This legislation is absolutely vital to the future health of our nation's estuaries, including our largest and most productive estuary--the Chesapeake Bay, and Maryland's Coastal Bays, and I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this measure. 
   H.L. Mencken once called the Chesapeake Bay a ``great outdoor protein factory,'' a description which, perhaps more than any other, underscores the critical importance of protecting and restoring estuarine ecosystems. Estuaries provide habitat to more than three-quarters of the fish and shellfish harvested in the United States. They are home to thousands of species of plants and animals, including many endangered and threatened species. They support millions of American jobs and play a vital role in the quality of life that our citizens enjoy. But the health and productivity of our estuaries are being degraded or destroyed by the tremendous increase in shoreline population and development, increasing point and non-point source pollution and other activities. It is estimated that, over the past century, some estuaries have lost up to 90 percent of their original habitat. 
   The Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act seeks to reverse these trends by setting the goal of restoring 1 million acres of estuarine habitat by the year 2010. It authorizes federal funding totaling $315 million over the next 5 years for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in cooperation with NOAA, EPA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to carry out estuary habitat restoration projects and provides incentives for local communities to participate in creative partnerships. It also reauthorizes the National Estuary Program and, for the first time, enables EPA to provide grants to implement conservation and management plans as well as design the plans. 
   Also incorporated in this measure is S. 492, the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act (CBRA), which I introduced together with Senators WARNER, ROBB, MIKULSKI and SANTORUM to reauthorize and enhance EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program. Mr. President, the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) was established in 1983 with the signing of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement which formally bound the Federal Government and the States to work together to restore and protect the Bay. It is the oldest EPA geographic program and the first estuary in the nation to be targeted for restoration as a single ecosystem. EPA's participation in the CBP was formally authorized in the Water Quality Act of 1987. The Act authorized $3 million annually to support the activities of the Agency's Chesapeake Bay Program Office in Annapolis, Maryland which coordinates Federal and State efforts to restore and protect the Bay and $10 million annually for matching Interstate Development grants. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Program has evolved considerably in the years since it was first established and has become a model for other estuaries around the country and around the world. The Bay Program has pioneered a wide range of pollution control initiatives, including biological nutrient removal technology implemented at 42 wastewater treatment facilities; various agricultural nonpoint source controls, such as nutrient management and integrated pesticide 
   management being implemented  on nearly two million acres of agricultural land; and implementation of a basinwide ban on phosphate detergents and a national ban on tributylin. The Bay Program has also been a leader in establishing a large volunteer monitoring program; creating a sophisticated computer modeling program; identifying atmospheric deposition of nitrogen as a significant pollution source for east coast estuaries; conducting an extensive habitat restoration program including the opening of hundreds of miles of prime spawning habitat to migratory fish through the construction of fish passages; and the restoration of submerged aquatic vegetation to support the filtering of nutrients as well as habitat for the Bay's living resources. The CBP has also spawned landmark state legislation such as nutrient management of farms, growth management and forest conservation and critical area protection. 
   The 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement expanded initial restoration efforts by targeting nutrient overenrichment as the Bay's major problem, and establishing the goal to reduce by 40%, nutrients flowing into the Bay by 2000. The pact included 28 other specific commitments to address key issues in living resources, water quality, population growth and development, public information and public access. The 1992 Amendments to the Agreement moved the Program upriver, committing the 40% nutrient reduction goal to the ten major tributaries to the Bay, as well as committing to retain the 40% nutrient reductions as a permanent cap to be extended beyond 2000. 
   There are signs that the general degradation of Chesapeake Bay has ebbed, and actual restoration has begun. However, numerous problems remain. Rapid population growth and development are expected in the areas of the Bay watershed closest to its waters. Loadings of nitrogen and sediments to the Bay remain high. Toxic sediment and water column contaminants are a problem in specific regions of concern and some other Chesapeake Bay locations. Of great concern are recent outbreaks of Pfiesteria-like organisms and the occurrence of lesions from other sources on striped bass and other commercial and recreationally important finfish in the Bay. Important food chain species and populations of forage fish are also declining. 
   In order to address these problems and continue restoration efforts, the CBRA reauthorizes and increases funding for EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program from the current level of approximately $20 million to $30 million a year. It encourages and assists Chesapeake Bay Agreement signatories in meeting nutrient reduction, water quality, toxics reduction and prevention and habitat restoration goals, and requires that federal facilities within the watershed comply with nutrient reduction and other Agreement goals. The legislation also creates a new small watersheds program designed to help local groups preserve and restore stream corridors. The initiative would make ``seed grants'' and technical assistance available to local governments, nonprofit organizations and citizens' groups involved in river and stream-restoration projects. It is my hope that the legislation will enable the Chesapeake Bay Program to continue its leadership and technology transfer to other groups participating in the National Estuary Program, particularly in the areas of nutrient reduction through new technologies, such as biological nutrient removal; air deposition of nitrogen to estuarine and coastal waters; computer modeling; and environmental indicators with an emphasis on measuring improvements to living resources. 
   Mr. President, in my judgement, the provisions contained in S. 835, will pay significant dividends in the years ahead by helping to preserve and enhance our nation's estuaries, while at the same time improving the quality of life for our citizens. I want to commend the Chairman and ranking member of the Committee, Senators SMITH and BAUCUS, for moving this legislation to the Senate floor. In my judgement, the legislation is a real tribute and fitting legacy to the former Chairman of the Committee and author of the legislation, John Chafee. I also want to express my appreciation to the co-sponsors of the Chesapeake Bay bill, Senators WARNER, MIKULSKI, ROBB and SANTORUM for their assistance. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to clarify an important issue contained in the conference agreement on S. 376, the satellite reform bill, with respect to ``Level III direct access.'' 
   The conference agreement provides authority for so-called ``Level III direct access''--which is the ability of customers other than INTELSAT signatories to enter into agreements with INTELSAT for ordering, receiving and paying for space segment capacity--but it says nothing about the signatory fee that COMSAT is entitled to receive from direct access users as determined by the FCC's direct access order made effective December 6, 1999. I understand it is the intent of the conferees to preserve this signatory fee to compensate COMSAT for the costs it incurs as the U.S. signatory to INTELSAT during its brief transition to a procompetitive privatization. 
   Nothing in the conference agreement is intended to vacate the FCC's ``Level III direct access'' order made effective December 6, 1999, including its assessment of a signatory fee to be charged  to direct access users to offset COMSAT's signatory costs. I would also add that Congress is addressing direct access to INTELSAT before it privatizes. After privatization, when INTELSAT become a commercial company like any other, it can make whatever business decisions it wants with respect to marketing or distribution arrangements--again, just as other companies do. Once privatized, the government should not be interfering, let alone dictating, these arrangements one way or another.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, 
   today, along with several of my colleagues, I am introducing the Industry  Training Consortia Act to provide our nation's workforce with the information technology and computer skills it needs to meet the emerging and rapidly changing requirements of our various technology sectors. The purpose of this legislation is to assist our business sector in establishing a national technology training infrastructure to provide our workforce with the skills it requires to remain competitive in the global, high technology marketplace. 
   The United States is currently the world's science and technology leader. We have achieved this status largely because we have had the most skilled, innovative, and competitive workforce in the world. Indeed, technical innovation, according to a report by the President's Council of Economic Advisers, has been responsible for more than half of America's productivity growth over the past fifty years. But technology is evolving so rapidly that some of our workers are being left behind. If we fail to keep them honed and highly skilled we risk losing our competitive edge. 
   Having the appropriate information technology skills is becoming more and more important in all sectors of our economy, not only in the high and biotech industries and the manufacturing sector, but also in the so-called low-tech industries. More than half of the new jobs created between 1984 and 2005 require or will require some education beyond high school. The percentage of workers who use computers at work has risen from 25% to 46% between 1984 and 1993. Moreover, firms today are not only using more technology, but are also reorganizing production processes in new ways, such as cellular production, use of teams, and other high performance structures and methods requiring higher levels and new kinds of skills. 
   A growing number of industries throughout the country are reporting serious difficulties in hiring workers with appropriate computer and information technology skills. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has estimated that between 1998 and 2008 we will need 2 million more newly trained and skilled Information Technology workers. That's an average of 200,000 additional workers a year. 
   In my own State of Maryland, we currently face an estimated shortfall of 10-12,000 workers with appropriate technology skills. A Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development survey indicates that 80% of firms which hire manufacturing or skilled trade workers, reported significant difficulty in finding applicants with the required skills for technology intensive jobs. The same survey indicates that more than two-thirds of businesses hiring computer technicians, engineers, analysts, or other technical or laboratory personnel experienced difficulty finding qualified workers. It also mentions that fifty-five percent of firms that hire college-level scientists or technical program graduates reported the same difficulty and that 62% of these firms reported that their need for hiring these types of graduates is expected to increase over the next five years. 
   While well intentioned, many existing training programs across the country are not structured to address this problem head on, from the perspective of industry. And while some post-secondary training institutions have reached out to industry and become more customer-focused, more still must identify ways to respond directly to the changing skills needs of our 
   employers. Our community colleges, and even four-year colleges and universities, cannot shoulder the entire burden of continually reassessing skill needs and providing up-to-date training and equipment with which to train workers in relevant knowledge and skills. Some colleges and universities have been able to establish partnerships with larger firms that have human resource departments, but building partnerships with small and medium-sized firms has proven more difficult. 
   Many firms, but particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, have limited capacity to engage in significant and sustained workforce development efforts. Managers and owners of most firms are simply too busy running their business to develop training systems, especially for new or dislocated workers. Firms also often lack information on what kind of training they need and where they can get it. As a result, most forego training initiatives and instead try to hire workers away from other companies in related fields. 
   And because workers are so mobile, individual employers are reluctant to bear the burden of training employees, whether they are new or incumbent workers, simply due to the likelihood that they will leave to work for a competitor. Without an adequate return on the investment for paying to train their employees, coupled with an increasingly competitive global marketplace, many larger companies have begun to cut back on their in-house training programs. 
   A unique approach, one flexible enough to address the fluctuations, transitions and emerging needs of our high technology economy is required. In order to train and educate new entrants to the workforce, workers dislocated by economic change, and workers already in the workplace facing increased demands for higher levels of technology related skills, we need an industry driven training infrastructure. 
   The legislation I am introducing would establish working groups across the country in which employers, public agencies, schools, and workers can pool resources and expertise to train workers for emerging job opportunities and jobs threatened by economic and technological transition. It will help develop targeted consortia of industry, workers and training entities across the country to assess where and what gaps exist and provide the skills that industry and workers require to remain competitive and on the cutting edge. 
   Specifically, it would authorize a grants program--to be overseen by the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Labor,--and provide up to a $1 million federal match, for every dollar invested by state and local governments and the private sector for these working groups. The Department of Commerce would be authorized to budget $50 million annually for this purpose and funds would be allocated through a competitive grants process, with each consortia of firms as applicants. 
   This legislation will allow industries to identify their own skills needs and build these consortia around their common requirements. Alliances would serve to harness the expertise of state and local officials, educational leaders, regional chapters of trade associations and union officials and pool the resources available among these entities. But each group would be predominantly made up of industry, and would be industry driven. Indeed, if we are going to address what is becoming a skills crisis in this country, our businesses must have a leadership role in establishing the means by which we continue to build and upgrade the skills of workers in technology related fields. 
   Smaller scale versions of the types of skills alliances which my legislation proposes to develop have already shown promise. In Wisconsin, metal-working firms have banded together with the AFL-CIO in a publicly sponsored effort that used an abandoned mill building as a teaching facility, teaching workers essential skills on state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment. Rhode Island helped develop a skills alliance among plastics firms, who then worked with a local community college to create a polymer training laboratory linked to an apprenticeship program that guarantees jobs for graduates. In Washington, DC telecommunications firms donated computers, and helped to set up a program to train public high school students to be computer network administrators and are now hiring graduates of the program at an entry-level salary of $25,000-30,000.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of Women's History Month--a time to honor the many great women leaders from our past and present who have served our Nation so well. These women have worked diligently to achieve social  change and personal triumph often against incredible odds. As scientists, writers, doctors, teachers, and mothers, they have shaped our world and guided us down the road to prosperity and peace. For far too long, however, their contributions to the strength and character of our society went unrecognized and undervalued. 
   It is also important to recognize the countless American women whose names and great works are known only to their families. They too have played critical roles in the development of our State and National heritage. 
   Women have led efforts to secure not only their own rights, but have also been the guiding force behind many of the other major social movements of our time--the abolitionist movement, the industrial labor movement, and the civil rights movement, to name a few. We also have women to thank for the establishment of many of our early charitable, philanthropic, and cultural institutions. 
   I am proud of the many women from Maryland whose bravery, hard work, and dedication have earned them a place in our Nation's history. They include Margaret Brent, America's first woman lawyer and landholder. In 1648, she went before the Maryland General Assembly demanding the right to vote. Another brave Maryland woman was Harriet Tubman, hero of the Underground Railroad, who was personally responsible for freeing over 300 slaves. Dr. Helen Taussig, another great Marylander, in 1945, developed the first successful medical procedure to save ``blue babies'' by repairing heart birth defects in children whose blood was starved of oxygen, turning their skin a bluish hue. This breakthrough laid the foundation for modern heart surgery. 
   I would also like to recognize my colleague, another great Maryland woman, Senator BARBARA A. MIKULSKI. One of only nine female Members of the Senate, she has forged a path for women legislators into the Federal political arena and has tirelessly fought for recognition of the right of women to equal treatment and opportunities in our society. Through her leadership, the effort to designate March as Women's History Month has been a resounding success. 
   Other Maryland women leaders include Dr. Lillie Jackson and Enolia McMillan, two great champions of the Civil Rights Movement, and Henrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America. Hattie Alexander, a native of Baltimore, was a microbiologist and pediatrician who won international recognition for deriving a serum to combat influenzal meningitis. Rachel Carson, founder of the environmental movement, Billie Holiday, the renowned jazz singer, and Elizabeth Seton, the first 
   American canonized as a saint were also all from Maryland. The achievements and dedication of these women are a source of inspiration to us all. 
   Now more than ever, women are a guiding force in Maryland and a major presence in our business sector. As of 1996, there were over 167,000 women-owned businesses in our State--that amounts to 39 percent of all firms in Maryland. Maryland's women-owned businesses employ over 301,000 people and generate over $39 billion in sales. Between 1987 and 1996, the number of women-owned firms in Maryland is estimated to have increased by 88 percent. 
   During Women's History month we have the opportunity to remember and praise great women leaders who have opened doors for today's young women in ways that are often overlooked. Their legacy has enriched our lives and deserves prominence in the annals of American history. 
   With this in mind, I have co-sponsored legislation again this Congress to establish a National Museum of Women's History Advisory Committee. This Committee would be charged with identifying a site for the National Museum of Women's History and developing strategies for raising private funding for the development and maintenance of the museum. Ultimately, the museum will enlighten the young and old about the key roles women have played in our Nation's history and the many contributions they have made to our culture. 
   However, we must do more than merely recognize the outstanding accomplishments women have made. Women's History Month also is a time to recognize that women still face substantial obstacles and inequities. At every age, women are more likely than their male contemporaries to be poor. A working woman still earns on average only 74 cents for every dollar earned by a man. A female physician only earns about 58 cents to her male counterpart's dollar, and female business executives earn about 65 cents for every dollar paid to a male executive. The average personal income of men over 65 is nearly double that of their female peers. Access to capital for female entrepreneurs is still a significant stumbling block, and women business owners of color are even less likely than white women entrepreneurs to have financial backing from a bank. 
   To address some of these discrepancies, I have co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act which would provide more effective remedies to victims of wage discrimination on the basis of sex. It would enhance enforcement of the existing Equal Pay Act and protect employees who discuss wages with co-workers from employer retaliation. 
   On the other hand, we have made great strides toward ensuring a fairer place for women in our society. The college-educated proportion of women, although still smaller than the comparable proportion of men, has been increasing rapidly. In 1995, women represented 55 percent of the people awarded bachelor's degrees, 55 percent of people awarded masters', 39 percent of the doctorates, 39 percent of the M.D.'s, and 43 percent of the law degrees. As recently as the early 1970s, the respective percentages were 43 percent, 40 percent, 14 percent, 8 percent, and 5 percent. Women are now the majority in some professional and managerial occupations that were largely male until relatively recently. 
   The future does not look so bright for women in many other countries where women not only lack access to equal opportunities, but even worse are subject to dehumanizing social practices and abominable human rights violations. For this reason, I have added my name to a resolution calling on the Senate to act on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. 
   Mr. President, in the dawn of this new millennium, we must renew our efforts to ensure that gender no longer predetermines a person's opportunities or station in life. It is my hope that we can accelerate our progress in securing women's rights. As we celebrate Women's History Month, let us reaffirm our commitment to the women of this Nation and to insuring full equality for all of our citizens.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am most pleased to join millions of Americans in commemorating African-American History Month and particularly this year's theme ``Heritage and Horizons: The African Legacy and the Challenges of the 21st Century.'' This theme as announced by the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History (ASALH) is most appropriate and timely as we enter a new millennium and hopefully a new and even brighter era of African-American progress. 
   Since 1926, Americans have observed a time during the month of February to recognize the vast history and legacy that African-Americans have contributed to the founding and building of this great nation. It was the vision of the noted author and scholar, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, that led to this celebration. As we review the last 100 years, it is important to remember that there have been many challenges and changes in the 1900's for African-Americans. 
   During the early 1900's, discrimination against African-Americans was very wide spread. By 1907, every Southern state required racial segregation on trains and in churches, schools, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and in other public places. New leaders for the African-American race emerged such as W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, whose intellectual thoughts on the progress and direction of African-Americans are still very much discussed in the community. 
   There was also the Northern migration of hundreds of thousands of Southern African-Americans during World War I to seek jobs in defense plants and other factories. Many African-Americans served our country admirably during this war and in World War II. Like World War I, this war led to the expansion of defense-related industries and opportunities in the North for employment. During the 1940's, about a million Southern African-Americans moved North. Discrimination played a large role in the labor industry which led A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to threaten a march on Washington, D.C. President Roosevelt then issued an executive order forbidding racial discrimination in defense industries. 
   Following World War II, three major factors encouraged the beginning of a new movement for civil rights. First, many African-Americans served with honor in the war, as they had in many of the wars since the American Revolution. However, in this instance, African-American leaders pointed to the records of these veterans to show the  injustice of racial discrimination against patriots. Second, more and more African-Americans in the North had made economic gains, increased their education, and registered to vote. Third, the NAACP had attracted many new members and received increased financial support from blacks and whites. Additionally, 
   a young group of energetic lawyers, including Thurgood Marshall, of Baltimore, Maryland, used the legal system to bring about important changes in the lives of African-Americans, while Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. appealed to the conscience of all Americans. 
   Congress had an important role in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I am pleased to note that Clarence Mitchell Jr. of Maryland played a critical part in steering this legislation through Congress. African-Americans also began to assume more influential roles in the national government, a development which has benefitted the entire Nation. 
   Gains in education for the African-American community have been significant. From 1970 to 1980, college enrollment among African-Americans rose from about 600,000 to about 1.3 million. This gain resulted in part from affirmative action programs by predominantly white colleges and universities. By the early 1990's about 11 percent of all African-Americans 25 years of age or older had completed college. About two-thirds of that group had finished high school. There have also been many more advances and accomplishments during that time, but this is just a brief overview of what has been a tremendous and rich history and heritage for African-American people in our Nation for the last 100 years. 
   As we look forward to a new century, we anticipate that African-Americans will continue to prosper in American society and throughout the world. Their success is our success. As we look towards the horizon, we see record breaking events for African-Americans. 
   The unemployment rate for African-Americans has fallen from 14.2 percent in 1992 to 8.3 percent in 1999--the lowest annual level on record. The median household income of African-Americans is up 15.1 percent since 1993, from $22,034 in 1993 to $25,351 in 1998. The real wages of African-Americans have risen rapidly in the past two years, up about 5.8 percent for African-American men and 6.2 percent for African-American women since 1996. 
   The African-American poverty rate has dropped from 33.1 percent in 1993 to 26.1 percent in 1998--the lowest level ever recorded and the largest five-year drop in more than twenty-five years. Since 1993, the child poverty rate among African-Americans has dropped from 46.1 percent to 36.7 percent in 1998--the biggest five-year drop on record. While the African-American child poverty rate is still too high, it is the lowest level on record. As the African-American population continues to expand, we continue to strive to make laws that improve the lives of all Americans so that many more record breaking accomplishments occur. 
   As we begin the first Census count of the 21st century, we are working to ensure that Census 2000 is the most accurate census possible using the best, most up-to-date methods to make sure every person is counted. According to the Census Bureau, the 1990 Census missed 8.4 million people and double-counted 4.4 million others. 
   Nationally, 4.4 percent of African-Americans were not counted in the 1990 census. While missing or miscounting so many people is a problem, the fact that certain groups--such as children, the poor, people of color, and city dwellers--were missed more often than others made the undercount even more inaccurate. A fair and accurate Census is a fundamental part of a representative democracy and is the basis for providing equality under the law. Therefore, I encourage everyone to make sure your neighbor is counted. 
   I would also like to observe that the State of Maryland is currently benefitting from a continued growth in our African-American population. Between 1990 and 1997, when the last set of complete figures were available from the Census Bureau, the number of African-Americans calling Maryland ``home'' grew to 1.4 million--an increase of 200,609 people. This makes Maryland the state with the eighth largest African-American population in the United States. Nearby Prince George's County was second in the Nation in terms of growth during this seven-year period with 68,325 new African-American residents. I am confident that an accurate Census 2000 count will show increases in these figures across the state. 
   I am also most gratified to note that finally, a memorial to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has been approved and a site near the tidal basin in Washington D.C. was chosen. The sacrifice that Dr. King made for civil rights has touched every element of American society. I am particularly pleased to be involved in this effort to mark the contributions of this great leader. This memorial will join the monuments to Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln in some of the most hallowed ground in our Nation. 
   Mr. President, as we look towards the future for African-Americans during this new century, it is my hope that the King Memorial will serve both as a monument to past achievements and our heritage, and also as an inspiration for our Nation to continue the struggle for an equality that includes all Americans.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would alleviate the $500,000 cost associated with the transfer of the former Bainbridge Naval Training Center in Cecil County, Maryland. It is my hope that this bill will help expedite the development of this property by the Bainbridge Development Corporation and the State of Maryland, and allow this site to realize its tremendous potential as soon as possible. Moreover, the money that the BDC will save through this waiver will be put towards salvaging several of the historic buildings on the site, namely, the historic Tome School. 
   Next week, I will participate in the transfer ceremony for this base, which now represents 1200 acres of pristine and strategically located land. The transfer follows decades of negotiations and cleanup, and I, along with the Navy, my constituents in Cecil County, and the other members of the Maryland State congressional delegation hope to see development of this site begin promptly. 
   In my view, the transfer of the Bainbridge site is a shining example of what can be accomplished through partnerships between Federal, State, and local governments. I introduce this bill to sustain our momentum and move this property into productive use as expeditiously as possible. Mr. President, I have spoken with the appropriate Navy officials regarding this matter and they have raised no concerns about this waiver. Indeed, this is truly a non-controversial measure with a very modest cost and I urge my colleagues to support its swift passage.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to rise today to join with nearly 1 million Lithuanian-Americans in commemorating the 81st anniversary of an independent Lithuania. On February 16, it is customary for those of Lithuanian heritage, and their friends and supporters to celebrate the proclamation of a progressive and independent Republic of Lithuania, which was reestablished after more than seven centuries of struggle. Lithuania's democratic hopes were realized once before this century, yet freedom was abruptly revoked in 1940, after 22 years of democratic governance. While February 16th reminds us of Lithuania's long and difficult period, it also affords us the opportunity to commend the determination and courage of the citizens of Lithuania and other Baltic nations. Their strong commitment to democratic values serves as an incentive for us all to rededicate ourselves to the principles for which this important day stands, liberty and freedom. 
   The history of this nation has been marked by constant struggle against aggressors. Through countless invasions, Lithuanian defenders have stood resolutely against their foes and have demonstrated their commitment to independence. After well over a century of domination, the people of Lithuania proclaimed their independence and reestablished their sovereignty as a nation on February 16, 1918. For more than two decades, this young nation prospered economically and lived at peace with its neighbors. The events of World War II brought this period to an end when, in 1940, Lithuania was occupied by Soviet Armed forces. Our thoughts must turn to those Lithuanians who suffered under the brutality of the Nazi and Soviet occupations. Many risked and lost their lives for the rights and freedoms that Lithuanians today are privileged to enjoy. Their steadfast determination and courage eventually prevailed, providing hope for all peoples who dreamt someday of being free. 
   In 1990, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuania rejoined the international community of democratic nations and embraced political and economic reforms. Lithuania experienced a peaceful transfer of civilian rule, despite a difficult period of transition, and has committed to pursuing economic reforms which offer the possibility of greater prosperity, a bright future and sustainable growth for years to come. To this end, Lithuania has chosen to engage with its neighbors and other democracies by joining The Baltic Economic Cooperation Agreement and the Council of Europe and through their desire to join the European Union. 
   The Lithuanian people have drawn their strength from a sense of nationhood. This has been most evident here in the United States, where we have witnessed the dedication of Lithuanian Americans to the freedom of their native land. Their perseverance has encouraged many of us to stand in this body over the last several decades and proclaim our support for a Lithuanian republic. 
   We in Maryland, and our Nation, are particularly fortunate to have such an active Lithuanian-American community. Longstanding traditions of self-help, volunteerism and the dedication to democratic ideals that have prevailed in the community have truly enriched the history of our country. In areas ranging from business, to academia, to the arts, Lithuanian-Americans consistently make significant contributions across the Nation. 
   Every year Lithuanians gather in their capital, Vilnius, to commemorate this anniversary. I am proud that we in the United States have continued to stand with them on this occasion, both in years when there was much to celebrate and in years when there were only dreams of a better future. I am confident that we will continue to celebrate this anniversary in the future with the same optimism that we do this year.

   Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Alan Greenspan to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. As I mentioned in the Banking Committee when we held the hearing on the nomination of Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, one of the distinctive aspects of the Federal Reserve Board as an institution has been its remarkable stability of leadership. 
   Since 1934, when President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Marriner Eccles to be Federal Reserve Board Chairman until today--a period of over 65 years--there have been only seven Federal Reserve Board Chairmen; only seven. Among them are some of the outstanding economic leaders of our country. Marriner Eccles himself served 14 years as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. William McChesney Martin served 19 years. Arthur Burns and Paul Volcker each served 8 years. 
   If Chairman Greenspan is confirmed--I am assuming, I think reasonably so, that would be the case--and serves the full length of his fourth term, as I expect he will, he will be the second longest serving Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. I think it is fair to say, in looking at his tenure as Chairman, that he will take his place among those other outstanding public servants who have provided exceptional economic leadership to our country. 
   Earlier this week, the U.S. economy achieved the longest expansion in its history with 107 months of continuous growth. We have achieved high levels of growth that have brought us the lowest levels of unemployment in 30 years, and all of this has been accomplished with the lowest levels of inflation in 30 years. 
   We have had a very virtuous economy in terms of low unemployment and low inflation. The expansion has now gone on long enough that its benefits have begun to be felt by the hardest to employ workers in our economy. Many companies now have instituted training programs which, of course, is all to the good. It enables us to improve the skills and the abilities of our workforce. It enables us to draw people into the workforce who heretofore have not been a part of it. A strongly vibrant economy is important to the success of any Welfare-to-Work initiative. One of the reasons that Welfare to Work has shown some of the results which it has shown is because it has taken place in the context of an economy moving towards or at full employment. 
   The performance of the economy has defied the conventional wisdom once held by some in the economic profession that there was some arbitrary rate of unemployment below which the economy could not go without triggering inflation. 
   Credit for this achievement should be shared. President Clinton and former Treasury Secretaries Bentsen and Rubin deserve credit for their disciplined leadership on fiscal policy which has eliminated our budget deficit and moved us into budget surpluses. The Congress also should share in that credit for maintaining fiscal discipline which has enabled us to come out of a deficit budget situation  into a surplus budget situation, although I would add as a word of caution that I think we need to be extremely careful and prudent now in the steps we take. 
   These surpluses about which so many people are talking in terms of what are they going to do with them are projected surpluses. They are not surpluses in hand and they depend very much on the continued healthy performance of the economy. I think it is imperative that we not go to excesses, whether on the spending side or the tax-cutting side, which would knock this economic engine off the track. 
   In addition--obviously highly relevant to the subject before us--Chairman Greenspan deserves credit for complementing the tight fiscal policy of the administration and the Congress with a monetary policy that has allowed our economy to grow. In doing so, he focused on the evidence before him and 
    was not bound by arbitrary assumptions about the limits of our economy's ability to grow without triggering inflation. 
   I think the Chairman has been very pragmatic as he has made his judgments. I think he has been very much driven by the facts of the situation and has not come at it with these ideological presuppositions into which he then tries to bend the facts but has taken the facts, evaluated them, and made his judgments. 
   I am reminded of the fact that some years back within the Federal Reserve System there was a regional bank president who asserted that if the economy started growing and drove the unemployment rate down or looked as though it was going to be below 6.7 percent unemployment, then inflation would virtually automatically start to rise and, therefore, the Fed had the responsibility--the Open Market Committee--as the economy was growing in this direction to start curtailing the economy, of slowing it down by raising the interest rates because unless they did that, a strongly growing economy would bring the unemployment rate down below 6.7 percent. And that was the magic point at which the inflation rate would start going up. 
   Fortunately, the Chairman, Chairman Greenspan, and a majority of his colleagues, never bought into this theory. Now we see the fact we have brought unemployment down to just over 4 percent, and we have no significant inflation problem before us. 
   There is a lot of credit that can go around. I mean, when you have success, everyone has fostered it. But I am quite happy certainly to allocate a portion of that to the Chairman and the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. 
   I have disagreed with Chairman Greenspan in the past about monetary policy, and may well disagree with him again in the future. I have been very much oriented to growth and jobs. I have always been deeply concerned about these so-called preemptive strikes against inflation where you slow growth and job production without any visible sign of inflation--simply some sort of anticipation of it. I have always argued that we ought to let the economy run for a while and see what it produces. The recent experience, of course, has been very encouraging because we brought unemployment down very significantly and have not triggered an inflation problem. 
   All in all, though, I think it is more than fair to say that Alan Greenspan has been a skillful and dedicated Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and merits confirmation for another term. 
   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join in supporting this nomination of Alan Greenspan to another 4-year term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. 
   Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the able Senator from New York, and not only a member but a very strongly contributing member of our committee.

There are other Members who have been actually allocated time specifically. Of course, we presume they will be coming to the floor in order to use that time.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am most pleased to join with the citizens of Maryland, Governor Parris Glendening, and other colleagues in government in welcoming Maestro Yuri Temirkanov, one of the most talented and gifted conductors of our time, as the new Music Director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. 
   Maestro Temirkanov's inspired energy, imagination, and popularity, coupled with the renowned excellence and stellar reputation of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, promises Marylanders and the nation an unprecedented artistic combination. As the eleventh Music Director in the Orchestra's 83-year history, Maestro Temirkanov will oversee all artistic programming of the BSO, conduct twelve subscription concerts, the opening fundraising gala, any recordings, and will lead tours as well. 
   The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, through its critically-acclaimed concert tours, Grammy Award-winning recordings, and cutting-edge concert formats, has earned deserved respect in the world of classical music. The addition of Maestro Temirkanov takes the BSO to the highest echelon of musical excellence and achievement. A recent article from the Baltimore Sun included the following quote from Mikhail Baryshnikov:  
   Baltimore audiences can look forward to special excitement, because Yuri Temirkanov is one of the truly inspired maestros of today.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I express my appreciation to the managers of the bankruptcy bill, Senators LEAHY, TORRICELLI, GRASSLEY, and HATCH, for accepting and including an amendment I had planned to offer on the floor as part of the managers' amendment to S. 625. My amendment requires that a simple yet important disclosure be made on credit card bills to help protect consumers. 
   During the bankruptcy reform debate in the last Congress, the Senate examined whether the increased rate of consumer bankruptcies in the Nation resulted solely from consumers' access to an excessively permissive bankruptcy process, or whether other factors also contributed to this increase. Ultimately we concluded that the record increase in bankruptcy filings across the nation was due not only to the ease with which one can enter the bankruptcy system, but also to the unparalleled levels of consumer debt--especially credit card debt--being run up across the country. As Senator DURBIN noted, and as the CBO, FDIC, and numerous economists have found, the rate of increase in bankruptcy filings paralleled the rate of increase in consumer debt. 
   This is not a coincidence. Rather, increased bankruptcies proceed directly from the fact that Americans are bombarded daily by credit card solicitations that promise easy access to credit without informing their targets of the implications of signing up for such credit. 
   During our debate in the last Congress, the Senate also concluded that irresponsible borrowing could be reduced, and many bankruptcies averted, if Americans were provided with some basic information in their credit card materials regarding the consequences of assuming greater debt. A consensus emerged that credit card companies have some affirmative obligation to provide such information to consumers in their solicitations, monthly statements, and purchasing materials, in light of their aggressive pursuit of less and less knowledgeable borrowers. 
   As a result of this consensus, the Senate's bankruptcy bill in the last Congress--S. 1301--contained several provisions in the managers' amendment addressing credit card debt, and requiring specific disclosures by credit card companies in their payment and solicitation materials. These provisions, which I sponsored along with Senators DODD and DURBIN, were vital to the Senate's success in adopting balanced bankruptcy reform legislation by the overwhelming margin of 97-1. 
   Unfortunately, the House-Senate conference committee struck these disclosure provisions from its final conference report, leaving the bankruptcy bill again a one-sided document that failed to account for the role credit card companies play in the accumulation of credit card debt and in increased consumer bankruptcy rates. As a result of the conference committee's actions, the conference report died in the waning days of the 105th Congress. 
   As we again debate bankruptcy legislation, it remains my firm belief that Congress must address both sides of the consumer bankruptcy equation--both the flaws in the bankruptcy system that make it easy for people to declare bankruptcy even if they have the ability to pay their debts, and the lending practices that encourage people with limited financial resources to accumulate debts that are beyond their ability to repay. 
   Last year, the Senate adopted an amendment to S. 625 that requires credit card issuers to give customers on their billing statements three disclosures: (1) warning that paying just the minimum monthly amount will increase the interest they pay and the time it takes to repay their balances; (2) a generic example; and (3) a toll-free number a customer can call for an estimate of how long he or she has to pay the minimum payment and the total payment to pay off his balance. However, the amendment contained an exception for certain credit card issuers that provide actual, instead of estimated, payment information. Such a credit card issuer would not have to disclose the warning, an example, or even the telephone number. This situation subverted the purpose of this section and distorted the balance contained in the original amendment. 
   My amendment would restore this balance by requiring some disclosures to be given by certain credit card issuers that have a toll-free number for informing customers of the actual number of months it takes to repay outstanding balances using minimum monthly payments requirement. It requires such credit card issuers to make two disclosures: (1) the telephone number and (2) a warning. My amendment requires the credit card bill to contain the statement, ``Minimum Payment Warning: Making only the minimum payment will increase the interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance. For more information, call this toll-free number: __XXX.'' 
   If we are going to make it harder for individuals to file for bankruptcy, we need to make certain that they are informed about their credit decisions. The minimal warning contained in my amendment helps credit card customers who pay the minimum monthly amount on their credit card bills better understand how long it will take and how much they will pay to work off the balance. The Financial Literacy Center has calculated that a consumer who, for example, has a $5,000 loan balance outstanding on which 17% interest is charged and who is paying 2% of the balance each month, will take 50 years to pay off the entire loan and end up paying $33,447. That is a very long time and a significant burden that, with the disclosures in my amendment, debtors will be able to better appreciate.  
   My amendment helps consumers get important information that will enable them to analyze how to manage their credit card borrowing more effectively.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 761, the Third Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This is an important bill at a pivotal time in our nation's history. The rapid growth of the Internet, and its transformation from an academic research tool to a truly global communications network, is exerting its influence in more and more areas of our daily lives. 
   One are of enormous change is the way in which Americans buy, sell, and trade products and services. Just as the general store gave way to the shopping mall and mail order catalogues, these now ``traditional'' forms of retailing are being supplanted by electronic commerce over the Internet. Electronic retailers are providing consumers with a broad range of new choices in goods and services. 
   Electronic transactions are also becoming an integral part of business-to-business relationships. Ordering, billing, and a host of other activities are now being handled by electronic means, cutting both costs and transaction times. These techniques will make our overall economy more efficient, and the benefits should eventually be passed on to consumers. 
   The world of electronic commerce is not without its problems, however. One of the largest of these is the lack of coherent legal framework for the conduct of electronic transactions. The commercial world is governed by a patchwork of Federal, state, and local laws. Because electronic commerce is such a recent phenomenon, it can be difficult to apply existing commercial codes and statutes to these new kinds of transactions. Often the laws are simply silent on electronic issues, leading to uncertainty for businesses and consumers alike. 
   One such area is electronic signatures. Technology now exists that can replace written signatures on paper documents with computer code that performs the same functions. However, many states have not yet enacted laws to ensure that digital signature technologies, when used in a reasonable and appropriate manner, will be considered valid. According to business groups, this uncertainty has had a dampening effect on the growth of electronic commerce. 
   Many state legislatures are hard at work to devise a workable, consistent legal framework for electronic records and signatures. Until their efforts are complete, however, S. 761, the bill introduced by Senator ABRAHAM, will serve as a stop-gap measure. It will provide a measure of legal certainty, while protecting the rights of consumers under existing laws governing many types of transactions. 
   I am pleased to have worked closely with Senator ABRAHAM, Senator LEAHY, Senator WYDEN, members of the Commerce Committee, industry, and consumer groups to craft a bill that answers the legal need, yet provides for continued consumer protections. I would like briefly to describe some of these critical consumer protection aspects of the bill. 
   While electronic commerce can provide consumers with enormous benefits, a sad stream of news articles over the past few years show clearly that there are unscrupulous operators on the Internet. The passage of this Act is intended to serve as a means of protecting consumers from deceptive practices. 
   To provide businesses with greater legal certainty, the bill stipulates that contracts cannot be deemed unenforceable solely because they involved the use of an electronic signature. Under this bill, companies and consumers should only be able to agree to reasonable and appropriate electronic signature technologies that provide adequate security to both parties. However, as the definition of the electronic signature makes clear, the electronic signature is only valid under this Act if the person intended to sign the contract. 
   The basic rules of good faith and fair dealing apply to electronic commerce, and this Act should not be the basis upon which parties to a contract can be asked to agree to terms and conditions for using electronic signatures and electronic contracts which are unreasonable based on the circumstances surrounding the transaction. For example, when the parties have conducted a transaction entirely in person, the fine print of a form contract should not include an agreement that the contract can be provided electronically rather than on paper. In addition, companies must deliver to consumers electronic records of the contract in a form they can receive, retain, and use to prove the terms of an agreement. Such an electronic record would have to be provided in a ``locked,'' or tamper proof, format. 
   Regarding new laws on electronic transactions, the states have been engaged for some time, through the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, in the formulation of a model Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). Versions of the UETA will be enacted by the individual states. The bill we are considering today includes a revised definition of UETA, changed from the bill reported by the Commerce Committee, that gives states more flexibility to pass versions of UETA that best meet the needs of their citizens. It is intended that California's recently passed version of UETA, for example, meet this test. 
   I would like once again to thank my colleagues, Senator ABRAHAM, Senator LEAHY, and Senator WYDEN for their hard work on this issue. I believe that we have reached an accommodation on this legislation that provides industry with the provisional legal certainty they seek, while ensuring that existing consumer laws are not diluted by the increasing use of electronic commerce. This is an important step toward making our commercial laws ready for the twenty-first century.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to note that Congress is taking the first important step toward providing debt relief for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. As co-sponsor, with Senator MACK, of legislation to authorize U.S. participation in this critically important international initiative, I believe that easing the debt burden of the world's poorest countries is one of the most meaningful things we can do to help these nations eradicate poverty and grow their economies on a sustainable basis. 
   The final version of the Foreign Operations appropriations bill contained enough money and authorizations to permit the HIPC Initiative to go forward, but there is more we have to do in Congress, beginning early next year, to provide the resources necessary to address the debt burden of the countries that are expected to qualify. As ranking member on the authorizing subcommittee in Foreign Relations, I intend to work hard to achieve the necessary additional authorizations there, including the very important one for U.S. contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund. I would like today to engage Senator GRAMM in a colloquy on the commitment I understand he made to the Administration to act on the necessary remaining IMF authorization in the Banking Committee as well.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in recent years there has been renewed interest in the early history of the Jewish community in Greece. The Hellenic and Jewish peoples have had a long and constructive relationship, and that interaction has been one of the foundations of Western civilization. 
   An important part of this historical movement is the renewed research on historic Jewish sites in Greece. There is now an active and impressive Jewish museum in Athens which has served as a focal point for this activity. These efforts have spawned a number of individuals to do their own family and group research; and I am pleased to report that one of my constituents, Dr. Judith Mazza, has written an excellent account of her visit to Greece entitled, ``First-time Traveler's Impressions of Jewish Sites in Greece,'' which was published in the spring 1999 issue of Kol haKEHILA. Dr. Mazza is descended from a Romaniote Jewish family from Greece, and her article depicts succinctly the rich and enduring Jewish cultural and religious legacy in Greece. I recommend it to all those interested in the history of the Jewish people and ask that the article be inserted at this point in the RECORD.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator KENNEDY's amendment to raise the Federal minimum wage. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the legislation upon which this amendment is based to raise the minimum wage 50 cents a year over the next two years, bringing it to $6.15 per hour by the year 2001. 
   For more than half a century, Congress has acted to guarantee minimum standards of decency for working Americans. The objective of a Federal minimum wage is to make work pay well enough to keep families out of poverty and off Government assistance.  Any individual who works hard and plays by the rules should be assured a living standard for his or her family that can keep them out of poverty. 
   If nothing is done during the year 2000, the real value of the minimum wage will be just $4.90 in 1998 dollars--about what it was before Congress last acted to increase the minimum wage in 1996. The proposed increase would restore the wage floor slightly above its 1983 level, still leaving it 13% below its 1979 peak. No one asserts that raising the minimum wage will correct every economic injustice, but it will certainly make a significant difference to those on the low end of the economic scale. We have the opportunity to enact what is in my view a modest increase to help curb the erosion of the value of the minimum wage in terms of real dollars, and it is an opportunity which we should not let pass us by. 
   Currently, a full-time minimum wage worker earns just $10,712--$3,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. In 1998, about 4.4 million wage and salary workers, paid hourly rates, earned at and below the minimum wage--about 1.6 million at the minimum rate and 2.8 million below the minimum. A dollar increase in the minimum wage would provide a minimum wage worker with an additional $2,080 in income per year, helping to bring that family of three closer to the most basic standard of living. This extra income will help a family pay their bills and quite possibly even allow them to afford something above and beyond the bare essentials. 
   According to the Department of Labor, 70 percent of workers who will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage are adults, 46 percent work full time, 60 percent are women and 40 percent are the sole breadwinners in their families. Mr. President, these are not the part-time workers and suburban teenagers many opponents of the minimum wage increase would have you believe. 
   After 30 years of spiralling deficits, we now have budget surpluses projected, unemployment is at a 25-year low, and inflation is at a 30-year low. However, despite this period of economic prosperity, the disparity between the very rich in this country and the very poor continues to grow. According to the Economic Policy Institute, projections for 1997 indicate that the share of the wealth held by the top 1 percent of households grew by almost 2 percent since 1989. Over that same period, the share of the wealth held by families in the middle fifth of the population fell by half a percent. In light of these estimates, consider that the Department of Labor predicts that 57 percent of the gains from an increase in the minimum wage will go to families in the bottom 40 percent of the income scale. 
   It is both reasonable and responsible for Congress to enact measures which provide a standard that allows decent, hard-working Americans a floor upon which they can stand. We did it back in 1996 when we approved, by a bipartisan vote of 74-24, a 90 cent increase in the minimum wage bringing it to its current level of $5.15 per hour, and it is appropriate to do it here again. With the economy strong, we have a responsibility to reinforce this basic economic floor for millions of American workers to prevent them from sliding further into the basement. 
   This is, and always has been, an issue of equity and fairness for working men and women in this country. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.

    Mr. SARBANES. I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated and effective leader of our Nation's transit program, Gordon J. Linton. Gordon recently resigned his post as the thirteenth head of the FTA to move on to other opportunities, and I would like to express my appreciation for the outstanding work that he has done. 
   During his six-year tenure as head of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Gordon Linton has proved to be one of the best and most accomplished Administrators. He spearheaded the FTA's Livable Communities Initiative which has demonstrated that transit can make a substantial contribution toward improving the quality of life in communities all across the Nation by improving the links between transportation and housing, schools, places of worship, employment and recreation. He worked tirelessly to expand citizen participation in the decision-making process to help make transit facilities and services more customer friendly and community-oriented. He played a key role in shaping the transit portion of the landmark Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century--or TEA-21--which is providing record levels of funding for public transportation and established the innovative Access to Jobs program which is designed to ensure that people in transition from welfare to work have adequate transportation services. 
   I first came to know Gordon six years ago in July, when I chaired his nomination hearing in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. It was clear that day, and evident throughout the past six years, that Gordon Linton was a passionate advocate for transit. He not only designed and directed over $37 billion in federal mass transit investments throughout the country--but never forgot that leadership begins by example and used public transportation himself to get to work and in traveling in communities around America. Mr. Linton came to Maryland on numerous occasions to support mass transit projects and improvements--projects such as the Baltimore Light Rail system; regional transit, such as the MARC commuter rail system; small town and rural systems to connect citizens in our rural areas to jobs, health care, education. He has done this in Maryland and he has done this in every state across the Nation. 
   Mr. Linton has exemplified a steadfast commitment to public service and public transportation. He is the longest-serving head of the Federal transit program since it was enacted in 1961. Before coming to Washington, Mr. Linton served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in Pennsylvania where he was instrumental in passage of the Commonwealth's first dedicated source of funding for transit and Pennsylvania's seat belt legislation. I am pleased to say that through his work as a Pennsylvania legislator and through his sincere, skillful shepherding of the Federal transit assistance program, Mr. Linton has proven his commitment to improve mobility, invest in our future and make America more livable for all Americans. 
   Mr. President, I know that every one of us whose constituents have benefitted from Gordon J. Linton's leadership of our Federal Transit programs wish him well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as we come to the closing moments of this discussion of the conference report, I want to recapitulate a few points. 
   First of all, I think it must be understood that changes are taking place in the financial landscape at the moment. They have been taking place over the last 20 years. In some respects, this legislation is an effort to create a statutory framework which will encompass the changes that have been happening and which it is reasonable to assume will continue to happen, even if we do not have legislation. 
   So many of the connections and the relationships about which some have expressed concern in the course of the debate--because they see this legislation as permitting them--are happening right now and will continue to happen. But they are happening without a rational legislative framework,  without the Congress, in effect, having made judgments as to what the structure of the system is going to be, without the actors within the system knowing exactly what the rules are, and having the security that comes from knowing they are operating within a defined environment. 
   I stress that because some have raised it in the course of the debate. Let me say in that respect I think we have had a very good debate on this conference report, if I may say so. I thank those of our colleagues who have spoken because of the depth of the perceptions and understanding they have brought to this debate. I think what transpired last night and today has been in the better traditions of the Senate. 
   The marketplace in many respects has influenced the need for this legislation. Securities firms have been offering bank-like products. Banks have been offering insurance-like products. Both have been engaged in significant securities activities. This has been taking place out in the marketplace but without a statutory framework within which it clearly functions. These developments have now been going on for more than two decades. We have been wrestling in the Congress for approximately that length of time to see how to revise our laws concerning financial services in order to update them. We are about to accomplish that today. 
   This will enable the regulators--and of course this bill is very strong on functional regulation--to maintain appropriate oversight as we deal with this evolving marketplace. At the same time, it will enable financial service firms to respond to the needs of their customers. Many assert the customers will receive very significant savings. Others say, no, no, it is going to result in greater costs. In a sense, we will have to see how it plays out.

<DOCNO>106-sarbanes-md-16-19991104</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. The administration says the following:  
   By allowing a single organization to offer any type of financial product, the bill will stimulate competition, thereby increasing choice and reducing costs for consumers, communities, and businesses. Americans spend over $350 billion per year on fees and commissions for brokerage, insurance and banking services. If increased competition yielded savings to consumers of even 5 percent, they would save over $18 billion per year.  
   They go on to say:  
   Removal of barriers to competition will also enhance the stability of our financial services system. Financial services firms will be able to diversify their product offerings and thus their sources of revenue. 
   Financial firms will be able to diversify their product offerings and thus their sources of revenue. They also will be better able to compete in global financial markets.  
   Which, of course, has become an increasingly relevant consideration as we consider our position vis-a-vis those of financial institutions headquartered in countries overseas. 
   From the very beginning, many of us made it very clear there were important principles we thought had to be addressed with respect to this legislation if we were to support it. We had to face questions, of course, of the safety and soundness of our financial system. We had important questions of CRA, important questions of consumer protection, important questions of the line between banking and commerce, which has been an important principle in the American system. 
   In the end, we have been able to work these issues in a way that we have addressed those concerns--not entirely in some instances. 
   People have talked about privacy today. It is my expectation that issue will continue to remain on our agenda because we have not yet fully disposed of it, although I do note this bill put in some privacy protections where none now exists. People should bear that in mind. Those who look at these provisions and say: We want more--and I am essentially with them; I introduced a bill earlier in this session that had more such provisions, and I continue to support those concepts--for those who say they want more, they need to understand we have nothing at the moment. The privacy provisions that are in this bill represent an important step forward. 
   I also have indicated that the too-big-to-fail issue--and the chairman has also commented on that--is an important matter that still remains before us. It is imperative this study the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are to do jointly come back with recommendations that enable us to address that issue. 
   This is a risk that is present in the situation. We have confronted it in the past with respect to various financial institutions. We get the moral hazard question: Institutions which assume they have reached the size that they then become too big to fail have less of a constraint upon them in terms of their activities than smaller institutions because they begin to operate on the assumption that no one is going to require them to bear the consequences of their imprudence. 
   There have been occasions, of course, in the past when regulators have said we simply cannot allow this institution to bear the full consequences of its bad judgments because if we do that, it will have an impact upon the financial system as an entirety; therefore, we need to work out ways in which we can address that question with respect to these large financial mergers and acquisitions which, of course, are going to happen under this legislation. Of course, they were already happening. 
   What the legislation does is put a framework around this activity which will enable the regulators to exercise much more careful oversight. It is preferable to have a framework developed by the Congress, not on an ad hoc basis by one regulator or another regulator, not in situations where some perceive that regulators are being competitive with one another in terms of how they deal with the financial services sector. If we can have a responsible statutory framework established by the Congress which is contained in this legislation that is now before us, it will contribute to the safety and soundness of the 
   financial system. This legislation better enables us to maintain the separation of banking and commerce. 
   There are important consumer protections, including some protections about which the Securities and Exchange Commission was concerned, and the legislation that has been developed has the very clear support of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   We have preserved the relevancy of the Community Reinvestment Act, and we have given banks the choice to conduct their expanded activities either through a holding company or, to a limited extent, through a subsidiary. That was the issue that had the Federal Reserve and the Treasury in deep discussions with one another, and in the end I believe they resolved that satisfactorily. 
   Let me also observe that this rational legislative framework we are putting into place provides for the future evolution of the financial services industry. People will have the security of knowing what the playing field is, something they do not know today with assurance. Nowadays, they go to a regulator and get permission to engage in an activity. The next thing they know, they are in court, and then the case has to wind its way through the court system. They may either be upheld or turned down. 
   No one is quite sure what they are permitted to do and what they are not permitted to do. People are constantly testing the edges of this. The regulators are in some confusion. In some instances we have overlap, and in other instances we seem to have no overlapping at all--in fact, a vacuum--in terms of overseeing these activities. 
   With this conference report and this legislation which represents a major change--there is no doubt about that--these are far-reaching and difficult public policy issues. They have not been solved for so long because they are far-reaching and difficult. We have had to address balancing the needs and concerns of the consumers--which, after all, ought to be one of our prime objectives--with a necessity of accommodating to new technology and new ways of doing business and the nature of the competition we are facing from abroad. 
   In the course of working through this, it has been an extremely interesting process. I take considerable satisfaction from the fact that in working with the chairman and with many others, we have been able to go from a position where we had a bill that, when it  left the Senate, was vehemently contested to where we now come back with a conference report that most of us, if not all, can join in supporting and commending to our colleagues. 
   I recognize some of the points that were made here by some who were apprehensive about the future. I think those are reasonable arguments. They are arguments we considered. They were factors with which we had to wrestle. But I am hopeful that what we are doing here will represent a very important step forward in the workings of the financial services industry, in the protections for our consumers, in giving us a rational statutory framework, and in enabling the regulators to do their job. 
   It sustains the relevancy of the Community Investment Act, which has been so important for some of the movement of capital into low- and moderate-income communities in this country. It has made such a difference. It is a very important first step, an important first step on the privacy issue. We have tried to safeguard the ability of State regulators to participate. On privacy, States can continue to enact legislation of a higher standard than the Federal standard. State insurance regulators will continue to play the role they have traditionally played with respect to State regulation of insurance. 
   So I think, all in all, we have put together a good and balanced package. I commend it to my colleagues as we move to final passage. I thank the chairman of the committee. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report on the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. 
   The Congress has struggled for over two decades with the issue of whether to permit banks to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies. This issue raises important questions for the safety and soundness of the financial system, important questions about the concentration of economic power, important questions about consumer protection, and important questions about access to credit for all Americans. 
   These are far-reaching and difficult public policy issues. The fact that they are so far-reaching and difficult, combined with differences among affected financial sectors--sectors of the financial industry over what should be contained in legislation and how to balance the concerns of consumers, the important consideration of safety and soundness and of assuring that the credit system will work to the benefit of all Americans--has made the enactment of a bill a significant challenge over an extended period of time. 
   In recent years, actions by regulators have permitted significant affiliations between banks and nonbank financial companies to take place. It is very important to keep that in mind as we consider enacting a piece of legislation because one has to be very much aware of what has transpired and the changes that have taken place in the financial arena as they consider the changes this legislation would now permit. Very frankly, the issue for Congress is not whether these affiliations should occur, because they have occurred one way or another, but whether they should take place on an orderly basis in the context of a responsible statutory framework or, instead, on an ad hoc basis as permitted by the regulators. 
   In my view, the preferable circumstance is for these affiliations to take place in the context of a responsible statutory framework established by the Congress, a framework that provides the regulators sufficient authority to protect the safety and soundness of the financial system, which maintains the separation of banking and commerce, protects consumers, preserves the relevance of the Community Reinvestment Act, and provides a choice to banks to conduct their expanded activities either through a holding company or a subsidiary of the bank. 
   It was not clear at the beginning of this Congress whether these goals could be achieved. The Senate passed a bill by the relatively close margin of 54-44 that, in my judgment, did not meet these objectives and was the object of a strong veto threat by the President. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, had passed a bill that largely met these objectives and that the Administration was prepared to support. 
   Today I am pleased to say to my colleagues that, in my view and in the view of the Administration, the bill produced by the conference committee is perceived as basically meeting the necessary standards. It is for that reason I am prepared to support the conference report. It is my understanding that the President is prepared to sign this legislation into law.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to lay out why, on balance, I believe the enactment of this conference report is in the public interest. 
   First, the legislation gives the regulators significant authority to supervise newly affiliated financial companies and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system. I started with the safety and soundness issue because I think it is paramount. I think the U.S. economy, in large part, depends on the confidence in the safety and soundness of our economic and financial institutions. If we are to lose that confidence, which exists not only in this country, but around the world, I think we would be in severe difficulties in a very broad and fundamental economic sense. So safety and soundness, I think, always has to be at the very top of the list of our concerns. 
   Specifically, section 114 of the conference report provides the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC authority to place restrictions or requirements on relationships or transactions between a bank and an affiliated company or a subsidiary, appropriate to prevent an evasion of any provision of law applicable to depository institutions, or--and I quote the bill now, soon to become a statute, I hope--``to avoid any significant risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions, or any Federal deposit insurance fund, or other adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices.'' 
   This important and broad delegation of authority to require ``firewalls'' to protect the federally insured bank from nonbank affiliates or subsidiaries emphasizes the important burden being placed on the regulators by this legislation to develop a coherent, responsible, safe and prudent approach to the supervision of the financial system. The permission contained herein for the expansion of activities calls for vigilant supervision of the financial system by the regulators. The legislation, in my view, provides the regulators the authority to do the job, but the responsibility will be on them to carry it out. 
   So this ``firewall'' provision that is in the conference report, which was actually taken from the House bill--we had no comparable provision on this side--gives the regulators the authority, I believe, to ensure a responsible, safe, and prudent approach. But it places, I think, a significant responsibility upon the regulators to exercise this authority in a way that it ensures that these objectives are realized. 
   This legislation also codifies a principle of functional regulation under which bank activities are generally supervised by bank regulators, securities activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by insurance regulators. New financial activities are the joint responsibility of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, which also serve as the umbrella regulators respectively of a financial holding company or a bank and its operating subsidiaries. 
   Now, secondly, the conference report strengthens the separation that currently exists in our financial system between banking and commerce. Financial authorities, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin, former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, and many other commentators, such as Henry Kaufman, Gerald Corrigan--and the list goes on--have expressed strong concerns about the mixing of banking and commerce, particularly in light of the recent experiences in Asia. 
   The conference report, therefore, closes the so-called unitary thrift holding company loophole to the separation of banking and commerce. The report before us prohibits all unitary thrift holding companies from having commercial affiliates. In addition, it prohibits exists unitary thrift holding companies from being transferred to commercial companies. This prohibition on transfer to commercial companies was added to the Senate bill on the floor by an amendment offered by my colleague, Senator JOHNSON of South Dakota, and it carried in the Senate by a 2-to-1 vote and was subsequently adopted by the conference committee. 
   In addition, the conference report contains important limitations similar to the House bill on merchant banking activities and activities complementary to financial activities that are designed to maintain the separation of banking and commerce. 
   In regard to merchant banking, the conference report allows a financial holding company to retain a merchant banking investment only for a limited period of time and generally prohibits the company from routinely managing or operating a nonfinancial company held as a merchant banking investment. Importantly, the conference report also gives the Federal Reserve and the Treasury the authority to jointly develop implementing regulations on merchant banking activities that they deem appropriate to further the purposes and prevent evasions of the conference report and the Bank Holding Company Act. Under this authority, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury may define relevant terms and impose such limitations as they deem appropriate to ensure that this new authority does not foster conflicts of interest or undermine the safety and soundness of depository institutions, or the conference report's general prohibition on the mixing of banking and commerce. 
   In regard to activities determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be complementary to financial activities, it is expected that such activities will not be significant in size, and determinations will be made on a case by case basis. 
   Third, with respect to consumer protections, the conference report contains important protections for consumers regarding the sale of uninsured financial products by banks. The conference report provides the Securities and Exchange Commission significant authority to supervise the securities activities of banks and includes several crucial investor protections. The conference report incorporates provisions to ensure the SEC can adequately regulate bank-sponsored mutual funds. These provisions are necessary to ensure that the SEC has adequate information about and inspection authority over bank investment advisers to inspect for trading violations, such as front-running and personal trading. 
   The provisions also address potential significant conflicts of interest that may impact banks that advise registered investment companies. The conference report also ensures SEC protections for new hybrid products and for most sales of securities by banks. It also includes protections for sales of sophisticated securities instruments to retail investors. 
   Similarly, the conference report requires the Federal banking agencies to issue consumer protection regulations within one year, applicable to the sale of insurance by any bank or other depository institution, or by any person on behalf of such an institution. The regulations will give protection over several aspects of insurance sales, such as sales practices, including anti-tying and anti-coercion rules; advertising; location, limiting sales to an area physically segregated from where deposits are taken; and qualification and licensing of sales personnel. 
   The conference report also preserves important authorities for the States to provide consumer protection on bank sales of insurance products. These protections were in the House bill and were included in the Senate bill by an amendment offered by Senator BRYAN during the markup in the Banking Committee. It was in the legislation that came to the Senate floor, and was passed by the Senate. 
   Fourth, with respect to the operating subsidiary issue, the conference report contains a provision authorizing banks to conduct certain new activities through an operating subsidiary of the bank. I will not go into this provision in detail. I simply note that it was worked out between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve over an extended period of time, and was crucial to the Administration giving its support to this bill. It will give financial services firms some latitude in choosing the corporate structure that best serves their customers. 
   In regard to the Community Reinvestment Act, this legislation establishes a fundamental principle: No bank or financial holding company can  engage in any new activities authorized by the bill, or engage in any new merger or acquisition authorized by the bill, if the bank or financial holding company does not have a satisfactory CRA rating. 
   This requirement on a bank or financial holding company for a satisfactory CRA rating in order to benefit from the new powers provided by the legislation was necessary to preserve the relevance of CRA in the new financial world which will be created by this bill. Without it, a bank's CRA performance would have become irrelevant to what will likely be the most intense area of activity in the financial industry. And the acceptance of this provision was essential for the Administration, and indeed for the Democratic members of the conference committee, to support the conference report. 
   The conference report does not contain two provisions with respect to CRA that were in the Senate bill, and I think would have been very damaging. One would have provided a safe harbor for banks from public comment on their CRA performance when they submitted an application to a regulator. The second exempted rural banks with assets under $100 million from CRA altogether. 
   The conference report does contain a provision providing for banks with assets under $250 million to have CRA examinations once every 4 years if they have a satisfactory rating, and once every 5 years if they have an outstanding rating. The regulators do retain authority to examine a bank at any time for reasonable cause. 
   The conference report also contains a provision requiring public disclosure and reporting on CRA agreements. The conference report explicitly directs the regulators to ensure that regulations prescribed by the agencies do not impose an undue burden on parties. In this regard, the statement of managers specifically provides that the reporting requirements of the provision can be fulfilled by the submission of a group's annual audited financial statement, or its Federal income tax return. 
   This was a provision that was intensely discussed and negotiated. The concept of public disclosure which was in the Senate bill was accepted by the conferees. The question that had to be worked out was exactly what did that mean and what was the reach of it and the requirements of it. As with many other provisions of this bill, the regulators will carry a particular responsibility to implement these provisions in a reasonable and responsible way. 
   Finally, let me point out where the conference report does not fully address two important areas. First, I do not think that the right of an individual to financial privacy is adequately protected. I expect that issue will be discussed at some length by some of my colleagues in the course of the debate on this conference report. Second, we have not dealt with what I think is 
   a very important issue of what is called ``too big to fail.'' 
   On the issue of privacy, last January I introduced the ``Financial Information Privacy Act of 1999'' together with a number of my colleagues, some of whom serve on the Banking Committee. I am frank to say I believe the central issue in this debate on privacy boils down to answering the question: To whom does this personal financial information belong, the individual, or the financial institution? I think upon reflection most people would answer the individual. 
   This legislation introduced earlier this year would have given an individual the right to ``opt out'', which would mean the right to say ``no'' to the sharing of or selling of his or her personal information to an affiliate within a financial services holding company. It also would have required an ``opt-in'' for the selling of such information to a third party. An ``opt-in'' would require a customer's informed consent before selling or sharing confidential customer information with an unaffiliated third party. 
   Neither of these provisions are included in the legislation before us. However, we were able to include in the conference report an amendment that I proposed which ensures that the Federal Government will not preempt stronger State financial privacy laws that exist now or may be enacted in the future. As a result, States will be free to enact stronger privacy safeguards if they deem it appropriate. 
   I am very frank to say that I think Americans are becoming increasingly concerned about this issue of financial privacy protection. I predict that this issue of privacy will not go away with the passage of this legislation. I know Senators BRYAN and SHELBY took a very strong lead in the conference committee on the privacy issue, along with a number of their colleagues from the House. Many of those who were very supportive of that effort will want to speak at some length on this subject during the discussion of this conference report, and they have specifically reserved time in order to do that. 
   The conference report also fails to deal with the creation of institutions which may be deemed ``too big to fail.'' The legislation before us substantially transforms the structure of the financial services industry by eliminating restrictions on the affiliations of banks, insurance companies, and securities firms. Despite the benefits which may accrue from such affiliations, there continue to be legitimate concerns that mergers permitted under this bill would create financial organizations so large that they would be deemed ``too big to fail.'' 
   Organizations as diverse as the American Enterprise Institute, the Brookings Institution, and the former Bankers Roundtable have repeatedly encouraged us to address the ``too big to fail'' problem by requiring large banking organizations to back some portion of their assets with subordinated debt. Regrettably, the conference report contains no such mandatory subordinated debt requirement or other market policing mechanisms. The report does contain an 18-month study to be conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department regarding the use of subordinated debt to protect the financial system, and to protect federally ensured deposit funds from the ``too big to fail'' institutions. 
   While obviously I think it would have been better to address this issue directly in the legislation, I certainly hope that 18 months from now, if not sooner, the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury will present the Congress with a joint recommendation together with legislative proposals on how best to deal with the issue of ``too big to fail.'' 
   In trying circumstances, the consequences of failing to deal with this issue could be extremely severe. I am hopeful that the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury will come back with a joint set of recommendations we can place into law. 
   These issues--dealing comprehensively with privacy and with ``too big to fail''--remain to be addressed as we move into the future. 
   Finally, I want to make a brief observation about the context in which we are working and have to consider this legislation. The need for this legislation has been influenced by the marketplace. In seeking to respond to the financial needs of their customers, securities firms have offered bank-like products, banks have offered insurance-like products, and both banks and insurance companies have engaged in significant securities activities. This blurring of the lines among banks, securities, and insurance products has been taking place in the marketplace since at least the mid-1970s. 
   Those who look at this endeavor and say we don't want to allow any of this affiliation to take place need to appreciate and understand, it has been happening in a significant way. A development which began the blurring of the distinction between securities and bank products was the offering by securities firms of cash management accounts. That development added a bank deposit transaction feature to a securities account. It allows customers to write checks on their money market funds, enabling those accounts to function much like the traditional checking account. Subsequently, marketplace changes, regulatory actions, and court decisions have enabled banks to sell insurance and to develop annuity products that have insurance characteristics but are defined as bank products. 
   On the commercial banking side, interpretations of existing laws have brought about a significant shift in ownership of firms underwriting securities. As of this past September, all the top 20 bank holding companies had what are known as section 20 subsidiaries that may engage under certain conditions in securities underwriting.  
   Updating our financial services laws is not only important to enable financial services firms to respond to the financial service needs of their customers, it is also important in order to ensure that appropriate regulatory oversight is maintained in the evolving marketplace. 
   In my view, this conference report will put in place a rational legislative framework for the future evolution of the U.S. financial services industry. It is a framework that will preserve safety and soundness, maintain the separation of banking and commerce, provide meaningful consumer protections, and preserve the relevance of the Community Reinvestment Act. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I extend my congratulations to the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator GRAMM. It has been a long ride, as one might say, with its ups and downs. However, the ship has been brought into port, so to speak. With the various accommodations worked out in the course of the conference, I expect the very close vote on the Senate bill will shift very markedly in the direction of support for this conference report. 
   I echo Senator GRAMM's commendation of House Banking Committee Chairman LEACH who was chairman of the conference committee. Chairman LEACH showed great fairness and calm under pressing circumstances. He kept the process working at times when it might otherwise have been in some jeopardy. Congressman LAFALCE as ranking member of the House Banking Committee, Congressman BLILEY and Congressman DINGELL, the chairman and ranking member of the House Commerce Committee, and indeed all the members of the conference who in one way or another played very constructive roles in trying to work this situation out deserve commendation. 
   I am particularly grateful to my Democratic colleagues on the 
   Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee for working through and joining together as we sought to achieve legislation that would meet our desires and meet the perceptions of the Administration and therefore bring about a Presidential signature at the end of this process. All Members on both sides of the aisle did not want to go through this very extended process and then have it vetoed and have to start all over again. Fortunately, we have accomplished that. 
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Greenspan played a significant role, as did the members of his staff who are extremely able, as did Treasury Secretary Summers and the members of his Treasury staff. I also acknowledge the role Bob Rubin has played in shaping where we are today, although he is no longer Secretary of the Treasury. Chairman GRAMM appropriately recognized the role Chairman DAMATO played in moving this legislation along. The Chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, was important on the investor protection provisions. 
   Finally, I thank the staff on this side of the aisle. Chairman GRAMM has recognized staff on his side of the aisle. I have high respect for their commitment and their competency. I don't think people fully appreciate the kind of dedication staff provides when Members are working through a very complex, complicated piece of legislation such as this. In this we have not only the concepts on which to reach agreement, but we have to work the concepts in the statutory language in a way that embodies what the understanding was that will also work in a technical and complex way. We are dealing with the sort of issues where, if it does not work, there are problems. I am hopeful we won't have to come back with extended technical corrections with respect to this legislation. If that is the case, obviously, we bow our heads to the staff. 
   On our side, I acknowledge our staff director Steve Harris, Marty Gruenberg, Patience Singleton, Dean Shahinian, Mitchell Feuer, Michael Beresik, Jonathan Miller, Yael Belkind, Erin Hanson, and Christen Schaefer. That is a long list, but it is a long list because some of the people are no longer on the staff. This issue has been going on long enough that people have come and gone. A number of those I listed are no longer on the staff, but they were here through at least part, if not a lot, of this effort. They made a significant contribution. It would be an oversight not to reference them. 
   Tomorrow, obviously, we will resume the debate. We will have the opportunity to hear from a number of our colleagues on this issue. I anticipate we will be able to go to a vote by midafternoon on this very important piece of legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. If the chairman will yield, I want to echo the chairman's comments. I say to our colleagues, if Senators will come early on and we can perhaps sequence them, we can give them more time than if some of the time is used up in quorum calls. Waiting for people to come becomes lost time. Then, when people come over, we may be very limited in how much time we have available to give them. 
   If Senators have statements they want to make of some consequence, we very much hope they will come over and do that.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious concern that House and Senate negotiators have agreed to delay for one year almost all of the proposed increase in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget for FY 2000. I strongly disagree with this approach to balancing the budget. Fully funding biomedical research at the NIH should be one of our  highest priorities, and I intend to oppose proposals that would delay funding for the NIH or fail to provide sufficient funding to ensure continued advancement in the field of biomedical research. 
   The proposed delay in NIH's authority to use $7.5 billion of its FY 2000 funding will mean that no new grants could be made until the end of the fiscal year. Thus, a one-year freeze will be put on all new biomedical research. Moreover, some on-going grants will have to be short-funded. For those suffering from life-threatening diseases, a one-year delay could be devastating. We cannot imperil continued progress in an area as important as biomedical research. 
   As our Nation searches for ways to improve health care for all its citizens, the need to ensure stability and vitality in biomedical research programs is increasingly imperative. Biomedical research has fundamentally changed our approach to treating disease and illness and has revolutionized the practice of medicine. Through the NIH, the Federal government has been the single largest contributor to the recent advances made in biomedical research, and NIH research has played a major role in the key medical breakthroughs of our time. 
   Biomedical research at the NIH has also contributed significantly to the growth of this Nation's biotechnology, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries. Many of the new drugs and medical devices currently in use were developed based on biomedical research supported by the NIH. NIH research has paved the way for the development of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries that have created millions of high wage jobs. 
   The promise of continued breakthroughs in the eradication of disease and the overall improvement in public health are contingent upon our commitment to supporting our scientists and researchers with adequate tools and resources. However, today, only one of three approved research proposals can be funded. 
   We must maintain our commitment to achieving full funding for biomedical research by FY 2002. Last year, we provided NIH with a downpayment on the resources it will need to take full advantage of the overwhelming opportunities for scientific advancement currently available in the field of biomedical research. This year, again we started on the right track by including another fifteen percent increase in the NIH budget. However, the proposed one percent overall budget cut will have a dramatic impact on the grant-making capacity of the NIH. As a result of this cut, 500 to 550 fewer grants will be awarded by the NIH next year. 
   This most recent proposal to require that the NIH delay spending approximately $2 billion of its FY 2000 funding until FY 2001, essentially revokes the entire increase for next year and goes back on our promise to substantially increase NIH funding by 2002. This additional funding cut will disrupt and delay research fundamental to saving lives and improving public health. It will also critically undermine our progress toward securing a strong and stable funding stream needed to ensure continued advances in biomedical research. 
   The proposed delay in NIH funding for FY 2000 is unconscionable. I will oppose it, and I urge the President to veto any conference report that includes this proposal.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in honoring a distinguished public servant and a revered Member of the United States Senate, Senator John Chafee, who died Sunday evening at Bethesda Naval Hospital. 
   While John Chafee was elected to the Senate in 1976, his public service began years before when he interrupted his education at Yale University to enlist in the Marine Corps during World War II, serving in the original invasion forces at Guadalcanal. He later returned to complete his education, receiving a bachelors degree from Yale in 1947 and, in 1950, a law degree from Harvard. 
   In 1951, John Chafee was called again to serve his country, returning to active duty to command a rifle company in Korea. Later, John Chafee served six years in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, where he was elected Minority Leader. He served as Governor of Rhode Island for three terms and in 1969 was appointed Secretary of the Navy. 
   As a Senator, John Chafee continued his proud legacy of leadership and accomplishment. I worked with Senator Chafee perhaps most closely in the U.S. Senate in his capacity as Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee where he labored tirelessly on behalf of many critical environmental initiatives, including efforts to strengthen the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
   Senator Chafee has been recognized for his important contributions in the area of environmental protection throughout his service in the U.S. Senate and has received nearly every major environmental award. He was also a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee where he worked hard to expand health care coverage for women and children and to improve community services for persons with disabilities. 
   John Chafee was a well-respected member of this body who engendered the affection of every member with whom he served. He had a unique ability to achieve consensus under very difficult circumstances. His unfailing courtesy and civility provided a positive and unifying force in the Congress which will be sorely missed by his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
   The Senate was a better place because of John Chafee and his devoted public service. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and to extend my deepest and heartfelt sympathies to his family.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to extend my congratulations and thanks to both Senators BOND and MIKULSKI for the conference report they are presenting us today. This bill makes constructive strides toward improving the housing situation for many poor and low income working families. 
   Though the Chairman and Ranking Member were under extremely tight budgetary constraints, they stood together and worked hard to bring us a conference report which restores important funding. They have presented us with a strong bill that invests in our nation's low income housing stock and continues our efforts to aid struggling communities in their redevelopment efforts. 
   It is my understanding that this bill moved forward with the support of  members from both sides of the aisle. I think that the Chairman and Ranking Member should be commended for this as well. It is notable when legislation receives such even handed, bipartisan support. 
   Let me highlight a few of the programs that received increased funding in this year's appropriations bill. 
   It includes 60,000 new section 8 vouchers to be used in our nation's most needy areas. I cannot express how important these new vouchers are to addressing the needs of low income Americans. As the economy soars, so do rents in many metropolitan areas, making it nearly impossible for low income families to afford an apartment. A recent report by the Low Income Housing Coalition shows that in no metropolitan area in this country can a person working at a minimum wage job forty hours a week afford the rent on an average two bedroom apartment. 
   There are 5.3 million families that HUD classifies as ``worst case housing needs.'' These are families that live in substandard housing or pay more than 50% of their income towards rent. Sixty thousand vouchers will not help all of these families, but they are an important step in the direction of alleviating poverty and will be enthusiastically received by the families that benefit from them. 
   Also included in this bill is funding for the important mark-to-market plan that will allow HUD to raise section 8 payments to prevent landlords from opting out of the program. In addition, the bill exempts the old preservation deals from restructuring, which saves money and housing. These two provisions are important to preserving affordable housing in our nation's communities. 
   This bill includes an additional $50 million to be used for Community Development Block Grants, or CDBG. These funds are used to address the needs of low income neighborhoods in a holistic manner. They have been a resource for renewal and redevelopment in many cities, including Baltimore and other Maryland metropolitan areas, since their creation in 1974. I am extremely pleased to see an increased investment in the hope that CDBG funds can bring needed assistance to many communities across America. 
   There is also an increase of $55 million to aid the rehabilitation of disabled elderly housing programs. That includes provisions to provide supportive housing for the elderly, service coordinators in elderly facilities, grants to convert elderly housing into assisted living, and funds for section 8 assistance to be used for assisted living facilities. These levels show that we are committed to our low income senior citizens. 
   Lastly, I want to highlight the increased commitment to improve the public housing projects that remain. Over the last few years many politicians have pointed to the failing of public housing, but have not provided the necessary funds to improve those developments. Senators BOND and MIKULSKI's bill takes the important and necessary action of increasing the public housing operating fund by $320 million. I look forward to seeing and hearing about the new and positive improvements that will occur as a result of this new funding. 
   I will continue in the years to come to press for an increased commitment to housing programs that serve our nations' working and low income families. Overall, the bill we are presented with today is a good bill, with funding for many vital housing programs.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference report on the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill. I regret very much having to do this because I appreciate the fact that all across our country, farmers are in need of assistance. I recognize that it is important to try to get some of these programs out to them. But I am very frank to tell the Senate that I think the conference  badly overlooked the pressing problems which the farmers in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic are facing. I can't, in good conscience, support a bill which simply fails to take into account the situation with which we are confronted, a situation which is unparalleled. 
   Steven Weber, President of the Maryland Farm Bureau, was recently quoted as saying:  
   This is not just another crisis. This is the worst string of dry summers and the worst run of crop years since the 1930s. Talk to the old-timers. They haven't seen anything like it since they were young. 
   Our farmers have been absolutely devastated by the weather we have experienced, not only over this past farming season but in previous ones leading up to it as well. We face a very pressing situation.''  
   In addition, I think this bill fails to address the needs of our dairy farmers. I will discuss that issue subsequently. First, I want to address the disaster assistance. 
   Most of the disaster assistance that is available under existing programs is in the form of low-interest loans for those who have been rejected twice by commercial lenders. What this approach fails to recognize is that our farmers have been hit with a double whammy. First of all, they had the low commodity prices which farmers all across the country have confronted; and in addition, in our particular situation, our farmers were confronted by severe drought problems, as I have indicated, unparalleled in the memory of those now farming for more than half a century. Low-interest loans simply won't work to address the collective and drastic impact of these factors. 
   Recognizing that, we sought substantially more and more direct disaster assistance in the Conference Agreement. And the response that the Conferees made to this request--the $1.2 billion that is in this bill--is clearly inadequate. The Secretary of Agriculture estimated that in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, we needed $1.5 to $2 billion just for those States alone. Never mind, of course, comparable damage, either drought or floods, that have occurred in other parts of the country which also need assistance. Indeed, it should not be our goal to identify an amount of funding where we have to take from one to give to the other. These states need assistance as well. What we are arguing is that this package ought to be comprehensive enough to meet the needs in the agricultural sector all across the country. I appreciate that other parts of the country have been hit with droughts and floods and that we must address these needs as well, but the amount provided in this conference report for disaster assistance is clearly inadequate to accomplish this goal. The amount that this legislation provides and that which will eventually make its way into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic States will not enable us to confront the problem bleakly staring our farmers in the face. 
   We wrote to the conferees, a number of us from this region of the country, asking them to consider the following measures. I regret that very little weight was given to this request. All of them, I think, are exceedingly reasonable requests, and had they been addressed, it would have affected, obviously, the perspective I take on this legislation. 
   We asked the conference committee to consider the following measures: First, crop loss disaster assistance programs that provide direct payments to producers based on actual losses of 1999 plantings. These payments could be drawn from the Commodity Credit Corporation funds without an arbitrary limit. The arbitrary limit currently in the agreement precludes comprehensive assistance and delays the availability of the assistance. We asked that yield loss thresholds and payment levels be determined in advance so the payments can be made to producers as soon as they apply, rather than providing a fixed amount which would require all producers to apply before a payment factor can be determined and payments can be issued. We asked for this measure because these farmers need the help now. They need it quickly. They are under terrific pressure. 
   Secondly, we asked the committee to consider sufficient livestock feed assistance, which addresses losses in pasture and forage for livestock operations, provides direct payments to producers based on a percentage of their supplemental feed needs, determined in advance to speed payments and avoids prorating. 
   Thirdly, we requested the conference to consider credit assistance which addresses the needs of producers who have experienced natural and market loss disasters. 
   Fourthly, we asked the conference for adequate funding to employ additional staff for the Farm Service Agency and the National Resource Conservation Service so they could swiftly and expeditiously implement various assistance programs at the State and local level. 
   Finally, we requested cooperative and/or reimbursable agreements that would enable USDA to assist in cases where a State is providing State-funded disaster assistance. 
   All of these, had they been responded to as we sought, would have given us an opportunity to address the situation in our region, not only in a forthright manner but one that would accommodate the pressing crisis which we confront. As we indicated, this crisis has reached overwhelming proportions. We risk losing a substantial part of the region's critical agricultural sector. The measures in this conference report, I regret to say, are not sufficient, nor sufficiently focused on the needs of the Eastern States to address their problems. That is one major reason I oppose this conference report and will vote against it. 
   Secondly, this conference report deals with the dairy issue in a way that is harmful to our region. By failing to adopt option 1-A and disallowing the extension of the authorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact, the conference agreement has left our dairy farmers confronting a situation of instability. Milk prices have been moving up and down as if they were on a roller coaster. Our dairy farmers have been subjected to wide and frequent swings, which place our dairy producers in situations where they don't have the cash-flow to meet their costs in a given month. The price goes up; the price comes down. It takes an enormous toll on the industry in our State and elsewhere in the east. 
   As a result of these fluctuations, the number of dairy farmers in Maryland has been declining markedly over the last 2 decades. We fear that if this process continues, we are going to see the extinction of a critical component of our dairy industry and the farm economy; that is, the family-run dairy farm. Indeed, my concern is primarily focused on family farmers and on sustaining their presence as part of the dairy sector. 
   The Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to enable Maryland to join the Northeast Dairy Compact. They also took measures in that legislation to ensure that the interests of consumers, low-income households and processors, would be protected when a farm milk price was established. In fact, a representative from those groups would be on the compact commission, as well as from the dairy industry itself. Other states that are a part of the Compact or want to participate have taken the measures to protect same interests. And we believe this established a reasonable solution to provide stable income for those in the dairy industry, particularly family dairy farmers. 
   But the conference denied what I regard as a fair and reasoned approach--in refusing to extend the authorization of the compact, and therefore, committed our region's dairy industry to a continuance of this unstable and volatile environment. 
   Mr. President, agriculture is an important economic actor in the state of Maryland. It contributes significantly to our State's economy. It employs hundreds of thousands of people in one way or another. We really are seeking, I think, fair and equitable treatment. I don't think this legislation contains a fair and equitable solution for the crisis that faces farmers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. Indeed, it seems to ignore the fact that we have farmers as well. The only farmers in the country are not in sectors other than the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic and the needs of all of our farmers should have been addressed in this legislation.

   Mr. SARBANES. They write:  
   Maryland Farm Bureau believes that many of the provisions in the economic disaster relief package are important and necessary. We are concerned, however, that the adoption of the conference report as drafted will not meet Maryland's drought disaster needs. We also believe that the absence of the Option 1A dairy language will have long-term negative impacts on the State's dairy industry.  
   I agree with that. We should reject this package, go back to conference, and develop a package that addresses the dairy issue, allows us to develop the compact to give some stability and diminished volatility in the industry, and also increases the drought assistance package so it adequately and directly meets the needs of the farmers of our region. 
   The conference agreement should have done better by these very hard-working men and women, these small farm families. And because it has not--as much as I appreciate the pressing needs of agriculture elsewhere in the country, and as much as I, in the past, have been supportive of those needs--we in the region must take measures to have our farmers' needs addressed in the current context. We have experienced a very difficult and rough period for Maryland agriculture, and for agriculture generally in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Because this crisis is not adequately addressed in this conference report, I intend to vote against it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, the CTBT, to which the Senate has been asked to give its advice and consent. This is a landmark agreement that will help stem the tide of nuclear proliferation and reduce the risk of nuclear confrontation. In my view, it is a treaty that, on balance, will serve U.S. interests and strengthen U.S. security. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a product of nearly 40 years of labor. The idea was first endorsed in 1958 by President Eisenhower, who recognized that the most effective way of controlling the development and spread of nuclear weapons was to ban their testing. 
   In 1963, the United States took the first step toward this end by signing and ratifying the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which prohibits nuclear explosions in the atmosphere, outer space, and under water. 
   Further limitations were established through the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, signed in 1974, and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty, signed in 1976. Under those treaties, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to halt underground explosions larger than 150 kilotons. 
   When the cold war came to an end, sentiment began to build for a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. President Bush signed legislation establishing a moratorium on such testing that was joined by France and Russia and continues to this day. 
   In January 1994, the Geneva Conference on Disarmament began negotiations on a treaty to forbid all nuclear explosions. An agreement was concluded in August of 1996, and the following month, President Clinton became the first world leader to sign the new treaty. It was submitted to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification just over 2 years ago, on September 24, 1997. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is relatively simple and straightforward. 
   First, it prohibits all explosions of nuclear devices. It does not ban the development or production of nuclear materials, nor does it affect activities to maintain a secure and reliable stockpile. By establishing a zero threshold on nuclear yield that affects all countries equally, the treaty draws a clear and consistent line between what is permitted and what is not. 
   Second, the treaty sets up a regime of verification and inspections, consultation and clarification, and confidence-building measures. An International Monitoring System of 321 monitoring facilities is to be established, and all data will be stored, analyzed, and disseminated by an International Data Center. In addition, information that the United States obtains through its own intelligence can be used as the basis for a short-notice, on-site inspection request. 
   Let me emphasize that. Information that the United States obtains through its own intelligence can be used as the basis for a short-notice, on-site inspection request. 
   Third, the treaty creates an organization to ensure proper implementation and compliance, and to provide a forum for consultation and cooperation among States Parties. The new body will have a Technical Secretariat responsible for day-to-day management and supervision of the monitoring and data-collection operations, as well as a 51-Member Executive Council, on which the United States would have a seat. Both the Technical Secretariat and the Executive Council are to be overseen by a Conference of States Parties, which will meet at least annually. 
   Finally, the treaty provides for measures to redress a situation and ensure compliance, including sanctions, and for settlement of disputes. Violations may result in restriction or suspension of rights and privileges under the treaty, as well as the recommendation of collective measures against the offending party and the referral of information and conclusions to the United Nations. 
   As Stephen Ledogar, who was the Chief Negotiator of the treaty for the U.S., testified before the Foreign Relations Committee, the United States objected to the inclusion of specific sanctions because of concerns about appointing an international organization ``to be not just the investigator and special prosecutor, but also the judge, jury, and jailer.'' He explained, ``we reserve for a higher body, the United Nations Security Council in which we have a veto, the authority to levy sanctions or other measures.'' 
   The CTBT, which has been signed by some 154 countries and ratified by 48, has drawn broad support not only from among the American population, but from key U.S. military and intelligence officials and from our key allies. 
   It has been endorsed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Hugh Shelton, as well as former Chairmen Gen. John Shalikashvili, Gen. Colin Powell, Gen. David Jones, and Adm. William Crowe, and the directors of all three national laboratories that conduct nuclear weapons research and testing. 
   NATO's Defense Planning Committee and Nuclear Planning Group called for ratification and entry into force ``as soon as possible.'' Thirty-two Nobel laureates in physics have written to the Senate stating that ``it is imperative that the CTBT be ratified,'' and noting that ``fully informed technical studies have concluded that continued nuclear testing is not required to retain confidence in the safety, reliability and performance of nuclear weapons in the United States' stockpile, provided science and technology programs necessary for stockpile stewardship are maintained.'' 
   Despite the importance of the CTBT for U.S. national security, formal consideration of the treaty has not taken place over the last 2 years. Now we are suddenly called upon to register a judgment without the benefit of proper hearings and committee debate. While I have come to the conclusion that the merits of this treaty outweigh its risks, and that it is therefore deserving of Senate advice and consent to ratification, I do regret that an issue of such significance should be taken up without the normal course of hearings and proceedings leading up to the consideration of a measure of this magnitude. 
   Let me outline a few of the reasons why I support this treaty. First, it will help reduce threats to U.S. national security. A complete ban on testing makes it harder for countries already possessing nuclear weapons to develop and deploy more sophisticated new designs, and for those seeking nuclear capability to initiate a nuclear weapons program. As we know, relatively simple bombs can be built without testing, but creating smaller, lighter weapons that are easier to transport and conceal and that require less nuclear material is difficult without explosive tests. 
   With a global ban in place, a nation intent on conducting tests would take on the burdens not only of increased expenses and technical dangers, but also the risk of detection and imposition of international sanctions. In a very real sense, the CTBT locks in U.S. nuclear superiority while preventing reignition of arms races that constitute serious threats to our national security. 
   The CTBT also promotes U.S. security by strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT, which entered into force in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995. The NPT is the bedrock of international arms control policy, representing a bargain in which non-nuclear weapons states promised to foreswear the acquisition of nuclear weapons and accede to a permanent inspection regime so long as the nuclear powers agreed to reduce their arsenals. In order to gain approval for permanent extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the five declared nuclear powers promised to negotiate and ratify a test ban treaty. 
   The CTBT further advances U.S. interests by providing additional tools to enhance our current monitoring and detection capability. The International Monitoring System will record data from 321 sensor stations--262 beyond what the United States possesses today. 
   The new facilities include 31 primary and 116 auxiliary seismic monitoring stations, 57 radionuclide stations to pick up traces of radioactivity, 8 hydroacoustic stations to detect explosions on or in the oceans, and 50 infrasound stations to detect sound pressure waves in the atmosphere. Thirty-one of the new or upgraded monitoring stations are in Russia, 11 in China, and 17 in the Middle East, all  areas of critical importance to the United States. 
   And one of the burden-sharing advantages of the treaty is that the United States will have access to 100 percent of the information generated by these 321 sensor stations but will pay only 25 percent of the bill for obtaining it. 
   Since the United States has not conducted a nuclear explosion in 7 years, and is unlikely to test with or without this treaty, the major effect of the CTBT is to hold other countries to a similar standard. 
   It includes surveillance to identify warhead problems, assessment to determine effects on performance, replacement of defective parts, and certification of remanufactured warheads. Our policy is to ensure tritium availability and retain the ability to conduct nuclear tests in the future, should withdrawal from the test ban regime be required. 
   Thus, under the treaty, the United States will be able to depend on its nuclear deterrent capability, while other nations will find it much more difficult to build weapons with the degree of confidence that would be needed to constitute an offensive military threat. Any country that should test would find itself the subject of international response; whereas in the absence of a treaty, such behavior carries no penalty. 
   It has been suggested that the United States should wait until more of the nuclear capable countries--whose ratification is essential for the treaty to go into effect--have ratified before moving forward on the treaty ourselves. Yet what incentive have the countries with only peaceful nuclear reactors to proceed, when the one country with the greatest number of deployed strategic warheads is unwilling to do so? 
   Just as with the Chemical Weapons Convention, where U.S. approval facilitated ratification by Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran, U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will create increased momentum and pressure for others to come along. The treaty cannot enter into force without us, but it needs our support to convince others to join.

   Mr. SARBANES. Indeed, all of our major allies have weighed in with their strong support for this treaty, which is particularly significant since they rely on our nuclear deterrent for their own defense. 
   An article in the Washington Post on October 8 reported that:  
   The world's major powers, including America's closest allies, warned the United States today that failure to ratify the multinational nuclear test ban treaty would send a dangerous signal that could encourage other countries to spurn arms control commitments.  
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer was quoted as saying:  
   What is at stake is not just the pros and cons of the test ban treaty, but the future of multilateral arms control.

   Mr. SARBANES. Perhaps as compelling as the case in favor of the treaty are the potential consequences of a negative vote. Senate rejection of the treaty could severely weaken the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, for which a review conference is scheduled next April. 
   It is entirely possible, as the Washington Post reported, that ``some nonnuclear countries might regard failure to ratify the treaty as a broken promise that would relieve them of the obligation to comply with key parts'' of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Such a result would not only undercut U.S. leadership and credibility on nonproliferation, threatening our policy objectives in Iraq and North Korea, among other places, but could increase the likelihood of resumed testing and aggravate the situation in South Asia. 
   Resumed testing would not only threaten regional security and U.S. strategic interests but could pose new challenges to public health and the natural environment. According to the Energy Department, more than one out of seven underground U.S. nuclear tests since 1963 vented radioactive gases into the atmosphere, and 
   the problem will obviously be much worse in countries that do not take or cannot afford the same level of environmental protections. 
   Some have objected that the treaty will be difficult to verify, that it will prevent the United States from maintaining a safe and reliable nuclear arsenal. While no treaty is completely verifiable, I believe the CTBT will increase, rather than decrease, our ability to monitor the development of nuclear weapons and preserve, not forfeit, our nuclear superiority. 
   In his statement before the Armed Services Committee on October 6, Secretary of Defense William Cohen addressed this point at length. I will quote the Secretary because I think his observations are extremely important.  
   CTBT evasion is not easy; it would require significant efforts in terms of expertise, preparations and resources. In the end, the testing party has no guarantees that its preparation or its nuclear test will escape detection and possible on-site inspection, despite its best efforts. In addition, detection capability varies according to the location of the clandestine test and the evasion measures employed; a potential evader may not understand the full U.S. monitoring capability, thus adding to his uncertainty. Further, detection of a nuclear explosion conducted in violation of the CTBT, would be a very serious matter with significant political consequences........Under CTBT, I believe the U.S. will have available sufficient resources to deter or detect, with confidence, the level of clandestine nuclear testing that could undermine the U.S. nuclear deterrent and take timely and effective counteraction to redress the effects of any such testing.  
   I yield myself 2 additional minutes.

   Mr. SARBANES. Moreover, to the extent Members are concerned with the adequacy of procedures for onsite inspections, I would remind them that, as with the Chemical Weapons Convention, these procedures were crafted with an eye not only to gaining access to other countries' facilities, but also to guarding against overly intrusive inspections within the United States. The lead U.S. treaty negotiator, Stephen Ledogar, explained to the committee how those procedures were developed:  
   This Treaty provides for on-site inspections on request by any Treaty party and with the approval of the Executive Council. No state can refuse an inspection. The U.S. position from the start was that on-site inspections were critical to provide us with added confidence that we could detect violations. And, if inspections were to be effective, they had to be conducted absolutely as quickly as possible after a suspicion arose, using a range of techniques with as few restrictions as possible. However, the U.S. also had to be concerned with its defensive posture, as well as an offensive one. It was necessary to ensure that sensitive national security information would be protected in the event of an inspection on U.S. territory. The U.S. crafted a complicated, highly detailed, proposal that balanced our offensive and defensive needs. There was resistance from some of our negotiating partners. However, by the time we were through, the Treaty read pretty much like the original U.S. paper put together jointly by the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State, the Intelligence Community, and the then-existing Arms Control Agency.  
   With regard to the security of our nuclear arsenal, the President has proposed six safeguards which will define the conditions under which the United States enters into the CTBT, and which, as I understand it, have been incorporated into the Resolution of Ratification. I ask the ranking member, these have now been adopted; is that correct?

   Mr. SARBANES. And those dealt with the conduct of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, the maintenance of modern nuclear laboratory facilities, the maintenance of a basic capability to resume testing, should it become necessary, the continuation of a comprehensive research and development program to improve our monitoring capabilities, the continued development of a broad range of intelligence gathering, and the ability to withdraw from the CTBT if the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon type critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified. 
   I believe these safeguards will ensure that U.S. national security interests can be met within the context of the treaty. 
   Mr. President, I support ratification, but there do not appear to be enough  votes to approve it. The President, in his letter requesting that action be delayed, stated that  
   ......proceeding to a vote under these circumstances would severely harm the national security of the United States, damage our relationship with our allies, and undermine our historic leadership over 40 years, through administrations Republican and Democratic, in reducing the nuclear threat.  
   I agree with the President's assessment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join in voting to postpone consideration of the treaty while we undertake to build the necessary understanding and political support that will lead to its ultimate ratification. 
   If we cannot approve the treaty, ratify it, then surely we should delay its consideration, postpone its consideration while we continue to explore the matter further, rather than, in my judgment, doing the grave harm that would come to the national security, as the President has outlined.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as the Senate continues its consideration of the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill today, I rise to discuss a problem the State of Maryland is struggling to overcome as it seeks to extend health care coverage to the 158,000 uninsured children in our State. This issue is particularly timely in light of the Census  Bureau report issued earlier this week which shows that the ranks of the uninsured grew by approximately 1 million in 1998 to a total of 44.3 million. The Census report also shows that the number of uninsured children has not decreased despite the establishment of a new Federal program designed to encourage States to expand health insurance coverage to more low-income children. Moreover, Maryland experienced one of the highest increases in uninsured people last year bringing the total number of uninsured to 837,000 or one-sixth of the population. A quarter of these uninsured Marylanders are children. 
   To address the growing number of uninsured children throughout the United States, Congress enacted the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1997, and Maryland eagerly applied to participate in this new Federal-State partnership. However, over the past couple of years, Maryland has been penalized under this program for having previously extended partial Medicaid coverage under a five year demonstration program to a class of low-income children who would not otherwise have qualified for Medicaid. These children should now be eligible for CHIP funding, but the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is blocking Maryland from accessing its CHIP funds for the benefit of these kids. 
   The law establishing the CHIP program prohibits the States from enrolling children into the State's CHIP program if those children were previously covered by the State's Medicaid program. HHS has made the decision to treat all children once eligible for the Maryland demonstration program, called the Maryland Kids Count program, as though they were covered under Medicaid. As a result of this discretionary decision by HHS, the majority of Maryland's uninsured children are ineligible for CHIP funding. In addition, Maryland has been unable to access most of the CHIP funding allocated to it. 
   The Maryland demonstration program should not be used to disqualify the State from accessing its CHIP funds because this demonstration cannot be equated with covering this group of children with full Medicaid coverage. The Maryland demonstration offered only partial Medicaid benefits (primary and preventive care). Hospitalization as well as dental and medical equipment were not covered. Thus, for each child in the demonstration program, Maryland spent less than half the amount it would have spent had Medicaid been extended to these children. 
   In addition, this demonstration program was conducted under a time-limited waiver which was scheduled to expire at about the same time the CHIP program was launched. In fact, HHS informed Maryland that it would not renew the waiver because Congress was establishing a more comprehensive children's insurance program and also because the Maryland demonstration had been rather unsuccessful. Only 5,000 children were enrolled, largely because the benefits offered were so limited. 
   HHS has used its discretionary authority in implementing the CHIP program to equate the Maryland demonstration program with full Medicaid coverage. Since they used discretionary authority to make this erroneous determination, HHS clearly has the authority to reverse this decision administratively. Would the Senator from Delaware, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, agree that the Department of Health and Human Services has authority to allow Maryland to access its CHIP funds to extend health insurance coverage to those low-income children previously eligible for the Maryland Kids Count demonstration program without additional legislative action?

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator ROBB's amendment to strike the exceptions to the high-density slot limit and the flight perimeter rule at Reagan National Airport. 
   I have serious concerns about increasing the number of flights and granting exemptions to the 1,250 mile nonstop perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. In my judgment, the bill provisions creating new slots at DCA and allowing for nonstop flights beyond the airport's existing 1,250 mile perimeter are fundamentally flawed for four reasons: first, they contravene longstanding federal policy; second, they undermine regional airport plans and programs; third these provisions will not have any significant impact on service for most consumers or competition in the Washington metropolitan region; and finally the provisions will subject local residents to an unwarranted increase in overflight noise. 
   First, the slot and perimeter rules have been in place for more than thirty years. And they were codified in the 1986 legislation that created the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Both rules were pivotal in reaching the political consensus among federal, regional, state, and local interests that allowed for passage of the 1986 legislations. The rules, as codified, were designed to carefully balance the benefits and impacts of aviation in the Washington metropolitan area. The bill now before us would overturn more than thirty years of federal policies and upset the balance struck in 1986. 
   Second, the slot and perimeter rules are among the most fundamental air traffic management and planning tools available to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. The Washington-Baltimore regional airport system plan and Reagan National Airport's master plan both rely on the slot and perimeter rules. By eliminating these tools, the bill before us would inappropriately override the authority and control vested in the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority and would affect local land use plans. One of the main purposes of the 1986 Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Act was to remove the federal government from the business of micro managing the operation of National Airport. The bill before us puts the federal government right back in the business of making decisions about daily operations and local community impacts--issues that should be left to local decision-makers. 
   Third, if the Washington region were not served by two other airports, Dulles and BWI, specifically designed to handle the kind of long-haul commercial jet operations never intended to use National, then the argument that the slot and perimeter rules are somehow inherently ``anti-competitive,'' might have some validity. However, because consumers have access to so many choices, the rules do not injure competition in the Washington-Baltimore region. Far from being an anemic market, the Washington-Baltimore market today is one of the healthiest and most competitive markets in the country. Consumers can choose between three airports and a dizzying number of flights and flight times. Indeed, GAO recently reported that even if the perimeter rule were removed ``only a limited number of passengers will switch'' from Dulles or BWI to National, underscoring my contention that the proposed new slots will yield no significant benefit to local consumers or otherwise improve the local market. 
   Finally, let me address the very important issue of noise, which is of principal concern to my constituents. Anyone who lives in the flight path of National Airport knows what a serious problem aircraft noise poses to human health and even performing daily activities. Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise (CAAN), a coalition of citizens and civic associations which has been working for more than 14 years to reduce aircraft noise in the Washington metropolitan area, has analyzed data from a recent Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority report which shows that between 31% and 53% of the 32 noise monitoring stations in the region have a day-night average sound level which is higher than the 65 decibel level that has been established by the EPA and the American National Standards Institute as the threshold above which any residential living is incompatible. New slots will add to the noise problem. 
   Mr. President, I support this amendment because I believe Congress should defer to the FAA and local airport officials on this issue. I also believe that Congress should not be asking hundreds of thousands of local residents to tolerate more aircraft noise merely to benefit a handful of frequent flyers and fewer than a handful of airlines. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment as well.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my colleague from Florida, Mr. MACK, in introducing the ``Debt Relief for Poor Countries Act of 1999.'' This bill is the companion legislation to H.R. 1095, offered in the House by Representatives LEACH and LAFALCE and cosponsored by 116 other Members. 
   The purpose of the bill is to provide the world's poorest countries with relief from the crippling burden of debt and to encourage investment of the proceeds in health, education, nutrition, sanitation, and basic social services for their people. 
   All too often, payments on the foreign debt--which account for as much as 70 percent of government expenditures in some countries--mean there is little left to meet the basic human needs of the population. In effect, debt service payments are making it even harder for the recipient governments to enact the kinds of economic and political reforms that the loans were designed to encourage, and that are necessary to ensure broad-based growth and future prosperity. 
   To address this problem the World Bank and the IMF began a program in 1996 to reduce $27 billion in debt from the most Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, known as the ``HIPC Initiative.'' But the program created a number of stringent criteria and provided only partial relief, which meant that only a small number of countries actually qualified for participation and the ones who did received only marginal benefits after an extended period of time. 
   Following calls by non-government organizations, religious groups and member governments for faster and  more flexible relief, the G-7 Finance Ministers, meeting this past June in Cologne, Germany, proposed alternative criteria that would make expanded benefits available quicker and to more countries. Last week, at the annual World Bank-IMF meetings here in Washington, President Clinton pledged to cancel all $5.7 billion of debt owed to the U.S. government by 36 of the poorest countries, and he sent a supplemental request for $1 billion over 4 years to pay the U.S. portion of the multilateral initiative. Canceling the debt will not cost the full $5.7 billion because many of the loans would never have been repaid and are no longer worth their full face-value. I commend the President for exercising international leadership on this important issue and for making it a foreign policy priority. 
   The legislation we are offering today goes even further by requiring the President to forgive at least 90 percent of the U.S. non-concessional loans and 100 percent of concessional loans to countries that meet the eligibility guidelines. To qualify, the countries must have an annual per capita income of less than $925, have public debts totaling at least 150 percent of average annual exports, and agree to use the savings generated by debt relief to facilitate the implementation of economic reforms in a way that is transparent and participatory, to reduce the number of persons living in poverty, to promote sustainable growth and to prevent damage to the environment. 
   Countries that have an excessive level of military expenditures, support terrorism, fail to cooperate in international narcotics control matters, or engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights are not eligible for debt relief under this legislation. 
   In addition, the bill urges the President to undertake diplomatic efforts in the Paris Club to reduce or cancel debts owed bilaterally to other countries, and to work with international financial institutions to maximize the impact of the HIPC Initiative. The United States accounts for less than 5 percent of the total debt burden, so it is essential that relief is provided in a coordinated and comprehensive fashion. 
   Mr. President, countries should not be forced to make a tradeoff between servicing their debt and feeding their people. And once debt is relieved, we should ensure that the savings are being used to reduce poverty and improve living standards, so that the benefits are widely shared among the population. This bill achieves both objectives, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its prompt consideration.

Kayci has recently been selected as Assistant Superintendent of Glen Canyon National Park in Utah and I, and many others in the State of Maryland, are sorry to see her go. 
   Throughout her 18-year career with the National Park Service, Kayci Cook has distinguished herself for her leadership, commitment and dedication to managing and protecting our Nation's most precious natural and cultural resources. Beginning as a seasonal park ranger at Wupatki and Canyon de Chelley National Monuments in northern Arizona, she quickly advanced through the ranks to positions as park ranger at San Antonio Missions National Historical Park in Texas, supervisory ranger at California's Death Valley National Monument, and Chief of Resource Education for Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin. In 1994, her contributions and accomplishments in these positions earned Kayci the prestigious Benvinetto Congressional Fellowship 
   I came to know Kayci three years ago, soon after she was appointed to lead Fort McHenry and Hampton and have had the privilege of working closely with her on a number of matters of mutual concern affecting these units of the National Park System. I can personally attest to the exceptional talent, ingenuity, and energy which she brought to this position. Under her leadership the fort walls and many historic structures at Fort McHenry have been restored, plans have been advanced to develop a new visitors center to accommodate the increasing number of visitors to the Fort, many preservation projects have been completed at Hampton and a new General Management Plan for this historic site is being completed. 
   Kayci Cook's hard work and dedication to the stewardship Fort McHenry and Hampton have earned her the respect and admiration of everyone with whom she has worked. She leaves behind two units of the National Park System that have been protected and improved through her efforts and the visitors to these sites will benefit from her labors for years to come. In my judgement, her extraordinary commitment and leadership should serve as a standard for those who will follow her. I greatly value the assistance Kayci provided to me and my staff and wish her the best of luck in the years ahead.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I want to speak about the end of an era for the David Taylor Research Center, and the beginning of a promising future for this facility and many of its workers. On September 25, 1999, the Navy will formally close the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division's Annapolis Site, more commonly known as the David Taylor Research Center (DTRC). While the Navy marks the occasion of its departure from this successful and accomplished lab, we must not dwell solely on its past. On this occasion we should also recognize the help and cooperation of Anne Arundel County, the Navy, and relevant businesses in developing a reuse strategy that will enable the lab to continue conducting important maritime research into the 21st century. 
   The Navy has a right to be very proud of the legacy of this lab. I want to touch on a few of its most important contributions throughout our maritime history. From its inception in 1903 by Rear Admiral George Melville, it has served a crucial role in the development of our modern Navy. 
   First established as the US Naval Engineering Experiment Station (EES), it served to fill the need for the testing of Naval equipment and the development of Fleet standards for Naval machinery. During WWI, the EES assisted the Navy with the procurement of naval machinery, crafting guidelines for optimum fuel usage, developing metal corrosion deterrents, and pioneering the first use of sonar. Before its expansion during WWII, the lab's research on sound led to the development of the first sonic depth and range finders. 
   In 1941, Dr. Robert Goddard established a Bureau of Aeronautics at the facility which led to the expansion of five additional Naval Laboratories on the site during WWII. The newly expanded Annapolis lab served to make many critical contributions to WWII Naval Fleet development, ranging from high capacity water stills for submarine use to improvements in Marine Corps landing craft. 
   By 1963, the facility had evolved into one of the Navy's premiere research and development centers, and was renamed the U.S. Marine Engineering Laboratory. During the Vietnam war, the lab provided support to our forces from 1966 until the end of the war. During that time, its projects included boat quieting systems, engine cooling, bunker busting, aluminum boat corrosion abatement, and the development of ferro-cement boats. 
   During the late 1970s, the work of the Annapolis lab was concentrated into two technical departments, Propulsion and Auxiliary Systems, and Materials Engineering. The lab's contributions to today's Navy range from cutting edge superconducting electrical machinery to patented approaches to isolating and silencing machinery on every submarine class. 
   In addition to these and other truly remarkable accomplishments, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division's Annapolis Site has served as the technical training ground for thousands of scientists, machinists, technicians, engineers, and other related lines of employment. It is through their innovation, expertise, and hard work that this facility has been such a critical proving ground for the Navy, and I am proud to say that because of our redevelopment strides, many of these experts will continue their excellent work for the Navy and other customers in Anne Arundel County. 
   As many of these employees will recall, I fought very hard in 1993 when the Navy recommended that this site be shut down. And I fought again in 1995 when the BRAC Commission made the final decision to close the Annapolis Center. I continue to believe that the decision was unwise, unjustified and failed to take into account the critical capabilities of the highly skilled and experienced team of scientists and engineers who have contributed so much to the Navy over the years. 
   After the Navy's decision, many of these dedicated scientists and researchers could have walked away and gone to Philadelphia or found jobs elsewhere. However, through reuse ventures such as those of VECTOR Research these individuals have made the best of the situation and worked to convert this unique facility into a maritime R&D park. As these businesses continue to expand their marine customer base, we can envision the park as a focal point for maritime high technology into the next millennium. In fact, this month has seen a major milestone in the site reuse process. As some of you know, DTRC houses a Deep Ocean Simulation Facility which is world class in nature, and is uniquely designed and equipped to evaluate commercial and military machinery targeted for deep ocean environments. I am delighted to say that on September 15th, operation of this complex was officially transferred from the Navy to a private firm. As a result of efforts such as this one, the Navy will also continue to benefit, since a large fraction of this reservoir of essential capability might otherwise have been dispersed or lost. Anne Arundel County's decision to take this approach for reuse and its coordinated and innovative strategy in  this regard, should serve as an example for the nation. 
   With the spirit of cooperation, and innovative reutilization reflected in this effort, I have no doubt that the DTRC will continue to contribute not only to the maritime high technology sector of Anne Arundel County and the State of Maryland, but also to our nation's technological advancement into the 21st Century.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Town of Oakland, Maryland. The Mayor of Oakland, Asa McCain, Jr., and the entire community are planning numerous events to commemorate this milestone. 
   Like so many of Maryland's historic cities and towns, Oakland, which was founded in 1849, has carved its own unique place in American history. At Oakland's center is one of the oldest railroad stations in the country. The Queen Anne style railroad station designed by E.F. Baldwin and built in 1885 by the B & O Railroad is now in the National Registry. 
   The railroad was responsible for popularization of the Oakland area as a resort in the late 1800's and resulted in Garrett County's flourishing export of timber and coal. Recently purchased by the ``Save the Oakland Station Committee,'' the station will be restored to its original splendor in an effort to provide a cornerstone for continued growth in the County. In recognition of  Oakland's community effort to revitalize its economy and preserve its historic past, the Town received a National Mainstreet Designation from the National Historical Trust in May of this year. 
   Another historically significant location in Oakland is the Church of the Presidents, built in 1868. Three United States Presidents, Grant, Harrison, and Cleveland, attended services there and preferred Garrett County to any other place for their vacations. 
   Today, Oakland and Garrett County are well known as one of the finest all-season resort areas, offering abundant sports activities including fishing, hiking, skiing--both alpine and cross-country--and boating. The natural beauty of this pristine area of our state led to Oakland's original name, ``The Wilderness Shall Smile.'' In addition, the town of Oakland, with its large victorian homes and beautiful tree-lined streets, enhance the appeal of this cool, mountainous retreat. 
   Oakland has faced its share of economic difficulties. The departure in 1996 of Bausch and Lomb, the largest employer in the area, dealt a severe blow. Nevertheless, Oakland faced the problem head-on and orchestrated an intense effort to recruit alternative employers. In April of this year, Simon Pearce, a premier glass maker and Vermont's largest tourism attraction, opened a factory just outside of Oakland. Through the inspired leadership of Mayor Asa McCain, the town of Oakland will continue to thrive and prosper well towards the Town's 200th anniversary. 
   Oakland is a model of community spirit and cooperation. The activities planned to commemorate the 150th anniversary exemplify the deep devotion of its residents to their community. I share the pride of Mayor McCain and all of Oakland's citizens in their Town's historic past and optimism for Oakland's continued success in the years to come.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, Senator BOND, and my colleague and close friend from Maryland, the ranking member of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, Senator MIKULSKI, for their good work in developing this bill under extremely difficult circumstances. 
   All of us should recognize that due to the steadfastness of these two Senators, many important programs that had otherwise been scheduled for the cutting block, programs that had, indeed, been severely damaged by the House bill, have been largely preserved in the legislation that is before us this afternoon. 
   My colleagues, Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI, working with the strong support of Senator STEVENS, the chairman of the full committee, and Senator BYRD, the ranking minority member of the full committee, worked hard to prevent deep House cuts from being carried forward in their bill. 
   So I very much appreciate the efforts by the chairman and the ranking member, for example, to preserve the affordable housing stock and to provide tenant protections in cases where owners insist in opting out of their assisted housing contracts. That is important progress, and I thank them for their hard work. 
   There is always the ``but.'' While recognizing and applauding the work of the subcommittee, I do not want to lose sight of the continuing, pressing affordable housing needs and the efforts that we must continue to make beyond the floor consideration of this legislation today as a Congress and as a nation. 
   Today, in the midst of the longest peacetime economic expansion in our Nation's history, we are faced with the largest number of our citizens facing ``worst case housing needs.'' Let me explain briefly what that phrase means. Families with ``worst case housing needs'' are those who pay over half their income in rent or live in severely substandard housing, housing that fails to meet basic standards of safety and decency. 
   For families paying so much of their income for rent, homelessness is only one bout of unemployment away. For those families, an unexpected medical bill brought on by a sick child or an elderly parent, a broken down car that makes it impossible to get to work, or any modest financial disruption in life's routines that most people could absorb, any of those activities can lead to eviction. Today, there are almost 5.5 million families who live with this sword of Damocles just over their heads. 
   Work in and of itself is not a solution. A recent study indicates that people working for the minimum wage, a full-time working family earning the minimum wage, would have to work in excess of 100 hours a week at the minimum wage in order to pay the rent for a two-bedroom apartment. 
   In other words--and the HUD statistics support this data--the fastest growing segment of the population with worst case needs are families. So there is this big gap between what working at the minimum wage brings in and what it costs on average for a modest apartment. 
   This underscores, in my opinion, the need to increase the stock of affordable housing. It also underscores, of course, the need to address the minimum wage as well. But this legislation before us now deals with housing. 
   We need to increase the stock of affordable housing. The fastest way to do that is by funding additional section 8 rental vouchers. This is very much the issue I hope will be addressed in conference. 
   Last year, we worked together to authorize 100,000 vouchers for fiscal year 2000 in the public housing bill. The budget the President submitted included the 100,000 vouchers in the proposal. In the current year, we funded 50,000 vouchers. 
   I make this point fully understanding the constraints under which Senators BOND and MIKULSKI worked to bring this bill to the floor today. As I have indicated, they did a good job within those constraints. But it is the responsibility of all of us now to consider how we can move beyond those constraints so we can start to meet the needs of the millions of working families, the millions of poor families, and the elderly that desperately need housing assistance just in order to make ends meet. 
   I very much hope we can start to address this problem in the conference. I encourage both of my colleagues to place this issue of section 8 rental vouchers high on their priority list as they go to conference. 
   Let me add two other brief points. Last year we passed important new public housing legislation, working successfully in a bipartisan way with Senators MACK, BOND, MIKULSKI, and D'Amato. That new law holds real possibilities for strengthening our public housing stock by giving more flexibility to local housing authorities while at the same time providing important protections for the poor. To make this law work, however, we must provide adequate funding. We need to give the housing authorities adequate operating subsidies to run their programs effectively on a day-to-day basis. 
   Furthermore, these housing authorities are public agencies that cannot opt out of the program, as many of their private counterparts do. We must provide them the capital necessary to maintain and upgrade their units so we can begin to build the kind of economically diverse communities we know are healthier for all residents. I very much  hope this issue will also be kept in mind as my colleagues go to conference. 
   Finally, I note my concern with the provisions of the bill that eliminate the Community Builders Program entirely this coming February. In fact, many of these employees are the sole HUD workers in various State or local HUD offices. Surely, a more measured approach to addressing these concerns is possible. Eliminating these positions will result either in offices being closed or HUD being forced to shuffle employees around in ways that simply may not be optimal. From all reports, the community builders are doing a good job. They have been well received. I hope we allow them to continue with their efforts. 
   In closing, I again thank my colleagues for their work on this bill. Many improvements were made possible by their resolve and their many efforts even before the bill was marked up, but there is still much to be done. I look forward to working with both of them, and the other members of the Appropriations Committee, as the bill moves to conference in the hope and anticipation that we may be able to move beyond some of the constraints under which they were laboring and to address these issues which I have outlined and, certainly, this very pressing need for affordable housing all across the country. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. REED addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in the coming weeks, the Finance Committee will begin consideration of legislation to reform the Medicare program. While I am not a member of that Committee, I would like to urge my colleagues to take this opportunity to address one of the most widespread problems facing senior citizens today--the lack of prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program. 
   Providing access to prescription medication is essential to ensuring our older Americans receive the health care they need. Today more than ever, medical treatment is focused on the use of drug therapies. Prescription drugs are an effective substitute for more expensive care or surgery, and they are the only method of treatment for many diseases. 
   Medicare beneficiaries are particularly reliant on prescription medication. Nearly 77 percent of seniors take a prescription drug on a regular basis. Consequently, although seniors make up only 14 percent of the country's population, they consume about 30 percent of the prescription drugs sold. However, the Medicare program, the national program established to provide seniors with vital health care services, generally does not cover prescription drug costs. 
   Medicare beneficiaries can obtain some coverage for drugs by joining Medicare HMOs. However, these HMOs are not available in many parts of the country, particularly in the rural areas. As we have learned in Maryland, where 14 of our rural counties will no longer be served by any Medicare HMO as of next year, private companies cannot be relied upon to provide a benefit as crucial to the health of our older Americans as prescription drug coverage. Drug coverage must be added as a core element of our basic Medicare benefits package. 
   Beneficiaries may also purchase drug coverage through a Medigap insurance policy. However, these plans are extremely expensive and generally provide inadequate coverage. In addition, for most Medigap plans, the premiums substantially increase with age. Thus, just as beneficiaries need drug coverage the most and are least able to afford it, this drug coverage is priced out of reach. This cost burden particularly affects women who make up 73 percent of people over age 85. 
   Those with access to employer-sponsored retiree health plans do generally receive adequate drug coverage. However, only about one quarter of Medicare beneficiaries have access to such plans. Thus, although most beneficiaries have access to some assistance, only a lucky few have access to supplemental coverage that offers a substantial drug benefit. Moreover, at least 13 million Medicare beneficiaries have absolutely no prescription drug coverage. 
   To make matters worse, the cost of prescription drugs has been 
   rising dramatically over the past few years. Pharmaceutical companies claim that today's higher drug prices reflect the growing cost of research and development. However, recent increases in drug prices have also resulted in large part from the enormous investment the industry has made in advertising directly to the public. 
   Moreover, recent studies have shown that seniors who buy their own medicine, because they do not belong to HMOs or have additional insurance coverage, are paying twice as much on average as HMOs, insurance companies, Medicaid, Federal health programs, and other bulk purchasers. Medicare beneficiaries are paying more as the pharmaceutical industry is facing increasing pressures from cost-conscious health plans to sell them drugs at cheaper prices. In addition, the industry offers lower prices to veterans' programs and other Federal health programs because the price schedule for these programs is fixed in law. Apparently, pharmaceutical companies are making up the revenues lost in bulk sales by charging exorbitant prices to individual buyers who lack negotiating power. 
   Despite these market pressures and increased research and development costs, the prices being charged to seniors and other individual purchasers are hardly justified when financial reports show drug companies reaping enormous profits. 
   Many seniors live on fixed incomes, and a substantial number of them cannot afford to take the drugs their doctors prescribe. Many try to stretch their medicine out by skipping days or breaking pills in half. Many must choose between paying for food and paying for medicine. 
   In the context of the budget resolution debate, proposals were made to provide for the added cost of including prescription drug coverage in the Medicare program. I voted for an amendment to create a reserve fund of $101 billion over 10 years to cover the cost of Medicare reform including the addition of a prescription drug benefit. This provision was included in the final version of the Senate budget resolution. However, legislation creating the drug benefit still must be enacted before coverage could be extended. 
   Helping senior citizens get the prescription drugs they need should be one of our top priorities this session. Unfortunately, the Majority is more interested in enacting deep and unreasonable tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy. Just before the August recess, Congress passed the Majority's FY 2000 budget reconciliation bill. I voted against this bill because it would spend nearly all of the on-budget surplus projected to accrue over the next ten years and would use none of this projected surplus to protect the Social Security System, to shore up Medicare, or to give senior citizens the prescription drug benefit they so desperately need. 
   I am pleased that the Finance Committee will be focusing on Medicare reform, and I hope that the legislation they develop will establish a prescription drug benefit for our older Americans. Providing seniors with drug coverage is essential to ensuring they receive quality health care. I believe that access to quality health care is a basic human need that in my view must be a fundamental right in a democratic society.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we have spent a lot of time in the Senate praising the booming American economy and low unemployment rates. I, like the rest of the colleagues, am proud to see our country benefitting from such prosperity, but all Americans are not participating in these benefits. 
   In reality, Americans that live in low income areas, either in cities or rural areas, are not experiencing today's prosperity. This is largely because they do not have the economic infrastructure in their communities to take advantage of it. Poor communities frequently lack local businesses to employ residents and provide services, creating no point of entrance for participation in the larger American economy. 
   It is for these reasons that I am co-sponsoring the Community Development and Venture Capital Act of 1999 introduced by Senator KERRY. This legislation is part of President Clinton's New market Initiatives Proposal. As my colleagues know, I have already introduced America's Private Investment Companies Act of 1999, or APIC, which is another part of the New Market initiative. 
   The Community Development and Venture Capital Act makes a three pronged effort to infuse capital into distressed communities, and establish small businesses in our nations most needy neighborhoods. First, the bill will use federal money to leverage private funding for venture capital companies with a commitment to community development, referred to as New market Venture Capital Companies (NMVC). This will help to nurture new businesses in poor areas. The companies funding by this bill will function much like the successful SBIC program that the Small Business Administration sponsors, but will focus on businesses in targeted neighborhoods that need more patient, long term capital funding, and added technical assistance to ensure success. 
   Furthermore, the bill will increase the number of community development venture capital funds so that more communities can be served by the program and expand the successful business mentoring program, BusinessLINC, already in place. 
   I have long argued that the best social policy is a job. This legislation, combined with the APIC bill and the New markets Tax Credit introduced by Senator ROCKEFELLER, will be a catalyst to the creation of new businesses and the jobs and economic opportunities they bring in those areas most in need.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to put a question to the Senator on the hold because I have been reading newspaper reports that I think have completely misinterpreted how the hold process operates. These reports have alleged that the Senate rules contain a provision that enables any Member of the Senate, in effect, to hold up action either on a nominee or on legislation and sort of that is that. That is not the case.

   Mr. SARBANES. It is a courtesy that is extended to a Member when he places a hold. The leadership can move ahead if the Member is being recalcitrant. Of course, it is up to Members to exercise a hold with some self-restraint. They may get the extra time they need, but, in my judgement, it ought not to be used as a weapon that completely submerges the nomination or the legislation. 
   I interjected because I am very concerned. I have read a number of newspaper reports that seem to suggest that the rules of the Senate are such that any Member can simply place a hold on a nomination and preclude any action. That is not the case. It is a courtesy that has been extended to Members by the leadership, but the leadership can always move ahead if they determine it is an urgent matter. Of course, they try to work it out so Members are willing to have it come up. That is what has happened in this instance. 
   I particularly express my appreciation to the distinguished Senator from Virginia for his efforts to try to move this matter forward.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be the United States representative to the United Nations with the rank of Ambassador. Ambassador Holbrooke has rendered superb service to our Nation during the course of his career. His diplomatic experience makes him an ideal choice for this very important position. 
   We need good, strong leadership at the United Nations. We have been without a permanent representative now for an extended period of time. An able, competent, skillful diplomat can make a big difference in terms of serving the national interests of our country. 
   Dick Holbrooke has had an illustrious career. He joined the Foreign Service in 1962. He had assignments in Vietnam, where he worked closely with Ambassador William Porter, Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, and Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. From the very beginning he was right in the middle of the decisionmaking arena and was recognized for his extraordinary talents. He was the Director of the Peace Corps in Morocco. He then left the Government for a while and was a managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine, 
   one of our leading foreign policy think magazines, where he did an outstanding job. In the mid-1970s, he was senior consultant to the President's Commission on the Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy. 
   This is a man who has committed his entire career to analyzing and enhancing the foreign policy of the United States in the name of serving our national security interests. He held two assistant secretaryships within the Department of State: Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and Assistant Secretary for European and Canadian Affairs. He has also served in a very distinguished way as our Ambassador to Germany. 
   I have worked closely with him in his capacity as Presidential Special Envoy to Cyprus, where he has striven mightily to try to move that issue forward. 
   He will do a terrific job at the United Nations. He has done an excellent job in every government position he has held. His commitment and dedication are obvious for all to see. I think the Senator from Delaware was right in saying that there were attacks on Dick Holbrooke's character which were extremely unfortunate and without basis or justification. To his credit, he withstood all of that. A lesser person might have walked away and said: Who needs to put up with this? But he has a driving sense of serving the country and serving the national interest. 
   Dick Holbrooke has addressed difficult, complex foreign policy issues in an extremely incisive and competent way. We need that skill at the United Nations. That is the skill he will bring. I am relieved that the nomination is finally before us for judgment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Dick Holbrooke to be our Ambassador to the United Nations. He will serve our Nation and, indeed, the world well in this position.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference agreement on the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 which provides for the development and improvement of our Nation's water resources infrastructure. This legislation authorizes water resource projects of vital importance to our nation's and our states' economy and maritime industry as well as our environment. 
   I am particularly pleased that the measure includes a number of provisions for which I have fought to ensure  the future health of the Port of Baltimore and of Maryland's environment. 
   First the bill authorizes nearly $28 million for needed improvements to Baltimore Harbor Anchorages and Channels. Many of the existing anchorages and branch channels within Baltimore Harbor were built in the first half of this century and are no longer deep enough, wide enough or long enough to accommodate the vessels now calling on the Port of Baltimore. Many of the larger ships must now anchor some 25 miles south of Baltimore in naturally deep water, resulting in delays and increased costs to the shipping industry. Also, the narrow widths of some of the branch channels result in additional time for the pilots to maneuver safely to and from their docking berths. In June 1998 the Chief of Engineers approved a report which recommended a number of improvements including: (1) widening and deepening Federal anchorages 3 and 4; (2) widening and providing flared corners for state-owned East Dundalk, Seagirt, Connecting and West Dundalk branch Channels; (3) dredging a new branch channel at South Locust Point; and (4) dredging a turning basin at the head of the Fort McHenry Channel. The report identified the project as ``technically sound, economically justified and environmentally and socially acceptable.'' This project has been a top priority of mine, of the Maryland Port Administration and of the shipping community for many years and I am delighted that this legislation will enable us to move forward with this important project. 
   Second, the legislation directs the Corps of Engineers to make critically needed safety improvements to the Tolchester Channel in the Chesapeake Bay. The Tolchester Channel is a vital link in the Baltimore Port system. It was authorized in the River and Harbor Act of 1958 and aligned to take advantage of the naturally deep water in the Chesapeake Bay, along Maryland's Eastern Shore. This alignment, which is shaped like an ``S,'' has posed a serious navigation problem and safety risks for vessels. Ships must change course five times within three miles, often beginning a new turn, sometimes in the opposite direction, before completing a first turn. With vessels nearly 1,000 feet in length, it is difficult to safely navigate the channel, particularly in poor weather conditions. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Maryland Pilots Association have expressed serious concerns over the safety of the area and have long recommended straightening of the channel due to the grounding and ``near misses'' which have occurred in the area. The cost for straightening the Tolchester ``S-turn'' is estimated at $12.6 million with $1.3 million coming from non-federal sources. This authorization enables the Corps to proceed expeditiously with these improvements and address the serious concerns of those who must navigate the treacherous channel. With $5.8 million already included in the fiscal 
   2000 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, this provision will ensure that these improvements will be undertaken in the near future. 
   Mr. President, the Port of Baltimore is one of the great ports of the world and one of Maryland's most important economic assets. The Port generates $2 billion in annual economic activity, provides for an estimated 62,000 jobs, and more than $500 million a year in State and local tax revenues and customs receipts. These two projects will help assure the continued vitality of the Port of Baltimore into the 21st Century. 
   In addition to port development and improvement projects, the measure contains a provision which will help significantly to enhance Maryland's environment and quality of life and help achieve the goals and vision of the Potomac American Heritage River designation. 
   It authorizes $15 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to modify the existing flood protection project at Cumberland, Maryland to restore features of the historic Chesapeake and Ohio Canal adversely affected by construction and operation of the project. Mr. President, the C&O Canal is widely regarded as the Nation's finest relic of America's canal building era. It was begun in 1828 as a transportation route between commercial centers in the East and frontier resources of the West. It reached Cumberland in 1850 and continued operating until 1924 when it succumbed to floods and financial failure. In the early 1950's, a section of the Canal and turning basin at its Cumberland terminus was filled in by the Corps of Engineers during construction of a local flood protection project. Portions of the Canal were proclaimed a national monument in 1961 and it was officially established as a national historical park in 1971. Justice Douglas described the park ``*.*.* not yet marred by the roar of wheels and the sound of horns. *.*.* The stretch of 185 miles of country from Washington to Cumberland, Maryland, is one of the most fascinating and picturesque in the Nation.'' 
   The National Park Service, as part of its General Management Plan for the Park, has long sought to rebuild and re-water the Canal at its Cumberland terminus. The NPS entered into a Memorandum of Agreement, MOA, with the Corps to undertake a study of the feasibility of reconstructing the last 2200 feet of the canal to the terminus, through and adjacent to the Corps' flood protection project. The Corps completed this study in July 1995 and determined that ``it is feasible to re-water the canal successfully; the canal and flood protection levee can co-exist on the site without compromising the flood protection for the City of Cumberland; re-construction and partial operation of the locks is feasible; and, based on the as-built information available, underground utility impacts can be mitigated at reasonable cost to allow construction of the canal and turning basin in basically the same alignment and configuration as the original canal.'' A subsequent Rewatering Design Analysis estimated the total project cost at $15 million. This authorization will enable the Corps to proceed with restoring a 1.1 mile stretch of the C&O Canal and revitalize the area as a major hub for tourism and economic development. 
   The conference agreement also authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake a study for control and management of waterborne debris on the Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna River is the largest tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, draining an area of about 27,500 square miles. It is also one of the most flood prone river basins in the nation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates several reservoirs for flood control and other purposes and there are three large hydroelectric dams on the lower Susquehanna. During high flow events, enormous amounts of debris, including trees, branches and manmade materials, are carried downstream and ultimately into the Chesapeake Bay. Most recently, the flood waters of January 1999 deposited tremendous amounts of debris as far as Anne Arundel County, Maryland, creating hazards to navigation, damaging boats and bulkheads, aggravating flooding and clogging beaches and shorelines. This legislation will enable the Corps of Engineers to evaluate the economic, engineering and environmental feasibility of potential measures to control and manage the amount of waterborne debris as well as determine if new and improved debris removal technologies can be utilized in the Susquehanna. 
   Finally, the conference agreement includes several other provisions which will help address important water resource needs in Maryland and nearby communities including the flood protection project for the District of Columbia, and the studies for the West View Shores Community of Cecil County, Welch Point and Chesapeake City, MD. 
   I want to compliment the distinguished chairmen of the Committee and the Subcommittee, Senators CHAFEE and WARNER, and the ranking member, Senator BAUCUS, for their leadership in crafting this legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today legislation to establish ``America's Private Investment Companies,'' or APIC. This legislation is part of President Clinton's ``New Markets Initiative,'' which I am also pleased to be able to support. 
   The New Markets Initiative, of which APIC is a crucial element, is an important response to economic problems that persist in many neighborhoods and communities in our urban and rural areas. These communities have been bypassed by the increased investment, job growth, and income increases that have characterized this unprecedented period of economic expansion. Indeed, the areas that would benefit from the New Markets Initiative are experiencing increased poverty levels, increased isolation, and ongoing joblessness and decay. 
   Yet, research increasingly shows that most of these areas represent good economic opportunities for American business. Michael Porter, a renowned business analyst who has written widely on competitiveness at both the firm and national levels, has written that a  
   ..... major advantage of the inner city as a business location is a large, underserved local market. ..... In fact, inner cities are the largest underserved market in America, with many tens of billions of dollars of unmet consumer and business demand.  
   Another group called Social Compact has done intensive studies of buying power in a number of communities around the country. These studies confirm Porter's earlier work. Social Compact estimated retail spending power in two communities in Chicago. Residents in the first community have median incomes of over $67,000 million whereas the median income in the second community is under $30,000. Yet, on a per acre basis, the lower income community has more than twice the spending power of the wealthier area. 
   Moreover, as labor markets grow tighter and tighter, inner cities have the advantage of an ``available, loyal workforce,'' to again quote Mr. Porter. 
   However, we need a catalyst to encourage business to take advantage of these opportunities. The APIC program provides that push. This bill gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), together with the Small Business Administration (SBA), authority to provide low-cost loans on a matching basis to specially constituted investment companies, called APICs, that raise private equity capital for investment in businesses in low-income areas. 
   Individual APICs will operate in a manner similar to Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs), a very successful program that helps fund start up small business. APIC will target its investment funds to larger businesses that locate in these underserved areas, with particular emphasis on those businesses that create good jobs in those neighborhoods. 
   The APIC program is essentially a private-sector venture in partnership with the public sector. The managers of the individual APICs will make the investment decisions according to the program goals and criteria. They will have their money, and the money of their investors, at risk, making the government's loan much more secure. 
   This program requires a very small federal investment--just $36 million in credit subsidy--to create an estimated $1 billion in debt financing available. This debt will, in turn, generate $500 million in private equity per year, or $7.5 billion over the next five years. APICs would use these funds, for example, to help a business establish a new back-office facility, factory, or distribution plant in a low income area. APICs could invest in the development of multi-tenant shopping centers, or in industrial parks. Combined with the New Market Tax Credit being introduced by my colleagues Senator ROCKEFELLER and Senator ROBB, APIC will help create important new economic opportunities in parts of America that have not yet been touched by  the economic prosperity most of us enjoy.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, during the week of August 30-September 3 we will celebrate Occupational and Environmental Health and Safety Week. As a strong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives to strengthen our safety and environmental laws and protect our workers and citizens, I am pleased to take this opportunity to draw my colleagues' attention to this important occasion and to take a few moments to reflect on and bring greater awareness of workplace and community health and safety issues to the public. 
   Occupational and Environmental Health and Safety Week is sponsored by the American Industrial Hygiene Association. This is the first annual celebration of this event and the goal is to highlight workplace and community health issues. This year's theme, ``Protecting Your Future ..... Today,'' shows the far-reaching nature of occupational and environmental safety's impact on the public. 
   One of the major issues concerning workplace safety is Ergonomics. Ergonomics is the science of fitting the job to the worker. It is the solution to a host of physical problems brought about by over-exertion or repetitive stress. More than 650,000 Americans suffer serious injuries and illnesses due to work-related musculoskeletal disorders each year, accounting for more than 34 percent of all lost-workday injuries and illnesses, and costing employers $15-20 billion annually in direct workers' compensation costs. 
   There is sound scientific evidence linking musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) to work. Last summer, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found ``compelling evidence'' that workplace modifications can reduce the risk of injury. A 1997 review of 600 studies by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health drew similar conclusions. For the average worker, the back takes the brunt of the injuries. About 4 out of 10 injuries involve strains and sprains, most of them back-related. The Department of Labor recently reported that injuries and illnesses for construction laborers, carpenters, welders and cutters increased by a total of 8,000 cases. Additionally, truck drivers suffer more than their share of injuries, including approximately 145,000 work-related injuries or illnesses each year. 
   Although many injuries occur in the workplace, our concern does not end there. OEHS Week's second important emphasis is safety in the community and home. Protecting and improving our environment, our parks and wildlife refuges, and natural resources have been among my highest priorities since I was first elected to the Congress. I have fought for, and helped enact, every major piece of legislation to enhance environmental quality--the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and Superfund, to name a few. OEHS Week is designed to heighten awareness about several vital community health concerns including carbon monoxide poisoning, indoor air quality, and noise exposure. 
   In my view, a clean environment is a legacy we leave for future generations. After all, our natural resources--our farmlands and forests, water, air, and our wildlife--are the foundation of our country's present and future well-being and quality of life. We are making progress in the effort to clean up the Chesapeake Bay--our nation's largest and most productive estuary. But much more work needs to be done to revitalize this national treasure and I have introduced legislation to amend the Federal Water Pollution Act to assist in the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. Additionally, I have introduced a bill to implement pilot projects in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina to address problems associated with toxic microorganisms in tidal and non-tidal wetlands and waters. 
   As we approach over 100 years of celebrating Labor Day, it is appropriate that we focus our attention on the safety of workers while in a workplace environment and on their safety and environmental concerns while away from the job site. This 1st annual Occupational and Environmental Health and Safety Week truly represents a  spotlight on the total quality of life of working Americans.

   Mr. SARBANES. I want to underscore the point the distinguished Senator from North Dakota is making. 
   Yesterday, I had the opportunity to go with Secretary Glickman and Governor Glendening to visit one of the farms that has been affected by the drought in our State. It is devastating to see. Of course, it is a compound of two things: The low commodity prices, which the Senator is demonstrating with his charts--this is not only wheat but the same thing applies to other basic commodities as well--and the drought, which is crippling certain parts of the country. 
   We talked to this farmer who has been farming ever since he was a young boy. His father was a farmer. His grandfather was a farmer. He doesn't know whether he will be in farming next year because of what has hit them--the combination of the low commodity prices and the drought which is now desperately affecting our country. 
   He is not alone. Farmers across Maryland and indeed, the nation, are finding themselves facing similar circumstances. Nearly one fourth of Maryland's corn crop is in poor to very poor condition. Likewise, 55 percent of pastures and hay fields are in poor or very poor condition. Milk production has decreased because of the high temperatures. And because pastures and field crops are in such bad shape, cattle and dairy farmers are now faced with a dilemma, whether or not to sell their animals or begin feeding them hay which should be utilized over the winter. 
   Maryland has suffered extensive drought damage for three consecutive years. However the drought this year is by far the worst since the depression. Yesterday, the United States Geological Survey reported that we may be in the midst of what could become the worst drought of the 20th century. Rainfall throughout Maryland is currently between 40 and 50 percent below normal. Throughout Maryland, counties are reporting losses as high as 100 percent for certain crops. Most alarmingly, there is no end in sight. 
   But the crisis affecting agriculture is about more than the drought. The dramatic drop in commodity prices, since the enactment of the Freedom to Farm Act, has had its affect on farmers throughout the country and the State of Maryland. The poultry industry, which is Maryland's largest agricultural producer, has witnessed a 45-percent decrease in exports. The situation for farmers is bleak and many are losing their businesses. 
   Mr. President, Maryland depends on agriculture. Agriculture is Maryland's largest industry contributing more than $11 billion annually to our economy. More than 350,000 Marylanders--some 14 percent of our State's workforce--are employed in all aspects of agriculture from farm production of wholesaling and retaining. Forty percent of our State's land is in agriculture--more than 2 million acres. So when our family farmers and the farm economy start hurting--everyone suffers. 
   Our farmers are in trouble and they deserve our assistance. This measure provides that assistance in the form of direct payments and low interest loans.  It gives nearly $11 billion in emergency assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been affected by natural disaster and economic crisis. $6 billion of that amount will deliver income assistance to farmers hit hard by the economic disaster. And more than $2.6 billion will be used to address natural disasters such as the drought. Within the disaster funds, nearly $300 million in section 32 and disaster reserve funds has been included to specifically address the Mid-Atlantic drought. 
   Mr. President, the need for this amendment is real. Until we are able to reform the Freedom to Farm Act or manufacture rain, these funds are vital to the preservation of the farm industry throughout the State of Maryland and the United States. 
   In my judgment, it is imperative that we pass this legislation. 
   I very much appreciate the Senator from North Dakota yielding. I want to underscore the crisis nature of the situation to which he is referring. 
   I want to acknowledge the consistent and effective leadership which he has exercised on many of these farm issues. He and others of us expressed concerns and questions at the time the 1996 act was passed. Much of that now seems to have come around to hit us--compounded, of course, by these serious weather circumstances which exist not in all parts of the country but in certain parts of the country. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am again pleased to join with my colleagues, Senators MIKULSKI, WARNER, ROBB and AKAKA, in introducing the Federal Employee Retirement Contributions Act of 1999. This bill makes a technical correction to legislation introduced last week that would return Federal employee retirement contribution rates to their 1998 levels, effective January 1st, 2000. It is my belief that the temporarily increased retirement contributions enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 represent an unfair penalty against Federal workers at a time when budget surpluses are predicted into the next ten years.

   Mr. SARBANES. This is the great exploding tax cut. I was looking at the very document the Senator from Texas himself distributed. It is clear that the marginal income tax rate cuts don't go fully into effect until the year 2008. By his own figures, it would cost $73 billion in the first 5 years, and $451 billion over 10 years; and it is not getting into full effect until right near the end of the 10-year period. So if you extrapolate out, you are going to have an incredible increase in its cost. 
   The same thing is true with virtually every provision that is in this amendment, with one exception. All of the others get phased in. They don't take full effect until close to the end of the 10-year period. Then you are given these cost figures which, of course, are over the range of the period. So, obviously, in the next 10-year period, these tax cuts are going to explode out of sight and put the Nation right back into the deficit box. Is that not a reasonable analysis, I ask the ranking member?

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Budget Reconciliation bill that is before us today. This bill would spend nearly all of the on-budget surplus projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the next ten years and would use none of this projected surplus to protect the Social Security system, shore up Medicare, or give senior citizens the prescription drug benefits they so desperately need. Instead of taking this opportunity to invest in the future of America at the threshold of the 21st century, Republicans want to enact deep and unreasonable tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy. 
   One major problem with basing a decade's worth of budgetary decisions on a projected surplus is that we have no way of knowing what will happen in the next ten years to affect these projections. Consider that just three years ago, when we enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, there were forecasts of large deficits stretching into the future. This year, both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget are projecting large surpluses over the same period. This turnabout should illustrate clearly that there is a large element of uncertainty in any economic projection, and that large scale shifts in tax policy that would tie our hands in the event of an economic downturn are, at the very least, unwise. 
   Furthermore, the surplus estimates are based on the assumption that the Federal government will adhere to the spending caps enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Leadership in both Houses has admitted that this is not a realistic assumption: a number of appropriations bills will not be able to pass unless their funding is restored to pre-cap levels. Already this year, appropriators are eyeing the projected budget surpluses to help fund large appropriations bills. And, as difficult as these spending caps have been for appropriators this year, the spending caps in future years call for even more drastic cuts. 
   We are in the midst of the longest peacetime economic expansion in history. This remarkable turnaround has come about in large part because of deficit reduction efforts which began with legislation proposed by the Administration and enacted by the Congress in 1993 - without a single Republican vote. Thanks to these efforts, we have been able to achieve record low levels of unemployment while at the same time maintaining dramatically low levels of inflation. Tax cuts of the magnitude put forward by the Majority would be unwise and potentially destabilizing in an economy that has strong growth, low unemployment and dramatically low levels of inflation. 
   The real question before us today is whether we are going to take advantage of this opportunity to exercise responsible fiscal policy. If we begin to stimulate the economy with a tax cut at the very time that unemployment is at unprecedented low levels, we run the risk of reigniting inflation. If we start over-stimulating the economy, the Federal Reserve will surely raise interest rates to keep inflation in check and we will be right back in the box we faced prior to this recovery. 
   It is my strongly held view that any surplus realized over the next ten years should be seen as an opportunity to pay down the Nation's debt, invest in our Nation's future, and shore up vital programs. The Republican tax plan would squander this unprecedented opportunity to ensure that the Federal government will meet its obligations after the baby boomers retire and beyond. 
   The Republican plan does nothing to preserve the integrity of the Social Security trust fund. The Social Security program is one of this Nation's greatest achievements. For more than 60 years, we have ensured that our senior citizens have a means of support in retirement after a lifetime of hard work. We must honor this commitment and ensure that seniors who count on Social Security receive their benefits. 
   The Republican tax plan would set aside no new resources for the Medicare program--the plan does nothing to extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund or provide prescription drug benefits. The President's proposal to enact a modest prescription drug benefit for Medicare would cost $46 billion over the next ten years--less than 6 percent of the total cost of the Republican tax proposal. 
   Beyond Social Security and Medicare, this projected budget surplus could allow us to invest in the country's infrastructure. We should invest in schools to provide our children with the best possible education; we should improve our Nation's highways and infrastructure; we should invest in America's workers to train them for the 21st century; we should continue to put more police officers on the streets and give them the resources they need to bring crime rates down; and we should protect our environment and natural resources. 
   While I am not opposed to passing legislation that uses a portion of the projected surplus to cut taxes, such cuts must be responsible, and we should ensure that America's hard-working families who are struggling to take part in the Nation's prosperity benefit first. 
   Mr. President, we are embarking on an extremely important decision in terms of the future course of the Nation. If we make it responsibly, we can continue on the path of prosperity. We can continue to invest in the future strength of our country through education, research and development, and infrastructure. We can shore up Social Security, address the problems in the Medicare program, and bring down the Federal debt. We can also implement targeted tax cuts that help strengthen our families. 
   All of these things are possible, but we cannot, for the sake of our future economic prosperity, go to extremes. The Republican proposal is an extreme proposal. Subjected to analysis, it does not stand up. I strongly oppose this proposal and I urge my colleagues to reject it.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senators MIKULSKI, WARNER, ROBB and AKAKA, in introducing the Federal Employee Retirement Contributions Act of 1999. This bill would return Federal employee retirement contribution rates to their 1998 levels, effective January 1st, 2000.  
   Mr. President, in the 1997 Budget Reconciliation bill, as part of the deficit reduction effort, Congress enacted temporary increases in Federal employee retirement contribution rates. In order to meet its fiscal year 1998 reconciliation instructions, the Governmental Affairs Committee reluctantly agreed to phased-in, temporary increases in employee retirement payments of .5 percent through December 31, 2002. 
   The 1997 provision effectively takes retirement contribution rates under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) from 7 percent to 7.5 percent and under the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) from .8 percent to 1.3 percent. Rates are to return to 7 percent and .8 percent respectively in 2003. 
   Mr. President, the sole rationale for this additional tax on Federal employee income in 1997 was to achieve deficit reduction. It is important to point out that Federal employees received no additional benefits from their increased contributions. Thus, the size of a Federal employee's retirement annuity is not greater because of their increased contributions. Instead, these contribution increases were merely one of several measures included in the Balanced Budget Act in order to raise revenues and reduce the deficit. 
   The goal of deficit reduction is being realized, and after 30 years of spiraling deficits the economy is now strong and the budget has been balanced. With budget surpluses projected for the near future, the rationale for increasing Federal employees' retirement contribution is no longer valid. 
   During the past weeks as tax cut proposals have begun moving in the Senate, I have worked to repeal the increased contributions as part of these proposals. While the Majority's tax cut packages would grant billions of dollars in tax relief over the next ten years, and even more in future years, the bill proposals fail to remove the burden that was placed on Federal employees under the Balanced Budget Act. 
   Mr. President, if we are going to move forward with tax reduction proposals, it is my strong view that we should first make certain that Federal employees, who were singled out to bear an additional burden in the deficit reduction effort, are relieved of that burden. Federal employees should not be forced to continue to contribute more than their fair share, at a time when others are having their taxes reduced. 
   As of January 1, 1999, half of the .5 percent increase (.25 percent) has already taken effect. Unless action is taken, an additional .15 percent will be deducted from Federal employees' salaries for their retirement on January 1, 2000, followed by .10 percent more in 2001. In these times of strong economic growth, Federal workers should no longer be required to carry this additional burden. 
   Federal employees were asked to make numerous sacrifices in order to contribute to our Nation's fiscal health. In addition to the increase in retirement contributions, the Federal Government has cut approximately 330,000 employees from its rolls and delayed statutory pay raises over the last several years. Certainly, these were substantial contributions to our country's economy and have helped us turn the corner toward the bright economic future that is now predicted. As we consider how to best utilize projected budget surpluses, we should first remove this burden from Federal employees who have already contributed so much. Repealing the increases in Federal employee retirement contributions is the fair thing to do.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the resolution that will be before us for a vote at the end of the afternoon, S. Res. 160, to restore enforcement of rule XVI. 
   Mr. President, I believe in the Senate as an institution. I think it is an important part of the workings of our democracy that the Senate carry out its duties and responsibilities in a way that it has done throughout the more than 200-year history of our Republic. 
   In a sense, this is a difficult issue for me because I voted not to waive rule XVI, or, in effect, not to overrule the ruling of the Chair, at the time the ruling was made. That, of course, was a motion offered by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I thought, well, we really should not change the way we do business. But what has happened since that time is, increasingly, that the minority has been really frustrated by the lack of opportunity to come to the floor of the Senate to offer its positions, to have them considered and voted upon. Therefore, I am going to vote against this resolution when it comes to a vote this afternoon simply, among other things, to make a very strong statement of protest against the procedures that are now being followed in the Senate, which are effectively preventing us from considering important issues. 
   Now, repeatedly, we have had a situation in which the majority leader, once a measure is offered, fills up the amendment tree by gaining first recognition, which is the majority leader's entitlement under our process, and then the minority has no opportunity to offer its proposals. I ask the minority whip and the assistant minority leader, isn't it the case that time and time again we have simply been blocked out from even putting an issue before the Senate? I am not complaining about being blocked out if we then go to a vote on it--well, I would complain, but you decide these things by majority vote. We are even being precluded from offering amendments in order to have positions considered; is that not correct?

   Mr. SARBANES. It raises this question in a democracy: What happens when you can't pose issues and have them debated and voted upon? 
   It seems to me an elementary way of proceeding. Traditionally, the Senate has always offered that opportunity, as a matter of fact. I have been in this body a long time and I can recall when, not too long ago, we were in the majority, and even earlier when that was the case, when the Senate was essentially run in a way that enabled Members to bring up proposals and have them considered and voted upon. It by no means guaranteed that your proposal was going to prevail; You might lose, and that was obvious. But that is part and parcel of the democratic process. But not to even be able to offer your amendments--and, of course, this resolution would, in effect, limit down the opportunities as well. 
   Essentially, if you had a Senate that was operating in the traditional way, you could offer your proposals. That sort of limitation is one that we traditionally lived with. But this was lifted by the majority, and at the same time they did this, subsequently, they have increasingly developed other ways of blocking the minority out from simply laying their positions before the Senate for consideration. Is that not the case?

   Mr. SARBANES. Well, the thing that struck me when I came to the Senate from the House was, in a sense, how much more wide open the Senate was in terms of considering proposals of the Members of the Senate. In the House, of course, you have title rules. You adopt a rule, and that limits the amendments that can be offered. We even had the so-called closed rule in which no amendment could be offered. You either had to vote up or down on the measure that was reported by the committee to the floor of the House. But usually you would get a rule that would perhaps give the minority an opportunity to offer a couple of amendments. One came to the Senate and discovered that both the majority and minority Members had much more of an opportunity to have amendments offered by the body and considered 
   and voted upon. 
   Of course, in order to control that procedure, we had a rule that you could  not legislate on an appropriations bill, which seemed to make good sense. Now, that was overturned a few years back when the majority wanted to have a certain measure considered and the Chair ruled that it constituted legislation on an appropriations bill; therefore, it was not in order. The majority--the other side of the aisle--then went forward and appealed the ruling of the Chair and they overruled the Chair. That established the precedent that you could offer legislation on an appropriations bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely correct. What has happened is longstanding precedent was overturned. Therefore, you could legislate on an appropriations bill. That is the precedent we have been working under for the last 3 or 4 years. On occasion, the minority--our side--has offered legislation on an appropriations bill. Now the majority wants to go back to the old ruling. Having overturned the old ruling themselves, they now want to return to it. 
   Well, as an institutionalist, you know the old rule made some sense. But what has happened to the Senate in the interim, in the meantime, since the overturning of this old rule, is that other techniques have also been developed to block the minority from offering amendments on the various matters that come before the Senate. So, in effect, they are closing out the minority from having any voice, any opportunity to present our positions, any opportunity to have a judgment made on our positions. 
   I am very frank to tell you that is not the way the Senate ought to work. 
   Previously, even when we had the old rule, we didn't have a couple with these other techniques that are now being used in order to keep the minority from bringing their position before this body. Until we can remedy that situation and get some assurance that we are going to have an opportunity to really present our amendments in an orderly and reasonable fashion, I am not going to support any measure that could have the possibility of closing out some opportunity that we now have in order to present our positions.

   Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely. In fact, the rule XXVIII issue is also very important. That was also overturned by the majority to permit matters to be included in a conference report that were not within either of the two bills that the House and the Senate sent to the conference. Of course, what that means is that a conference can come back with something that is outside of the scope of the conference and present it to these bodies--a matter that neither the House nor the Senate considered in the course of sending that legislation to conference. 
   Talk about potential mischief. You could bring back in here, contained in a conference report with all of the sort of protections that a conference report has in terms of its consideration, and so forth, matters that were outside of what was sent to conference. The minority leader is trying to remedy that matter. 
   I can't for the life of me see why someone who supports S. Res. 160 would oppose the proposal of the minority leader. But I guess we will discover that when we come to a vote on the matter later this afternoon. 
   It eventually comes back to the very basic question. That is, What are to be the rights of the minority in this body? One of the great strengths of the Senate traditionally has been that it has accorded to the minority a real opportunity to participate in the consideration of matters on the floor of the Senate. The minority has not traditionally been closed out of participating. In fact, some have argued that minorities traditionally have been given too much of an opportunity to participate. They argue that. 
   But what has been happening in recent years is, the 
   majority has been using its majority to overrule these precedents of the Senate, which effectively then allows the majority to do what it wants to do and completely leaves the minority outside of the process. 
   That is, in a sense, the issue that is at stake. That is why there has been such a strong reaction to this proposal, because S. Res. 160 comes in the context of these other matters that have been happening, all of which have moved in the same direction; namely, to preclude the minority from having a fair opportunity to present its positions to the Senate, to have them considered, and to have judgment rendered upon them. It is fundamentally changing the nature of the Senate. 
   One of the great things about American democracy that any political commentator always points to is that, unlike many systems, it isn't run in such a tight, rigid, disciplined fashion that the minority can be excluded from any opportunity to be heard and to have its positions considered. Particularly the Senate has been the great bulwark of strength in that regard. 
   Now we have a proposal to overturn the very precedent which the majority themselves established only a few years ago, and to do so at the very time that increasingly the majority is using other techniques to block the minority from presenting its position, including, of course, this technique of filling up the amendment tree so that no amendments can be offered. 
   We really are moving very much in the direction of saying to the minority, in effect, well, you can come here and sit at your desks, but that is about all you can do around here; there is not much else you can do in terms of trying to constructively affect the legislative process. 
   I am very frank to say that I think we must resist that development. I think it is significantly undercutting the nature of the Senate as an institution and the role it has played in the country's history. I think this is a very important debate. I think the matter that is coming before us has a great deal to do with saying how the institution ought to run. 
   I must say that if the procedures were all fair and if we were given a fair opportunity to present our positions, there might be something that could be said for going back and treating what was done as a mistake, as some of us assert it was at the time. But in light of these subsequent developments, it seems to me that the minority has to really insist that no opportunity to offer its position should be denied to them. Therefore, that is the position I intend to take when this matter comes to a vote at the end of the day. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the amendment of the Senator from Indiana and am confident that it will be approved by a majority of my colleagues. 
   This is the second time in 3 years that funding for the National Endowment for Democracy has been eliminated in the Senate Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. And this is the second time this year that we are debating the NED issue on the floor of the Senate despite consistently overwhelming votes in favor of the NED. 
   I find it difficult to understand why we keep returning to this matter when the record is clear--there is a consensus of support for the endowment in the Senate. As my colleagues are aware, last month there was an effort on a different measure (State Department authorization bill) to seriously undermine and weaken the National Endowment for Democracy and the work of its core institutes. That amendment was soundly defeated on a vote of 76-23. In 1997, NED funding was restored by the Senate on a vote of 72-27. 
   Over the years, the NED and its core institutes have done some extremely effective work around the world in strengthening and assisting in the development of democratic institutions, and protecting individual rights and freedoms. 
   The relationship between NED and its core institutes has worked rather well. These four core entities, including the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI), represent key sectors of our democratic society: business and labor, and the two political parties which have formed a major part of the American democratic system. 
   Each sector offers a special expertise in helping develop fledgling democratic systems and has assisted grassroots and indigenous organizations, civic groups, and individuals across the globe in more than 90 countries. 
   Indeed, many individuals and groups, recognized in the Congress for having fought for human rights, freedom, and democracy, have received vital support from the NED family. They, in turn, have praised the NED because of the critical assistance which made it possible for them to pursue valuable efforts in their own countries. 
   I should note that the NED has provided support to Chinese dissidents since its establishment in 1983. In fact, the endowment's first grant in 1984 was for a Chinese-language journal edited in the United States and circulated in China. 
   The NED serves an important role because of the fact that it can operate as an entity independent from any government. And it can support nongovernmental groups which provide opportunities that would not otherwise be available if these activities were undertaken by a government, or governmental agency. 
   In fact, NED grants have been helpful in leveraging resources from the private sector and encouraging other international institutions to participate as well. And in-kind contributions, for example, come in the form of experts who offer their free time and efforts on a probono basis to conduct training seminars and to monitor elections worldwide. 
   The National Endowment for Democracy has enjoyed broad bipartisan support since it was established in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan. Former Secretaries of State, including Henry Kissinger, Cy Vance, Ed Muskie, George Shultz, and Jim Baker all have been very supportive of NED's work and its ``strong track record in assisting ...... significant democratic movements over the past decade.'' 
   In a letter this week to my colleague from Florida, national security adviser Sandy Berger reaffirmed the President's and his administration's strong support for the NED. As he indicates, ``from supporting election monitoring in Indonesia, to promoting independent media in the Balkans, the NED represents and promotes the most fundamental of American values throughout the world........The President remains one of the strongest champions of the endowment''. 
   The sweeping and profound changes resulting from the end of the cold war provide ample reason as to why we continue to need institutions like the NED which can operate in a cost-effective manner and, at the same time, promote our interests and values. Many of the new democratics which have emerged from the implosion of the Soviet Union, and the collapse of the Iron Curtain, have benefited from the assistance NED and its grantees have provided. 
   It is my hope that my colleagues will see the wisdom of continuing support for the NED.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Robert Tobias for his distinguished service at the National Treasury Employees Union, including four terms as its president. 
   Admired by his friends and adversaries alike, Bob Tobias has garnered respect as an effective advocate and constructive mediator during his tenure at the NTEU. 
   Bob and his wife Susan reside in Bethesda, MD, and we are very proud to have them as residents of our State. However, Bob is a native of Michigan and received a bachelor's degree, as well as a master's degree, in business administration from the University of Michigan. Bob completed his education at George Washington University, where he received a law degree. He built upon his formal education with substantial legal experience as a labor relations specialist for General Motors Corporation in Detroit and with the Internal Revenue Service. 
   When Bob first joined the NTEU in 1968, he became its second staff employee. During his 31-year tenure at NTEU, Bob served the organization in numerous capacities and saw the staff grow to more than 100 members with seven field offices across the country. Now representing more than 150,000 Federal employees at the Internal Revenue Service, Customs Service, and other agencies, NTEU is a strong voice for public servants on Capitol Hill and with the other branches of Government. 
   Starting at NTEU as a staff attorney, Bob later served as general counsel and executive vice president, supervising a staff of 45 attorneys and field representatives nationwide, as well as the litigation and negotiations staff in the NTEU training program. His dedicated and skillful performance in these positions led to his election as President of NTEU in 1983 and his subsequent reelection on three occasions. 
   Under Bob's guidance, NTEU has been an influential voice for Federal employees and has waged many successful battles on their behalf. From challenging the line-item veto, to securing the right to picket for Federal employees, to obtaining the payment of over a half billion dollars in back pay from the Nixon administration, Bob Tobias has achieved wide-ranging victories for our public servants. 
   In addition to his talent for successful litigation, Bob Tobias has worked with the Government and its agencies to improve the status of Federal employees and to enhance their ability to serve the public. For example, he is credited with wide-ranging IRS reforms, rendering the tax-collecting organization a more efficient and responsive public agency. He is credited with instituting the first negotiated alternate work schedule for employees and the first cooperative labor management program for onsite child care. 
   Because of his extensive interaction with the agencies that employ Federal workers, Bob is highly regarded as an expert on how to improve Government. Many different organizations have sought out his expertise on these matters and, among others, Bob is now a member of the President's National Partnership Council, the Federal Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health, the Executive Committee of the Internal Revenue Service, and the American Arbitration Association. 
   Because of his dedicated leadership on behalf of our Federal workers, his consensus-building approach to Government reform, and the highly professional manner in which he carried out his work, Bob Tobias leaves a powerful and enduring legacy as President of the NTEU. I am pleased that he will continue in the public realm since he is planning a career in public policy teaching and writing. 
   Again, I congratulate Bob Tobias on his outstanding service at NTEU and his terrific record as a public servant on behalf of the American people, and I wish him all the best in the years ahead. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend my very able colleague from Illinois for his very eloquent remarks about this tragedy, and I associate myself with his remarks. Our hearts do go out to both families, the Kennedy family and the Bessette family. The Bessette family has lost two children. 
   My State has been fortunate to be blessed by the extraordinary leadership of the next generation of the Kennedy family in terms of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who now serves as our lieutenant governor. So I have a direct sense of the strong responsibility of dedicated public service which has marked this family from the very beginning. 
   All of us are deeply struck by this tragedy. Our hearts reach out to the families. We extend them our very heartfelt sympathies. We feel very deeply about our colleague, Senator KENNEDY, who, of course, has assumed the family leadership responsibilities. We have to press on, but it really comes as a very saddening tragedy for all of us. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding.

   Mr. SARBANES. I commend the Senator from Illinois. 
   We have a marvelous opportunity at this point, having come out of this deficit box as a consequence of the fiscal policies pursued by this administration, to reduce the national debt for the first time in a great number of years. Indeed, if we maintain proper discipline, we can in effect eliminate the national debt for the first time since the first part of the 19th century. 
   All of that is at risk of loss, as the Washington Post says, because of the ``egregious recklessness of the Republican proposal'' which goes way out to the extreme. 
   I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed at the end of this discussion.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has pointed out very carefully, first of all, this is an exploding tax cut. The cost of this tax cut escalates very quickly as time goes by. While the projections are over the first 10 years, in the second 10 years it virtually triples in terms of cost. 
   Secondly, it is premised on the proposition there will be about a 20-percent cut in existing programs; Head Start, VA medical care, title I for the disadvantaged--all the investments we need to make for the future strength of our country. The Republican appropriations bills are zeroing out the COPS program which is putting community police on the streets all across America and bringing down the crime rate. 
   Thirdly, it does not adequately provide for Medicare. In fact, it doesn't provide at all for Medicare looking out into the future. 
   The real question is whether we are going to take advantage of this opportunity to exercise a responsible fiscal policy. Furthermore, if we start stimulating the economy with a tax cut at the very time that we have gotten unemployment down to 4.2 percent--an unprecedented low level, the best in the last 30 years--then we are going to run the risk that we will start pressure on prices, have an inflation problem, and the Federal Reserve will start raising the interest rates. 
   In fact, at the last Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve raised the interest rates a quarter of a point. If the Republicans controlling the Congress start stimulating the economy, you can assume that the Fed will take up these interest rates in order to dampen down economic activity, and we will be right back in the box with a problem we had in terms of how to encourage economic growth and have a responsible economic policy. We have done a good job.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as the Senator from Illinois pointed out, in 1993 when we enacted the President's economic program, not one single person from the other side of the aisle supported that program. Not only did they not support the program, they made all sorts of dire predictions of what would happen to the Nation's economy. In the debate on this floor, Members stood up and it was as though the sky was going to fall in if this program was carried through. 
   Only a few have been willing subsequently to own up to the inaccuracy of their prediction--only a few. The others sort of, I guess, forget they ever made the prediction. But the fact of the matter is, the policy has worked extraordinarily well: Unemployment at a 30-year low; inflation at a 30-year low; we have come out of deficit and into surplus. Now we have the opportunity to move ahead in a responsible manner, not in an egregiously reckless manner, as the Washington Post points out in this editorial. 
   So I commend my colleague from Illinois for his comments. This is an extremely important decision we are about to make in terms of the future course of this Nation. If we make it responsibly, we can continue on the path of prosperity. We can continue to invest in the future strength of our country through education, research and development, and developing our Nation's infrastructure, our transportation, and our communication infrastructure. We can shore up the Social Security system. We can address the problems of Medicare. We can bring down the debt. We can even do targeted tax measures to help middle-income people and to help improve and increase productivity in our Nation. All of those are possible. 
   But things must be done in moderation. We cannot go to extremes, and the Republican proposal is an extreme proposal. Subjected to analysis, it does not stand up. We must not go down that path. I commend the Senator from Illinois for making that point so effectively here on the floor this morning.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, twenty-five years ago on this day, Turkish troops began their brutal assault on the people of Cyprus, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee their homes and villages. Less than a month later, after a cease-fire had been accepted and negotiations toward peaceful resolution of the conflict were proceeding under United Nations auspices, Turkey sent another, even larger occupation force of 40,000 troops and 200 tanks, seizing more than a third of the island. For the last quarter of a century, Turkish military forces have illegally occupied the northern part of the island, forcibly dividing it. Communities have been splintered, lives shattered, a nation deprived of its cultural heritage and the opportunity to live in peace. 
   The events of 1974 took a harsh toll on the people of Cyprus that remains with us to this day. Hundreds of thousands of Cypriots who fled advancing troops remain refugees in their own land, unable to return to the homes and the communities they inhabited for generations. Others have been stranded in tiny enclaves, deprived of the most basic human rights, forbidden to travel or worship freely. The beautiful coastal resort of Famagusta lies emply, bearing silent witness to what once was an economic and cultural center of the island. The Green Line runs like a jagged scar across the face of Cyprus. An entire generation has grown up in the shadow of military occupation, knowing only division and despair. 
   It is time for the world to recognize, however, that the Cyprus problem is more than just a humanitarian tragedy. As we have seen in Bosnia and Kosovo, when the suffering of a people puts peace and stability at risk, we also have a strategic interest in facilitating a negotiated settlement. And as long as the Cyprus problem divides not only a country, but two of our key NATO allies, the United States must work to help find a solution. The success of the UN peacekeepers should not for a minute obscure the real threat of conflict in the region. Cyprus can be either a spark to confrontation or the starting point for reconciliation, and we have a hard-headed security interest in seeing it resolved. 
   In one of the tragic ironies of this situation, the man who ordered the invasion is once again Prime Minister of Turkey. On this sad anniversary, we ask the President to call upon Mr. Ecevit to assume the mantle of statesmanship and acknowledge that the status quo is not acceptable. The Turkish government must demonstrate its willingness to help rectify this continuing injustice and to participate in good faith in U.S. and U.N.-mediated efforts to resolve it. The current situation hurts not only Greek and Turkish Cypriots but Turkey itself, and its relations with the United States and the international community. 
   I am pleased to say that the Clinton administration has kept the Cyprus issue high on the international agenda, raising it at every appropriate opportunity and assigning some of their most capable diplomats to work toward a settlement. I would particularly like to recognize the work of Dick Holbrooke and Tom Miller in this regard. Although Tom has just been sworn in as our new Ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Dick, I hope, will soon be confirmed as our Permanent Representative to the United Nations, they have played an invaluable role in demonstrating the seriousness of this administration in bringing peace and justice to this troubled island. 
   In recent weeks there has been increased international attention focused on the Cyprus problem, and a greater sense of urgency in bringing the two sides together. The G-8 for the first time has dealt with the Cyprus problem in a direct and substantive way, urging the UN Secretary General, in accordance with relevent Security Council resolutions, to invite the leaders of the two sides to comprehensive negotiations without preconditions in the fall of 1999. Unfortunately, thus far, Mr. Denktash, the leader of the Turkish-Cypriot community, has sent a negative message on his participation in such talks. 
   Less than a month ago the UN Security Council endorsed the G-8 leaders' appeal and reaffirmed its position that ``a Cyprus settlement must be based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international personality and a single citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded, and comprising two politically equal communities as described in the relevant Security Council resolutions, in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation, and that such a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession.'' Such a resolution, according to the G-8, ``would not only benefit all the people of Cyprus, but would also have a positive impact on peace and stability in the region.'' 
   Mr. President, the division of Cyprus has gone on far too long. I want to take this opportunity to commend the thousands of friends and supporters of a free  and unified Cyprus who joined hands around the Capitol today. As we commemorate this tragic anniversary, let us salute their courage and redouble our own efforts to help bring an end to this terrible and continuing injustice.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senators ROBB, WARNER and MIKULSKI, as an original co-sponsor of these two measures providing the additional financing necessary for the replacement of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. The proposed $600 million in new funding authorized in these measures, combined with the $900 million already made available under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), will enable us to move ahead with constructing this vital link in our region's and nation's transportation system. 
   Mr. President, everyone who commutes to work in the Washington Metropolitan area or who travels on Interstate 95 knows what a serious traffic and safety problem we have in the area of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. The bridge is one of the worst bottlenecks on the interstate system. It is carrying traffic volumes far in excess of its designed capacity. Originally constructed in 1961 to carry 70,000 vehicles per day, the bridge now averages 176,000 vehicles daily. It is rapidly approaching the end of its service life. In fact in 1994, the Federal Highway Administration determined that due to the age of the facility, the structural deterioration and traffic demand, the existing bridge would not last much beyond 2004 even with additional repairs. The substandard condition of the bridge and resulting congestion means accidents-- at a rate of twice that for other segments of the Capital Beltway--and significant delays for commuters, interstate truckers, tourists, businesses and employers alike. With traffic volumes in the area projected to nearly double in the next 20 years, there has been a clear need to address this problem. 
   In 1996, after many years of intensive study, the Wilson Bridge Coordination Committee, comprised of federal, state and local officials, recommended a 12-lane drawbridge and reconstructing approaches and adjacent interchanges as the preferred alternative for the replacement structure, at an estimated cost of $1.6 billion. Since then, there has been much discussion and debate about the size and cost of the facility as well as how the new bridge would be paid for and I would like to make several points: 
   First, the project is a federal responsibility. The bridge is owned by the Federal government. In fact, it is the only federally-owned bridge on the interstate system. Funding provided for it should be commensurate with the federal ownership of the bridge. 
   Second, the replacement bridge must be built in accordance with the same standards as applied to bridges owned by state jurisdictions. Just replacing the existing structure is not an acceptable option because it would continue the current bottleneck at the bridge and because it would not meet the Federal Highway Administration's own guidelines which require states in building new structures to meet projected future carrying capacity needs. This means the replacement structure must be able to accommodate current as well as projected future traffic growth and that the related interchanges and approaches to the bridge should match the new bridge. It should also provide for pedestrian and bicycle access as well as accommodate future transit useage. What is needed is not a quick fix that we will have to revisit in several years, but a long term solution that will carry us well into the next century. 
   Third, we should not lose sight of the fact that if a replacement is not undertaken in the very near future, it will be necessary to impose significant restrictions on the use of the existing bridge and this will have enormous economic and transportation related consequences throughout the entire region. 
   Last year we took a significant step forward in replacing the Woodrow Wilson Bridge by authorizing $900 million in new contract authority in TEA-21. The legislation which we are introducing today, when enacted, will help ensure that the federal responsibility to this bridge is met, and that it will meet the region's needs as we move into the next century. 
   I want to commend Secretary Slater and his staff at the Department of Transportation for their support and assistance in developing this legislation and I urge my collegues to join me in supporting this measure.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week the Senate is finally addressing an issue that is vitally important to the American people--managed health care reform. 
   The number of Americans who receive health care through managed care organizations continues to increase at a rapid rate. Today, approximately 75 percent of those with employer-provided health insurance are covered by managed care plans. 
   Although managed care was put forth as promoting both greater efficiency and higher quality health care, all too often the lure of greater profits has resulted in curtailing care to patients dependent on managed plans for their medical needs. The American people are rightly demanding more patient protections, and it is clearly time for Congress to act to guarantee all Americans certain fundamental rights regarding their health care coverage. 
   The Democrats in both the House and Senate have worked hard to convince the Republican Majority of the need to establish safeguards for patients in managed care. For a long time the Majority chose to ignore the patients' plight and refused to acknowledge the need for any patient protections at all. Last Congress we proposed a comprehensive set of reforms designed to ensure that patients receive the care they have been promised and have paid for. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this Democratic bill again this Congress. 
   After seeing how the public responded to this Democratic initiative, the Republican Majority did draft a managed care reform bill. But, unfortunately their bill calls for only the most minimal reforms; in many respects it is a sham. In addition, until this week, they persisted in blocking the issue from being brought up on the floor. 
   However, the Democrats joined together in insisting that the needs of managed care patients be given careful consideration. After much hard work by the Minority leader and others, an agreement was reached under which patients' rights legislation could be brought up on the Senate floor this week. 
   The debate which has taken place highlights the difference between the Democratic and the Republican approaches to this issue. The Democrats seek to provide comprehensive coverage and protections; the Republicans are minimalist in both respects. Let us look at some of the differences: the Democrats' bill would protect all 161 million Americans with private insurance; the Republican proposal ignores the over 113 million people who work for other than the large self-insured employers, or State or local governments, or who buy their own insurance. 
   Our bill would guarantee basic patient protections to all consumers of private health insurance. The Republican proposal would cover only the employees of businesses that assume the risk of self-insuring their employees. Thus, the Republican bill leaves out more than 70 percent of the consumers of private health insurance. 
   The Democrats' bill provides patients with access to specialists, whereas the  Republican bill is woefully inadequate in this regard. For those who are seriously or chronically ill, receiving treatment from a qualified medical specialist can mean the difference between life and death. Our Patients' Bill of Rights would guarantee that patients with special conditions could go to providers with the expertise needed to treat their particular problems, even if the needed specialist was not a member of a plan's provider network. Under the Republican bill, patients are not guaranteed access to the specialists they need and could be charged exorbitant fees for going to an out-of-network provider--even if the plan may be at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists. 
   The Democratic bill would prevent HMOs from arbitrarily interfering with doctors' treatment decisions whereas the Republican bill does not address this issue at all. The Republicans claim that our provision would allow doctors to order unnecessary care, but that is not the case. Under our bill, an insurer could still challenge a doctor's recommendation, but their denial of coverage would have to be based on medical facts not on their bottom line. 
   The Democratic bill would restore patients' ability to trust that their health care provider's advice is driven solely by health concerns, not cost concerns. It would prohibit the coercive practices used by managed care companies to restrict which treatment options doctors may discuss with their patients. The Republican bill would allow HMOs to continue terminating health care providers for having frank and candid doctor-patient communications and would allow HMOs to continue using incentives to bias a doctor's medical decision-making. 
   Managed care companies regularly refuse to pay for emergency room services without prior authorization. This unreasonable requirement has caused countless tragedies as people are forced to waste critical time finding an emergency room their HMO will pay for. 
   One of my constituents recently experienced this shocking treatment from an HMO. While hiking in the Shenandoah Mountains, she fell off a 40-foot cliff. She sustained fractures to her arms, pelvis, and skull but was quickly airlifted to a hospital in Virginia. Her HMO refused to pay the over $10,000 in hospital bills because she failed to gain ``pre-authorization'' for her emergency room visit. For over a year, she challenged her HMO and faced personal bankruptcy. Ultimately, the Maryland Insurance Administration ordered the insurer to pay the hospital and fined them for refusing to pay from the outset. However, her struggles with the HMO were not yet over. Within a year, after follow-up surgery for her injuries, she found herself again in need of an emergency room. This time she called the HMO beforehand, but was told they would pay only for her screening fees because the visit was not considered a medical emergency. 
   The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights would guarantee that patients could go to the nearest emergency room during a medical emergency without having to call their health plan for permission first. Patients would have the right to receive the medical care they need without the limitations currently imposed by HMOs. The Republicans, on the other hand, would not guarantee patients access to the nearest emergency room and would not ensure that patients could receive full medical care without prior authorization. 
   Our bill would also provide patients with meaningful recourse if they are harmed by a managed care plan's medical decision-making. Today, there is nothing to discourage HMOs from denying critically necessary care. Thus, our bill creates a fair, independent, and timely appeals process through which patients could challenge a plan's denial of care. Under the Republican bill, HMOs could delay the appeals process indefinitely and many HMO decisions could not be appealed at all. Furthermore, where the Republican bill is silent, our bill would enable those harmed by the medical-decision making of HMOs to hold those HMOs legally accountable for second-guessing the advice of a treating physician. The Republican plan would continue to shield HMOs from accountability for conduct that results in injury or death to patients. 
   The American people need a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. That is why I strongly support the Democratic proposal put forward by Senator DASCHLE.

   Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator from New York has again emphasized an extremely important point. People watching this debate have to understand, we have had these amendments arguing about what practice should be covered--what practice should be covered. So we have an important difference there. But the fact of the matter is, under the Republican proposal, no matter what practice is covered, it is only going to reach less than 30 percent of the people. 
   For the remainder, the other 70 percent, the 113 million, this debate for them is completely irrelevant because they are not going to be covered at all. So all of this other argument about whether you cover this procedure or that procedure--which I think are extremely important arguments in and of themselves, and important issues--but unless we deal with this issue of coverage, which is the sharpest contrast between the two proposals, well over 70 percent of the people are simply going to be left out altogether. Is that not correct?

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong opposition to the amendment offered to this legislation by my colleague from Kansas, Senator BROWNBACK. I am supportive of the amendment offered by the chairman of the subcommittee to the Brownback amendment, the second-degree amendment. But I want to address the Brownback amendment for just a few minutes here. In the course of doing that, I will underscore why I am supportive of the chairman's amendment and why I oppose the Brownback amendment. 
   The Brownback amendment is similar to legislation that was considered by the Foreign Relations Committee in May. That bill was reported out on a voice vote, but six members of the committee--six members--joined in submitting minority views in opposition to several of its major provisions. It had been my expectation that if this issue were to come up, it would come up in the course of calling up that bill, which is on the calendar, has been reported out of committee. That is the normal way one would expect to deal with substantive legislation. 
   What we are confronted with here is an effort to attach this amendment to an appropriations bill. Of course, we all know the problems that are connected with doing that. It slows down the appropriations process. You often engage in major issues of substantive content, which really ought to involve the substantive committees, and, instead, it is shifted into the appropriations context. One would have to be naive not to appreciate that it is done on occasion, but I don't think it is a good idea. 
   I must say, my view here on this matter is, in part, influenced by that. In other words, it is not as though the bill that came out of committee, which we considered and debated, on which we had a vote and on which some of us were in the minority, the bill went out, and it has been placed on the calendar. It is not as if that bill is before us--substantive legislation. Instead, what we have now is an amendment that takes most of the content of that bill and seeks to add it as an amendment to the appropriations bill. 
   This isn't an amendment that deals with numbers and figures. It is not, in effect, an amendment that falls clearly within the bailiwick of the appropriators. This is an amendment that really deals with a very important substantive issue of national policy. Senator BROWNBACK proposes to change it, to take out of the law a provision that is now in the law. I think it is very important to understand that. In other words, the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Kansas would make a major alteration in existing law, and it would seek to do it, as I have indicated, in the context of considering the appropriations legislation. 
   I can remember a time in this body where efforts to do that alone were reason enough to oppose an amendment. It was not too long ago. In other words,  efforts to really put in the appropriations context major changes in substantive law would be met with the contention that this should be dealt with by the substantive committee and ought not to be intruded into the appropriations process, that we should not ``legislate on an appropriations bill.'' How many times have we heard that phrase? 
   Particularly, it seems to me when the legislation is on the calendar, it is available at an appropriate time to be considered by this body, in the proper context, where we could have the major debate, which I think this provision requires with respect to the substance of U.S. policy. 
   Now, one of the things this proposed amendment does, which represents a major shift in policy, is the impact it would have on section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, which addresses the question of government-to-government aid to Azerbaijan, so long as they maintain a blockade on Armenia. Section 907 precludes such aid. 
   This amendment, in effect, would remove that provision in the law. To the credit of the chairman of the committee, he has offered an amendment that would knock out that provision. If that were to prevail, it would significantly reduce my concerns about this amendment, although I have some other concerns, not of the same magnitude as this one. 
   Let me address a couple of questions here. Section 907, in my judgment, made sense when it was enacted, and it continues to make sense today. To waive it in the absence of any progress toward a lifting of the blockade would reward the Government of Azerbaijan for its intransigence and remove a major incentive for good-faith negotiations from one side in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
   For nearly a decade, the Government of Azerbaijan has prevented the transport of food, fuel, medicine--let me repeat that--food, fuel, medicine, and other vital commodities to Armenia and to Nagorno-Karabakh, causing immense human suffering. During winters, much of the Armenian population has had to live without heat, electricity, or water. Schools and hospitals have been unable to function, and most Armenian industries have been forced to close down, crippling the economy and producing widespread unemployment and poverty. 
   Think of this. Azerbaijan is imposing a blockade on Armenia --total: no food, no fuel, no medicines. The blockade has been particularly devastating because a similar restriction is imposed by Turkey on traffic to Armenia and because of the civil conflict that makes transport through Georgia difficult. Since Armenia is entirely landlocked, they are left with hardly any alternative. They have a small border with Iran; but, of course, that is the very outcome we do not want to encourage in terms of where they turn for supplies. 
   This law was written in an effort to move the countries toward negotiating a peaceful resolution of their disputes. All Azerbaijan must do to get section 907 lifted is--and I quote this under existing law--``take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.'' 
   Again, they must ``take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.'' 
   This is an entirely reasonable expectation, especially given the ostensible purpose of the amendment which the Senator from Kansas has offered, which is ``to promote trade and commerce and economic cooperation between the countries of the region.'' 
   He wants to promote trade and commerce amongst the countries of the region, and yet Azerbaijan is maintaining this embargo, which precludes any such trade with Armenia. 
   The Government of Azerbaijan continues to thwart U.S. attempts to promote peaceful conflict resolution and regional economic integration. Although a cease-fire has been in effect in Nagorno-Karabakh since 1994, Azerbaijan has not moved to lift the economic blockade. It is also seeking to exclude Armenia from all East-West commercial corridors. 
   Let me be very clear what the existing law, section 907, limits or retains, because this is an effort to apply in a nuance way an incentive, or a subtle pressure, to try to move the parties in the region towards a peaceful resolution of their dispute. 
   We are not talking about commercial trade. Some people refer to this provision as an ``economic sanction.'' Let's examine that. 
   The provision of the existing law, section 907, prohibits direct U.S. Government aid to Azerbaijan as long as they maintain this blockade. The proposed amendment would lift that. So the aid could be given even though they maintain the blockade, which, as I have indicated, I think would be a terrible step, a very harmful, substantive policy decision. 
   We are not talking about commercial trade, which is usually where you debate economic sanctions. In fact, the United States has perfectly normal trade relationships with Azerbaijan. To the extent that U.S. companies may not be investing there, it is due to that country's economic and political instability, its corruption, and to the low price of oil--not due to a lack of U.S. taxpayer assistance. 
   In fact, under the existing law, Azerbaijan receives U.S. assistance. It gets $24 million in economic assistance, which will bring it to a total of over $100 million since 1994. Because section 907, as it is now written in the law, does not apply to the Trade and Development Agency, the Export-Import Bank, to OPIC, to humanitarian assistance, to the foreign and commercial services, to activities to support democracy, nonproliferation, and disarmament, or aid through nongovernmental organizations, all of those activities can take place now under existing 907. 
   So what 907 does in order to attempt to exercise a certain amount of influence in how matters progress in that area is restrict the direct government-to-government assistance. Assistance through aid through nongovernmental organizations is not touched. Even some government assistance, if it goes to support democracy, nonproliferation, and disarmament, can take place.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. This body has responded in the past. The argument was, well, if you just give some carrot, you would see some change in behavior. 
   When we first started out with 907, it was much more restrictive. Over the passage of time, these various exceptions have been put into the law. But we have retained a more limited number of restrictions. To move them now altogether--I mean the ball game is over with. Why should Azerbaijan be concerned to settle anything? 
   Some say, well this somehow is a sanction. What we are talking about here is whether U.S. direct foreign assistance will be made available. Foreign assistance is not an entitlement. I want to repeat that. Foreign assistance is not an entitlement. 
   I hope people aren't going to get up on the floor and say: Well, somehow there is some kind of entitlement and, therefore, Azerbaijan is entitled to get foreign assistance. The placing of conditions upon foreign aid is both reasonable and appropriate for policy as well as budgetary reasons. It is a standard procedure. Conditions should not be considered sanctions. They ensure that U.S. aid serves U.S. interests. 
   I doubt seriously, if Members would stop and really focus on it, that there would be any Member of this body who would suggest that we should give foreign aid regardless of the recipient's policies and actions; that somehow they have an entitlement claim to foreign assistance, and, therefore, there can be no conditions, or no restrictions placed on it, and regardless of what the recipient's policies and actions are, we need to provide that assistance. 
   Let me turn to Azerbaijan's performance in the peace process, because there is a peace process underway. Conceivably, if Armenia was blocking the  peace process and Azerbaijan was cooperating with it, one could come along and say: Well, we have to make some accommodation to Azerbaijan because they are now working with the peace process. 
   It is exactly the opposite. That peace process has been stalled since November when Azerbaijan, the very country that this amendment now seeks to free of any limitations on American foreign assistance, when Azerbaijan unilaterally rejected a compromise proposal put forward by the cochairs of the OSCE's so-called Minsk Group--Russia, France, and the United States. The OSCE has established a Minsk Group that is chaired by Russia, France, and the United States as cochairs, and they have been trying to develop a peace process to resolve this matter between Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Azerbaijan. 
   In November of 1998, the Minsk Group called for a common state of Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. The so-called common state approach was accepted by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh as the basis for negotiations among the parties in spite of the serious reservations which were held by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
   This is a proposal that the Minsk Group put to the parties in order to advance the peace process. Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, with concerns, nevertheless, accepted this development as a way of going forward with the direct negotiations. 
   Azerbaijan summarily rejected the peace plan, threatened to overturn the cease-fire, which has been in effect, and then complained about the delay in finding a resolution to the conflict, and recently--from reliable reports--Azerbaijan has provoked a series of armed incidents along the cease-fire line. 
   Furthermore, in addition to rejecting the peace plan, Azerbaijan objected to Armenia's proposals to foster regional cooperation through open borders and restoration of rail and road links in the Caucasus. Armenia's proposal was set out at the Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus and Asia Conference held in Azerbaijan in September of 1998, but Azerbaijan refused to recognize any of these rights or obligations insofar as they applied to Armenia. 
   I want to underscore not only this recalcitrance but this absolute repudiation of the peace process, of this effort by the Minsk Group--headed by France, Russia, and the United States, the three cochairs--to try to develop a peace process to resolve this situation in the Caucasus. Azerbaijan has refused to participate. 
   Do not forget how the war started. After years of denying the people of Nagorno-Karabakh their constitutional rights and freedom, the government of Azerbaijan undertook a massive military offensive against Nagorno-Karabakh in the winter of 1993 to 1994. Although Azerbaijan launched the attacks, they encountered a better organized defense and were forced to negotiate a cease-fire, which has been in effect since May of 1994. As I indicated earlier, they threatened to overturn that cease-fire recently when they rejected the proposal of the Minsk Group. 
   In the face of this behavior, it is now proposed by an amendment to lift the remaining few limitations on direct American foreign assistance to Azerbaijan. Obviously, Azerbaijan wants a completely normal relationship with the United States, but in a ``prod'' for them to rectify this situation and to give us a more stable, peaceful environment, that remains one of the prods we ought not give away. 
   The waiving of section 907 of the Freedom Support Act would reward the party that has been intransigent in peace negotiations and has actually thwarted legitimate aspirations for democracy and justice in the region. 
   I intend later to go into some detail with respect to the human rights practices in Azerbaijan, taken, of course, from the human rights report of the Department of State, the annual report that is made on human rights conditions in various countries around the world. I know there are others who want to speak, so I don't propose to do that right now. If we are seriously entertaining the prospect of changing this law, lifting the remaining limitations that are provided by section 907, obviously one of the things we must do is examine the human rights practices of the country that is going to be freed from these limitations. 
   Let me read one paragraph from the State Department report, in lieu of a more complete exposition of this situation, which is what I hope to do later. This will give some sense of the problem.  
   Azerbaijan is a republic with a presidential form of government. Heydar Aliyev, who assumed presidential powers after the overthrow of his democratically elected predecessor in 1993, was reelected in October in a controversial election marred by numerous, serious irregularities, violations of the election law, and lack of transparency in the vote counting process at the district and national levels. President Aliyev and his supporters, many from his home region of Nakhchivan, continue to dominate the Government and the multiparty 125-member Parliament chosen in the flawed 1995 elections. The Constitution, adopted in a 1995 referendum, established a system of government based on a division of powers between a strong presidency, a legislature with the power to approve the budget and impeach the President, and a judiciary with limited independence. The judiciary does not function independently of the executive branch and is corrupt and inefficient.  
   Later the report goes on to detail numerous human rights abuses on the part of the police, the ministry of internal affairs, and the ministry of national security. As this debate progresses, I will seek to develop those points in order to make it clear that certainly the human rights record doesn't warrant eliminating the limitation. Certainly, the support of the peace process doesn't warrant what this amendment proposes to do. Certainly, the nature of the blockade which they have imposed, which goes to humanitarian goods and services as well as everything else, doesn't warrant lifting the amendment. 
   The amendment, obviously, raises very difficult questions. It represents a major departure in substance in terms of our policy. I know the chairman has an amendment which will knock out this provision as it affects section 907. I am very supportive of that. I hope that will carry. 
   In any event, I am very much opposed to the amendment. I am frank to say I don't think we should be dealing with this amendment on an appropriations bill.

   Mr. SARBANES. I think we will have eliminated the last prod that we have to try to get them to settle the war and enter into a more normal, peaceful trading and commercial relationship with Armenia. 
   It is an irony that this amendment, this Silk Road Act, is supposedly to encourage commerce and trade amongst the countries in the region but that it has a repeal of 907 for one of the countries that is imposing a blockade on such trade and commerce with its neighbor. 
   It makes absolutely no sense. It runs counter to the announced objective of the legislation and of the amendment. We have a situation where we have a cease-fire, we have a Minsk process in action. We have a proposal submitted by the three cochairs. Azerbaijan rejected it. An effort is being made to revisit that, to try to move that situation forward. 
   I think to come in with this amendment at this time is certainly not going to help the peace process.

   Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. The really discouraging thing was that the Minsk people made the proposal. That is the United States, France, and Russia, speaking on behalf of the OSCE. And Azerbaijan rejected participating in that process. Had Azerbaijan accepted it and Armenia rejected it, I can imagine people would say, Azerbaijan is trying to make the peace process work, Armenia is blocking it, and we ought to go ahead and enter into this normal relationship with Azerbaijan. But that was not the case. 
   Second--I will detail it later--to some extent I am reluctant to detail the human rights performance, because one does not like to come on the floor of the Senate and go into a lengthy exposition of that issue. We want people to improve. When we do these human rights reports, we try to not, as it were, overload them. But now when you offer an amendment that is going to take out the last limitation we have on aid, it seems to me at a minimum it warrants a very careful examination of the human rights performance within Azerbaijan. I am frank to tell you I think, once we undertake to do that, most Members are going to have increasingly growing questions about the nature of this regime and about whether we should be trying now to repeal any limitations on providing assistance which could serve as a way to try to get a better performance. 
   I have gone on for some time. I see my colleague from Michigan has been on the floor waiting patiently. I will come back, obviously, and revisit this issue; particularly, if necessary, to get into this human rights discussion. 
   As you know, each year the State Department puts out a country report on human rights practices. This one is for 1998. This is in accordance with legislation enacted by the Congress. There is a lengthy section in here on Azerbaijan, which I think Members certainly ought to have in mind as they consider whether we should adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas which repeals section 907 of existing law. I want it to be very clearly understood, the amendment that has been offered makes a very significant change in existing law, and the second-degree amendment offered by the chairman of the committee would take out the provision that is most offensive in that regard, and that is the proposal of the Senator from Kansas to in effect give up an open waiver on section 907, thereby in effect providing for its repeal. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I bring to the Senator's attention a statement that was adopted on April 15 of this year by 23 political parties in Azerbaijan that are members of the movement for electoral reform and democratic elections. These are the major opposition parties in Azerbaijan. Listen to this:  
   The existing Government of Azerbaijan, having usurped powers as a result of a plot in 1993, created an antidemocratic regime in the country, violated human rights and freedoms, performed brutal repressive policies against political parties and opposition forces, pursued and jailed hundreds of citizens for political reasons, falsified presidential elections, remained indifferent to the assassination of deputies of the people, brought social economic conditions of the population down to a deep precipice, illegally redirected credits from foreign countries for their own purposes, failed to achieve significant improvements in the oil industry, created conditions for the session of some already-signed oil contracts, misappropriated industrial enterprises and violated the labor rights of hundreds of thousands of citizens, substantially destroyed the industrial potential of the country, brought agriculture to a disastrous state, created conditions where a selected group of individuals accumulate state property in their hands but conceal it under the name of reforms, raise corruption and bribery to historically high levels and, thus, brought many sectors of the life of the country to a state of catastrophe.  
   Then they talk later--I am not going to quote it all--about the cruel pressure of the Government against the free and independent mass media, how citizens were illegally arrested for participating in election rallies and sentenced to jail terms. 
   Imagine the courage it took to make this statement. And now the Congress of the United States is going to come along and repeal section 907? What message does that send to these brave people who are challenging their own authoritarian government on its practices? 
   The Senator is absolutely right. It would send absolutely the wrong message; would it not?

   Mr. SARBANES. The argument the Senator made about trying to move forward was responded to by the committee in the past with the Exim exception, with the OPIC exception, with the encouraging democracy exception, all of the provisions that provide some aid. Now the Senator wants to lift any limitations altogether. I think any chance of getting this situation resolved will simply be gone. 
   I know the pressures that exist. The Silk Road strategy involves tremendous oil interests. We ought to put that out on the table, I guess. Someone ought to lay that out as an important consideration. But it ought not to result in overturning what has been an established policy in the way we are trying to do it today, particularly in a situation when, last fall, we thought we would be able to move this peace process. Had Azerbaijan participated in the peace process last fall, we would have been able to move forward. They refused to do so.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in light of the comments of the Senator from Texas, I want to reemphasize something I said earlier. Section 907 is not a sanction. There is no provision currently in place that prevents American companies from trading or doing commerce in Azerbaijan. The only thing section 907 limits is it doesn't allow foreign assistance direct from the U.S. Government to Azerbaijan unless Azerbaijan--listen to this --takes demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. So it is an absolute misrepresentation of the current situation to assert that this is a sanction. There are no trade sanctions. In fact, as the chairman of the subcommittee indicated, there are a number of Government programs that are operating in Azerbaijan. 
   The only thing not now permitted is direct foreign aid. There is not an entitlement to foreign aid. All we have said--I think, quite reasonably--is that you can't get any foreign aid unless you take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia. That is what 907 provides. 
   Why should we give them foreign aid and allow them to continue the blockade? We want the blockade to cease.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Ambassador James Sasser, our former colleague from Tennessee, who served in this body as a distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He is returning from his post in the People's Republic of China where he has been the U.S. Ambassador since 1995. He has done an outstanding job during a challenging period in our relations with China. 
   Having had the honor to serve with Jim for 18 years in the Senate, I know him to be a man of great insight, intellect, and integrity, a highly respected public servant. While he served in the Senate, his interests and work covered a broad range of domestic and foreign policy issues. As Senate Budget Committee chairman, his keen grasp of financial and budgeting issues enabled him to handle that assignment with tremendous skill under very difficult circumstances. Jim constantly showed great resolve in addressing measures to reduce our deficit. He was instrumental in helping lead our country on to a path which is reflected in today's budget surplus. 
   This dedication and commitment has characterized Jim's lifetime devotion to our country. His interests in public service began long before he was elected to the Senate. Jim's father, a public servant himself, instilled in Jim the principles of public service at an early  age. He served as a role model for Jim and set him on a course which he has followed with great distinction. 
   Throughout his career, Jim Sasser has demonstrated, both in spirit and in deed, his adherence to the ideals most important to this Nation. He is a shining example of how much one individual can contribute to our Nation's well-being. Jim's leadership has always been highly regarded and broadly respected. 
   Throughout his tenure as Ambassador to China, Jim has been confronted with many difficult aspects of the relationship. Jim's work has emphasized the importance of keeping the lines of communication open by regularizing our contacts with the current Chinese leadership and ensuring that we remain engaged in our bilateral relationship. Jim's longstanding commitment to the promotion of democratic principles and values has played an important role in helping shape his service to our country. 
   Jim Sasser has done a terrific job as our Ambassador to China, and I wish him well in all his future endeavors.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee. 
   I now will speak on the bill, which presents some difficult issues. Despite the chairman's accommodation--which is a step forward that I appreciate--I still plan to vote against the bill, as I did in the committee. I say to the chairman that this decision has been made more difficult for me because this bill is now being named after Admiral Nance. 
   I wish the substance of the bill were such that I could feel free to vote for it. Unfortunately, I do not. But I want to make it very clear that if I could have improved the substance enough, the fact that Admiral Nance's name is on this bill would have clearly moved me in the direction of voting for it. Hopefully, it will come back from conference in a somewhat better state, and I might be able to vote for it then. 
   I wanted to say this at the outset because I, like so many Members of this body, had enormous respect and affection for Admiral Bud Nance and for his commitment to our Nation, both in war and in peace. I saw that commitment every day after he joined the chairman in the workings of our committee. His contributions were widely recognized and he will be greatly missed. 
   This amendment, which we have now adjusted, was an effort to keep us from going further into arrears to the United Nations in the current year. Under the compromise, we will authorize the full amount this year for peacekeeping, but we still fall behind on the contributions to international organizations. 
   The bigger problem connected with the legislation is the proposed package to settle our past arrears to the United Nations, which unfortunately, has two major shortcomings. First of all, the total figure does not reach the level which our Government admits we owe, missing it by a little under $100 million if one includes debt relief. My second objection is that the money we do authorize has been heavily conditioned. 
   Let me just say at the outset that I believe important U.S. national interests are undermined by our continued failure to pay what we owe to the United Nations and its affiliated agencies. I know the chairman and the ranking member are trying to search for a solution to this problem. I respect their efforts. I just do not think they have gone far enough along this important path. 
   By refusing to meet our legal obligations while continually issuing new demands, we are wasting our own influence, damaging our credibility and international respect, engendering resistance to the reforms we seek, and complicating the U.N.'s ability to perform its duties in a timely and effective manner. In my view, we should pay our arrears promptly, in full, and without additional conditions. 
   Unfortunately, this legislation does not accomplish that objective. The United States acknowledges we owe $1.021 billion to the U.N. The U.N. says we owe $1.5 billion. This bill authorizes $819 million over 3 years, plus an additional $107 million in credit. Even the $819 million which is authorized will not be paid promptly and at once; it will be paid over a 3-year period. So we will still be almost $100 million short of our acknowledged obligations, far short of the U.N. figure, with no promise of ever paying it back. 
   Unfortunately, that puts us in the position of a permanent default, particularly when one realizes that the authorization for the current year falls short. The amendment we just adopted helps to correct that on the peacekeeping side, but it still leaves us $23 million short on regular dues to the United Nations. 
   Furthermore, the bill imposes a long list of arbitrary and burdensome conditions for paying even the reduced amount, to which I have just made reference. These conditions have not been negotiated with or agreed to by the United Nations. They are, in effect, unilaterally imposed by the United States. They are being imposed on past obligations, on money we had agreed to provide 
   without such stipulations. 
   The consequence of these arrears is that the U.N. has been unable to reimburse other countries for sending their troops on peacekeeping missions that the United States encouraged and endorsed. Other countries have put the lives of their own citizens on the line in order to accomplish mutually agreed objectives. The U.S. responsibility in most of those instances was to provide money to cover the missions they were performing for us and the entire world. Those missions have been accomplished. The bill has not been paid. 
   In addition, despite my amendment, this legislation creates new arrearages to the U.N., so not only do we fail to pay all the money we owe in arrears, not only do we establish preconditions for this partial payment, but we begin to build up new debts by authorizing less than is needed. 
   The agreement that was reached on the amendment addressed this in part. It provided the $235 million needed for assessed peacekeeping operations. The bill had $215 million. It still does not provide the full amount needed for assessed U.N. dues, falling short by $23 million. 
   I must say, if any other country delinquent in its obligations showed up with the demands we have placed in this legislation, lacking the intention of paying its debts in full and short of its current dues, we would be extremely upset at what we would regard as its audacity. Surely our friends and allies will have the same reaction to our conduct. 
   This approach runs counter to that reflected in the exercise of American leadership at the end of World War II, an approach that I think should characterize our policy toward the United Nations today. 
   It is my strongly held view that the interests of the United States have been served by our Nation's active participation in the United Nations and the U.N. system. Especially now, with the end of the cold war, the U.N. has a genuine opportunity to function as it was intended at the end of World War II, without the constant Soviet veto in the Security Council that effectively neutralized it for so many years. 
   The task facing us today is to assist the United Nations to adapt to the end of the cold war and the challenges of the new century. The need for the United Nations remains clear, for as then-Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright commented:  
   The battle-hardened generation of Roosevelt, Churchill and de Gaulle viewed the U.N. as a practical response to an inherently contentious world; a necessity not because relations among States could ever be brought into perfect harmony, but because they cannot.  
   This sense of realism seems absent from many of the current discussions of the United Nations. There has been a misperception that the U.N. can somehow dictate policies to the United States and force us to undertake actions that do not serve U.S. interests. This is simply not the case. Those who labored in San Francisco and elsewhere to create the United Nations some half a century ago insisted that the United Nations organization recognize the reality of great powers by granting significant authority to the Security Council. 
   In the Council, the United States and other major powers were given the veto power, thereby ensuring that the U.N. could not undertake operations which the United States opposed. Every U.N. peacekeeping operation requires prior approval by the United States. 
   Actually, by failing to meet our financial obligations, we are abdicating the powers available to us within the U.N. system. 
   We are, for example, in danger of losing our vote in the General Assembly, a status generally reserved for the world's lawless and pariah states. Since the General Assembly works on the basis of consensus, we are depriving  ourselves of the ability to press for needed reforms. 
   The influence we held in the past by our leadership, reflected in the large number of senior posts awarded to U.S. nationals, is being eroded and subjected to challenge. 
   As Ambassador Richardson explained in the course of his confirmation hearings to go to the U.N.--he, of course, is now Secretary of Energy--I quote him:  
   Growing resentment over our failure to pay our assessed dues and arrears has put our continued leadership and influence at risk....... [A]mong the members of the Geneva Group, composed of the U.N.'s largest contributors and a crucial source of support for U.N. reform, there is virtually no willingness to consider reductions in our dues for peacekeeping or the regular budget until we pay our arrears. If the United States fails to meet its financial commitments to the U.N. system, it will become increasingly difficult to set the U.N. priorities for the future and to ensure that qualified Americans serve in important U.N. posts.  
   Let me just talk a bit about how an effective U.N. serves U.S. interests. I believe, of course, that U.S. leadership is essential to an effective U.N. 
   Over the years, the U.N. has negotiated over 170 peaceful settlements across the globe--helping to end wars, uphold cease-fires, protect civilians, reintegrate refugees, oversee the conduct of free and fair elections, monitor troop withdrawals, and deter intercommunal violence. 
   From Iraq to Bosnia and Kosovo, assembling coalitions to repel aggression and keep peace would have been impossible without assistance and support from the United Nations. 
   In Haiti, the introduction of U.N. peacekeepers meant that U.S. troops could be extracted without condemning the country to chaos, while in Cyprus, the U.N. prevents an outbreak of hostilities that could lead to conflict between two NATO allies.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the arrears package in this bill is a significant step toward meeting our international obligations. But I am deeply troubled by its failure to authorize the full amount that United States itself admits we owe, let alone what the U.N. claims we owe. 
   Secondly, even making that money available, or any part of it, is very heavily conditioned in this legislation. In other words, we are saying to the U.N.: Yes, we are willing to pay some of what we owe, but in order to get any of this money, you will have to comply with a long list of conditions--several of which I think will be extremely difficult for them to meet. In any event, it is sort of a ``take it or leave it'' approach. This was not part of a negotiated agreement. We are going to approve the package and then present it to them. I think we may encounter a difficult reaction to this and see a continuing problem. 
   Third, as I indicated, even with the accommodation made on the amendment earlier, we still create new arrears. So it is not as though we are able to say to the U.N. that this is the package we propose for arrears and, in the future, we are not going to let this situation arise again. In other words, we aren't really on board here to meet our continuing obligations to the organization, which in substantial measure has been responsive to American interests. Instead, we are going to continue to go into arrears, extending the problem which has brought us to the impasse we now confront. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, we will be voting, as I understand it, on the amendment which I offered on Friday. The chairman at that time asked  if I could go ahead, and I indicated I could to try to move the bill along. 
   We have worked over the weekend. Staff has worked on this amendment and some modification was made in it which was earlier sent to the desk by the chairman of the committee. I thank the chairman and his staff and the ranking member and his staff for working on this. 
   Actually, the chairman and his people were reasonably trying to get at a problem. We have made an adjustment that makes it work. If a Foreign Service officer receives a suspension of more than 5 days, that fact will stay in his or her file until they next come up for promotion and for tenure. There would still be a minimum period when any suspension will be in the file, but beyond that period, the minor suspensions will drop out of the file. Any one that has been for more than 5 days will remain in the file. That is to get at a problem. 
   Staff said to me, on occasion we get reports on these people, and when we look into it, we discover there was a major suspension but this suspension dropped out of the person's record before they came up before a promotion board. People believe, in a case of something of more than 5 days, which obviously would be of some consequence, that it ought to remain in and not be excised from the record. We have made that adjustment. I thank the chairman and his people for their responsiveness. 
   The other amendment I believe was agreeable on Friday. That was on a grievance, where we took it back up from 1 year to 2 years. The committee had dropped it from 3 to 1 in terms of the period when an employee has to file a grievance. One year is tough, particularly if that person is overseas, because they do not get home leave except every 18 months. We took it back up to 2 years and made some other minor changes, and that is acceptable to the committee. I very much appreciate that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I hope the committee will find it possible to accept this amendment. I will very briefly describe it. 
   This amendment seeks to address two provisions in the bill which affect the rights of those who serve in the Foreign Service. The first problem deals with the time period given in order to file a grievance. Under the current system, employees have a period of 3 years to file a grievance; that is the current law, 3 years. The bill does two things: It reduces that period to 1 year. It will take away the employee's right, which was upheld by a 1989 decision by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board, to challenge an old evaluation that has been used against them. 
   It does two things. The amendment addresses those issues. It extends the period for filing a grievance to 2 years. In other words, the committee bill brings it down from 3 years to 1 year. We put it back up to 2 years. 
   Let me explain why I think this is important. Members of the Foreign Service have limited access to lawyers and personnel files while they are overseas. This amendment, moving the period back up to 2 years, gives them time to return to the United States on home leave, which they are entitled to only after they have been at their post for 18 months. They can come back on home leave in order to research and file their case. 
   If the grievance is against an employee's supervisor, the employee would have 1 year after he or she ceased to be supervised by that individual to file the grievance. I think the fairness of that is obvious on its face. 
   In addition--and this is a complicated, but I think important point--the amendment deletes the sentence that would preclude employees from grieving old evaluations used against them. Currently, promotion panels can reinterpret old reports to select out Foreign Service personnel using report statements which did not seem and were not intended at the time to be negative. The promotion panels can go back to these old reports and reinterpret them. 
   The bill, as it is written, eliminates the ability to challenge an old evaluation on the part of the employee. Civil service employees have this protection now. They can contest all bases cited for their termination, regardless of when the matter occurred. A Foreign Service employee should have the same due process rights. 
   In fact, following this 1989 decision to which I referred, the Foreign Service Association and the five foreign affairs agencies in the Government reached an agreement under which employees may contest records to the extent they are used as a basis for grievable actions taken against them. 
   Denying employees the ability to do that, among other things, would lead to filing unnecessary preemptive grievances for fear they would be used against them in the future. In other words, if you are going to say these old evaluations can't be ``grievanced,'' then it will serve as an incentive to contest more evaluations earlier. 
   This amendment restores the limited right, if an old evaluation is used to challenge it, and it would preclude the need for such preemptive grievances. 
   That is the first part of the amendment. It seems to me to make eminent good sense to do this. I have tried to take into account some of what the committee was seeking to accomplish. As I have indicated, we accept bringing the 3 years down, but we 
   think it should come down to 2. I think taking it to 1 is going too far. The employees overseas would have a difficult time because they don't get the home leave for 18 months. 
   The second part of the amendment relates to the length of time a disciplinary action stays in an employee's personnel file. Under the current system, a reprimand stays in the employee's file for 1 year and a suspension for 2 years. The bill would extend that period in all cases until the employee is tenured as a career member of the service or next promoted. In effect, you may significantly lengthen the time in which these disciplinary actions stay in the employee's file. 
   There is a balancing to be done because under the current system disciplinary records are removed from the file after 1 or 2 years, no matter how serious. Therefore, they are not always available to reviewers when a Foreign Service employee is considered for promotion. That is something we need to look at. I understand the committee was focused on that. 
   The bill attempts to rectify this problem by requiring all records of disciplinary action to remain in the employee's file until the employee is tenured or next promoted. The proposed change makes no distinction between a suspension of 1 day or 1 month, between a minor infraction or a major violation. By failing to differentiate between minor and major violations, this change could have the unintended effect either of extending the length of punishment beyond a reasonable time period or reducing the likelihood that appropriate disciplinary actions will be imposed in the first place. The disciplining authorities may forego imposing these actions in the more minor cases because they know these things will remain in the file perhaps for a long period--until tenure or the next promotion. 
   This part of the amendment requires the Director General of the Foreign Service to decide when taking a disciplinary action what length of time it should remain in the employee's record based on the seriousness of the violation. In no case, however, would the letter remain in the file less than 1 year for a reprimand or 2 years for a suspension. 
   So we set, as it were, a minimum requirement of 1 year for a reprimand and 2 years for a suspension. Beyond that, the Director General, at the time of the disciplinary action, could indicate the additional length of time, as it were, that the disciplinary action would remain in the employee's file. I think this accomplishes the purpose of distinguishing between major and minor infractions, in a sense. It does not put the minor infractions in there indefinitely or until tenure or promotion is reached, but it does permit the Director General, on the major infractions, to extend them beyond the minimum of 1 year for a reprimand or 2 years for a suspension. 
   In both instances here I have tried to take into account what I have perceived to be the concerns of the committee in including these provisions. Neither proposal, in effect, eliminates the committee provisions. It only seeks to modify them or to adjust them, and I think would make for a more equitable system. I very much hope the committee will find it possible to accept this amendment.

   Mr. SARBANES. Let me say to my distinguished colleague, I think we could work something out. I am not trying to create a situation in which the Director General can simply end up retaining the current system. Because, as I understand it, the committee's concern was that these disciplinary records were taken out of the file after 1 or 2 years, no matter how serious, and therefore they were not always available for review when a Foreign Service employee was considered for promotion. So the committee said, all right, we are going to keep it in the record until you are tenured or you are next promoted. 
   I think that is reasonable to do for serious violations, but I think we need to create a differentiation between serious violations and what would be minor infractions. But I think if we require regulations be proposed that would define that difference and that would be submitted to the committee, it seems to me maybe that would work it out in a way that is amenable to everyone.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, recently the Washington Post contained an article recognizing an innovative and successful approach to public housing in Baltimore, MD. Pleasant View Gardens, a new housing development, holds great promise as a new approach to public housing in the Nation. 
   The birth of this new project began in 1994, when the City of Baltimore in cooperation with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the State of Maryland, made funds available for the demolition of Lafayette Courts and began the process of replacing it with the new Pleasant View Gardens. As the Washington Post reported, high rise buildings in the ``densest tract of poverty and crime in [Baltimore] city'' have been replaced by low-rise, low density public housing where in the evenings you hear ``the murmur of children playing on the jungle gym at sunset,.....police officers [chat] with residents..[and] the street corners [are] empty.'' Residents who once referred to their housing as a ``cage,'' now allow their children to play outside.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on May 24, 1924, President Calvin Coolidge signed into law the Rogers Act, establishing a unified corps of career diplomats to represent the United States abroad. Based on the principles of professionalism, non-partisanship and merit-based promotion, thus was born the modern foreign service. 
   This year we join in commemorating the 75th anniversary of the foreign service. Over the years there have been many changes: it has become more diverse, more specialized, and has been called to deal with an ever-expanding list of issues. While this milestone is an occasion for celebration and congratulations, there are some sobering reminders of the task that still awaits us. 1998 saw the worst attack on American diplomats in history, with two tragic bombings that resulted in the deaths of over 220 persons, twelve of them Americans. Here in Washington, we continue to contend with budget cuts that handicap the ability of our foreign service officers to perform their duties safely and effectively.

   Mr. SARBANES. I wish to associate myself with the statements of my colleague, Senator Bryan, the author of the amendment adopted by the Banking Committee. My understanding in voting for his amendment was that it codified the Barnett Bank standard for preemption of State laws. The Committee Report accompanying S. 900 seeks to amplify, or put a gloss on, the Barnett Bank standard. I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada whether the gloss put on the ``prevent or significantly interfere'' standard in the Committee Report is in keeping with his amendment.

   Mr. SARBANES. I would like to point out that the language of the amendment offered by my colleague from Nevada was previously explained in the Report of the Banking Committee that accompanied H.R. 10 last year. For State laws that fall outside the 13-point safe harbor, the bill does not limit in any way the application of the Supreme Court's Barnett Bank decision. State laws outside the safe harbor could be challenged under that decision. This year's Committee Report incorrectly describes the standard that State laws must meet under Barnett Bank in order to avoid being preempted.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that ten elementary schools throughout Maryland have been named Blue Ribbon School Award winners by the United States Department of Education. These schools are among only 266 elementary schools nationwide to be honored with this award, the most prestigious national school recognition for public and private schools. 
   The designation as a Blue Ribbon School is a ringing endorsement of the successful techniques which enable the students of these schools to succeed and achieve. Over the past few years, I have made a commitment to visit the Blue Ribbon Schools and have always been delighted to see first hand the interaction between parents, teachers, and the community, which strongly contributed to the success of the school. I look forward to visiting each of these ten schools and congratulating the students, teachers and staff personally for this exceptional accomplishment. 
   According to the Department of Education, Blue Ribbon Schools have been judged to be particularly effective in meeting local, state and national goals. These schools also display the qualities of excellence that are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of the next century. Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools which have strong leadership; a clear vision and sense of mission that is shared by all connected with the school; high quality teaching; challenging, up-to-date curriculum; policies and practices that ensure a safe environment conducive to learning; a solid commitment to family involvement; evidence that the school helps all students achieve high standards; and a commitment to share the best practices with other schools. 
   After a screening process by each State Department of Education, the Department of Defense Dependent Schools, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Council for American Private Education, the Blue Ribbon School nominations were forwarded to the U.S. Department of Education. A panel of outstanding educators from around the country then reviewed the nominations, selected schools for site visits, and made recommendations to Secretary of Education Richard Riley.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last week the Senate lost one of its most able and committed staffers; the country lost a brave public servant, a true patriot. Beyond that, with the passing of Adm. James W. ``Bud'' Nance, many of us have lost a good friend. 
   I want to touch for just a moment on his Maryland connections. Admiral Nance graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis in 1944, then went off to serve in our Navy in World War II. He in fact served in World War II, in the Korean war, and in the Vietnam war. 
   In the mid-1950s, he was a project pilot for the flight test division of the Naval Air Test Center in Patuxent River, MD, in St. Mary's County, the mother county of our State. I simply say we were honored to have had his presence in our State for an extended period on those two occasions. 
   Here in the Senate, an institution sometimes marked by acrimony and divisiveness, Bud Nance displayed a warmth and generosity of spirit. He was able to work constructively with those on both sides of the aisle to enhance our Nation's interests. That was always first and foremost in Bud's mind--what served the interest of our great country. 
   Each time I had occasion to work with him, Bud listened to my concerns and responded promptly and fairly. Others had the same experience. He fought hard for the principles in which he believed, but always in a manner that commanded respect and admiration. 
   As the chairman of our committee has indicated, his lifetime friend made an invaluable contribution to our Nation's policies.  
   I was particularly moved by the way Admiral Nance dealt with his illness. Having had an illustrious 35-year career in the Navy, he knew how to surmount the gravest challenges and how to maintain strong leadership throughout. He demonstrated that once again by showing up for work every day with a smile and a vitality that masked whatever pain and discomfort he may have felt. Every day he reported for duty. Rather than complaining about his own situation, he showed a genuine interest in the health and well-being of those around him, and the other staff members of the committee will recount his unfailing courtesies towards each and every one of them. 
   I join my colleagues in offering my deepest condolences to Bud's wife of 53 years, Mary Lyda, and to his four children and seven grandchildren. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate itself were fortunate to have had the benefit of his dedicated service over the past 8 years. He will be remembered fondly, not only for his lifetime of service to this country--civilian as well as military--but also for his integrity, courage, and grace. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a group of individuals and agencies whose cause represents the ideal of public service--the improvement of the lives of those who are less fortunate. The Maryland Association of Community Action Agencies (MACAA), which begins its annual conference Monday in Ocean City, is a group of seventeen Community Action Agencies (CAA) which combat poverty in cities, towns and rural communities throughout our State, and provide services to countless low-income families and individuals. 
   This year's MACAA conference is made even more significant as 1999 marks the 35th anniversary of the creation of Community Action Agencies. CAA's were developed as part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 which was the centerpiece of President Johnson's War on Poverty. This Act also began other critical social service programs including the Head Start pre-school program and the Job Corps Training Center program.  
   Currently, the MACAA serves individuals and families in Baltimore City and 23 counties throughout Maryland. Working with 1000 agencies nationwide, CAA's serve 98% of our Nation's cities and counties and are a primary source of support for the more than 38 million Americans living in poverty in rural and urban areas. Services provided by CAA's and their dedicated volunteers include employment training, adult and child educational services, senior assistance, income management, housing and rental assistance, emergency services and food and nutritional relief. Whether it is through the exchange of information on poverty issues, the provision of services and assistance, the development of funding resources, or the effort to influence public policy, the ultimate mission of these agencies and volunteers is to assist low-income citizens to achieve a higher level of self-sufficiency. 
   Mr. President, for more than 30 years, MACAA has sponsored this annual conference which brings together hundreds of individuals involved in the effort to eliminate poverty. Appropriately, this May has been designated National Community Action Month, and May 4-10 has been designated National Community Action week to publicize the achievements of CAA's and to emphasize their continuing importance in our communities. This is a most fitting occasion to celebrate a coalition such as MACAA, which is so integral to the health and well being of citizens throughout Maryland. I am pleased to congratulate the MACAA for thirty years of invaluable service, and for their efforts to, to borrow the CAA credo, provide a ``hand up, not a hand out.''

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 30, the Agricultural Market Failure Protection Act of 1999. The purpose of this bill, of which I am co-sponsor, is to protect farmers against income loss resulting from severe economic downturns and weather-related crop losses. In my view this legislation is very timely, considering the current status of our nation's agricultural economy. 
   We have been experiencing alarming economic conditions in the agricultural sector for over two years. A combination of declining crop prices, reduced yields, and unfavorable export markets have led to a substantial decrease in overall farm incomes. As a nation, we often forget how important it is to protect the vitality of our agricultural producers. We do not want to wait until farms disappear and our supermarkets can no longer stock their shelves to address this situation. 
   Farmers in my own state of Maryland are not immune to the effects of this crisis. Over the past two years, they have been hit hard by low commodity prices and a widespread drought that has destroyed a significant number of crops. The Maryland Agricultural Statistics Service reports that total farm income fell $8.2 million last year to $265.4 million overall. This was a 3 percent decline. Since 1996, farm incomes in Maryland have fallen 26 percent. Prices for grain, corn, soybeans, and hogs are all down, some at 20 to 30 year lows. A recently published article from The Baltimore Sun illustrates the impact of this crisis on the economy of Maryland. 
   In an effort to address this decline, the Agriculture Market Failure Protection Act would revise marketing assistance loan rates, authorize six-month loan extensions, and amend the Internal Revenue Code to temporarily increase the number of years permitted for the carry back of net operating losses for certain farmers. In short, it would help prevent future income loss by giving farmers a chance to run their operations without constantly being at  the mercy of the market. With these changes to the Agricultural Market Transition Act, farmers will be able to spread crop sales throughout the entire season, and subsequently allow them to take advantage of higher prices. 
   The legislation which Senator DASCHLE has introduced leaves commodities in the hands of farmers, thereby allowing them to make their own marketing decisions for the future. I commend him for introducing this legislation, and in light of the current state of the agricultural economy, I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 30, the Agricultural Market Failure Protection Act of 1999.

   The leader's intent, as I understand it, is to try to finish this bill tonight. I think the chairman will probably agree with me that there is the real possibility that we could do that, but in order to accomplish that, it would be very helpful if Members who are thinking of offering amendments would let us know about them so 
   we can incorporate that factor into our thinking as we think about how we are going to move the bill along. I would be most appreciative if people could do that.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first of all, I want to indicate right at the outset that I am supportive of this amendment which the chairman has sent to the desk. I would like to address briefly the two aspects of it. 
   First of all, it would preserve current law that ends the FICO assessment differential at the end of 1999. 
   Actually, my colleague, Senator JOHNSON, was going to offer an amendment later, and part of that amendment would encompass this provision as well. That is an amendment that addresses the unitary thrift issue, which I believe is probably an amendment we will be able to get to fairly shortly this morning. In fact, the chairman and I are hopeful that when we do that, we will be 
   able to work out a time agreement with those who are interested in the amendment so we could structure that debate, structure the vote, and Members would know how we are moving ahead. 
   We indicated earlier, and I want to repeat the request--I will do it after we vote on this amendment--that Members who have amendments to let us know. Of course, we know about the unitary thrift amendment. We know about the op-sub amendment. We know that some Members are thinking of offering amendments. The chairman indicated earlier that, if we could see them, we might be able to work out accommodations with people offering amendments. 
   It will be very helpful to us if Members will let us know. I think an opportune time will be when we have the vote on this amendment, or shortly thereafter we could begin to try to program and plan the day. 
   The FICO assessment differential--let me briefly describe the legislative background and show why the current law should be preserved. 
   In 1996, Congress passed the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 to resolve the disparity. 
   Let me just say this amendment has two things: the FICO differential and this antifraud privacy provision in it. As the chairman has indicated, that is just a small step. I am going to address that shortly. 
   Many Members have a very keen interest in the privacy issue. The privacy concerns which they have been focused on are sort of broader and separate and more extensive than what is in this amendment. But this amendment in and of itself, I think, is desirable, although it by no means addresses the privacy question in any broad or full manner. 
   Coming back to the FICO assessment differential, when we passed the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 to resolve the disparity between the assessments being charged by the SAIFs and the BIFs to the thrifts and the banks for payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation, so-called FICO bonds, it paid depositors of institutions that failed during the thrift crisis. 
   Actually, the differential that caused thrifts to migrate assessable deposits to the BIF fund, the Bank Insurance Fund, in order to reduce their premiums, that obviously over time could have led to a destabilization of the SAIF funds. 
   The legislation in 1996 required SAIF-insured institutions to pay a one-time $4.5 billion payment to the SAIF funds, and for 3 years, until the end of 1999, to pay assessments at a rate of 6.1 basis points of deposits, which was five times the rate at which BIF-insured funds were assessed. Then, as it were, as part of the arrangement for the thrifts undertaking these large payments, a one-time $4.5 billion payment and the five-time multiple on the assessment rate going into the SAIF funds, the Congress provided that the assessments would be equalized in the two funds no later than January 1, 2000, and the same rate would be assessed on BIF and SAIF-assessable deposits thereafter. 
   The bill before has a provision in it, which the chairman has now proposed to strike, but that provision, if it remained, would extend the premium differential for another 3 years and, therefore, require SAIF-insured savings associations to pay a much higher deposit assessment for another 3 years, whereas the existing law would have eliminated that differential at the end of this year. This obviously would impose very significant additional and unexpected costs. 
   I think, in thinking about this, that we have to really think about it in terms of in the sense of what the understanding was in 1996, what the expectations were, what the planning has been, and, of course, if we don't allow the law to take effect as it was laid out to do in 1996 in the Deposit Insurance Funds Act, we markedly changed people's expectations and people's planning.

   Mr. SARBANES. I commend the very able Senator from South Dakota and his colleague from Wyoming for offering this amendment. I think it is a very important amendment. They have made some very strong arguments for it. 
   Both Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin, who differ on other aspects of this legislation that is before us, are in agreement, along with Chairman Volcker and Henry Kaufman, and many others who have examined this issue, that we need to address this question. 
   It is called the unitary thrift loophole, because over time the powers of the thrifts have been expanded. So a provision, which at an early time may not have appeared to be a loophole, now becomes a loophole through which commercial companies can acquire thrifts and, in effect, eliminate the line drawn between banking and commerce. 
   The recent experience with banking crises in other countries--Japan, Korea, and so forth--where they had industrial financial conglomerates, indicates the difficulties and the dangers of allowing these arrangements. 
   I want to address very specifically the argument of limiting the transferability of a unitary thrift holding company--and this would limit it only in terms of being transferred to a commercial company; it would not limit it in terms of being transferred to a financial company. 
   It would be unfair because companies bought thrifts at a time when they could sell them to any commercial company, and it is now being asserted that this would be a taking under the fifth amendment of the Constitution or perhaps, alternatively, a breach of contract by the government. 
   You cannot keep people from making any argument that is available to them. They can sort of reach out and grab hold of any argument that exists and sort of bring it in and try to set it down here in the middle of the Senate and say, aha, here is this argument and you have to pay attention to it. 
   You need to look at the argument and what is involved. 
   Let me just for a moment analyze this argument that it is a taking. The Supreme Court's rulings in the area of the fifth amendment takings of property have generally dealt with real property, not with business charters issued by the government, such as a thrift charter. However, even if a thrift charter did qualify as property for taking purposes, prohibiting transfers of thrifts to commercial companies would not give rise to liability under the standards which the courts have used to require compensation. 
   It is being asserted here that this is going to be a taking; you are going to have to pay compensation. Then you have to take a look at it. Is this limitation that is involved in this amendment, this limited limitation with respect to the transferability of this thrift, is that going to be considered a taking by the court? I submit it would not give rise to liability under the standards which the courts have used to require compensation. Courts have held that no compensation is owed if there is not an invasion of the property or a total diminution of economic value of the property. Closing the loophole would not involve either of these two things. 
   There is a considerable value in the thrift charter which would continue even if this limited amount of transferability is no longer permitted. In fact, these thrifts may be sold to thousands of other thrifts, banks, securities broker dealers, insurance companies and other financial companies under this legislation. Of course, this is the very kind of transfer that occurs in the vast majority of thrift transfers. It is to some other financial institution. 
   Of course, the legislation would permit that, and this amendment does not touch that. The potential for change in the powers of a unitary thrift holding company is in fact inherent in having an S&L charter. The holder of a federally granted charter cannot expect that the government will never change the laws under which the charter operates. The Constitution does not guarantee that a company allowed to engage in some activity will have the right to continue to do so in perpetuity. 
   I am as sensitive as any to the takings question. It is a very important part of our Constitution. It is an important part of the workings of our economic system. But we need to look at the cases in terms of what the court has interpreted as constitutional. We need to exercise some practical sense judgments. Clearly, the law has never been that a company engaged in some activities can never be limited or restrained by the government and has that right 
   to go on in perpetuity. In the past, Congress has changed statutes governing savings associations and has required compliance with the amended statute. 
   In 1987, Congress imposed a qualified thrift lender test requiring thrifts to hold a percentage of their total assets as qualified thrift investments. New requirement. New limitation. A unitary thrift holding company owning a thrift that failed to comply with those new requirements would have been required to divest its commercial activities. 
   Also in 1987, we limited the transferability of nonbank banks by requiring that upon transfer the new owner bank would be required to register as a bank holding company. These actions have not been found to be takings. 
   Let me turn to the other possible argument; that is, that there is a breach of contract by the government. 
   The argument has been raised that closing the loophole may break a supposed contract. The Winstar case, U.S. v. Winstar Corporation et al, 518 U.S. 839, a 1996 case, has been used as a basis for this concern. However, closing the unitary thrift loophole involves facts that are materially different from those on which the case of U.S. v. Winstar Corporation was decided. In Winstar, the Supreme Court determined that the United States had made specific contractual promises to acquirers of failed thrifts and had breached those specific contractual promises.

   Mr. SARBANES. The court found the government liable for breaching its contracts by not permitting the thrifts to count goodwill and capital credits toward regulatory capital requirements after the enactment of FIRREA. There had been a specific undertaking in the S&L cases that those goodwill arrangements could be counted and, in fact, they wouldn't have taken over the failed thrifts had they not been able to do so. 
   It is vastly different from the situation that we are confronting here. 
   There are no specific contracts here that promise acquirers of thrifts that they could sell them to commercial companies or that the law governing permissible thrift affiliations would never change. Prohibiting unitaries from affiliating with commercial companies is no different than many prohibitions the government legislatively imposes on industries each year with no financial liability to the government. 
   The difference with the supervisory goodwill cases couldn't be clearer. Those cases were based upon contract law. No contracts are involved in the unitary provisions of H.R. 10. No guarantee was made by anyone that these affiliations with a commercial firm could continue and the government is entitled, in order to achieve important public policy objectives, to make reasonable changes. I submit to you that this is one such reasonable change in order to ensure that the dividing line between banking and commerce remain firm. 
   All of the people have told us about the dangers of mixing banking and commerce. From the Fed, Alan Greenspan says:  
   Failure to close this loophole now would allow the conflicts inherent in banking and commerce combinations to further develop in our economy and complicate efforts to create a fair and level playing field for all financial service providers.  
   Secretary Rubin has echoed those comments, as has Paul Volcker and many other distinguished commentators.  
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time. How much time is remaining?

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from South Dakota because the amendment, as he was going to originally propose it, included this closing of the unitary thrift company loophole but maintained the existing law on the differential payment by the S&L's and the banks. The chairman offered that and it was accepted earlier this morning. I think the fact that it was embraced--and I think the adoption of that amendment should be taken in the context of this amendment--reflects an effort to come up with a very balanced approach on the part of the able Senator from South Dakota.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in view of the comments that were just made by my able colleague from Wyoming, I want to address this safety and soundness issue. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to which he referred, the regulatory agency with the most at stake in terms of protecting the deposit insurance funds, sees the op-sub as equivalent to the holding company structure for safety and soundness reasons. 
   The argument was just made that there are some safety and soundness problems. The FDIC Chairman, Donna Tanoue, wrote a 
   letter to the Banking Committee:  
   With the appropriate safeguards, the operating subsidiary and the holding company structures both provide adequate safety and soundness protection. We see no compelling public policy reason why policymakers should prefer one structure over the other. And absent such a compelling reason, we believe the Government should not interfere in banks' choice of organizational structure.  
   That is the current Chairman of the FDIC. Lest someone says that is only the current Chairman, let me refer to an article written by three previous FDIC Chairmen, both in Democratic and Republican administrations: Ricki Tigert Helfer, William Isaac, and William Seidman, all of them with many years of direct experience in this area. They all agree with the current FDIC Chairman and have offered strong support for the operating subsidiary approach.

   Mr. SARBANES. The article says:  
   The debate on banks conducting financial activities through operating subsidiaries has been portrayed as a battle between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The Treasury believes banks should be permitted to conduct expanded activities through direct subsidiaries. The Fed wants these activities to be conducted only through holding company affiliates. 
   Curiously, the concerns of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have been largely ignored. The FDIC, alone among the agencies, has no ``turf'' at stake in this issue, as its supervisory reach extends to any affiliate of a bank. The FDIC's sole motivation is to safeguard the nation's banks against systemic risks.  
   They go on to say:  
   Every subsequent FDIC chairman, including the current one, has taken the same position .....  
   In other words, allowing with the view toward bank subsidiaries conducting these activities. 
   In fact, they point out that requiring the bank-related activities be conducted in holding companies will place insured banks in the worst possible position. They will be exposed to the risk of the affiliates' failures without reaping the benefits of the affiliates' successes. 
   It is very clear that the regulator concerns of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are supportive of doing it either way. 
   Will the Senator yield me 1 more minute?

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, let me quickly run through some important safety mechanisms that are in the Shelby-Daschle-Reed amendment: 
   One, a full capital deduction for investments in subsidiaries so that all such investments would be fully deducted from the bank's regulatory capital. Banks must remain well capitalized after this deduction, meaning even if the subsidiary fails, the bank's capital will remain intact. 
   Two, downstream investments in subsidiaries be no greater than the total amount that a bank could upstream as a dividend to a holding company. So they have exactly the same extent to which they can engage in new financial activities between the subsidiary or the affiliate. 
   We remove any advantage for subsidiaries in terms of transactions with their parent banks by applying sections 23(a) and 23(b) of the Federal Reserve Act to subsidiaries, just like affiliates. It would require the maintenance of subsidiaries as separate corporate entities. 
   The bank's credit exposure to a subsidiary be no greater than it could have been to an affiliate. 
   Real estate investment and insurance underwriting is not permitted in the subsidiary. 
   All of these features, I think, go to ensuring the safety and soundness of the approach contained in the Shelby-Daschle-Reed amendment, and I am supportive of this amendment. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding time.

   This was the last of the very large--I do not want to suggest that any amendment any Member has to offer is not a large amendment; I recognize that, but this was the last of a series of large amendments that we had lined up. I know the chairman and leader's intention is to try to finish this evening. As I understand it, there are some amendments around. I guess we will find out very shortly. Maybe we can dispose of them or deal with them in a fairly reasonable way in a short period of time and then go to the final vote on this bill. 
   As I understand it, the leader said that if we voted final passage tonight, there would be no votes tomorrow. Members, I think, would have to figure whether it is worth investing a little more time this evening in order to finish up. That is how I see the lay of the land. I just ask the chairman to comment.

We have joined together, actually, in introducing legislation on this privacy question, along with Senators LEAHY and DODD and HOLLINGS. Earlier today we raised the issue with the chairman. 
   I think it would probably be helpful if the chairman could provide--the Senator may want to question him himself--the similar assurances he gave earlier about the committee committing itself to examining this issue in a comprehensive way, with hearings and with the idea in mind, of course, to try to bring forth legislation that will address what the chairman himself has conceded is an important issue that needs to be addressed.

   Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. I want to make it very clear, the provision that was adopted earlier today was an antifraud provision. It was designed to get at people who get this information by fraud. The fact of the matter is, under the current arrangements there is no restriction that precludes a financial institution from providing this information or selling this information to others. 
   I think you are absolutely right; people would be dumbfounded to know that this information they are giving to their financial institution has no privacy protections around it. I think it is extremely important, as the Senator has emphasized, to establish such protections. 
   It has an issue of some complexity to it. We need to work through it. I think the hearings that have now been committed to will give us the opportunity to do it. There are many members on the committee on both sides of the aisle who are interested in this issue. I hope we can move forward and bring a significant piece of legislation to the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, the committee has brought out--in fact, it is on the calendar--a regulatory relief bill to lessen the regulatory burdens on the financial institutions, and it seems to me in that spirit of lessening burdens, this basic banking amendment would certainly be an opportune amendment to offer to that bill when it is before the Senate. I am pleased that the chairman has committed to having an up-or-down vote. 
   I think the Senators are onto a very important issue, and it really is just a basic issue of equity and fairness for small people. I very much appreciate not only their raising it, but insisting that at some reasonable point we be given an opportunity to vote up or down on this important matter.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in paying this tribute to JOE BIDEN on the occasion of him casting his 10,000th vote in the Senate. The casting of that vote is an occasion to pay tribute not for voting but for a real career of service and of great distinction. It has been one of the pleasures of my service in this body to have served with JOE BIDEN, and one of my pleasures that we represent adjoining States. Therefore, we interact on a number of issues that otherwise would not be the case amongst Members of the Senate. 
   He has had an extraordinary career here. He is now in his fifth term. He got elected before he was old enough, actually, under the Constitution, before he was old enough under the Constitution to be a Member of the Senate. He was elected at the age of 29, and he has just had a terrific career of accomplishment. Those who have worked with him derive great pleasure from it. We have marveled at his legislative skill. 
   I want to talk about two or three of the things in which he has been very much involved. We have served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee all of these years. And he has exercised extraordinary leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee at various points during his career. We are making a lot of the fact now in America that crime rates are going down all across the country. So everyone is sort of looking to see what is the cause of that, or who ought to get the praise for it. I have to tell you that JOE BIDEN ought to get a lot of the praise for the fact that crime has gone down across this land. He has authored every significant anticrime initiative in the Congress over a period of time that he has been here--the Juvenile Justice Prevention Act, the Victims of Crime Act, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and on and on and on. 
   Senator BIDEN has been a great champion of law enforcement and of those who work in law enforcement. He has been sensitive on the important civil liberties and civil rights cases, which a democracy ought to be sensitive to. He has understood how you can balance those and put it together. There are thousands and thousands of cops on the street today giving us safer neighborhoods and more secure cities and communities all across America because of JOE BIDEN's initiatives. 
   Senator BIDEN was the first to include the provisions with respect to violence against women and really raise to a very high level the whole issue of gender-based crimes. He has consistently focused our attention onto that area. 
   He has dealt in a very effective way with the gun issue, which is not easy to deal with in this body, and certainly not an easy issue to deal with effectively. I have to tell you that I think throughout all of this period Senator BIDEN had a clear perception and focus on how to do something about the crime issue. He did not demagog it. He did not seek to emotionalize it. He worked hard to develop the real programs that would make a difference in our communities all across the country. I am extremely grateful to him for that. 
   On the Foreign Relations Committee, he has consistently been an advocate of an international stance by the United States--actually, the expansion of NATO was in large part a consequence of his very effective advocacy and leadership. He 
   has been sensitive to the importance of human rights and democratic values in American foreign policy. I have been very privileged to serve with him on the Foreign Relations Committee and to see his effective leadership in that arena. 
   Finally, let me just say he is a terrific friend. I can't tell you how much I value and treasure his friendship, how much it has meant, how much I enjoy his sense of humor, and even how much I like to listen to his speeches--which occasionally go on for a while. But this institution has been honored by having him as a Member. It is extraordinary that at what is really, for the Senate, still a very young age, he has achieved his 10,000th vote. I wish him many, many, many thousands more. I thank him for his extraordinary service to the country and for his deep friendship to all of us. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the substitute amendment, which is the provisions contained in S. 753, introduced by Senator DASCHLE and all of the Democratic members of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. 
   We have been at this for a long time--those on the committee and other Members who have been interested in the issue of financial services modernization. We have been seeking to find a way to pass a bill to protect safety and soundness, to protect consumers, to ensure that CRA not be undercut or eroded; and that permits financial service institutions within the realm of financial services, in effect, to enter into new arrangements in terms of affiliations and the activities they can conduct. 
   This is something that has been urged on us. Those in the industry think it would be helpful to them. Some of this has been taking place without statute, but it is uncertain, unsure. It happens through regulation; it happens through court decision. I think most people think if we could arrive at a statutory framework in which to place these developments that that would be a desirable objective. 
   That is why we introduced S. 753. That is why we are offering it as a substitute amendment to the committee bill. It essentially tracks the language of the bill that was reported last year on a vote of 16-2 from the committee with one exception with respect to operating subsidiaries. This substitute permits banks to conduct some activities in an operating subsidiary--not all of the activities they can now engage in--and that reflects, in part, an effort by Secretary Rubin to try to reach an accommodation to ensure that some of the concerns that were raised are addressed. 
   There is a conflict, a difference of view here, a very strong difference of view here between Secretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan, both of whom are saying to have a bill we have to have a good bill, and their definition of a good bill, each of them, is one that corresponds to their views, particularly on this important issue of the op-sub versus the affiliate, as far as carrying on activities. 
   In this regard, I point out as we listen to Secretary Rubin that we are also listening, of course, to the possibilities of a 
   Presidential veto. We can't get a bill into law without the President's signature--that is obvious and clear--and the President has taken a very strong position on this legislation. In fact, he has sent a letter to the committee stating in the clearest possible terms that he would veto the committee bill if it was presented to him in its current form. That is when we began the markup in the committee. The committee has issued a statement of administration policy in which they say:  
   Nevertheless, because of crucial flaws in the bill, the President has stated that if the bill were presented to him in its current form, he would veto it.  
   We have had extended debate on the differences between the committee bill and the substitute amendment. Senator GRAMM and I and others are participating in that. I am frank to say I thought the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, just laid out a very clear, concise, extremely well-stated position with respect to the differences between these approaches. 
   We differ in banking and commerce. The substitute seeks to, in effect, reaffirm, make clearer, the division between banking and commerce. We differ, as I indicated, with respect to the operating subsidiary issue, which of course involves the sharp difference between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. We differ very strongly on CRA. It is asserted that the substitute expands CRA. In fact, what the substitute seeks to do is to ensure that if banks move into securities and insurance, that those banks should have a satisfactory CRA rating before they can undertake such a merger or affiliation. 
   It requires the banks to be in compliance with CRA. It in effect says that a bank with an unsatisfactory CRA rating is not going to be able to use this additional power now being given to them to move into securities and to move into insurance. At the moment, they do a limited amount of that activity. But if they are going to actually go into it in a full-scale way, which is what this legislation offers--which both pieces of legislation offer to the banks, we do not differ on that proposition; both as a part of the financial services modernization approach are prepared to permit that--but we feel very strongly that they should be in compliance, the banks should be in compliance with CRA, if they intend to do that.

   Mr. SARBANES. First of all, I commend the able Senator from Nevada for an extremely fine statement in support of this amendment which I very strongly back. 
   The Senator made reference--I think it is an extremely important point--to the fact that the decisions with respect to complying with CRA are made by the regulators. As I understand it, community groups or anyone else can come in and make comments when some of these steps are to be taken for which an institution would have to meet CRA muster, and some of those comments, I assume, can be right on point, others may wander about. But whatever the case, it is not the people who comment who make the judgment; it is the regulators who make the judgment. So they can take it into account, give it some weight, give it no weight--isn't that correct?

   Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from Texas interrupted the Senator to make the point on this ``comments'' question, the safe harbor issue, that if we previously had a satisfactory rating or better, they could not take into account people's comments, unless they had substantial, verifying information, and then we are being told that a lot of cases were read that indicated that ``substantial'' means a scintilla of evidence. 
   The Senator was a distinguished attorney general for the State of Nevada for a number of years before he became the Governor. Wouldn't he read the phrase ``substantial, verifiable information'' as a more exacting standard than ``scintilla'' of evidence?

   Mr. SARBANES. It is interesting. The current system I think is seen by most people as working fairly well. In fact, many fine financial institutions do not complain about it. They are prepared to continue to work under the current system, and many of them have even said they see strong positive value in it. So it seems to me this is an effort to institute an important change that would really cut off open comment. 
   You see, none of this is done, as I understand it, in the committee bill with respect to management or capital or any of the other issues the regulators look at when they undertake to consider one of these mergers or affiliations. It is being applied only to CRA. I mean CRA is being singled out for the application of this kind of prescreening, as it were, of people's ability to come in and make their comments.

To my knowledge, we have not had within the committee any sort of comprehensive hearings to examine those questions; is that the Senator's understanding?

<DOCNO>106-sarbanes-md-20-19990505</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. The Senator's amendment, I think, has an extremely important provision which says that if a banking institution wishes to go into securities or into insurance, which would be permitted in a comprehensive way for the first time by this legislation, that banking institution must  pass the CRA test in order to do that. It is asserted that this is a, I think the language was used by my colleague, the chairman, a massive expansion of CRA. 
   I take a very different view of that. It seems to me it is only keeping CRA abreast of the developments that are taking place with respect to financial modernization, because heretofore banks could not reach out and do--they did some of those activities within the bank of a very limited nature that had been permitted either by regulation or by court opinion but which were highly controversial and contested, and one of the things this bill is intended to do is to resolve those questions in terms of the structure of the financial services industry. Both the Senator and I are supportive of trying to do that. 
   It seems to me that if the bank is now going to be permitted to move out to do these other activities, it is not some massive expansion of CRA. That CRA requirement would be placed upon the bank before they could move to do those other activities. Otherwise, it seems to me, over time, you will erode CRA, as institutions begin to shift their assets out from 
   under the banking activity into the securities and the insurance activities. 
   This amendment, the proposal the Senator has, does not extend CRA to the securities and insurance affiliates; am I correct on that point?

   Mr. SARBANES. Which in fact has been strongly urged by a number of the community groups that are supportive of CRA. They in effect want to extend it out. If that were to be done, I would recognize that as an expansion, and we could fight that issue, as it were. But that is not what is in this amendment. 
   This amendment puts the requirement only on the bank, if it seeks to go out and do those activities. That seems to me to be perfectly reasonable. In fact, it seems to me failure to do that is really a setback or an erosion of CRA. 
   I ask the Senator his view on that question.

<DOCNO>106-sarbanes-md-25-19990505</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. I am quite prepared to concede that there are a lot of small banks that do, in fact, service their community, as the Senator has indicated by the quotes. We have never held extended hearings on this issue, but the material from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation says that 57 percent of small banks and thrifts have a loan-to-deposit ratio below 70 percent and that 17 percent of those have levels less than 50 percent. Conceding that there are small banks who  really pay attention to their community, it is obvious that there are also small banks which are not doing that. 
   In fact, the Madison Wisconsin Capital Times, in an editorial a couple of years ago, said:  
   Many rural banks establish a very different pattern than reinvesting in their communities where local lending takes a lower priority than making more assured investment like Federal Government securities. Thus, such banks drain local resources of the very localities that support them, making it much harder for local citizens to get credit.  
   I do not gainsay the examples that the Senator cited. But 
   clearly, there are examples on the other side. And CRA, of course, is directed to get not at the good or the best actors, but the ones that are not addressing needs. The statistics from the regulators seem to indicate, and this editorial that we have--and we have other comments to the same effect--seems to indicate that there is a problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. That is a reasonable point. It ought to be examined in a set of careful hearings, because, in fact, the particular institution may confront that problem, although it may be overlooking loan possibilities, which has frequently been the case and is certainly the case in many instances in which areas people were neglected in terms of the availability of credit. We have never done those kinds of hearings. We have never really looked at this problem in some sort of objective, comprehensive way. 
   And we hear all these kinds of ad hoc stories, as it were. But, you know, there are counter-ad hoc stories. I am frank to say I don't think we ought to be making the kind of significant changes in the CRA that are in the committee bill without having gone through the sort of process I am talking about. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mr. SARBANES. I am looking at a table from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, from 1990 through 1998, that those 320 institutions were given a ``needs to improve'' rating which, of course, is below compliance, and 18 institutions were given ``substantial noncompliance.'' 
   The Senator is using this ``three'' figure, and I don't know where that comes from.

   Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, he simply stated the point all over again, but it hasn't squared the factual discrepancy. 
   According to our data from bank regulatory agencies, more than 70 small, rural banks and thrifts are currently deemed not in compliance; that is, below a satisfactory rating with CRA this year alone. 
   Since 1990, 338 small, rural banks and thrifts received CRA ratings below satisfactory. 
   Sure, the Senator can make the same speech about those numbers, but I just want to get those on the RECORD, because those numbers are very significantly different from the numbers which the Senator is putting forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SARBANES. Let me compliment the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from North Carolina for their very strong presentations and their tremendous contributions to the Banking Committee. They both came on the committee this year, and we are barely a few months into their first session and they have both made extraordinary contributions to the work of the committee and to the work of the Senate. I simply want to say, as one Senator who has been here for a while, we are very honored to have them as part of the Senate and thankful and grateful to them for the contributions they make. 
   I wanted to ask the Senator this: In a letter we received from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which in effect fits in with the point that both Senators were making about the importance of the Community Reinvestment Act--it is signed by close to 170 mayors from all over the country, besides the ones that are trustees and on the advisory board of the U.S. Conference of Mayors--it says:  
   .....As mayors, we recognize that CRA has been an essential tool in revitalizing cities around this nation. In fact, there is now increasing recognition that the strength and economic health of whole regions require strong and vibrant cities. Creating new economic activity--new businesses, new jobs, new homeowners--is key to the revival of urban areas and their surrounding regions, CRA has been a key component to creating this new economic activity.  
   They go on later to say:  
   Prior to the enactment of CRA, banks and thrifts routinely redlined low and moderate-income neighborhoods in our nation's cities. The modest requirement in CRA that financial institutions meet the credit needs of their communities has led to the successful channeling of billions of dollars into localities.  
   Then they note that the bill brought out by the committee would severely weaken CRA. They say: 
   Unless the onerous CRA provisions are addressed and CRA is preserved and strengthened, we would urge strong opposition to the Senate bill.  
   I raise that with the Senator because it seems to me that it goes to this very point, including the pictures he was showing. We are talking about the elected officials who are right on the front line, so to speak, trying to deal with the problems of their communities, trying to bring them back and achieve revitalization and renewal. They, obviously, have come in feeling very strongly. 
   Mr. President, does the Senator feel that this is another perspective on the very point he was trying to make of the importance of CRA--not just for the people who directly benefit from it but for the broader community, for all of us, it seems to me, here is, in a sense, an endorsement of the very position the Senator has been enunciating.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have refrained from taking a lot of debate time this afternoon, because a lot of our colleagues want to speak. I recognize that. Of course, the temptation is very great to sort of rise every time the chairman of the committee speaks. He has done that at some length here this afternoon. So I am not going to do it now, because I have colleagues here. I hope before we get to 7 o'clock I will get a chance to have a few minutes to make a statement. 
   But I want to say that there is kind of an Alice-in-Wonderland quality to this debate. The chairman pulls these figures out of the air. 
   I don't really know where they come from. I asked him where they come from. He says there have been 16,000 something examinations of banks under $100 million in nonmetropolitan areas. 
   I don't know where he gets that figure. The figure from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is 11,445. He says only 3 have been found in substantial noncompliance; the figure is 18, and another 320 have been found a need to improve. This chart is from the FDIC. 
   The Chairman says only three--it is not only three. I want to make that point.

   Mr. SARBANES. The Senator said earlier today that the cost this is imposing on small banks is $1.3 trillion. 
   I am thinking to myself, $1.3 trillion from these examinations? So I asked him, How did you get that figure? He took the number of examinations--about which we have just disagreed--and he multiplied it by 80,000. I am not sure where he got the 80,000 figure. Someone must have written in and said: That is what it costs our bank.

<DOCNO>106-sarbanes-md-49-19990505</DOCNO>

   Mr. SARBANES. I don't know any study that validates that figure as the right figure. 
   Even assuming for the purpose of this Alice-in-Wonderland discussion that both the number of exams and the costs which we were then told came to a $1.3 trillion burden, the fact is, it is $1.3 billion. That is still a lot of money. I don't pretend to the contrary, but it is a lot different from $1.3 trillion. It was escalated 1,000 times. 
   Let me give one other example. We were told the CRA is allocating more money each year than the gross domestic product of Canada. The CRA commitments are over a 10-year period. Those commitments, factored out over a 10-year period, do not begin to approach the gross domestic product of Canada. 
   These are only a few examples. We could give a lot more. I want to underscore these figures that come floating in out of the air, and we hear this long disquisition. When we start probing these figures, we discover it is not there; it is Alice in Wonderland. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator.

   I, again, want to underscore the very strong and powerful statement which I think Senator BRYAN made shortly after noon at the outset of this debate, and I am deeply appreciative to him for the strong leadership he has shown with respect to this amendment. 
   We have tried to give all Members a chance to speak. I, in fact, have refrained from doing so in the course of the day in order to make sure that our colleagues had a chance to speak. I would like to take just a few minutes now. 
   I want to speak in support of the amendment. But I really do not want to repeat a lot of the extensive discussion of the issues which have taken place, both during opening statements on the bill, and on the alternative amendment, and now on this amendment itself, although they may well bear repeating. 
   I want to make sure my colleagues appreciate the intense feeling and the critical importance which civil rights groups, mayors, rural groups, Hispanic groups, and Native American groups attach to this issue of CRA. They have all sent letters to the committee.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, these letters reflect how CRA has benefited communities all over this country--small, urban, and rural. They demonstrate how CRA has expanded economic opportunities for people of all races, colors, and ethnic affiliations. 
   Yesterday morning, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, our preeminent civil rights group, held a press conference in support of CRA. I would like briefly just to quote some of the comments made by civil rights leaders at the press conference, as well as comments made by individuals who benefited from CRA. 
   Dr. Dorothy Height, chairman of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, president emeritus of the National Council of Negro Women, spoke, and said:  
   Since its enactment in 1977, the Community Reinvestment Act has served as one of the crowning achievements in the civil rights movement. 
   The premise of the legislation is simple--to make sure that economic opportunity for families and communities is available to every American. 
   Opportunities for home ownership, small business development, and sustaining rural communities are critical to the strength of this Nation. 
   With CRA our neighborhoods have a chance. Without it, they are discriminated against. 
   Just as civil rights legislation enacted a decade ago sought to break down the walls of discrimination that separated us in schools, restaurants, and places of work by the color of our skin, the CRA has meant opportunity for everyone, whatever race or color. As a result of CRA, millions of minorities across this Nation now have access to the capital that will allow them to build new homes, to create new businesses, and to improve education.  
   She concluded her introductory remarks at the press conference by saying:  
   Leaders you see before you represent dozens of organizations galvanized by an assault on the Community Reinvestment Act. Those organizations represent millions of Americans who have been touched by CRA and millions more who deserve the same opportunity.  
   Make no mistake about it, this issue is seen by the civil rights community as a critical civil rights issue. Fair access to credit is fundamental to hopes for economic progress in our minority communities. 
   Another speaker at the press conference was Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League, who said:  
   We of the National Urban League strongly support financial services modernization because we believe it is in tune with the times. But we staunchly oppose any effort to gut the CRA. We at the Urban League work with the leaders of many financial institutions. Just last week I talked with Kenny Lewis, president of Bank America, who said that his bank stands strongly behind the renewal of CRA.  
   I know that belief is echoed by many leaders in the financial services and banking community who see it as good business for their corporations. 
   Charles Kamasaki, senior vice president of the National Council of La Raza, stated:  
   The National Council of La Raza is the Nation's largest Hispanic civil rights organization. We represent more than 200 local community-based organizations who provide a range of services, many of them supported by CRA-related funds in over 32 States.  
   Mr. Kamasaki, the head of the National Council of La Raza, introduced Richard Farias as president of the Tejano Center for Community Concerns in Houston, a member organization of La Raza. Mr. Farias stated, in speaking of the importance of CRA:  
   Now because of CRA, a number of banks in Houston created a consortium to help us purchase a $2.1 million school building. The building has 7.5 acres and 80,000 square feet of space, including a gymnasium, a cafeteria, an auditorium and 25 classrooms. They now have a charter school for success that houses 400 students and is expected to grow to 650 students.  
   He goes on to say that it is very important to understand that CRA is not just about community development; it is about empowerment of the people; it is about being able to give low-income children and families the right that they have to not only good housing but to good education and to good health services. 
   Daphne Kwok, executive director of the Organization of Chinese Americans, also took part in the press conference. She stated that the Organization of Chinese Americans supports the Community Reinvestment Act because it has enabled home ownership among minority and low- and moderate-income individuals:  
   Asian Pacific-Americans, especially Chinese-Americans, Korean-Americans, Vietnamese-Americans, Asian Indian-Americans are small business owners, and many of them are seeking to open up businesses in low and moderate income areas.  
   JoAnn Chase, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, then spoke and stated:  
   Founded in 1944, the National Congress of American Indians is the oldest, largest and most representative national organization  devoted to promoting and protecting the rights of American Indian tribal governments and their citizens. One of our key missions has been to continuously advocate for Indian self determination and self sufficiency, and toward that end from its very inception, our communities, our governments, our people have supported the Community Reinvestment Act, which has proven to be an effective means of encouraging federally insured financial institutions to extend prudent and profitable loans in traditionally underserved areas, particularly in Indian country. 
   Specifically, the CRA has helped focus attention to the challenges of extending credit to reservations and has acted as a catalyst to reservation-based economic development. Since the implementation of the CRA, Native American governments and citizens and our own banks have negotiated agreements for lending more than $155 million within the Indian country which has substantially advanced efforts toward economic self-sufficiency. It is a law that has helped build homes for our people, has inspired hope and has created jobs in many native communities.  
   The final speaker at the press conference was Hillary Shelton, Washington bureau director of the NAACP, who stated:  
   *.*.* on behalf of the NAACP *.*.* we are honored to strongly support and continue to endorse the Community Reinvestment Act and consequently oppose any attempts to weaken it. 
   The CRA has been instrumental in the revitalization of literally tens of thousands of communities nationwide, and continues to be an important tool in the NAACP's ongoing efforts to help people and communities achieve the goals of community resurrection, development, and growth, at no cost to American taxpayers.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I just want to underscore a couple of the things that the able chairman of the committee just stated. This is a partial agreement that was worked out and was an effort to get the Senate into its consideration of the bill in an orderly and prompt manner. I think it will accomplish that. 
   A number of colleagues asked me during the last vote about making opening statements. I indicated that the chairman would be making an opening statement, and I would make one, and then the floor would be open for opening statements. We hope we can complete those, I assume, this morning before we take a break for the conference luncheons, and then we would be able to move on to the substitute amendment in the afternoon. 
   So we hope Members will try to keep this schedule in mind and 
   come over sometime during the morning here. I know a number have left to go to committee meetings, but they said they wanted to come back in order to make an opening statement. We want to try to accommodate our colleagues in that regard. 
   On the vote schedule, I think we will have to work that out on the basis of the people who are away, so that we can accommodate everyone in terms of being able to vote, which I assume will be sometime tomorrow, as I understand it.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, for the fourth time in 11 years, the Senate is debating legislation to modernize the structure of the financial services industry. We are addressing this issue  because we want our financial services statutes to keep pace with forces that are changing the financial marketplace, forces such as globalization, technological change, and the development of new products. 
   Many experts agree that the time has come to allow affiliations between banks, securities firms, and insurance companies; in other words, those actors within the financial services industry that heretofore have been kept separate by existing statutes--although those statutes have, to some extent, been eroded either by regulatory decisions or by court decisions. It is, therefore, felt that financial services modernization legislation would be useful in helping to set the structure within which financial institutions are to operate, to provide a certainty and a stability that is now missing under the existing arrangements, and which is not altogether clear along the borderline of what activities are permitted and what activities are not permitted. 
   Now, we have not only no objection, we are supportive of the effort to allow these affiliations to take place within the financial services industry. Therefore, we are anxious to obtain the enactment of financial services modernization legislation. However, it is important, in the course of doing that, that we achieve or preserve certain important goals: obviously, the safety and soundness of the financial system; the continuing access to credit for all communities in our country; protecting consumers, who, after all, are Mr. and Mrs. America. We are concerned that in this effort to create a new structure we don't lose sight of the very specific problems that relate to the ordinary American with respect to credit; and finally, maintaining the separation of banking and commerce. There are some who would like to cross that line as well, but we think that would be a great mistake to do that. 
   Now, just a little bit of history here. Last year, every Democratic member of the Senate Banking Committee voted for financial services modernization in the form of what was then referred to as H.R. 10, the Financial Services Act of 1998. That bill was reported by the Senate Banking Committee on a bipartisan vote of 16-2. So there was a joint bipartisan effort last year, to try to obtain enactment of financial services modernization legislation, which didn't prove out--unfortunately, in my view. 
   Now, this year, unfortunately, the bill brought out of the Committee was on a vote of 11-9, a straight party vote, which I regret. I particularly regret that, since last year we were able to bring a bill out on a 16-2 vote, which, in effect, was a very strong bipartisan statement. That obviously raises the question: Why this dramatic change from last year to this year? I think, very simply, it is because the bill brought to the Senate now, S. 900, does not meet the important goals that I set out earlier of continuing access to credit for all communities in our country, protecting consumers, and maintaining the separation of banking and commerce. 
   Before this year, the efforts of the Banking Committee to modernize financial services,--in other words, taking earlier efforts to which I referred, in which we moved legislation out and, 
   on occasion, even moved it through the Senate, but weren't able to get it passed in the House--those efforts were, in each instance, bipartisan efforts. We reported legislation with support from both sides of the aisle. That effort, of course, earlier on, and certainly last year, reflected compromises among Committee members and among industry groups on a wide range of issues and, in fact, last year's bill was not opposed by a single major financial services industry association. 
   Now, this year, the consensus so carefully developed last year has been abandoned. That decision, of course, has made this bill a controversial one and has led to opposition to it. As I indicated, all of the Members on this side of the aisle in the Committee opposed the Committee bill. Some financial industry groups oppose aspects of the Committee bill. Civil rights groups, community groups, consumer organizations, and local government officials also strongly oppose the Committee bill, especially with respect to the Community Reinvestment Act provision, which is an extremely important issue, as Members are well aware. 
   Lastly, let me note, because it is highly relevant to the process in which we find ourselves, that the White House--the President himself--strongly opposes this legislation. The President sent a letter to the Committee at the time of the markup, saying:  
   This administration has been a strong proponent of financial legislation that would reduce costs and increase access to financial services for consumers, businesses and communities. Nevertheless, we cannot support the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, as currently proposed by Chairman GRAMM, now pending before the Senate Banking Committee.  
   They then go on to indicate their difficulties with the Community Reinvestment Act provisions, noting that:  
   It is a law that has helped to build homes, create jobs and restore hopes in communities across America.  
   They reference that:  
   The bill would deny financial services firms the freedom to organize themselves in the way that best serves their customers, prohibits a structure with proven advantages for safety and soundness, which is the op-sub affiliate issue. 
   The bill would provide inadequate consumer protections and, finally, the bill could expand the ability of depository institutions and non-financial firms to affiliate at a time when experience around the world suggests the need for caution in this area.  
   The President concludes that letter by saying:  
   I agree that reform of the laws governing our Nation's financial services industry would promote the public interest. However, I will veto the financial services modernization act if it is presented to me in its current form.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the administration has also just submitted a Statement of Administration Policy, which starts out:  
   The Administration strongly opposes S. 900, which would revise laws governing the financial services industry. This Administration has been a strong proponent of financial modernization legislation that would best serve the interests of consumers, businesses, and communities, while protecting the safety and soundness of our financial system. Consequently, it supports the bill's repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act's prohibition on banks affiliating with securities firms and of the Bank Holding Company Act's prohibitions on insurance underwriting. Nevertheless, because of crucial flaws in the bill, the President has stated that, if the bill were presented to him in its current form, he would veto it.  
   And then it enumerates their concerns with the bill, most of which repeat the points made in the President's letter to the Committee of March 2.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, my colleague from Texas, the chairman of the Committee, indicated in his remarks that he had doubts about the administration's seriousness about the bill. I don't quite know where those doubts come from. But let me simply say that I don't think they could be more serious about it than they have indicated, and I know the very strong feeling that the Secretary of Treasury and indeed the President hold on a number of these issues that we are debating here and seeking to try to resolve on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
   We have this situation where it is clear that unless these concerns enumerated and expressed by the President are resolved in a favorable way we are heading down a path towards a veto. That doesn't seem to me to be the most constructive or productive path on which to proceed in terms of trying to enact legislation. 
   The Democratic Members of the Banking Committee have joined with Senator DASCHLE in introducing Senate bill 753, the Financial Services Act of 1999. That bill largely encompasses the compromises that were developed last year in the bipartisan legislation. 
   It differs in one important respect, and that is with respect to the bank operating subsidiary provisions. I will discuss those in a little more detail  shortly. But that alternative which reflects essentially last year's bipartisan agreement will be offered as an amendment in a the nature of a substitute to S. 900. 
   That in fact will be the first amendment that will be offered. And obviously we expect to do that at the conclusion of opening statements when Members have had an opportunity to make their opening statements. We expect them to go to the alternative, and we will discuss it obviously in some detail. It is I think a very important proposal. 
   If in fact the alternative were substituted for the bill we would be well on the way to getting legislation enacted into law, because it would remove the veto threat at the end of this path and would in effect put the Senate essentially in the same ballpark, although not exactly, with where the House Banking Committee was when it reported out, on a vote of 51 to 8, a bipartisan piece of legislation. 
   It is quite true that bill now has to go through the House Commerce Committee because of the division of jurisdiction on the House side, and presumably differences between how the House Commerce Committee sees issues and how the House Banking Committee has seen them will have to be resolved on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   But at this stage, the first step, what the House Banking Committee has done--I underscore score again on a very strong 51 to 8 vote, an overwhelming bipartisan endorsement--parallels, is very similar, to what is contained in the alternative that we will be offering as an amendment as a substitute for the bill that is now before us. 
   Let me turn to the bill that is now before us with special emphasis on its differences from the Committee reported bill last year with the 16 to 2 vote that we had in the Committee. 
   It is important I think to try to develop a consensus on these issues. The Committee in the past has essentially worked in a nonpartisan way. We have divisions within the Committee but they 
   have not usually been on a straight party basis. 
   I share the regret expressed by the chairman that we have not been able to work this matter out this year in a way to avoid these sharp party differences. But the failure to do so relates back directly to these very critical issues that are at stake. These were issues on which last year we were able to work out accommodations and in fact the provisions we are advancing in the substitute are last year's agreed-upon provisions, the consensus provisions from last year with the one exception of the operating sub-affiliate issue which I will address shortly. 
   Clearly one obvious and extremely important problem with S. 900, the bill now before us, brought out by the Committee is the treatment of the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. The agreement that we have reached in terms of the order of procedure provide that an amendment specifically directed to CRA will be in order as fourth in the line. 
   We set out this order just for the first four amendments in an effort to structure at least the outset of the consideration of this very important legislation. 
   I share the chairman's perception that this is very important legislation. It is an issue we have wrestled with for many years. It pertains to the workings of our financial services industry, which in turn, of course, pertains to the workings of our economy and our position in the international economic scene. These are important matters to which we are addressing ourselves. 
   I echo the chairman's hope that Members will pay close attention. I assume that Members will pay close attention, and that they will come to it with an open mind as they weigh the various considerations that are before us. 
   Let me turn to the CRA provisions. 
   Let me first say that the Community Reinvestment Act, in the judgment of most objective observers, has played a critical role in expanding access to credit and investment in low- and moderate-income communities. We think it has been of critical importance in providing access to credit, which very frankly is, in today's context when we talk about civil rights in terms of economic opportunity, a very important aspect of civil rights. 
   In 1977, the CRA was enacted to encourage banks and thrifts to serve the credit needs of their entire communities. Consistent with safe and sound banking practices, banks and thrifts must serve not just upper-income areas but low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, as well. CRA reflect the view that banks and thrifts receive public benefits such as deposit insurance, access to the Federal Reserve discount window and the Federal Reserve payment system, that they draw deposits out of these communities and that they have a responsibility to make loans into the communities in order to serve the entire community. 
   In fact, the loan-to-deposit ratio is often an important standard to measure the extent to which the institutions drawing deposits out of the community are providing a flow of credit back into those communities. 
   Now, my colleague, the chairman of the Committee, has talked about these very large amounts of money that have been committed for community reinvestment purposes. First of all, let me say those figures are grossly overstated. The figures cited reflect commitments made by financial institutions projected 10 years into the future. They are not the commitments for 1 year. He is upset by the size of them. I wish they were for 1 year. I am not upset by the size of them. I would like to see these kind of commitments made into reinvesting in our communities. In any event, in order to get this debate on an apples and apples basis, I think it is very important to understand that the figures that were being tossed around by the chairman reflect commitments made by the institutions over an extended period of time and not what is going to take place this year. 
   CRA has significantly improved the availability of credit in historically underserved communities. There are any number of success stories. Obviously, we will address those when we turn to the specific CRA amendment. Let me just simply point out that CRA has been credited with a dramatic increase in homeownership by low- and moderate-income individuals. Between 1993 and 1997, private sector home mortgage lending and low- and moderate-income census tracks increased by 45 percent. CRA has helped spur community economic development. The number of loans for small business in low- and moderate-income areas has increased substantially. 
   Now, the chairman says there has been this sharp increase in the amount of commitments. That is true, but there has been a very sharp increase in the amount of mergers and acquisitions which helped to trigger the CRA process. There has been a more receptive attitude toward CRA on the part of the regulatory agencies. In fact, regulatory agencies, community groups, local and State elected officials and many bankers agree that CRA has been beneficial. Chairman Greenspan specified that ``CRA has very significantly increased the amount of credit in communities,'' that the changes have been ``quite profound.''

   Mr. SARBANES. Second, Mr. President, is the provision for a safe harbor for banks with a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating. Actually, what this provision would do is effectively eliminate public comment on CRA performance. Banks that had received a ``satisfactory'' or better rating at the recent exam, and during the preceding 3 years, would be deemed to be in compliance with CRA and immune from public comments on CRA performance. That would be the case unless you had substantial, verifiable information to the contrary--which of course is a very heavy burden of proof. 
   Actually the regulators oppose this. Comptroller of the Currency Hawke stated:  
   Public comment is extremely valuable in providing relevant information to an agency in its evaluation of an application under the CRA, convenience and needs and other applicable standards--even by an institution that has a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating. This amendment would limit or reduce public comment that is useful in our application process. 
   And there is a similar comment from Ellen Seidman, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
   Public comment is useful because many banks or regulators sample only a portion of the markets to determine the institution's CRA rating. Public comment provides an opportunity for community members to point out facts and data that have been overlooked in a particular examination. 
   Actually, 97 percent of the institutions get a ``satisfactory'' rating so you, in effect, are going to exclude out from this CRA review most of the institutions. 
   None of the statistics support these assertions that there are too many challenges, that there is too much delay. In fact the percentages are quite small, in terms of the number of challenges that are filed, and then the number of instances in which the challenge gains any recognition from the regulators. 
   The regulators, of course hear all of the comments. Individuals seeking to comment on other aspects of the bank's performance--financial and managerial resources, or competitive implications--are not going to have their rights similarly curtailed. We do not think the rights on CRA should be so curtailed. We will develop this, of course, later in the debate. 
   Let me now turn very quickly to the small bank exemption. The exemption for the rural institutions would exempt a vast number of institutions in underserved rural areas. It is asserted that these banks by their very nature serve their communities. But small banks have historically received the lowest CRA ratings. In fact, FDIC statistics show that 57 percent of small banks and thrifts have loan-to-deposit ratio below 70 percent, with 17 percent of those having levels below 50 percent.

   Mr. SARBANES. In conclusion, let me simply state, Mr. President, that on this side of the aisle we are very much committed to trying to get financial services modernization legislation. All of us supported it last year. In the Committee again this year we supported legislation which would accomplish that purpose. We do not believe that the bill brought forward by the Committee meets the very important goals which I outlined at the outset. 
   I think the legislation introduced by Senator DASCHLE, and joined in by us, is a balanced, prudent approach to financial services modernization. It reflects last year's carefully struck bipartisan compromises. It is not opposed by any financial services industry actor or player. It is similar to the bill passed, by a broad bipartisan vote, by the House Banking Committee, and it is clearly the approach most likely to achieve the enactment of financial services modernization legislation. 
   If you want to get legislation, given that at the end of the line it must not  only pass the Congress, but be signed by the President, this approach is clearly the one that is most likely to achieve the enactment of financial services modernization legislation. 
   When the opportunity presents itself, I urge my colleagues to shift off the path that is before us and to move on to that path. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I have indicated earlier in the course of the opening debate on this issue, we are very anxious on our side to have financial service modernization legislation, and most of us subscribe to the proposition of allowing affiliations between banks, security firms, and insurance companies. 
   However, as I have indicated, that is not the only issue before us. We have to consider that question in the context of addressing important questions of providing credit in all communities in our country; namely, the Community Reinvestment Act issue. We have to consider how these activities are to be done, whether they are to be done solely in an affiliate, outside of the banking structure, or whether banks will have the opportunity either to use the affiliate or to do it in an operating subsidiary. We have the important issue of the long historical separation between banking and commerce, which has prevailed in this country. And we have other aspects of the legislation which I think are of importance, including important provisions with respect to consumer protection. 
   As we have indicated earlier, we were not able to support this legislation in the committee and the legislation was brought to the floor on an 11-to-9 vote. The alternative, which we have now offered, just offered, and which is at the desk, is, in effect, the bill that the committee reported last year on a 16-to-2 vote with the one substantial change of providing for the operating subsidiary approach. That is now contained in the alternative, the substitute amendment which I have sent to the desk. 
   Last year some very careful compromises were worked out in order to move this legislation forward on a consensus basis. Unfortunately, that has  not been the case this year, and the legislation that was developed in the committee was reported by the majority but contained no supporting vote from any of the Democratic members of the committee. The proposal before us, S. 900, the bill from the committee, is strongly opposed by a great number of civil rights groups, community groups, consumer organizations, and local government officials. People within the financial services industry have mixed views on some of the provisions of S. 900, and of course the President has indicated that he will veto the committee bill. 
   Unfortunately, we have this sharp contrast with last year's bipartisan approach. I think it is fair to say that none of the industry association groups oppose the substitute. They have been caught in the switches, so to speak, on this issue, and subjected to considerable persuasion. But I think it is fair to say that the provisions that are in the substitute will pass muster. These provisions also are fairly close to what the House Banking Committee has done by a 51-to-8 bipartisan vote. So we think the approach contained in the substitute just sent to the desk stands the greatest chance of finally being enacted into law. This substitute amendment, in effect, would put us on a path, at the end of which we could obtain the President's signature and get legislation. 
   Let me briefly seek to contrast the substitute and S. 900, the bill brought from the committee. It should be clearly understood that there is an intense view on this side of the aisle, and I believe shared by at least a few on the other side of the aisle, that the Community Reinvestment Act has really 
   been a very significant and constructive public policy. It has improved the availability of credit in low- and moderate-income communities. There is example after example, and we will put those in the RECORD as this debate develops, where the CRA lending and investments have brought life to previously neglected communities and given people not only hope, but the ability to move up the American ladder of opportunity. It has helped to alleviate credit needs and improve services in rural areas and on Native American reservations. It has had a significant impact on home ownership amongst minority groups, African Americans and Hispanic Americans, whose numbers in terms of home ownership have increased dramatically, and everyone who goes and observes that phenomenon reports back that the CRA has had a considerable role to play in that very important objective. 
   The President has stated:  
   [W]e should all be proud of what [CRA] has meant for low and moderate-income Americans of all races. Although we still have a long way to go in bringing all Americans into the economic mainstream, under CRA the private sector has pumped billions of dollars of credit to build housing, create jobs and restore hope in communities left behind.  
   It is for this reason that farm groups, labor unions, mayors all across the country, community development corporations, Hispanic organizations, Asian American, Native American--this has had a significant impact on the Indian reservations across the country--and civil rights groups all support retaining the effectiveness of CRA. 
   I will include in the RECORD at the end of my remarks letters from these various organizations detailing their very strong view about CRA, and in effect their support for this substitute. 
   The substitute requires that banks should have at least a satisfactory CRA rating before they can affiliate with securities and insurance firms, and that they would have to maintain that rating to continue the new affiliation. These provisions are essential in order to maintain the effectiveness of CRA within the expanded holding company structure. Capital, management, and CRA performance are at issue when an institution files an application for deposit insurance, a charter, a merger, an acquisition or other corporate reorganization, a branch or the relocation of a home office or branch. 
   If you are going to allow banks for the first time in a comprehensive way to engage in insurance and securities activities, then it is important that those banks, before they can do that, meet the CRA test. Otherwise, you are going to have a situation in which financial institutions could enter into additional activities, even if they were deficient in their CRA performance. 
   As the FDIC Chairman, Donna Tanoue stated:  
   The bank and thrift regulatory agencies consistently take into account an insured institution's record of performance under CRA when considering an application to open or relocate a branch, a main office, or acquire or merge with another institution. As this legislation would enable institutions to enter into additional activities, it would seem consistent that CRA compliance should continue to be a determining factor. 
   Last year, we worked out these CRA provisions in the bill that was reported out of the committee. And the consensus, a 16-2 vote, contained these important CRA provisions. 
   This year, the provision requiring a satisfactory rating as a precondition of expanded affiliations is absent from the committee-reported bill. There are two provisions in the committee-reported bill which we feel very strongly contribute to undermining the application of CRA. 
   This substitute amendment, unlike the committee bill, requires banks have and maintain satisfactory CRA ratings in order to engage in and maintain expanded affiliations. To fail to do so would allow banks, for the first time, to move out in terms of the activities they can engage in, in a comprehensive way--both securities and insurance--without the bank that is going to do that having to meet the CRA test. 
   It does not apply, the CRA, to the insurance and securities activities, although many CRA advocates want to do exactly that. It only requires that the bank, as a condition of affiliation, meet the CRA performance standards. 
   As Secretary Rubin has stated:  
   If we wish to preserve the relevance of CRA at a time when the relative importance of bank mergers may decline and the establishment of non-bank financial services will become increasingly important, the authority to engage in newly authorized activities should be connected to a satisfactory CRA performance.  
   Let me turn to the other CRA issues that are, in effect, posed by the substitute as compared to the committee-reported bill. 
   The second provision of the committee bill that weakens CRA is its safe harbor for banks with a ``satisfactory'' or better CRA rating. This is, banks would be deemed in compliance with CRA if they had in each of their three preceding examinations received a satisfactory rating. Groups, in fact, would not be able to comment about CRA performance unless they could carry the very heavy burden of providing substantial, verifiable information to the contrary. 
   The Federal bank regulatory agencies oppose this provision. They agree that a satisfactory CRA rating is not conclusive evidence that a bank is meeting the credit needs of all of its communities. On the contrary, they welcome comments from the public regarding the CRA performance of the institutions they supervise. 
   For example, Ellen Seidman, Director of the Office of Supervision said:  
   [w]e generally find that the information received from those few who do comment on applications is relevant, constructive, and thoughtful, and frequently raise issues that need to be considered. In order for us to reach a supportable disposition on an application, and satisfy our statutory responsibilities, we need to have public input.  
   Public comment is especially useful in the case of large banks serving multiple markets, because regulators sample only a portion of these markets to determine the institution's CRA rating. Public comment provides an opportunity for community members to point out facts and data that may have been overlooked in a particular examination. 
   In fact, the provision that is in the committee bill would preclude looking at anything that took place prior to the past examinations if those examinations produced a satisfactory rating. 
   It is very clear that this safe harbor provision of the committee bill would stifle public comment on banks' and thrifts' CRA performance. This is so because nearly all banks and thrifts receive satisfactory or better CRA ratings, well up into the 90s, 90-percentile figures. 
   The committee majority asserts that the public comment process has been routinely abused, but that assertion is not supported by the record. We get these sort of examples that are brought in. There has never been a full-scale hearing on this issue. All of the statistical information from the regulatory  agencies indicate that there has not been abuse of the public comment process. The vast majority of applications reviewed on CRA grounds are approved in a timely manner. Many do not receive any adverse comments. Very few applications that receive adverse CRA comments are delayed. 
   The substantial, verifiable information would really knock community groups and ordinary citizens out of being able to comment in any meaningful way. As the FDIC Chairman Tanoue stated, ``Public comments relating to CRA should not bear a burden of proof that is not imposed on public comment related to any other aspect of a bank's performance.'' 
   The regulators take in all these comments and then they make their judgment. There seems to be a presumption here that when people come in and make a comment that somehow they then carry the day. Nothing could be further from the truth. The regulators collate all these comments, consider them, and proceed to make their judgment. And the number of instances in which CRA has been raised is a very small percentage of the total. 
   The third way in which the committee bill attacks CRA is the exemption for rural institutions with less than $100 million in assets. This would obviously have very severe consequences for low- and moderate-income rural communities which depend heavily on small banks for their credit needs. 
   It is asserted that these small banks, by their nature, serve the credit needs of their local communities. However, historically, in the ratings made by the regulators, small banks have received the lowest CRA ratings. Although many small banks do serve the needs of their communities, observers note that some small banks often invest in Treasury bonds rather than in their own communities. 
   Some have argued that you need an exemption in order to relieve the regulatory burden. The fact of the matter is, as the Federal bank regulators revised the CRA regulations in 1995 to reduce the cost of compliance for small banks, the new rules provided a streamlined examination for small banks. They exempted small banks from reporting requirements. And they emphasized the institution's actual performance rather than paperwork. 
   The FDIC, the OTS, and the OCC support the application of CRA to small banks. FDIC Chairman Tanoue stated:  
   Although the vast majority of institutions satisfactorily help to meet the credit needs of their communities, not all institutions may do so over time, including small institutions. Some institutions may unreasonably lend outside of their communities, or arbitrarily exclude low- and moderate-income areas or individuals within their communities. We believe that periodic CRA examinations for all insured depository institutions, regardless of asset-size, are an effective means to ensure that institutions help to meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income areas. 
   Before I turn to that subject, let me again stress how critical the flow of credit, which has resulted from CRA, has been to the redevelopment of low- and moderate-income areas. The bill brought out of the committee, S. 900, would really close down opportunity for large numbers of people in these low- and moderate-income communities to really improve themselves, to move to home ownership, to open small businesses, to carry out the sort of community renewal which gives them a better neighborhood in which to live.  
   I have heard these assertions, but we can take you through instance after instance in which the impact of CRA has been such as to provide hope to communities and to lift them up and to enable people to move up the ladder of opportunity. I do not know what could be more consistent with an American goal or objective than to give people this opportunity to advance. And particularly the financial institutions, which are subject to these CRA requirements, are prepared to abide by them. Many of them have given testimony about the beneficial impact it has had on the community and the beneficial impact on their relationship with the community. 
   Let me turn to the banking and commerce issue. Another aspect of the committee bill--and this is an important part of the substitute--that differs significantly from the substitute amendment is its approach to the separation of banking and commerce. In an important respect, the committee bill breaches the separation of banking and commerce, and this could lead to biased lending decisions and may well ultimately put the taxpayer-backed deposit insurance funds at risk. 
   Now, this separation of banking and commerce is a longstanding principle in American law, dating back over now 
   almost 140 years to the National Bank Act of 1864, which specifically forbids banks to engage in or invest in commercial or industrial activities. Under existing law, a commercial firm, such as General Motors or Microsoft, may not own a bank or be owned by a bank. We have tried to draw a line there. There has been some fuzzing of that line, but not much. 
   In 1956, the Congress enacted the Bank Holding Company Act, which prohibited commercial firms from owning banks and prohibited holding companies owning two or more banks from owning commercial firms. This policy was strengthened by the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970, which extended the prohibition on owning commercial firms to holding companies owning just one bank. In other words, it drew a very sharp line. 
   In submitting the 1970 amendments, President Nixon said:  
   The strength of our banking system depends largely on its independence. Banking must not dominate commerce or be dominated by it.  
   Now, why do we have this principle of separating banking and commerce in U.S. law? Because allowing banks to affiliate with commercial firms raises concerns relating to risk to the deposit insurance fund, the impartial granting of credit, unfair competition, and concentration of economic power. A bank affiliated with a commercial firm would have an incentive to make loans to that firm, even if the firm were less creditworthy than other borrowers. The bank would have a similar incentive not to lend to the firm's competitors, even if they were creditworthy. 
   Financial experts have pointed out these dangers. Secretary Rubin testified that mixing banking and commerce:  
   ..... might pose additional, unforeseen and undue risk to the safety and soundness of the financial system, potentially exposing the federal deposit Insurance funds and taxpayers to substantial losses. ..... Equally uncertain is the effect such combinations might have on the cost and availability of credit to numerous diverse borrowers and on the concentration of economic resources.  
   The leading economist Henry Kaufman warned that mixing banking and commerce would lead to conflicts of interest and unfair competition in the allocation of credit. In his view:  
   ..... a large corporation that controls a big bank would use the bank for extending credit to those who can benefit the whole organization. ..... The bank would be inclined to withhold credit from those who are or could be competitors to the parent corporation. Thus, the cornerstone of effective banking, independent credit decisions based on objective evaluation of creditworthiness, would be undermined.  
   Public interest groups have made the same point. Consumers Union testified that it opposes:  
   ..... permitting federally-insured institutions to combine with commercial interests because of the potential to skew the availability of credit, conflict of interest issues, and general safety and soundness concerns from expanding the safety net provided by the government.  
   The difficulties experienced in Asia demonstrate the risks associated with mixing banking and commerce. Both Secretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan testified that the financial crisis in Asia was made worse by imprudent lending by banks to affiliated commercial firms. In other words, if you cross that line and put the commercial firm in the bank--as it were, in the same pot--you run a heavy risk, as was exemplified in the Asian financial crisis, of imprudent lending. 
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wrote, recent experience with the banking crises in countries as different in their stages of development as Japan, Indonesia and Russia demonstrate the folly of permitting industrial financial conglomerates to dominate financial markets in potentially large areas of the economy. 
   The substitute amendment tries to sustain this line between banking and commerce. The committee bill crosses this line in a number of respects. 
   First of all, it permits bank affiliates to acquire any type of company in connection with merchant banking activities. However, the committee bill drops  certain safeguards that are in the substitute and that were in last year's bipartisan bill. Those safeguards allowed merchant banking investment to be held only for such period of time as would permit the sale of the investment on a reasonable basis. It precluded the bank affiliate from actively participating in the day-to-day management of the company. 
   The committee bill drops those safeguards. In effect, it would allow a bank holding company to operate commercial companies of any size and in any industry for an unlimited period of time. This would break down the separation of banking and commerce. 
   The substitute restores the safeguards that were in last year's bill. 
   Secondly, both the committee bill and the substitute amendment allow holding companies that own banks to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities. 
   But the committee bill goes further by authorizing holding companies to engage in activities that are complementary activities that are financial in nature. It provides no definition or limitation of these complementary activities and, therefore, raises the danger that these complementary activities would be commercial in nature and cross the separation between banking and commerce. The substitute does not permit those complementary activities. 
   Finally, the committee bill does not close the unitary thrift company loophole. That loophole refers to the fact that a company that owns just one thrift, called a unitary thrift holding company, may also own a commercial firm. There are currently over 500 thrifts owned by unitary holding companies. The vast majority of these are owned by financial firms. Now, both the committee bill and the substitute would prohibit the creation of new unitary thrift holding companies by commercial firms. However, there is a sharp difference in that the committee bill would allow a commercial company to acquire any of the 500 existing unitary thrift holding companies. 
   Now, obviously, if they can do that, if hundreds of commercial firms, in effect, can acquire a unitary thrift holding company, they can effectively obliterate the separation between banking and commerce. Financial leaders and banking industry groups advise the committee to prohibit commercial firms from acquiring control of thrifts. Chairman Greenspan recommended that financial services modernization legislation at least prohibit, or significantly restrict, the ability of grandfather unitary thrift holding companies to transfer their legislatively created grandfather rights to another commercial organization. 
   Secretary Rubin observed that, ``without such a limit on transferability, existing charters may tend to migrate to commercial firms and could become a significant exception to the general prohibition against commercial ownership of depository institutions.'' 
   Both the ABA and IBAA--the American Bankers Association and the Independent Bankers Association of America--wrote to Senators yesterday expressing their support for closing the unitary thrift holding company provision, including restricting transferability of existing unitaries. 
   Now, let me turn briefly to some important consumer protection provisions that are in the substitute amendment, but that are not in the committee bill, and which we think make the substitute more desirable legislation than the committee bill. 
   Obviously, if you are going to have a financial services modernization bill, you must ensure adequate consumer protection. We need to be sure that consumer protections keep pace with changes taking place in the financial market. In recent years, banking securities and insurance products have become more similar. A wider variety of financial products is available through banks. This increases potential customer confusion about the risks of the product the customer is buying, who is selling it, and whether or not it is insured by the FDIC. Measures such as disclosure to customers and licensing of personnel can help keep such misunderstandings to a minimum, and such a provision should be included in any financial services modernization bill. 
   Unfortunately, the committee bill fails to include a number of important consumer protection provisions that passed the committee overwhelmingly last year, and which we have now included in the substitute that is now before the body. 
   Very quickly, on insurance sales, while some of the provisions of last year's bill relating to insurance sales have been substituted into the committee bill--that was done in the committee--but more remains to be done. The substitute amendment would require Federal bank regulators to establish mechanisms for receiving and addressing consumer complaints--something that is completely absent in the committee bill. 
   The substitute amendment would provide that Federal regulations would supersede State regulations when the Federal regulations afforded greater protection for consumers. The committee bill allows State regulations to prevail even if it offers less protection to consumers. 
   With respect to securities activities, the committee bill provides less protection for consumers than does the substitute amendment. 
   Currently, banks enjoy a total exemption from the definitions of ``broker,'' ``dealer'' and ``investment advisor'' under the Federal securities law. Because of this blanket exemption, consumers who purchase securities from banks do not receive any of the protections of the securities laws, which in many ways are superior to those offered by the banking laws. For example, broker-dealer personnel have an obligation to recommend to their clients only transactions that are suitable based on their client's tolerance for risk, overall portfolio, and so forth. 
   Bank personnel have no such obligation. Broker-dealer personnel must pass licensing exams and are subject to continuing education requirements. Bank personnel are exempt from these requirements. Disciplinary histories of broker-dealer personnel are made publicly available to 
   investors. No such history is available regarding bank personnel. Broker-dealer managers have a duty to supervise their sales personnel, which is enforceable under the Federal securities laws. Bank managers do not. 
   Finally, customer disputes with brokerage firms are subject to arbitration, which offers a specialized, quicker and cheaper forum for settling disputes. No arbitration exists for customer disputes with banks. 
   Now, the committee bill, like the substitute amendment, would repeal the total exemption banks enjoy from the definition of broker and dealer. Also, like the substitute amendment, the committee bill contains a number of exceptions that allow certain securities activities to continue to take place directly within banks. However, the exceptions in the committee bill are significantly wider than those in the substitute amendment. Let me just mention some of those important differences. 
   The committee bill allows a bank trust department conducting securities transactions to be compensated on a transaction-by-transaction basis, just like a broker. Where the substitute amendment allows a bank to sell unregistered securities exclusively to sophisticated investors, the committee bill allows a bank to sell unregistered securities to all investors. 
   Finally, the committee bill prohibits the SEC from determining that a new product is a security and, therefore, must be sold by an SEC-registered broker-dealer, unless the Federal Reserve concurs. Over time, this will move even more securities activities directly into banks. The substitute amendment would afford the SEC the first opportunity to define new products as securities. 
   The committee bill also leaves the SEC with less authority over bank-advised mutual funds and with less ability to protect investors in those funds. 
   Now, the substitute amendment requires the Federal banking regulators to issue regulations regarding the sale of securities by banks and bank affiliates. The bank regulators would have established mechanisms to review and address consumer complaints. The committee bill does not include this provision. 
   No one of these provisions that I made reference to may seem to be of major import. But all of them taken together, I think, indicate that the protections for consumers that are contained in the substitute amendment  significantly exceed those that are in the committee-reported bill. 
   Another area in which the committee bill departs from last year's agreement regards a special deposit insurance assessment paid by thrifts. 
   Prior to 1996, thrifts paid a higher assessment rate than banks did for interest payments on certain bonds issued to pay for the resolution of the savings and loan crisis, so-called ``FICO bonds.'' In 1996, Congress acted to close this assessment differential on FICO bonds. The rates were to be equalized until January 1, 2000, and the bill that we reported last year left the 1996 agreement intact. The committee bill now before us would extend this assessment differential for another 3 years, so that thrifts would continue to pay a higher assessment rate for another 3 years. 
   This may well lead institutions to shift their deposits from the thrift insurance fund to the bank insurance fund, which might well create stability problems for the thrift insurance fund. 
   Chairman Tanoue has written that this provision serves no positive public policy purpose. And it is not in the substitute amendment that is now before us. 
   Let me now turn to an issue in which my colleague, the chairman of the committee, has spent a considerable amount of time here on the floor today in pointing out the differences between the substitute that is now before us and the committee 
   bill. 
   All of these provisions I have thus far enumerated were essentially contained in the bill that was reported last year by the committee on a 16-to-2 vote. The one area in which the substitute amendment differs from last year's bipartisan bill is its treatment of operating subsidiaries and banks. 
   Last year's bill contemplated that principal activities, such as underwriting securities and insurance, would take place in a holding company's subsidiary rather than bank subsidiaries. Certain agency activities such as sales of insurance were permitted in bank subsidiaries. 
   This approach was supported by the Federal Reserve. It was opposed by the Treasury Department. That was an important difference last year. It remains an important difference this year. 
   As the legislative process has proceeded, the Treasury Department has agreed to significant additional safeguards regarding the scope and regulation of bank subsidiaries' activities. With these safeguards, it appeared to us that banks should be given the option of conducting financial activities in operating subsidiaries. That approach is contained in the substitute amendment now before the Chamber. 
   President Clinton has indicated that he will veto the reported bill in part because ``it would deny financial services firms the freedom to organize themselves in a way that best serves their customers.'' 
   Let me talk a bit about the safeguards, the changes in the sense that the Treasury has agreed to, which I think now warrant allowing the banking institution to have a choice. They wouldn't be required to do it in an op-sub. They could still do it in an affiliate. They could have a choice between the two as a matter of their own organizational preference. 
   Last year, the Treasury was clear that they would not do real estate in the operating-sub. And they continue to hold to that position this year. In addition, the Treasury last year agreed that insurance underwriting may not take place in a bank subsidiary. This prohibition on insurance underwriting would be in addition to an explicit prohibition on real estate development conducted by bank subsidiaries to which the Treasury agreed last year. So we have these two areas now that were provided for and placed outside of the op-sub umbrella. 
   On merchant banking, the Treasury has agreed that the Federal Reserve shall have the authority to define merchant banking activities and bank subsidiaries. This meaningful step on the part of the Treasury will contribute to bank subsidiary activities being structured in a prudent fashion. 
   Merchant banking presents a potential breach in the separation of banking and commerce. The possible dangers would be increased if two different regulators were to define separately the dimensions of permissible merchant banking activities. Then to avoid the possibility that would happen--that the dimensions of the permissible merchant banking activities would be defined by two different regulators who would have different concepts--in the substitute, we have the provision that the Federal Reserve would have the exclusive authority to define merchant banking activities and bank subsidiaries. 
   The Treasury has also agreed that the Secretary and the Federal Reserve should jointly determine which activities are financial in nature, both for a holding company subsidiary and for a bank subsidiary. Both the Secretary and the Federal Reserve would jointly issue regulations and interpretations under ``the financial in nature'' standard. This would eliminate a potential competition between bank regulators. 
   Further, to place activities on an equal footing, the same conditions would apply to a national bank seeking to exercise expanded affiliation through a subsidiary as a holding company seeking to exercise those affiliations. These conditions are that banks be well capitalized, well managed, and in compliance with CRA. 
   The Treasury also supports the application of the functional regulation of securities and insurance activities taking place in bank subsidiaries just as it applies to holding company subsidiaries. 
   These provisions are all reflected in the substitute amendment. 
   In addition, the Treasury supports a requirement that national banks with total assets of $10 billion or more retain a holding company, even if they choose to engage in expanded financial activities through subsidiaries. This is designed to preserve the oversight that the Federal Reserve now has over the Nation's largest commercial banks through their holding company. So this was an effort by the Treasury to accommodate one of the concerns that had been repeatedly expressed by the Federal Reserve. 
   Furthermore, the substitute amendment contains certain additional safeguards that the Treasury Department now supports for financial services modernization legislation. Every dollar of a bank's investment in a subsidiary would be deducted from the bank's capital for regulatory purposes. In this way, the 
   bank would have to remain well capitalized, even after deducting the investment in the subsidiary, and even should it lose its entire investment. 
   Secondly, a bank could not invest in a subsidiary in an amount exceeding the amount the bank would pay to a holding company as a dividend. 
   And, thirdly, the strict limits that now apply to transactions between banks and their affiliates would apply to transactions between banks and their subsidiaries. 
   These restrict extensions of credit from banks to their affiliates guaranteed by banks for the benefit of their affiliates and purchases of assets by banks from their affiliates. All such transactions must be at arm's length, and fully collateralized, and the total amount of such transactions between a bank and all of the affiliates is limited. 
   In total, these safeguards pertaining to the regulation of bank subsidiaries should eliminate any economic benefit that may exist when activities are conducted in bank subsidiaries rather than holding company subsidiaries. 
   The provisions regarding the scope of activities permitted for bank subsidiaries should remove any opportunity for regulators to compete with one another to the detriment of the safety and soundness of the banking system, or the separation of banking and commerce.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing on behalf of myself, Mr. HUTCHINSON, and Mr. TORRICELLI, legislation to create a National Military Museum Foundation. The purpose of this legislation is to encourage and facilitate private-sector support in the effort to preserve, interpret and display the important role the military has played in the history of our nation. This legislation is, in my judgment, crucial at this particular moment in history, when we are on the verge of jeopardizing two-centuries worth of military artifacts and negating the possibility of such collections in the future. 
   It has been the long-standing tradition of the U.S. Department of War and its successor, the Department of Defense, to preserve our historic military artifacts. Since the days of the revolution to the conflict in Bosnia, Americans have been proud of the role that our military has had in safeguarding our democracy, and we have tried to ensure that future generations will know that role. Over the years we have accumulated a priceless collection of military artifacts from every period of American history and every technological era. The collection includes flags, uniforms, weapons, paintings and historic records as well as full-size tanks, ships and aircraft which document history and provide provenance for our nation and armed services. 
   In recent years, however, the dedicated individuals who identify, interpret, catalog and showcase those artifacts have found themselves shortchanged and shorthanded. With financial resources diminishing, not only are we cheating ourselves out of the military treasures currently warehoused out of public sight, but we are in danger of lacking the funds to update our collections with new items. 
   ``A morsel of genuine history,'' wrote Thomas Jefferson to John Adams in 1817, ``is a thing so rare as to be always valuable.'' Mr. President, today, significant pieces of our military history are being lost, shoved into basements, or subject to decay. With each year also comes less funding, and our artifacts are multiplying at a pace that exceeds the capabilities of those who are trying to preserve them. Since 1990 alone, the services have closed 21 military museums and at least eight more are expected to close in the next few years. 
   We cannot let this proceed any further. Military museums are vital to documenting our history, educating our citizenry and advancing our technology. More than 86 museums in 31 states and the District of Columbia daily instill Americans from veterans to new recruits to elementary school students with a sense of the sacred responsibility that military servicemen bear to defend the values that have made this country great. 
   Military museums teach our servicemen the history of their units, enhancing their understanding both of the team of which they are a part and the significance of the service they have pledged to perform. And when a museum makes history come alive to young children, those children learn for themselves that what this country stands for and the sacrifices that have been made to preserve the freedoms we often take for granted. 
   Many of our servicemen have learned their military history through these artifacts rather than textbooks, and many of our technological advances have come as a direct result of these artifacts. The ship models and ordinances at U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, MD, for example, have been used by the Academy's Departments of Gunnery and Seamanship. It has also been reported that a study of an existing missile system, preserved in an Army museum, saves the Strategic Defense Initiative $25 million in research and analysis costs. These museums serve as laboratories where engineers can learn from the lessons of the past without going through the same trial and error process as their predecessors. 
   Yet without adequate funding, these benefits will be lost forever. According to a 1994 study conducted by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation entitled, ``Defense Department Compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act,'' the Department of Defense's management of these resources has been ``mediocre,'' with the cause attributed to ``inadequate staffing and funding.'' 
   More than 80 percent of the museums studied said their survival relies heavily on outside funding. When asked about their greatest needs, the response was nearly always staff and money. And those museums that reported sufficient staffing from volunteers nevertheless said that the dearth of funds for restoration and construction paralyzed them from fully utilizing the available labor. 
   According to the study, money is so tight that brochures and pamphlets are often unaffordable, leaving visitors with no explanations about the objects that have come to see. A young child might be duly impressed by the sight of a stern-faced general, but the historical lesson is greatly diminished if the child is not told the significance of the event portrayed or why the general looked so grim that day. 
   Perhaps most distressing, the study reported ``substantial collections of rare or unique historical military vehicles and equipment that are unmaintained and largely unprotected due to lack of funds and available expertise.'' In addition, the museums were found to be struggling so much with the care of items already in house, that they were unable to accept new ones. With a new class of military artifacts from the Vietnam and Gulf Wars soon to be retired, one wonders whether those artifacts will be preserved. If 
   we do not take action to save what we have and acquire what we don't, future generations will see these pockets of negligence as blank pages in the living history books that these museums truly are. 
   Only a Foundation can address these problems. The alternate solution--to press the services to devote more money to these institutions--is implausible in this budgetary climate. The Secretary of Defense must place his highest priority on the readiness of our forces. Closely allied to that priority is the effort to improve the quality of life for our citizens on active duty. And, as aging equipment faces obsolescence, the Secretary has indicated that the future will bring an increased emphasis on replacing weapons systems. By all realistic assumptions, the amount of funds appropriated for museums is likely to continue downward. 
   My bill recognizes the growing need for a reliable source of funding aside from federal appropriations. A National Military Museum Foundation would provide an accessible venue for individuals, corporations or other private sources to support the preservation of our priceless military artifacts and records. A National Military Museum Foundation could also play an important role in surveying those artifacts that we know to exist. Currently, these is no museum oversight or coordination of museum activities on the DOD level. A wide-ranging Foundation survey would therefore not only eliminate duplication, but would most likely discover gaps in our collections that must be filled before it is too late.  
   Under the proposed legislation, the Secretary of Defense would appoint the Foundation's Board of Directors and provide basic administrative support. To launch the Foundation, the legislation authorizes an initial appropriation of $1 million. It is anticipated that the Foundation would be self sufficient after the first year. This is a small price to pay to save some of our most precious treasures. 
   This legislation is modeled on legislation that established similar foundations, such as the National Park Foundation and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, both of which have succeeded in raising private-sector support for conservation programs. My bill is not intended to supplant existing Federal funding or other foundation efforts that may be underway, but rather to supplement those efforts. 
   The premise for establishing a national foundation is, in part, to elevate the level of fund raising beyond the local level, supplementing those efforts by seeking donations from potentially large donors. I also want to emphasize the inclusiveness of the Foundation, which will represent all the branches of our armed services. 
   Mr. President, statistics reveal that foundations established without the mandate of a federal statute and the backing of an established agency seldom succeed. With ever-diminishing federal funds, we cannot expect the Department to put our military museums ahead of national security. Truly, an outside source committed to sustaining our museums is imperative. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I call to the attention of my colleagues the recent Community-Wide Memorial Observance of Yom HaShoah V'Hagvurah held at Temple Beth Ami in Rockville, Maryland. I had the privilege of participating in this Holocaust remembrance ceremony sponsored by the Jewish Community Council of Greater Washington. I commend Temple Beth Ami for hosting this annual event and the Jewish Community Council for providing the community in Maryland and the Washington, D.C. area with so many valuable services year-round. 
   The Holocaust represents the most tragic human chapter of the 20th century when six million Jews perished as the result of a systematic and deliberate policy of annihilation. Holocaust remembrance is an effort to pay homage to the victims and educate the public about the painful lessons of this horrible tragedy. 
   As my colleagues are aware, this month marks the 54th year since the beginning of the liberation of the Nazi death camps in Europe and the 56th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The occasion also is an opportunity to remember the plight of the passengers aboard the S.S. St. Louis who sought to rebuild their shattered lives outside Europe. Most of the 937 men, women and children who fled Germany on the St. Louis on May 13, 1939 were seeking refuge from Nazi persecution but were turned back months before the outbreak of World War II. 
   In his moving remarks at Temple Beth Ami, Benjamin Meed, the President of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and a survivor himself of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, spoke eloquently before this assembly of the importance of overcoming indifference to genocide. Ben Meed has dedicated himself to working hard along with many other survivors to ensure that the memory of millions is still with us, and I believe that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is a fitting and exceptional tribute to his efforts. In his words, the Holocaust Museum is ``the culmination of our devotion to Remembrance.'' 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Benjamin Meed's remarks at Temple Beth Ami be entered into the RECORD at this point.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Low Vision Information Center, LVIC, located in Bethesda, Maryland. This unique center provides  critical help to visually impaired individuals and their families. 
   Low vision is the third leading cause of disability in the United States whose causes, among others, include macular degeneration and glaucoma. Low vision is a life altering condition which prevents millions of Americans from performing ostensibly elementary tasks such as reading, walking without aid, dialing the telephone, and even recognizing the faces of family and friends. Unlike other vision complications, low vision cannot be corrected with glasses and contacts, nor are there medical or surgical solutions available. There are, however, research and rehabilitation centers which address low vision, including Maryland's own Johns Hopkins Lions Vision Research and Rehabilitation Center at the Wilmer Eye Institute, which research the condition and help formulate ways in which the challenges posed by low vision can be reduced. 
   The LVIC provides a related but unique service. Established 20 years ago, LVIC is dedicated to helping individuals with low vision cope with daily tasks in a home-like setting with the most up-to-date technology, LVIC has served more than 40,000 clients and their families during its 20-year history. Currently, LVIC staff and volunteers see up to 150 clients a month in their downtown Bethesda office. LVIC helps people with everything from successfully pouring a cup of coffee, to writing personal checks, to learning how to use a talking watch. Additionally, LVIC often shows vision professionals what it is like to suffer from low vision by providing them with goggles that simulate various eye afflictions. Staff and volunteers also visit senior centers and nursing homes to educate this populace about low vision. 
   Mr. President, it has always been my firm belief that public service is one of the most honorable callings, one that demands the very best, most dedicated efforts of those fortunate enough to serve their fellow citizens. LVIC provides a critical public service to countless individuals in our society, both by directly helping those who suffer from low vision, and by educating professionals and lay people alike on the causes, symptoms and technology available relating to low vision. I am pleased to join with all of LVIC's clients and their families, staff and volunteers in celebrating 20 years of public service that has significantly improved the quality of life for low vision individuals in our society.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference report now before us on the budget resolution. 
   The Congressional budget process as we know it is 25 years old this year. Silver anniversaries such as this one are important milestones, but this year's budget resolution provides no cause for celebration. For a number of reasons, I am deeply disappointed in the resolution that my Republican colleagues appear determined to adopt today. 
   First are issues of process. As a member of the Budget Committee, I have been disappointed in the amount of time that we have had available to study the budget proposals before us. Consideration in committee, on the Senate floor, and now in relation to this conference report has been marked by the absence of detailed, written proposals that would provide the basis for sound decisions. 
   Indeed, I understand that at the conference on this resolution, there was not even a draft resolution to which members could react. After less than 6 hours of consideration, and with no text available, the conference committee hurriedly approved this report early Wednesday morning. The Senate has not had the chance to give the measure a proper review, yet here we are the very next day asked to approve a $1.4 trillion budget. It is troubling that the majority's desire to beat today's statutory April 15 deadline has prevailed over thoughtful consideration and debate. The result of this haste and the deficient policy making process will be quite clear to the American people once they understand this budget's real implications. 
   Mr. President, I believe that this budget will take the country in the wrong direction. We are now in the 96th month of the longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history. We are truly in a virtuous economic cycle, as growth reached 6.1 percent in the last quarter of 1998, and 3.9 percent for the year. 1998 was the sixth year of such steady growth, a pattern of robust increases that many economists once thought unsustainable over such long periods. 
   I am proud to have been a part of the effort in 1993 that helped to create this  positive economic climate. Working together, President Clinton and congressional Democrats crafted a package that finally brought the federal deficit under control. By making difficult but critical decisions to cut federal programs and raise revenues, we tamed the deficits that plagued the Nation throughout the 1980s, placed enormous pressure on important federal initiatives, and hampered our economic growth. Most Republicans argued at the time that this responsible package would ruin the economy and send markets tumbling. They were dead wrong. 
   Thanks to the strong economy and the fiscal discipline begun in 1993, the country is in a fiscal position no one dreamed possible even two years ago. In 1997, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and nearly everyone else were predicting substantial budget deficits far into the next decade--as high as $159 billion in fiscal year 2000, $153 billion in fiscal year 2002, and continuing for the foreseeable future. Earlier in the decade, OMB estimates for the 2002 deficit ran as high as $576 billion. This year, those forecasts have been turned upside down. CBO's recent projections call for unified budget surpluses rising from $131 billion in fiscal year 2000 to $381 billion if fiscal year 2009. 
   The budget resolution before us will seriously endanger this hard-won progress, and will short-change national priorities that the American people have clearly indicated they want to see addressed. Depending upon one's point of view, this is either the last budget of the old millennium, or the first of the new. In either case, it is an opportunity for us to think seriously about our Nation's needs and priorities as we look into the next century, and chart an appropriate course for the future. This budget, however, is less a forward-looking policy blueprint than a political document aimed at short-term gain. 
   This is unfortunate, because as we look toward the future we face some very real challenges, the most significant of which will come in Medicare and Social Security. Together, these are two of the crowning achievements of American government, and have lifted literally millions of older Americans out of poverty. These programs have worked, and continue to work every day for our senior citizens and their families. 
   To prepare the country for the future, any budget that we pass must meet several criteria. It must extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. It must recognize the magnitude of these obligations in a forthright way, and include a mechanism to boost national savings and economic growth, so that we are in a better position to meet them. It should be designed to reduce, not increase, the growing income disparities that can fray our social fabric. Finally, it should protect other important national priorities. Support for communities, scientific research, veterans benefit, education, environmental protection, and the like should not be sacrificed for tax breaks for the well-to-do. 
   This proposal fails to meet any of these criteria. Instead, it appears tailor-made to accommodate the majority's priority of huge tax cuts for the wealthy. While the total available for tax cuts starts off at $15 billion in fiscal year 2000, that mushrooms to $142 billion over 5 years and $778 billion over the next 10 years. Who will benefit from these tax cuts? If past is prologue, lower and middle income Americans will not. Capital gains cuts, repeal of estate taxes, and more corporate loopholes all give tax relief where it is least needed--to those already at the top of the income scale. These have been part and parcel of previous Republican tax cut packages, and there is no reason to suspect that this year will be any different. 
   The Republican budget would require devastating, unsustainable cuts in critical programs that serve millions of Americans. In order to provide massive increases in defense outlays while trying to stay under the discretionary caps passed 2 years ago, this plan makes dramatic cuts in almost every other area of government. According to estimates from the Office of Management and Budget, the combination of defense increases, protection of a select few programs, and retention of the budget caps would force spending reductions in non-defense discretionary programs of $26.9 billion in fiscal year 2000 alone. This would require an unprecedented across-the-board cut of over 11 percent in real terms from fiscal year 1999 levels across a broad array of important government functions. 
   On top of these huge cuts, this budget will cripple important programs far into the future in order to fund the majority's tax cuts. After the current spending caps expire, any future increases would be held to well under the rate of inflation. This means that every year, important functions will continue to suffer real cutbacks amounting to billions of dollars. Incredibly, discretionary levels in 2009--10 years from now--will be just 2.6 percent over those enacted this fiscal year, 1999. This will not even begin to make up for losses to inflation, to say nothing of increased needs caused by a growing population. 
   I also must note that the conference report does not specifically call for continuation of the traditional parity in pay increases between military and civilian government employees. I successfully sponsored an amendment to maintain this parity in S. 4, the military pay increase bill passed by the Senate earlier this session, and I urge the Senate to continue its support for this principle as the appropriations process moves forward. 
   Mr. President, this budget proposal falls far short of the mark in almost every important respect. It would harm important programs ranging from Head Start to the FBI, from air traffic control to food safety inspections, while providing a huge tax cut for the wealthy. 
   The plan utterly fails to meet the most fundamental tests--it does not extend the solvency of Social Security in any way, and does nothing meaningful to address the more immediate problems in Medicare. When Democrats introduced amendments in the Budget Committee and on the floor that would specifically put saving Social Security and Medicare ahead of the Republican tax cut, the measures were defeated. Republicans opposed Social Security and Medicare at their inception, and this budget resolution shows that they still do not see how important these programs are to millions of individuals. The Republican priorities evident in this resolution simply are not shared by most of the American people. 
   I strongly oppose this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week from April 11-17 we are celebrating the 41st anniversary of ``National Library Week.'' As a strong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives to strengthen and protect libraries, I am pleased to take this opportunity to draw my colleagues' attention to this important occasion and to take a few moments to reflect on the significance of libraries to our nation. 
   When the free public library came into its own in this country in the 19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because of its commitment to the same principle of free and open exchange of ideas as the Constitution itself. Libraries have always been an integral part of all that our country embodies: freedom of information, an educated citizenry, and an open and enlightened society. They are the only public agencies in which the services rendered are intended for, and available to, every segment of our society. 
   It has been my longstanding view that libraries play an indispensable role in our communities. From modest beginnings in the mid-19th century, today's libraries provide well-stocked reference centers and wide-ranging loan services based on a system of branches, often further supplemented by travelling libraries serving outlying districts. Libraries promote the reading of books among adults, adolescents, and children and provide the access and resources to allow citizens to obtain reliable information on a vast array of topics. 
   Libraries gain even further significance in this age of rapid technological advancement where they are called upon to provide not only books and periodicals, but many other valuable resources as well. In today's society, libraries provide audio-visual materials, computer services, internet access terminals, facilities for community lectures and performances, tapes, records, videocassettes, and works of art for exhibit and loan to the public. In addition, special facilities libraries provide services for older Americans, people with disabilities, and hospitalized citizens. 
   Of course, libraries are not merely passive repositories of materials. They are engines of learning--the place where a spark is often struck for disadvantaged citizens who for whatever reason have not had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge available. I have the greatest respect for those individuals who are members of the library community and work so hard to ensure that our citizens and communities continue to enjoy the tremendous rewards available through our library system. 
   My own State of Maryland has 24 public library systems providing a full range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long tradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. This policy has been enhanced by the State Library Network which provides interlibrary loans to the State's public, academic, special libraries and school library media centers. The Network receives strong support from the State Library Resource Center at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, the Regional Library Resource Centers in Western, Southern, and Eastern Shore counties, and a Statewide database of holdings totalling 178 libraries. 
   The result of this unique joint State-County resource sharing is an extraordinary level of library services available to the citizens of Maryland. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding service by borrowing more public library materials per person than citizens of almost any other State, with 67 percent of the State's population registered as library patrons.  
   I have had a close working relationship with members of the Maryland Library Association and others involved in the library community throughout the State, and I am very pleased to join with them and citizens throughout the nation in this week's celebration of ``National Library Week.'' I look forward to a continued close association with those who enable libraries to provide the unique and vital services available to all Americans.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today the Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee--myself, Senators DODD, KERRY, BRYAN, JOHNSON, REED, SCHUMER, BAYH, and EDWARD--are joining with the Democratic Leader, Senator DASCHLE, in introducing the Financial Services Act of 1999. 
   Senator DASCHLE and the Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee strongly support financial services modernization legislation. Last year, every Democratic member of the Committee voted for financial services modernization in the form of H.R. 10, the Financial Services Act of 1998. That bill was reported by the Committee on a bipartisan vote of 16 to 2. In a Committee markup of financial services legislation on March 4 of this year, every Democratic member of the Committee voted for financial services modernization in the form of a substitute amendment that I offered. The substitute amendment contained the text of last year's bill with the addition of a provision that would permit banks to conduct expanded financial service activities through operating subsidiaries. The substitute amendment was defeated on a party line vote of 11 to 9. 
   The bill being introduced today consists of the substitute amendment that was offered in the Banking Committee markup. We introduce this legislation because it meets certain basic goals. These include permitting affiliations among firms within the financial services industry, preserving the safety and soundness of the financial system, protecting consumers, maintaining the separation of banking and commerce, and expanding access to credit for all communities in our country. Unfortunately, the bill reported out of the Senate Banking Committee does not meet these goals and was opposed by every Democratic member of the Committee. 
   We are disappointed that the Committee Majority has abandoned the consensus so carefully developed last year. The broad, bipartisan margin of support enjoyed by last year's bill reflected the compromises struck during  the course of its consideration. It was not opposed by a single major financial services industry association. 
   The legislation being introduced today reflects compromises among Committee Members and among industry groups on a wide range of issues, including the Community Reinvestment Act, consumer protections, and the separation of banking and commerce. The decision by the Committee Majority to abandon these compromises has resulted in less than unanimous industry support for the Committee-passed bill. In addition, civil rights groups, community groups, consumer organizations, and local government officials strongly oppose the Committee-passed bill. 
   We are disappointed as well that the Committee Majority has refused to recognize that enactment of financial services legislation entails accommodation of views not only of members of the Congress, but in particular the view of the White House and the Treasury Department. On March 2, before the Committee's markup, President Clinton wrote:  
   This Administration has been a strong proponent of financial legislation that would reduce costs and increase access to financial services for consumers, businesses, and communities ..... I agree that reform of the laws governing our nation's financial services industry would promote the public interest. However, I will veto the Financial Services Modernization Act if it is presented to me in its current form.  
   The President warned that the bill ``would undermine the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act,'' ``would deny financial services firms the freedom to organize themselves in the way that best serve their customers,'' ``would ..... provide inadequate consumer protections,'' and ``could expand the ability of depository institutions and nonfinancial firms to affiliate .....'' None of these concerns was fully addressed by the Committee Majority at markup. Unless the concerns of the Administration are addressed, it is clear the Committee-passed bill will not be enacted into law. 
   We believe the bill we are introducing today is a balanced, prudent approach to financial services modernization legislation. It could not only be passed by the Congress, but signed into law by the President. It is clearly the approach most likely to lead to the enactment of financial services modernization legislation in this Congress.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from Oregon for joining in this initiative. This is an effort to focus attention on the need to provide adequate funding for International Affairs, the so-called 150 account, which is essential for maintaining our security and building peace. U.S. international leadership requires effective diplomacy, which is in many ways our first line of defense. If we do it effectively, we do not have to resort to using our military strength. 
   I want to make it very clear that the chairman of the Budget Committee has been sensitive to this problem. We appreciate the constraints within which the committee has had to work, and in the past the chairman has been responsive to our concern. 
   Secretary Albright, of course, has just made some very strong statements about how pressed and handicapped she feels by the funding levels proposed in this budget. This amendment is an effort to show that the Members of this body recognize the importance of providing the necessary resources for the conduct of U.S. diplomacy, and our intention, as we move through this budget process, to find additional funds with which to address the programs in the 150 account. 
   We have an urgent and sustained requirement to provide for upgrades in embassy security. We do not want to take that out of the other international programs, because that account is already at rock bottom--indeed, below rock bottom. 
   Mr. President, recently I received a letter from the Coalition for American Leadership Abroad, which stated in part: 
   We are deeply concerned that over the last decade our institutions, programs, and the necessary resources to support diplomacy, America's front line in today's world, have been seriously impacted by budget cuts. Our organization, the Coalition for American Leadership Abroad (COLEAD), a nonpartisan coalition of 37 non-profit foreign affairs organizations, seeks to support and strengthen American engagement in world affairs. We believe that we should not withdraw from the world and that American leadership in world affairs is not only vital for our national interests and security but also to build a better world community. We should not turn our backs on the 95% of mankind beyond our borders. 
   U.S. funding for our diplomatic effort, in its many forms, has decreased by some 50% in real terms over the past dozen years. We are especially concerned about the projected downward trend in the foreign affairs budget for the next three years. Thus, we need to restore a rational sense of balance and proportion to our funding allocations for programs that preserve and protect our interests abroad. Effective American diplomatic leadership cannot exist without resources. We strongly believe that the time has come to examine American interests and programs in order to develop a broad bi-partisan consensus which would gain public and leadership support. We need to develop a better and wider consensus about how best to support these efforts in terms of institutions and resources. Our goal should start and end with a stronger America abroad, rather than a weaker nation in world affairs. 
   Mr. President, hopefully, as we work through this budget process over the coming weeks and months, we will be able to find a way to respond to the challenges that we are facing with respect to the various programs and policies that are contained in the 150 account. 
   As Secretary Albright has pointed out, there is a clear and present danger to American safety, prosperity, and values if we do not adequately address the resource question. 
   I am very hopeful that we will be able to come to grips with this in a realistic way, and I appreciate the initiative of my distinguished colleague from Oregon in this regard. This is simply a call to begin confronting this problem as we move down the budget path. I am pleased to join in support of this amendment.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, entitled the ``Transit in Parks Act'' or TRIP, to help ease the congestion, protect our nation's natural resources, and improve mobility and accessibility in our National Parks and Wildlife Refuges. I am pleased to be joined by Senators REID, MURKOWSKI, BOXER, KENNEDY, MOYNIHAN, SCHUMER, KERRY, and MURRAY who are cosponsors of this important legislation. 
   The TRIP legislation is a new federal transit grant initiative that is designed to provide mass transit and alternative transportation services for our national parks, our wildlife refuges, federal recreational areas, and other public lands managed by three agencies of the Department of the Interior. I first introduced similar legislation on Earth Day, 1998 and, during consideration of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA-21, part of my original bill was included as section 3039, authorizing a comprehensive study of alternative transportation needs in our national park lands. The objective of this study is to better identify those areas with existing and potential problems of congestion and pollution, or which can benefit from mass transportation services, and to identify and estimate the project costs for these sites. The fiscal year 1999 Transportation Appropriations bill included $2 million to help fund this important study. I am pleased to report that much important research that will more fully examine the park transportation and resource management needs and outline potential solutions and benefits is underway. 
   Before discussing the bill in greater detail, let me first provide some background on the management issues facing the National Park System. 
   When the national parks first opened in the second half of the nineteenth century, visitors arrived by stagecoach along dirt roads. Travel through parklands, such as Yosemite or Yellowstone, was difficult and long and costly. Not many people could afford or endure such a trip. The introduction of the automobile gave every American greater mobility and freedom, which included the freedom to travel and see some of our nation's great natural wonders. Early in this century, landscape architects from the National Park Service and highway engineers from the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads collaborated to produce many feats of road engineering that opened the national park lands to millions of Americans. 
   Yet greater mobility and easier access now threaten the very environments that the National Park Service is mandated to protect. The ongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a challenge for our national park system. Today, record numbers of visitors and cars has resulted in increasing damage to our parks. The Grand Canyon alone has five million visitors a year. It may surprise you to know that the average visitor stay is only three hours. As many as 6,000 vehicles arrive in a single summer day. They compete for 2,000 parking spaces. Between 32,000 and 35,000 tour buses go to the park each year. During the peak summer season, the entrance route becomes a giant parking lot. 
   In the decade from 1984 to 1994, the number of visits to America's national parks increased 25 percent, rising from 208 million to 269 million a year. This is equal to more than one visit by every man, woman, and child in this country. This has created an overwhelming demand on these areas, resulting in severe traffic congestion, visitor restrictions, and in some instances vacationers being shut-out of the parks altogether. The environmental damage at the Grand Canyon is visible at many other parks: Yosemite, which has more than four million visitors a year; Yellowstone, which has more than three million visitors a year  and experiences such severe traffic congestion that access has to be restricted; Zion; Acadia; Bryce; and many others. We need to solve these problems now or risk permanent damage to our nation's natural, cultural, and historical heritage. 
   My legislation builds upon two previous initiatives to address these problems. First is the study of alternative transportation strategies in our national parks that was mandated by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, ISTEA. This study, completed by the National Park Service nearly five years ago in May 1994, found that many of our most heavily visited national parks are experiencing the same problems of congestion and pollution that afflict our cities and metropolitan areas. Yet, overwhelmingly, the principal transportation systems that the Federal Government has developed to provide access into our national parks are roads primarily for private automobile access. 
   Second, in November 1997, Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt signed an agreement to work together to address transportation and resource management needs in and around national parks. The findings in the Memorandum of Understanding entered into by the two departments are especially revealing:  
   Congestion in and approaching many National Parks is causing lengthy traffic delays and backups that substantially detract from the visitor experience. Visitors find that many of the National Parks contain significant noise and air pollution, and traffic congestion similar to that found on the city streets they left behind. 
   In many National Park units, the capacity of parking facilities at interpretive or science areas is well below demand. As a result, visitors park along roadsides, damaging park resources and subjecting people to hazardous safety conditions as they walk near busy roads to access visitor use areas. 
   On occasion, National Park units must close their gates during high visitation periods and turn away the public because the existing infrastructure and transportation systems are at, or beyond, the capacity for which they were designed.  
   The challenge for park management is twofold: to conserve and protect the nation's natural, historical, and cultural resources, while at the same time ensuring visitor access and enjoyment of these sensitive environments. 
   The Transit in Parks Act will go far to meeting this challenge. The bill's objectives are to develop new and expanded mass transit services throughout the national parks and other public lands to conserve and protect fragile natural, cultural, and historical resources, to prevent adverse impact on those resources, and to reduce pollution and congestion, while at the same time facilitating appropriate visitor access and improving the visitor experience. This new federal transit grant program will provide funding to three Federal land management agencies in the Department of the Interior--the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management--that manage the 378 various parks within the National Park System, including National Battlefields, Monuments and National Seashores, as well as the National Wildlife Refuges and federal recreational areas. The program will allocate capital funds for transit projects, including rail or clean fuel bus projects, joint development activities, pedestrian and bike paths, or park waterway access, within or adjacent to national park lands. The bill authorizes $50 million for this new program for each of the fiscal years 2000 through 2003. It is anticipated that other resources--both public and private--will be available to augment these amounts in the initial phase. 
   The bill formalizes the cooperative arrangement in the 1997 MOU between the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the Interior to exchange technical assistance and to develop procedures relating to the planning, selection and funding of transit projects in national park lands. The projects eligible for funding would be developed through the TEA-21 planning process and selected in consultation and cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior. The bill provides funds for planning, research, and technical assistance that can supplement other financial resources available to the Federal land management agencies. It is anticipated that the Secretary of Transportation would select projects that are diverse in location and size. While major national parks such as the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone are clearly appropriate candidates for significant transit projects under this section, there are numerous small urban and rural Federal park lands that can benefit enormously from small projects, such as bike paths or improved connections with an urban or regional public transit system. Project selection should include the following criteria: the historical and cultural significance of a project; safety; and the extent to which the project would conserve resources, prevent adverse impact, enhance the environment, improve mobility, and contribute to livable communities. 
   The bill also identifies projects of regional or national significance that more closely resemble the Federal transit program's New Starts projects. Where the project costs are $25 million or greater, the projects will comply with the transit New Starts requirements. No single project will receive more than 12 percent of the total amount available in any given year. This ensures a diversity of projects selected for assistance. 
   I firmly believe that this program can create new opportunities for the Federal land management agency to partner with local transit agencies in gateway communities adjacent to the parks, both through the TEA-21 planning process and in developing integrated transportation systems. This will spur new economic development within these communities, as they develop transportation centers for park visitors to connect to transit links into the national parks and other public lands. 
   Mr. President, the ongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a challenge for the National Park Service. Today, that challenge has new dimensions, with overcrowding, pollution, congestion, and resource degradation increasing at many of our national parks. This legislation--the Transit in Parks Act--will give our Federal land management agencies important new tools to improve both preservation and access. Just as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is essential to moving large numbers of people in our national parks--quickly, efficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact. At the same time, transit can enhance the economic development potential of our gateway communities.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise in observance of Greece's 178th anniversary of National Independence. Today, we are here to pay tribute to Greek and American democracy, and to our shared commitment to peace and stability in the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean. 
   On March 25, 1821, the Greek people initiated their victorious pursuit of liberty from four centuries of oppressive Ottoman rule. After nearly ten years of struggle against overwhelming odds, the Greeks accomplished this historic request, reaffirming their commitment to the individual freedoms that are at the heart of the Greek tradition. 
   From the beginning of their revolution, the Greeks had the support, emotional and material, from a people who had recently gained freedom for themselves: the Americans. Looking back at their triumphant march toward liberty, the American people followed with affinity the Greek pursuit for national independence. Since then, our two nations have remained firmly united by a shared commitment to democratic principles. These ties were reinforced by thousands of Greeks who came to America for greater economic opportunity. These immigrants and their descendants continue to make their own important and unique contributions to America's economic and political strength. 
   As a nation whose founders were ardent students of the classics, America has drawn its political convictions from the ancient Greek ideals of liberty and citizenship. And just as America looked to the Greeks for inspiration, Greek patriots looked to the American Revolution for strength in the face of their own adversity. The exuberance and passion of a young nation dedicated to freedom lifted the spirits of the Greek patriots, and reminded them of their long-standing democratic legacy. 
   As we enter the next century, it is appropriate that we retrace our common struggle to build societies based on individual rights, equality and the rule of law. During World War I, our nations forged a steadfast alliance to maintain peace in the Balkans. During the Second World War, Greeks heroically resisted the brutal Nazi regime, defeated Mussolini's troops, and contributed in no small part to the allied victory over the Axis Powers. At the Cold War's inception, President Truman and the American people committed to helping Greece rebuild their war-ravaged nation through the Marshall Plan. Greece continues to play an important role as a valued member of the international community within NATO and the European Union. 
   Today, as one of the few stable democracies in its region, Greece has played a stabilizing role throughout the Balkans and is helping its neighbors progress toward greater political and economic security. Greek economic modernization, along with its status as a member of the European Union, allow Greece to act as a model for and play a constructive role in the economic well being of its neighbors. 
   Mr. President, the new millennium promises an even stronger Greek-American relationship and further cooperation in the areas of our mutual interests. Through ties of blood and affection, as well as shared political goals and philosophical ideals, Greece has retained a special relationship with the United States. Therefore, on this important occasion, it is fitting that we remember this historical legacy and rededicate ourselves to the principles which inspired the free and democratic peoples of America and Greece.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on a subject that was the focus of considerable discussion last fall, during the Senate's consideration of bankruptcy reform legislation. 
   During that debate, the Senate examined whether the increased rate of consumer bankruptcies in the Nation resulted solely from consumers' access to an excessively permissive bankruptcy process, or whether other factors also contributed to this increase. Ultimately it concluded that the record increase in bankruptcy filings across the nation is due not only to the ease with which one can enter the bankruptcy system, but also to the unparalleled levels of consumer debt--especially credit card debt--being run up across the country. As Senator DURBIN noted in his opening statement on the bankruptcy reform bill last fall, and as the CBO, FDIC, and numerous economists have found, the rate of increase in bankruptcy filings is virtually identical to the rate of increase in consumer debt. 
   This is not a coincidence. Rather, increased bankruptcies proceed directly from the fact that Americans are bombarded daily by credit card solicitations that promise easy access to credit without informing their targets of the implications of signing up for such credit. 
   During last fall's debate, the Senate also concluded that irresponsible borrowing could be reduced, and many bankruptcies averted, if Americans were provided with some basic information in their credit card materials regarding the consequences of assuming greater debt. A consensus emerged that credit card companies have some affirmative obligation to provide such information to consumers in their solicitations, monthly statements, and purchasing materials, in light of their aggressive pursuit of less and less knowledgeable borrowers. 
   As a result of this emerging consensus, last year's Senate bankruptcy bill--S. 1301--contained several provisions in the Manager's Amendment addressing credit card debt, and requiring specific disclosures by credit card companies in their payment and solicitation materials. These provisions, which I sponsored along with Senators DODD and DURBIN, were vital to the Senate's success in adopting balanced bankruptcy reform legislation that placed responsibility for the surge in consumer bankruptcies on debtors and creditors alike, and enabled the Senate to pass its bankruptcy bill by the overwhelming margin of 97-1. 
   Unfortunately, the House-Senate conference committee struck these disclosure provisions from its final conference report, leaving the bankruptcy bill again a one-sided document that failed to account for the role credit card companies play in the accumulation of credit card debt and in increased consumer bankruptcy rates. As a result of the conference committee's actions, the conference report died in the waning days of the 105th Congress, amid pledges by the majority to resurrect it in the early days of the 106th Congress. 
   Mr. President, if we are indeed going to enter again into a debate on bankruptcy legislation in the 106th Congress, it remains my firm belief that Congress must address both sides of the consumer bankruptcy equation--both the flaws in the bankruptcy system that make it easy for people to declare bankruptcy even if they have the ability to pay their debts, and the lending practices that encourage people on the economic margins to accumulate debts that are beyond their ability to repay. 
   I therefore rise today to introduce legislation that is similar, though not identical, to the language included in last year's Senate bankruptcy bill. It is my hope that this bill will stimulate discussion about the responsibilities of lenders in the bankruptcy equation, and that, when the time comes to debate bankruptcy reform, the nature and extent of these responsibilities will be a large part of the discussion. 
   In short, this legislation amends the Truth in Lending Act to require credit card companies to disclose the following basic information in each monthly statement:

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation together with Senators WARNER, CAMPBELL, and MURRAY, which would grant a Federal Charter to the Korean War Veterans Association, Incorporated. This legislation recognizes and honors the 5.7 million Americans who fought and served during the Korean War for their struggles and sacrifices on behalf of freedom and the principles and ideals of our Nation. 
   Mr. President, the year 2000 will mark the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War. In June 1950 when the North Korea People's Army swept across the 38th Parallel to occupy Seoul, South Korea, members of our Armed Forces--including many from the State of Maryland--immediately answered the call of the U.N. to repel this forceful invasion. Without hesitation, these soldiers travelled to an unfamiliar corner of the world, and joining an unprecedented multinational force comprised of 22 countries, they risked their lives to protect freedom. The Americans who led this international effort were true patriots who fought with remarkable courage. 
   In battles such as Pork Chop Hill, the Inchon Landing and the frozen Chosin Reservoir, which was fought in temperatures as low as 57 degrees below 0, they faced some of the most brutal combat in history. By the time the fighting had ended, 8,177 Americans were listed as missing or prisoners of war--some of whom are still missing--and 54,246 Americans had died, the most of any American war in the 20th Century. One hundred and thirty-one Korean War Veterans were awarded the Nation's highest commendation for combat bravery, the Medal of Honor. Ninety-four of these soldiers gave their lives in the process. There is an engraving on the Korean War Veterans Memorial which reflects these losses and how brutal a war this was. It reads, ``Freedom is not Free.'' Yet, as a nation, we have done little more than establish this memorial to publicly acknowledge the bravery of those who fought the Korean War. The Korean War has been termed by many as the ``Forgotten War.'' Mr. President, freedom is not free. We owe our Korean War Veterans a debt of gratitude. Granting this federal charter--at no cost to the government--is a small expression of appreciation that we as a nation can offer to these men and women, one which will enable them to work as a unified front to ensure that the ``Forgotten War'' is forgotten no more. 
   The Korean War Veterans Association was originally incorporated on June 25, 1985. Since its first annual reunion and memorial service in Arlington, Virginia, where its members decided to develop a national focus and strong commitment to service, the association has grown substantially to a membership of over 25,000. At present, the KWVA is the only veterans organization comprised exclusively of Korean War Veterans and one of the few such organizations of its size without a federal charter. Over the years, it has established a strong record of service and commitment to fellow Korean War veterans, ranging from its efforts on behalf of Project Freedom to its successful effort to construct a national Korean War Veterans Memorial on the Mall. A federal charter would allow the Association to continue and grow its mission and further its charitable and benevolent causes. Specifically, it will afford the Korean War Veterans' Association the same status as other major veterans organizations and allow it to participate as part of select committees with other congressionally chartered veterans and military groups. A federal charter will also accelerate the Association's ``accreditation'' with the Department of Veterans Affairs which will enable its members to assist in processing veterans' claims.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of Women's History Month--a time to honor the many great women leaders from our past and present who have served our Nation so well. They have worked diligently to achieve social change and personal triumph usually against incredible odds. As scientists, writers, doctors, teachers, and mothers, they have shaped our world and guided us down the road to prosperity and peace. For far too long, however, their contributions to the strength and character of our society went unrecognized and undervalued. 
   Women have led efforts to secure not only their own rights, but have also been the guiding force behind many of the other major social movements of our time--the abolitionist movement, the industrial labor movement, and the civil rights movement, to name a few. We also have women to thank for the establishment of many of our early charitable, philanthropic, and cultural institutions. 
   In Maryland, we are proud to honor the many women who have played such critical roles in the development of our State heritage. They include Margaret Brent, who, in 1648, became America's first woman lawyer and landholder, and Harriet Tubman, who saved thousands of lives during the Civil War through the Underground railroad. Other great Maryland women include Henrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization  of America and Dr. Helen Taussig, who developed, in 1945, the first successful medical procedure to save ``blue babies.'' 
   Now more than ever, women are a guiding force in Maryland and a major presence in our business sector. As of 1996, there were over 167,000 women-owned businesses in our State--that amounts to 39 percent of all firms in Maryland. Maryland's women-owned businesses employ over 301,000 people and generate over $39 billion in sales. Between 1987 and 1996, the number of women-owned firms in Maryland is estimated to have increased by 88 percent. 
   During Women's History month we have the opportunity to remember and praise great women leaders who have opened doors for today's young women in ways that are often overlooked. Their legacy has enriched the lives of us all and deserves prominence in the annals of American history. 
   With this in mind, I have co-sponsored legislation again this Congress to establish a National Museum of Women's History Advisory Committee. This Committee would be charged with identifying a site for the National Museum of Women's History and developing strategies for raising private funding for the development and maintenance of the museum. Ultimately, the museum will enlighten the young and old about the key roles women have played in our Nation's history and the many contributions they have made to our culture. 
   However, we must do more than merely recognize the outstanding accomplishments women have made. Women's History Month also is a time to recognize that women still face substantial obstacles and inequities at every turn. Access to capital for female entrepreneurs is still a significant stumbling block, and women business owners of color are even less likely than white women entrepreneurs to have financial backing from a bank. A female physician still only earns about 58 cents to her male counterpart's dollar, and female business executives earn about 65 cents for every dollar paid to a male executive. At every age, women are more likely than their male contemporaries to be poor, and the average personal income of men over 65 is nearly double that of their female peers. Tragically, the incidence of AIDS among black and Hispanic women and teenage girls is far out of proportion to their percentage of the population. 
   On the other hand, we have made great strides toward ensuring a fairer place for women in our society. The college-educated proportion of women, although still smaller than the comparable proportion of men, has been increasing rapidly. Black and white women's death rates from heart disease have dropped significantly since 1970. Women are now the majority in some professional and managerial occupations that were largely male until relatively recently. 
   Mr. President, as we begin a new millennium, it is my hope that our progress in securing women's rights will accelerate. As we celebrate Women's History Month, let us reaffirm our commitment to the women of this Nation and to insuring full equality for all of our citizens.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of one of the area's finest news stations, WTOP, a station that has been a trustworthy and informative source of regional and national news since 1969. 
   In our increasingly inter-connected society where technology has increased the speed at which information is collected, disseminated and analyzed, the importance of responsible journalism has become even more important. WTOP has maintained a reputation as an accurate news source by its reporting of events from Watergate to the recent impeachment trial; from Vietnam to conflicts in the Persian Gulf; from issues regarding the District of Columbia to the politics of my home State of Maryland. In addition to news accounts on these issues, WTOP always has weather, traffic and sports reports to complete its effective coverage. Much as CNN is the leader in television news coverage, WTOP leads the way in providing up-to-date radio news 24 hours a day. 
   I would also like to commend the service of one individual in particular, WTOP's Congressional correspondent Dave McConnell, who has been with the station for almost 20 years. I have worked first-hand with Dave over the years and have the utmost respect for his journalistic integrity and his dedication to reporting the news in a precise yet understandable way. Indeed, his ``Today on the Hill'' broadcasts have provided listeners with the most up-to-date information on legislative activities on Capitol Hill by talking directly with members of Congress about the issues. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to recognize the professionalism of this station and its employees on this auspicious anniversary, and to extend my best wishes to WTOP for the next 30 years and beyond.

   Mr. SARBANES. I desire to speak about the extremes to which the other side will go to frustrate the opportunity to consider significant educational initiatives on this bill by now bringing into consideration subject matter completely extraneous to education and the jurisdiction of the committee; namely, the amendment that is now pending dealing with a banking issue. I want to speak on that subject for a few minutes. I think it is highly relevant to the situation in which we find ourselves.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think the extremes to which the other side will go to try to frustrate considering bona fide educational issues on this education bill was demonstrated by the fact that the vote we just had  was on tabling a motion on an amendment involving the ``Know Your Customer'' proposed regulations that were put out by the Federal banking regulators. 
   I wrote to the regulators, pointing out the problems with these proposed regulations and urging them to carefully consider these problems before proceeding or implementing them. The regulators have received a flood of comments highly critical of the proposed regulations and, in fact, the comment period, which ends on March 8, is not yet over. At least two regulators have already indicated, in advance of the comment period ending, that they expect not to adopt the proposed regulations as final regulations in view of the overwhelming number of comments they have received and the complexity of the issue. 
   Many of my colleagues have, as I have done, written to them pointing out the difficulties connected with these regulations and the possible breaches of customers' personal financial privacy. 
   On the other hand, since there is a law enforcement issue involved here with respect to money laundering, we need to be very careful what we do. I am concerned because the amendment not only addresses the proposed regulations but also precludes any other regulations being put forward by the agencies that would be similar to these. 
   Conceivably, the agencies could develop more narrow regulations that focus on the money laundering issue, in an effort to curb criminal activity, that would not carry with it the heavy burdens of regulation on the banks and the potential intrusion into the financial privacy of ordinary, law-abiding citizens, which none of us wants to do. 
   In fact, I have introduced a bill on the financial privacy issue, broader legislation than we are talking about here. I have been joined in that by Senators DODD, BRYAN, EDWARDS, LEAHY, and HOLLINGS. That is S. 187. 
   I invite other colleagues to join on that legislation, S. 187, because I think financial privacy is an extremely important issue and one that we need to address. We need to assure safeguards to our consumers that their financial privacy is not to be intruded upon without their knowledge and an opportunity to object. 
   But to reach out, as happened this morning, and try to drag in a subject matter unrelated to education and not directly connected with this bill, as part of a constant process that has been going on over the last few days to block out important educational amendments that would raise significant issues which need to be addressed, it seems to me, is going too far. 
   Let me, on these regulations, quickly point out that the regulators have received over 130,000 public comments about the regulations, demonstrating a great deal of concern about the privacy of personal financial information. The regulators have already indicated they recognize the problems with the proposed regulations. Some have testified or written to the Congress indicating they expect withdrawal or substantial if not total revision. 
   We are addressing the problem in the normal course under which proposed regulations are addressed, the problem which this amendment addresses. In fact, of course, this amendment moves in and, in effect, seeks to shortcut or terminate the regular process which would be to let the comment period run and then the regulators take the comments into account. We have already had an indication from the regulators that they have seen enough now so that when they take the public comments into account, the concerns that Members have expressed, myself included, will be addressed. 
   The potential problem with the amendment is that it may foreclose any possibility of addressing the legitimate concerns of the law enforcement community directed towards money laundering. My very able colleague from Michigan, Senator LEVIN, has been working on that issue. 
   I simply rise to point out some of the complexity of this issue with which we are dealing, and to focus on the current situation in which we find ourselves--I gather there is not the ingenuity or wit to devise education-related amendments to try to block this process, as has been going on. So now we are going to reach out, wherever we can, and find non-education-related amendments, to bring them in to try to close out the amendment tree. 
   I am prompted to speak on that because this question of privacy is an issue to which we have addressed some attention. As I said, there is a comprehensive bill which has been introduced by a number of us which I am very hopeful we will be able to have hearings on and act on. 
   I think the ``Know Your Customer'' proposed regulations is a very important issue to be addressed. But I find it interesting that here we are on a Friday morning and, instead of dealing with education, we have brought in this issue out of the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I think the regulators were about to address this issue to everyone's satisfaction, but the issue has been addressed in the amendment, possibly in such a broad fashion that it will prevent the formulation of regulations specifically designed to get at money laundering, which the law enforcement community has indicated is a significant concern of theirs. That is an issue to which Senator LEVIN has addressed considerable attention. 
   I say to the distinguished chairman, to the extent he views these comments as not relevant or germane to his legislation, they were prompted by the fact that an amendment was proposed which itself is not relevant or germane to the bill before us and has nothing to do with education. 
   My own preference, obviously, is to get on with the education amendments. I hope these discussions that are going to take place will make it possible for significant and important education amendments to be offered to this legislation. We are out here with an important piece of education legislation whose basic concept I support. But I do not think we should be precluded from offering other important initiatives with respect to education which, I think, if brought before the body, would command broad support in this institution. I think it would be very important in helping to deal with the Nation's educational challenges.

   Let me just make two observations: First of all, on the need for this banking amendment, to send a message. The message has certainly been sent by many Members and by extensive public comment. 
   In that regard, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the end of my statement a letter which I sent to the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on January 12 on this very issue of the ``Know Your Customer'' programs, sharply critical of the proposed regulations.

   Mr. SARBANES. Just briefly the other question, I have been watching what has been going on. I am not on a committee with direct jurisdiction here, but I was prompted to speak by the fact that in this game of delay and blockage we are now dragging in outside amendments. 
   The chairman says he wants these other amendments considered in the context of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Am I mistaken in my impression that the Secretary of Education, who I think is supportive of Ed-Flex measures, advanced the position that those Ed-Flex measures should be considered in the context of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act?

   Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that, first of all, that was extensively discussed. And my understanding is that it is consistent with recent educational studies, that small class size in the early years has been shown to have significant benefits. You talk about, we are spending a lot of money and we do not know whether it is producing results. One thing we seem to know, on the basis of the study, is that if we can lower these class sizes, particularly in the early years, we are going to get beneficial results. 
   If you ask anyone about the difference between the situation in the public schools and private schools, for which parents pay a lot of money, the first thing that leaps out at you is small class size. If you ask parents why they are laying out all of this money, one of the first things they say is, to get a small class size. And these studies that have been done, as I understand it, support the proposition that the small class size will produce significant results, particularly when directed toward the early years so we can get these young people up to standard.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chairman, I hope we are not going to leave any impression here that the growing consensus on the benefit of small classes, particularly in the early grades, is somehow suspect. It is my understanding that consistently across the board students attending smaller classes in the early grades have been found to make more rapid progress than students in larger classes; that these benefits are the greatest for low-achieving minority children and low-income children, because smaller classes enable the teachers to identify and work effectively with students. In many instances they are able to address the problem early on, which prevents its worsening, perhaps to the extent of requiring special education in later years--if you are talking about conserving your resources. 
   I understand that Project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 schools in Tennessee. Students in small classes performed better than students in large classes in each grade from kindergarten through the third grade. Followup studies show that the gains lasted through at least the eighth grade. The gains were larger for minority students. 
   In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education Program is helping to reduce class size in grades K through 3 and in low-income communities. Students in the smaller classes had significantly greater improvements in reading, math and science tests than students in the larger classes. The most significant achievement gains were among African American males. 
   In Flint, MI, efforts over the last 3 years to reduce class size in grades K through 3 have produced a 44-percent increase in reading scores and an 18-percent increase in math scores. 
   So the issue which the Senator from Washington and others are trying to address is an extremely important issue. It follows on the initiative that was taken by the Congress last year, and I very much hope that we will be able to address it in the course of considering this legislation. We ought to put these educational issues before the Senate and act upon them. 
   I yield the floor.

   First of all, I acknowledge that he is trying to address the problem, and I indicated as much when we discussed it in the Banking Committee.

   Mr. SARBANES. Not the amendment; I will address the amendment. I want to talk about the bill and the proposal in the Banking Committee first. I think both of those propositions, the proposal in the committee and the bill, went too far, and I think the Senator is prepared to concede they went too far because they would have wiped out existing regulations--not just proposed regulations--existing regulations addressed to significant cash transactions that we think are tied to the money laundering issue. 
   I don't think the Senator disagrees with that.

   Mr. SARBANES. I understand that and I indicated earlier that had been done. 
   I only have two observations about that. Yesterday, the Comptroller of the Currency in testimony on the House side stated that they intended to withdraw the proposals ``promptly.'' 
   Now, perhaps the Senator feels that through his communications with the regulators heretofore and the letters he sent--and I have sent a letter, and others have sent letters--we weren't able to get sufficient credit for having brought about this change--so we need to come out here and try to get this amendment passed so that we really show that we are the ones who did it and not the regulators who were affected, acting in a reasonable manner after reviewing all of the comments that have been received not only from the public but from Members of the Congress, as well. 
   Second, I do have some concern about your amendment because it addresses not only the proposed regulations, but, as I understand, it precludes them coming forward with any similar regulations that might be greatly narrowed so they get at the money laundering issue. 
   I don't assert that I am an expert on the money laundering issue and that is why the Senator from Michigan, Senator LEVIN, is putting a statement in the RECORD addressing the money laundering question, 
   and the importance of that question and how we try to get at it. 
   I think this problem was well on its way to being solved. I understand the other side is searching desperately for amendments to offer in order to try to block this amendment process on educational issues. It is my perception that is why this matter came before us today, in an effort to keep out of the amendment process on the Ed-Flex bill, important amendments, which a number of our colleagues wish to offer. But the Senator and I share a common view that the regulations went too far, and we have expressed that opinion. 
   I think the initial proposals the Senator from Colorado made went too far in the other direction--and were overly broad. I think this proposal has been narrowed down, but I think it still contains within it one remaining problem, which I indicated, and that is whether it precludes any opportunity to do something that would be more effective on the money laundering issue,  without creating any of the privacy problems or the overregulation problems that both of us and others have perceived as being contained in the proposed regulations. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in honoring a distinguished public servant and a highly respected Member of the United States Congress, Morris K. Udall, who died on December 12, 1998. 
   Mo Udall was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election held on May 2, 1961, succeeding his brother, Stewart, who had resigned from the House to serve as Secretary of the Interior in the Kennedy Administration. He served the citizens of Arizona and his nation with great distinction until his resignation on May 4, 1991. I was elected to the House of Representatives on November 3, 1970 and am proud to have served in the House with Mo Udall during the 92nd, 93rd and 94th Congresses. 
   Mr. President, Mo Udall was one of the most productive and creative legislators of his time. He chaired the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs from 1977 to 1991 and used this position very effectively to move numerous important environmental measures through the Congress. The National Wildlife Federation named Mo Udall its Legislator of the Year in 1974 and in 1980 Congress passed his Alaska Lands Act, which doubled the size of our national park system and tripled the size of the national wilderness sytem. His accomplishments in this critical area reflect a Westerner's deep love and respect for the land. 
   Mo Udall's intelligence, sense of humor and civility endeared him to his colleagues and to the citizens of Arizona's District 2 whom he served so well. He was the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in 1980 and was paid a special tribute by the Democratic Party during the 1992 national convention. 
   When Mo Udall retired in 1991, Washington Post reporter, David Broder, had this to say:  
   The legacy he left is imposing and enduring, it ranges from strip mining and Alaska wilderness legislation to the reform of archaic committee and floor procedures that congressional barons had used to conceal their arbitrary power. For a whole generation of congressmen, Udall became a mentor and a model, he was special and precious to many of us.  
   Mr. President, Mo Udall was special. He provided a positive and unifying force in the U.S. Congress which has been sorely missed. He was a good friend and respected colleague in the public service, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and to extend my deepest and heartfelt sympathies to his family.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Blind Persons Earnings Equity Act, a bill that will open up a world of opportunities for blind persons and greatly improve their lives. Currently, the blind are discouraged from working by an overly restrictive provision in the Social Security Act that limits the amount of income they may earn for themselves. The Blind Persons Earnings Equity Act would raise that earnings restriction and lessen the burden of at least one of the many obstacles to employment faced by the blind today. 
   Blindness has profoundly adverse social and economic consequences, and Social Security benefits are needed to offset the disadvantages suffered by the blind. However, these same laws that are meant to help, must be revised when it becomes clear they are hindering blind persons from joining the workforce and discouraging them from becoming fully engaged in society. 
   Instead of encouraging the blind to develop job skills and become productive members of their communities, the law addressed by this bill penalizes them. Once their earnings rise above an amount that is barely sufficient to cover the most basic living expenses, their Social Security benefits are cut completely. No wonder it is estimated that over seventy percent of the employable blind population is either unemployed or underemployed. 
   This statistic, however, does not represent an unwillingness to work. On the contrary, the blind want to work and take great pride in developing the necessary skills that enable them to contribute to society. 
   I had the honor of knowing personally a great American leader who just happened to be blind. His name was Dr. Kenneth Jernigan and for over 25 years he led the organized blind movement in the United States. As President for the National Federation of the Blind, he moved the national headquarters to Baltimore where I had the opportunity to meet him. Sadly, Dr. Jernigan passed away last year. 
   Dr. Jernigan may have been blind in the physical sense, Mr. President, but he was a man of vision nonetheless. In his leadership of the National Federation of the Blind, he taught all of us to understand that eyesight and insight are not related to each other in any way. Although he did not have eyesight, his insight on life, learning, and leading has no equal. Dr. Jernigan devoted his life to empowering the blind and encouraging them to be active members of society. He fought to improve their access to information, education, jobs, and public facilities.  
   The overly restrictive earnings cap in the Social Security Act represents precisely the kind of unfair law and barrier to employment that Dr. Jernigan battled throughout his life. He knew first hand about the devastating impact that restrictions such as this could have on the aspirations and hope of blind persons already struggling to overcome tremendous challenges. 
   Congress itself has recognized the overly restrictive nature of this earnings cap. In 1996, we raised the cap for senior citizens with passage of the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act. However, the earnings limitation for blind individuals was left unchanged. Up until that point, for almost twenty years, the same earnings cap had applied to both senior citizens and blind persons under the Social Security Act. With passage of the 1996 Freedom to Work Act, seniors were encouraged to remain active and continue working, but the disincentive to work was unfortunately left in place for the blind. Consequently, by 2002, seniors will be permitted to earn up to $30,000, but blind people who earn over $14,800 (less than half as much) will lose their benefits. 
   There is no justification for raising the earnings cap for one group and not the other. Why should we distinguish between two groups that for over twenty years were treated even-handedly under the law? What has changed to cause us to discriminate between the two and encourage one to work while greatly limiting the opportunities of the other? By reestablishing parity in the treatment of blind persons and senior citizens under the Social Security Act, this legislation will restore fairness to this law and will remedy a policy that has kept the blind locked out of rewarding, self-fulfilling employment. 
   Although a small number of blind persons may become newly eligible for benefits as a result of this change, their number will be a mere fraction of the thousands who do not work because of the disincentive imposed by this earnings limit. By enabling these beneficiaries to work, the overall net effect of this bill will be to increase payments to the Social Security trust funds and bring additional revenue to the Federal Treasury as well. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this necessary legislation that will ensure the blind are treated fairly under the law and will empower thousands of blind beneficiaries to become more engaged in society through productive employment.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today, I am introducing along with a number of my colleagues, a bill to continue and enhance the efforts to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. Joining me in sponsoring this bill are my colleagues from Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, Senators MIKULSKI, WARNER, ROBB, and SANTORUM. 
   Mr. President, the Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and the key to the ecological and economic health of the mid-Atlantic region. The Bay, in fact, is one of the world's great natural resources. We tend to take it for granted because it is right here at hand, so to speak, and I know many Members of this body have enjoyed the Chesapeake Bay. The Bay provides thousands of jobs for the people in this region and is an important component in the national economy. The Bay is a major commercial waterway and shipping center for the region and for much of the eastern United States. It supports a world-class fishery that produces a significant portion of the country's fin fish and shellfish catch. The Bay and its waters also maintain an enormous tourism and recreation industry. 
   The Chesapeake Bay is a complex system. It draws its life-sustaining waters from a watershed that covers more than 64,000 square miles and parts of six states. The Bay's relationship to the people, industries, and communities in those six states and beyond is also complex and multifaceted. 
   I could continue talking about these aspects of the Bay, but my fellow Senators are aware of the Bay's importance and have consistently regarded the protection and enhancement of the quality of the Chesapeake Bay as an important national objective. 
   Through the concerted efforts of public and private organizations, we have learned to understand the complexities of the Bay and we have learned what it takes to maintain the system that sustains us. The Chesapeake Bay Program is an extraordinary example of how local, State, regional, and Federal agencies can work with citizens and private organizations to manage complicated, vital, natural resources. Indeed, the Chesapeake Bay Program serves as a model across the country and around the world. 
   When the Bay began to experience serious unprecedented declines in water quality and living resources in the 1970s, the people in my state suffered. We lost thousands of jobs in the fishing industry. We lost much of the wilderness that defined the watershed. We began to appreciate for the first time the profound impact that human activity could have on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. We began to recognize that untreated sewage, deforestation, toxic chemicals, agricultural runoff, and increased development were causing a degradation of water quality, the loss of wildlife, and elimination of vital habitat. We also began to recognize that these negative impacts were only part of a cycle that could eventually impact other economic and 
   human health interests. 
   Fortunately, over the last two decades we have come to understand that humans can also have a positive effect on the environment. We have learned that we can, if we are committed, help repair natural systems so that they continue to provide economic opportunities and enhance the quality of life for future generations. 
   We now treat sewage before it enters our waters. We banned toxic chemicals that were killing wildlife. We have initiated programs to reduce nonpoint source pollution, and we have taken aggressive steps to restore depleted fisheries. 
   The States of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania deserve much of the credit for undertaking many of the actions that have put the Bay and its watershed on the road to recovery. All three States have had major cleanup programs. They have made significant commitments in terms of resources. It is an important priority item on the agendas of the Bay States. Governors have been strongly committed, as have State legislatures and the public. There are a number of private organizations--the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, for example--which do extraordinary good work in this area. 
   But there has been invaluable involvement by the Federal Government as well. The cooperation and attention of Federal agencies has been essential. Without the Federal Clean Water Act, the Federal ban on DDT, and EPA's watershed-wide coordination of Chesapeake Bay restoration and cleanup activities, we would not have been able to bring about the concerted effort, the real partnership, that is succeeding improving the water quality of the Bay and is succeeding in bringing back many of the fish and wildlife species. 
   The Chesapeake Bay is getting cleaner, but we cannot afford to be complacent. There are still tremendous stresses on the Bay. This is a fast-growing area of the country, with an ever increasing population, development, and continuous changes in land use. 
   We need to remain vigilant in continuing to address the needs of the Bay restoration effort. The hard work, investment, and commitment, at all levels, which has brought gains over the last three decades, must not be allowed to lapse or falter. 
   The measure I am introducing today reauthorizes the Bay program and builds upon the Federal Government's past role in the Chesapeake Bay Program and the highly successful Federal-State-local partnership to which I made reference. The bill also establishes simple agency disclosure and budget coordination mechanisms to help ensure that information about Federal Bay-related grants and projects are readily available to the scientific community and the public. 
   As I mentioned before, the Chesapeake Bay Program is a model of efficient and effective coordination. Still, there is always room for improvement as experience informs and enlightens our judgments. While coordination between the various levels of government has been exemplary, coordination among Federal agencies can be strengthened. This legislation begins to develop a better coordination mechanism to help ensure that all Federal agency programs are accounted for. 
   In addition, this bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a ``Small Watershed Grants Program'' for the Chesapeake Bay region. These grants will help organizations and local governments launch a variety of locally-designed and locally-implemented projects to restore relatively small pieces of the larger Chesapeake Bay watershed. By empowering local agencies and community groups to identify and solve local problems, this grant program will promote stewardship across the region and improve the whole by strengthening the parts. 
   This bill was carefully crafted with the advise, counsel, and assistance of many hard working organizations in the Chesapeake Bay region, including the Chesapeake Bay Commission, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, The Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay and various offices within the state governments of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.  
   Mr. President, it is the hope of the cosponsors that this bill will ultimately be incorporated into a larger piece of legislation that is due to be reauthorized or considered this year. However, if such legislation is not considered or should become stalled in the legislative process--the larger legislation covers a wide range of issues--it is our intention to try to move forward with this legislation separately. 
   The Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort has been a major bipartisan undertaking in this body. It has consistently, over the years, been strongly supported by virtually all members of the Senate. I strongly urge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this legislation and contributing to the improvement and the enhancement of one of our Nation's most valuable and treasued natural resources.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last Thursday's Baltimore Sun reported that Pfiesteria, a sometimes toxic microorganism, has been found in five more Maryland rivers. The article explained that new research is proving what scientists have suspected since serious outbreaks of toxic Pfiesteria first occurred in 1997--namely that Pfiesteria exists in a wide area. While the organism isn't always toxic, the fact that it has been found in a wide area coupled with the fact that it has proved injurious in the past, strongly supports the assertion that Pfiesteria poses a potential threat to the economic well-being of thousands of businesses in the fishing, recreation, and tourism industries along the east coast. 
   In 1997, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina suffered from several separate incidents that involved fish behaving in an erratic manner, a large number of fish with lesions, and fish kills. State and outside scientists concluded that Pfiesteria was the most likely cause of the problem. In Maryland, the fishing industry alone, lost millions of dollars in revenue. 
   In 1998, the magnitude of reported Pfiesteria outbreaks was considerably less, however, we cannot become complacent. The report in the Baltimore Sun confirms that the 1997 Pfiesteria outbreaks may not have been a one-time phenomenon. We must begin to safeguard the economy, both regional and national, from the impacts of Pfiesteria. 
   Today, I am joined by my colleague from Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI, and my colleague from North Carolina, Senator EDWARDS in introducing a bill, entitled the Toxic Microorganism Abatement Pilot Project Act, which would authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to begin developing tools and techniques to abate the flow of nutrients into our waters and thereby prevent or at least minimize the effects of future toxic Pfiesteria outbreaks. 
   In 1997, the Administration directed that an interagency research and monitoring strategy be developed in response to the outbreaks of Pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay. Several Federal agencies participated in the development of this strategy including the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Centers for Disease Control, and the Departments of Interior and Agriculture. Funding to implement the plan was included in the fiscal 1998 and 1999 budgets. Unfortunately, the key federal agency with expertise in habitat maintenance, water resources and engineering principles--the Army Corps of Engineers--was not included in the interagency task force and the agency's unique qualifications were not integrated into the strategic plan. While research into the exact causes of toxic Pfiesteria blooms is imperative, it is just as important that we take early, aggressive, and concrete steps to prevent such blooms if we can. 
   This bill is designed to ensure that all available expertise is brought to bear in combating these biotoxins. The legislation would authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct an evaluation and to engage in pilot projects to develop tools and techniques for combating Pfiesteria and other toxic microorganisms. At the end of each pilot project, the Army Corps of Engineers will be required to submit a report to Congress that describes the project, its success, and the general applicability of the methods used in the project. 
   Because of its expertise in construction and watershed management, the Army Corps of Engineers has a vital role to play in responding to the threats posed by toxic microorganisms. This legislation provides the funding and authority for the agency to do so.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, every February, since Dr. Carter G. Woodson first initiated the idea in 1926, Americans have celebrated the contributions of African-Americans to our history, literature, arts, sciences, politics and every other facet of American life. What was in the beginning only a week-long event, has blossomed into a month-long celebration. 
   This year's theme, as selected by the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History (ASALH), is ``The Legacy of African-American Leadership for the Present and the Future.'' This theme captures one of the primary objectives of Dr. Woodson in creating this annual celebration. Dr. Woodson believed that you must look back in order to look forward. He dedicated his entire life to the research and documentation of African-American history, and his efforts were intended to educate and inspire contemporaneous and future generations of Americans. 
   In keeping with this theme and Dr. Woodson's vision, I rise today to share with my colleagues of the Senate and the American people a few of the legacies of outstanding African-Americans from Maryland. While this is not an exhaustive listing, it exemplifies the legacy of African-Americans in the areas of science, engineering, abolitionism, literature, religion, theater, education, civil rights, law, business, athletics, diplomacy and politics. I believe you will find--as I have found--their stories and accomplishments inspiring, and it is my fervent hope that today's African-American youth will find in these men and women role models to inspire their own efforts as we move into the 21st Century. 
   Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806) of Ellicott's Mill, Maryland is credited with building the first clock in America in 1753. He was an inventor, scientist and surveyor who played an important role in the layout and design of our nation's capital city. 
   Harriet Tubman (1820-1913) of Dorchester County, Maryland escaped from slavery and was responsible for assisting more than 300 slaves reach freedom in the north through the underground railway. 
   Francis E.W. Harper (1825-1911) of Baltimore, Maryland was the first African-American writer to have a published short story. She also had her poetry and other verse published, including a novel in 1892. 
   Billie Holiday (1915-1959) of Baltimore, Maryland is to this day regarded as one the greatest jazz vocalists in history, and as one of America's premier artists of the 20th Century. 
   Zora Neale Hurston (1891-1960) of Baltimore, Maryland was a distinguished author, folklorist and anthropologist.  
   Charles Randolph Uncles (1859-1933) of Baltimore, Maryland became the first African-American priest ordained in the United States on December 19, 1891, beginning a line of American ministers that has included Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Reverend Jesse Jackson. 
   Eubie Blake (1883-1983) of Baltimore, Maryland was a popular ragtime pianist and composer who first learned to play the piano at age six and went on to break color barriers on Broadway and theaters across the nation. 
   Mary Church Terrell (1864-1954) of Annapolis, Maryland was an outstanding educator and early civil rights leader. 
   Edward Franklin Frazier (1894-1962) of the Eastern Shore of Maryland was a teacher of mathematics, professor of sociology and author who created and furthered the academic knowledge and understanding of the African-American community. 
   Clifton Wharton (1899-1990) of Baltimore, Maryland became the first African-American foreign service officer named chief of an American mission overseas when he was appointed U.S. Minister to Romania in 1958. 
   Leon Day (1916-1995), a Hall of Fame baseball player from Baltimore, Maryland, was one of the most consistently outstanding pitchers in the Negro Leagues during the 1930's and 1940's. His consistency was interrupted only by two years of service in the Army during World War II where he distinguished himself on Utah Beach during the Allied invasion of France. 
   Reginald F. Lewis (1942-1993) of Baltimore, Maryland created first African-American law firm on Wall Street and led the first African-American owned company with annual revenue exceeding $1 billion. 
   Thurgood Marshall (1908-1993) of Baltimore, Maryland served as chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Educational Fund (NAACP-LDF) at a time when the NAACP brought, argued and won Brown v. Board of Education, the seminal 1954 civil rights Supreme Court case. He went on to serve his nation as a federal Appellate Court judge, Solicitor General, and the first African-American member of the United States Supreme Court. 
   I am also sorry to report that Maryland recently lost one of its legal and political leaders when Judge Harry A. Cole passed away earlier this month. Judge Harry A. Cole was both the first African-American to hold the office of an Assistant State Attorney General in Maryland, and the first African-American named to the Maryland Court of Appeals, which is my State's highest court. During his fourteen year tenure on the Court of Appeals, Judge Cole distinguished himself with his scholarly and independent opinions, and we will miss him dearly in Maryland. 
   Mr. President, as this short account makes evident, Maryland is and has been proud to be the home of some of America's greatest African-Americans. These are people who did not let economic or racial barriers stop them from reaching their goals or achieving their dreams. These outstanding individuals, and many others from Maryland and across the United States, have opened doors and set high standards for later generations of African-Americans. Most importantly, however, these are people who continue to serve as role models for all Americans. 
   Indeed, the State of Maryland continues to be blessed and enriched with outstanding African-American leaders who have built on Maryland's rich African-American legacy. I speak here of such individuals as Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and NAACP President and CEO Kweisi Mfume. 
   I would like to observe that the State of Maryland is currently benefiting from a continued growth in our African-American population. Between 1990 and 1997, when the last set of complete figures were available from the Census Bureau, the number of African-Americans calling Maryland ``home'' grew to 1.4 million--an increase of 200,609 people. This makes Maryland the state with the eighth largest African-American population in the United States. Nearby Prince George's County was second in the nation in terms of growth during this seven-year period with 68,325 new African-American residents. 
   Mr. President, in closing, Maryland is fortunate to have such a rich legacy of African-American leadership as well as a growing population of young African-American men and women to whom this legacy will provide inspiration and examples. As I noted at the outset, Dr. Woodson believed in looking back in order to look forward. As I look back at the deeds and accomplishments of the Marylanders listed above, and of the many outstanding African-Americans who have contributed to American science, engineering, abolitionism, literature, religion, theater, education, civil rights, law, business, athletics, diplomacy and politics, I see much to inspire our forward march into the next century, during which I hope we will eradicate forever the scourge of prejudice and racial bias from our society.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the amendment that I and Senator WARNER and Senator ROBB and Senator MIKULSKI have offered is before the Senate. This is a very straightforward amendment expressing the sense of the Congress that parity between Federal civilian pay and military pay should be maintained. We should continue that parity. A comparison by CRS of military and civilian pay increases finds that 80 percent of the military and civilian pay increases in the last 25 years have been identical. Disparate treatment goes against established congressional policy that has ensured parity with all those who work to serve our Nation, whether in the Armed Forces or in the civilian workforce. 
   One of the rationales for the increase for military personnel, which is in this legislation which I support, has been to address the concerns about retention and recruitment problems. We have comparable problems with respect to the civilian service, and I think it is important to note that more and more of graduating classes indicate less interest in the Federal service. A GAO report in 1990 found that low pay was the most cited reason for employees leaving the civil service or refusing to take a Federal position in the first place. 
   Over the years, particularly in recent years, Federal employees have made significant sacrifices in the name of deficit reduction. The law governing Federal civilian pay has never been fully implemented since 1994. In fact, Federal civilian workers received a reduced annual adjustment. The gap continues to grow, which we are very concerned about. We have been through a downsizing period during which the Federal employees have continued to provide high-quality service. So I strongly urge my colleagues to support this provision. It is an effort to achieve a first-rate public service. 
   Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleague from Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI, to introduce legislation that is absolutely critical to the administration of justice and the economy in our State of Maryland. This legislation provides for four additional bankruptcy judges for the federal judicial District of Maryland. 
   This bill represents only the most recent of our efforts to strengthen Maryland's federal bankruptcy court. Early in the 105th Congress, we introduced legislation adding two additional bankruptcy judges for the District of Maryland, in line with the then-pending request of the Judicial Conference. The House of Representatives followed suit in summer 1997, passing legislation that authorized these two judges, in addition to other new bankruptcy judgeships throughout the country. Last year, the Senate overwhelmingly passed bankruptcy reform legislation that, among other things, authorized these two judgeships, though under the Senate bill the judges were of temporary, rather than permanent, status. This legislation ultimately was not enacted into law, however, and with such inaction the problem facing Maryland's sitting bankruptcy judges has only grown. Maryland remains without the additional judgeships it so desperately needs to make our bankruptcy system work. 
   Our State's need for additional bankruptcy judges has long since passed the critical stage. Since November 1993, when Maryland last received an additional bankruptcy judge, the number of bankruptcy filings in the State has more than doubled. While the entire nation has witnessed a surge in bankruptcy filings over the past several years, the increase in Maryland has dwarfed the national average increase. Bankruptcy filings in Maryland in the second quarter of 1998 grew at eight times the national rate of increase for that period; for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1998, the rate of increase in Maryland was the tenth greatest of the 90 federal judicial districts in the Nation. The District of Maryland ranks first among federal judicial districts in filings per judge. As noted earlier, each House of Congress authorized two additional bankruptcy judges for Maryland during the 105th Congress. Simply put, however, the problem has outpaced this solution. 
   The need for the four additional judgeships sought in this legislation becomes even more evident when one considers it in the context of the case-weighting system adopted by the Judicial Conference in 1991 to assess requests for additional bankruptcy judges. Under this system, different types of bankruptcy cases are assigned different degrees of difficulty and overall weighted case-hour goals are established for the judges. 
   The Judicial Conference begins to consider requests for additional judges when a district's per-judge weighted caseload reaches 1500 hours. The average United States Bankruptcy Judge had a weighted case-hour load of 1429 hours per year for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1998. For that same period, Maryland's bankruptcy judges averaged a weighted case-hour load of 3020 hours--an astounding 211 percent of the national average. Not only do the Maryland figures dwarf the national average; they also dwarf the prior Maryland figures which led to legislation passed by each Houses of Congress authorizing additional judgeships. Indeed, Maryland's overall weighted case load for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1998, represented a 25% increase over its load for the prior 12-month period alone. 
   I ask my colleagues to consider these telling statistics: 
   If Maryland were to receive two additional judgeships tomorrow, its per-judge weighted caseload would still be 2013 hours--41 percent greater than the national average last year, and 34 percent greater than the 1500-hour benchmark used by the Judicial Conference to evaluate requests for additional judgeships. 
   If Maryland were to receive three additional judgeships tomorrow, its per-judge weighted caseload would still be 1725 hours--21 percent more than the national average, and 15 percent greater than the Judicial Conference benchmark. 
   Only if Maryland were to receive four additional judgeships, as requested in this bill, would the per-judge caseload in Maryland approximate the national average. And even then each Maryland judge would have a caseload of 1510 case-weighted hours--still above the 1429-hour national average, and still above the 1500-hour Judicial Conference benchmark. 
   The additional judgeships sought in this bill are essential not only for effective judicial administration, but also for Maryland's economy. Bankruptcy laws foster orderly, constructive relationships between debtors and creditors during times of economic difficulty. Their effective and expeditious implementation results in businesses being reorganized, jobs (provided by creditors and debtors) preserved, and debts managed fairly. Overworked bankruptcy courts have a destabilizing effect on this system, and the inevitable delays occasioned by the lack of judges harm creditors and debtors, imperiling Maryland's businesses and the people they employ. 
   It is expected that bankruptcy reform legislation will be one of the first items on the Senate's agenda now that it has resumed legislative business. Adding judgeships in Maryland's and other bankruptcy courts in need of relief is an essential component of any such reform, given that the legislation we are contemplating will not only not ease the burdens on these courts, but in fact will increase these burdens by imposing new responsibilities on our nation's bankruptcy judges. And even if comprehensive bankruptcy reform fails or is delayed, the current state of affairs facing Maryland's bankruptcy court requires immediate action in the form of adding judges to that court. 
   In closing let me once again commend the efforts of Maryland's four sitting bankruptcy judges--Chief Judge Paul Mannes and Judges Duncan Keir, James Schneider, and Steve Derby. Their dedication to the administration of justice is especially impressive given the extraordinary burdens placed on them--burdens which the Senate ought to ease at the earliest possible instance.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President I will be very brief. I appreciate the courtesy of the distinguished Senator from Georgia in allowing me to present this amendment before he presents his. We will take this up in the morning. There will be a very limited amount of time. 
   Very simply, this is a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that there should be parity between the adjustments and the compensation of members of the uniformed services and the adjustments and the compensation of civilian employees of the United States. In almost every year over the past two decades, there have been equal adjustments in the compensation of members of the uniformed services and the compensation of civilian employees of the United States, and this expresses the sense of the Congress that this parity in adjustments should continue. 
   I know a number of Members wish to join in cosponsoring, and I add Senators ROBB and Senator MIKULSKI as cosponsors at this point. Members will obviously have a chance to do that first thing in the morning. Senator WARNER and I can speak to it briefly in the morning. 
   It is a very straightforward amendment. I don't know of any opposition to it. I very strongly urge my colleagues to be supportive of this amendment. 
   I again thank the Senator from Georgia for his kindness, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, together with my colleague Senator MIKULSKI, which will help commemorate and preserve significant sites associated with America's Second War of Independence, the War of 1812. My legislation, entitled ``The Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail Study Act of 1999,'' directs the Secretary of the Interior to initiate a study to assess the feasibility and desirability of designating the route of the British invasion of Washington, D.C. and their subsequent defeat at Baltimore, Maryland, as a National Historic Trail. A similar companion bill is being sponsored by Congressmen BEN CARDIN and WAYNE GILCHREST in the House of Representatives. 
   Since the passage of the National Trail Systems Act of 1968, the National Park Service has recognized historically significant routes of exploration, migration and military action through its National Historic Trails Program. Routes such as the Juan Bautista de Anza, Lewis and Clark, Pony Express and Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trails cross our country and represent important episodes of our nation's history, episodes which were influential in shaping the very future of this country. It is my view that the inclusion of the Star-Spangled Banner Trail will give long overdue recognition to another of these important events. 
   The War of 1812, and the Chesapeake Campaign in particular, mark a turning point in the development of the United States. Faced with the possibility of losing the independence for which they struggled so valiantly, the citizens of this country were forced to assert themselves on an international level. 
   From the period of the arrival of the British forces at Benedict, in Charles County, Maryland, on August 18, 1814, to the American victory at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, on September 14, 1814, the war took a dramatic turn. The American forces, largely comprised of Maryland's citizens, were able to slow the British advance through the state and successfully defended Baltimore, leading to the retreat of the British. 
   The more than 30 sites along this trail mark some of the most historically important events of the War of 1812. The Star-Spangled Banner Trail, commemorating the only combined naval and land attack on the United States, begins with the June, 1814 battles between the British Navy and the American Chesapeake Flotilla at St. Leonard's Creek in Calvert County, Maryland. It continues to the site of the British landing at Benedict, Maryland the starting point of the British march to the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. The trail follows the defeat of the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, the evacuation of the United States Government, the burning of the nation's capital, including the White House and the Capitol Building, the battle at North Point and the bombardment of Fort McHenry, site of the composition of our National Anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner, and the ultimate defeat of the British.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chief Justice and colleagues, in his award-winning book ``The Making of the President, 1960,'' Theodore H. White refers to an American Presidential election as ``the most awesome transfer of power in the world.'' 
   He notes that:  
   No people has succeeded at it better or over a longer period of time than the Americans. Yet as the transfer of this power takes place, there is nothing to be seen except an occasional line outside a church or school or file of people fidgeting in the rain, waiting to enter the voting booths. No bands play on election day, no troops march, no guns are readied, no conspirators gather in secret headquarters.  
   And later in that opening chapter White observes:  
   Good or bad, whatever the decision, America will accept the decision and cut down any man who goes against it, even though for millions the decision runs contrary to their own votes. The general vote is an expression of national will, the only substitute for violence and blood.  
   I begin with those quotes to underscore the critical significance of a Presidential election in the structure of our national politics. Many learned commentators have observed that one of the original contributions to the art of government made by the Constitutional Convention was to develop a Presidential, as opposed to a parliamentary, system of government, wherein the executive is chosen by the electorate and is not dependent upon the confidence of the legislature for his office. As former Attorney General Katzenbach observed:  
   It is a serious matter for the Congress to remove a President who has been elected in a democratic process for a term of four years, raising fundamental concerns about the separation of powers.  
   He goes on to note that if the removal power is not limited, as it clearly is, impeachment could be converted into a parliamentary vote of no confidence which, whatever its merits, is not our constitutional system. The separation of powers embraced in our Constitution and the fixed term of the President have been credited by many observers with providing stability to our political system. 
   It is important therefore to recognize that in considering the matter before us we do so in the context of a Presidential election, wherein the people have chosen the single leader of the executive branch of our Government--the President. 
   Since the Framers put the impeachment remedy in the Constitution, it is obvious they recognized that there may be circumstances which require the Congress to remove a duly elected President. However, in my judgment, as the Framers indicated, we need to be very careful, very cautious, very prudent, in undertaking that remedy lest we introduce a dangerous instability in the workings of our political institutions. 
   Viscount Bryce, whose bust is at the foot of the steps in the hallway below, was a distinguished commentator about the American political system. He wrote in ``The American Commonwealth'' in discussing the impeachment of a President:  
   Impeachment is the heaviest piece of artillery in the congressional arsenal, but because it is so heavy, it is unfit for ordinary use. It is like a 100-ton gun which needs complex machinery to bring it into position, an enormous charge of powder to fire it, and a large mark to aim at. Or to vary this simile, impeachment is what physicians call a heroic medicine, an extreme remedy proper to be applied against an official guilty of political crimes.   
   Let me turn next to the argument which seeks to draw an analogy between the impeachment of a President and the impeachment of judges, an argument that cites three recent cases in which judges have been removed from office. In my view, this analogy misses the mark. 
   Two of the judges that the Senate convicted and thus removed from office had been accused in a criminal case, tried before a jury, found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and were in jail. Until we removed them they were still drawing their salary. In the third case, the defendant had been acquitted of bribery, but a judicial inquiry found that he had perjured himself to cover up the bribery misdeeds. Difference No. 1: Judges can be criminally prosecuted while in office; the President cannot. (At least that has been the theory up to this point.) 
   Secondly, elected versus appointed. Judges are appointed to the bench for life. They can only be removed by impeachment. The President is elected by the people for a 4-year term and can only hold two such terms. As President Ford, when he was a Congressman, stated:  
   I think it is fair to come to one conclusion, however, from our history of impeachments. A higher standard is expected of Federal judges than of any other civil officers of the United States. The President and the Vice President and all persons holding office at the pleasure can be thrown out of office by the voters at least every 4 years.  
   Thirdly, one needs to consider the injury to the branch of Government which would result from the removal of the officer. The removal of one judge out of hundreds and hundreds of judges does not significantly affect the operation of the judicial branch of our Government. The removal of the President, the single head of the executive branch, obviously is in an entirely different category. The President, under our system, holds the executive power. In the end, executive branch decisions are his decisions. 
   In the minority report in the House Watergate proceedings, Republican Members stated:  
   The removal of a President from office would obviously have a far greater impact upon the equilibrium of our system of Government than removal of a single Federal judge.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators MIKULSKI and WARNER in submitting a resolution which would express the sense of the Congress that parity between Federal civilian pay and military pay should be maintained. Disparate treatment of civilian and military pay goes against longstanding Congressional policy that for more than a decade has ensured parity for all those who have chosen to serve our Nation, whether that service be in the civilian workforce or in the armed services. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important resolution.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I rise to express my support for S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, a bill to guarantee all Americans with private health insurance, and particularly those in HMOs or other managed care plans, certain fundamental rights regarding their health care coverage. 
   Over the past decease, our health care system has changed dramatically. Today, approximately 161 million Americans receive medical coverage through some type of managed care organization. Regrettably, the change has had some unfortunate consequences. Many in managed care plans experience increasing restrictions on their choice of doctors, growing limitations on their access to necessary treatment, and an overriding emphasis on cost cutting at the expense of quality. 
   This shift to managed care, largely a response to rapidly increasing medical costs, has resulted in a health care system overly driven by the need to secure healthy profit margins. The impact these market forces have on the health care Americans receive must be moderated. Access to quality health care is an essential human need, and in a democratic society, it must be recognized as a fundamental right.  
   Our bill would guarantee basic patient protections to all consumers of private insurance. It would ensure that patients receive the treatment they have been promised and have paid for. This bill would prevent HMOs and other health plans from arbitrarily interfering with doctors' decisions regarding the treatment their patients require. 
   Our bill would restore patients' ability to trust that their health care practitioners advice is driven solely by health concerns, not cost concerns. HMOs and other health care plans would be prohibited from restricting which treatment options doctors may discuss with their patients. In addition, our bill would outlaw the use of financial incentives to reward doctors for cutting costs by recommending against potentially necessary treatments. 
   One of the most critical patient protections that would be provided under our bill is guaranteed access to emergency care. The Patients' Bill of Rights Act would ensure that patients could go to any emergency room during a medical emergency without calling their health plan for permission first. Emergency room doctors could stabilize the patient and focus on providing them the care they need without worrying about payment until after the emergency has subsided.

    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues on the Senate Steel Caucus in sponsoring the Trade Fairness Act of 1999. This legislation seeks to respond to the current steel import crisis and prevent future crises by amending U.S. trade law and creating a comprehensive steel import monitoring system. 
   Within the past year, foreign steel has been imported into the United States at unprecedented levels and at prices far below cost. As economic markets have failed in Russia and Asia, foreign steel manufacturers have increasingly turned to the United States to sell their product and, in return, obtain hard currency. In fact, the import rate rose 30 percent in the first ten months of 1998, as compared with the same period last year, and U.S. steel imports this past October were the second highest in history. 
   As a result, U.S. steel manufacturers are faced with a real crisis, one that threatens to undermine a key sector of our economy. Plants across the country have been forced to shorten shifts,  lay-off workers and, in some cases, declare bankruptcy. In my own state, workers at Bethlehem Steel's Sparrows Point Division have been subjected to shorter hours, shorter shifts and even the shutting down of Sparrows Point's galvanized steel line. 
   Mr. President, for the past fifteen years, the U.S. steel industry has worked aggressively to streamline its operations, improve productivity and cut costs, but it cannot compete against illegally dumped steel. It is, in fact, time for this Congress to Stand Up For Steel. 
   With this legislation, we can begin to do just that. The Trade Fairness Act of 1999 is comprised of two sections which will enhance the ability of the Administration to take action on this crisis. The first of these sections amends the emergency safeguards provisions, Section 201, of the 1974 Trade Act which allows the President to grant temporary import relief to a domestic industry which the International Trade Commission finds has been seriously injured by increased imports. This section seeks not only to ensure that the steel industry is treated equitably, but that all domestic industries may be allowed to compete fairly in the global marketplace. 
   The second section creates a comprehensive steel import monitoring program which requires importers to provide information including the name and address of the importer, supplier and producer of the goods to be imported, the country of origin of the goods, the expected date of entry of the goods, a description of the goods, including the classification of these goods under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, and the quantity of the goods to be imported. This information will aid the Administration in monitoring the amount of steel brought into the United States and allow these numbers to be tabulated and released at a rate faster than at present. 
   Mr. President, as you know, on January 7, the Administration submitted the ``Report to Congress on a Comprehensive Plan for Responding to the Increase in Steel Imports.'' I am disappointed that this report appears largely to be a recital of things already done by the Administration, rather than new steps planned to address the problem. The Administration should be focusing on keeping America's steelworkers in their line of work, instead of in line collecting unemployment. For over a century, the steel industry has stood tall and served as a foundation of the American economy. The time for the Administration to Stand Up For Steel is now. The U.S. steel industry and the 226,000 Americans employed by it deserve nothing less than the full support of their country. 
   The Trade Fairness Act of 1999 would allow the Administration to provide strong support for the American steel industry. I strongly urge my colleagues to support its passage.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to authorize continued U.S. participation in the International Mobile Satellite Organization, currently known as ``Inmarsat'', during and after its restructuring, scheduled to take place April 1. The United States is currently a member of this organization, but its structure and functions are slated for significant reform. Rather than actually owning and operating mobile satellite telecommunications facilities, the intergovernmental institution will retain the much more limited role of overseeing the provision of global maritime distress and safety services, ensuring that this important function is carried out properly and effectively under contract. U.S. participation in the organization--which will keep the same name but change its acronym to ``IMSO''--will not require a U.S. financial contribution and will not impose any new legal obligations upon the U.S. government. Privatization of Inmarsat's commercial satellite business is an objective broadly shared by the legislative and executive branches, American businesses, COMSAT, which is the U.S. signatory entity, and the international community. 
   To give some brief background, Inmarsat was established in 1979 to serve the global maritime industry by developing satellite communications for ship management and distress and safety applications. Over the past 20 years, Inmarsat has expanded both in terms of membership and mission. The intergovernmental organization now counts 85 member countries and has expanded into land-mobile and aeronautical communications. 
   Inmarsat's governing bodies, the Assembly of Parties and the Inmarsat Council, have reached an agreement to restructure the organization, a move that has been strongly supported and encouraged by the United States. This restructuring will shift Inmarsat's commercial activities out of the intergovernmental organization and into a broadly-owned public corporation by next spring. The new corporation will acquire all of Inmarsat's operational assets, including its satellites, and will assume all of Inmarsat's operational functions. All that will remain of the intergovernmental institution is a scaled-down secretariat with a small staff to ensure that the new corporation continues to meet certain public service obligations, such as the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). It is important to U.S. interests that we participate in the oversight of this function, as well as be fully represented in the organization throughout the process of privatization. 
   The legislation I am introducing will enable a smooth transition to the new structure. It contains two major provisions. First, it authorizes the President to maintain U.S. membership in IMSO after restructuring to ensure the continued provision of global maritime distress and safety satellite communications services. Second, it repeals those provisions of the International Maritime Satellite Telecommunications Act that will be rendered obsolete by the restructuring of Inmarsat, including all those relating to COMSAT's role as the United States' signatory. The bill's provisions will take effect on the date that Inmarsat transfers its commercial operations to the new corporation.

   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to address a very important issue: the protection of every American's personal, sensitive, financial information that is held by their bank, securities broker-dealer, or insurance company. I am introducing a bill to provide basic financial privacy protections for our citizens. I am pleased that Senators DODD, BRYAN, LEAHY, EDWARDS, and HOLLINGS are joining me in the introduction of the Financial Information Privacy Act of 1999.  
   This bill seeks to protect a fundamental right of privacy for every American who entrusts his or her highly sensitive and confidential financial information to a financial institution. Every American should know whether the financial institution with which he or she does business undertakes to sell or share that personal sensitive information with anyone else. Every American should know who would be obtaining that information, and why. Every American should have the opportunity to say ``no'' if he or she does not want that confidential information disclosed. Every American should be allowed to make certain that the information is correct. And these rights should be enforceable. 
   This bill, Mr. President, would accomplish these objectives. 
   Few Americans understand that, under current Federal law, a bank, broker, or insurance company may take any information it obtains about a customer through his or her transactions, and sell or transfer that information to a third party. For example, they may sell that information to a direct marketer or another financial institution, or post it on an Internet website without obtaining the customer's consent or even notifying the customer. 
   The amount of information that can be disclosed is enormous. It includes: 
   Savings and checking account balances; 
   certificate of deposit maturity dates and balances; 
   any check an individual writes; 
   any check that is deposited into a customer's account; 
   stock and mutual fund purchases and sales; 
   life insurance payouts; and 
   health insurance claims. 
   Today's technology makes it easier, faster, and less costly than ever for institutions to have immediate access to large amounts of customer information; to analyze that data; and to send that data to others. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies are increasingly affiliating and ``cross-marketing,'' or selling the products of affiliates to existing customers. This can entail the warehousing of large amounts of highly sensitive customer information and selling it to or sharing it with other companies, for purposes unknown to the customer. While cross-marketing can bring new and beneficial products to receptive consumers, it can also result in unwanted invasions of personal privacy without customers' knowledge.
