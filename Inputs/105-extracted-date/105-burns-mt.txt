Mr. BURNS. I thank my colleagues. Yes, the amendments do satisfy my concerns. 
The amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) approved by the Senate today, to implement in the United States the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, are an important achievement in ensuring fair play for American companies doing business overseas. The value of this legislation for U.S. business fully justifies the action we are taking today. However, there are provisions in this bill that are unrelated to implementation of the OECD convention. I would have preferred a bill that did not contain these unrelated provisions, principally embodied in Section 5. 
The House earlier passed S. 2375 with an amendment making significant changes to language addressing the treatment of international organizations providing commercial communications services which had earlier been contained in Section 5 of H.R. 4353 as reported by the House Commerce Committee. These changes reflect an agreement between the House and Senate Commerce Committee leaders. It is my understanding that the House Commerce Committee report accompanying H.R. 4353 addressing Section 5 of that bill is not germane to the interpretation of section 5 in light of the significant changes made therein. 
With respect to Section 5 and the other provisions of the bill concerning the international organizations INTELSAT and Inmarsat, the Senate is accepting these provisions because of our understanding that nothing in the bill will change the immunities treatment of INTELSAT and Inmarsat, nor create an inconsistency with U.S. obligations under international agreements (e.g., by requiring action or inaction by the Executive Branch) or interfere with the President's authorities under the constitution to conduct the foreign relations of the United States. To achieve the objectives of Section 5, the President can be expected to use existing and future negotiations aimed at the privatization of the telecommunications services of INTELSAT and Inmarsat. 
I have the following specific views with regard to the bill's telecommunications provisions: 
The United States remains in a positions to meet fully its obligations under the INTELSAT Headquarters Agreement, an international agreement under which the United States has undertaken international legal obligations to INTELSAT. Nothing in the statute changes the immunity standards of that Agreement. Based on my discussions with the administration, I expect that the President will designate the INTELSAT Headquarters Agreement under subsection (d)(2). 
The requirement in [section 5(d)(1)] for the President, consistent with requirements in international agreements to which the U.S. is a party, to take all appropriate actions to eliminate or limit substantially any privileges and immunities from suit or legal process accorded to an international organization applies only to suits or legal process in respect of the organizations' commercial activities. Such an interpretation would be consistent with the theory of sovereign immunity to which the United States adheres. 
The requirements [in Section 5(d)] for the President, consistent with requirements in international agreements to which the U.S. is a party, expeditiously take all appropriate actions to eliminate or limit substantially privileges and immunities does not compel the President to take any action which the President may find to be contrary to the interests of the United States and does not compel the President to decertify INTELSAT or Inmarsat under the International Organizations Immunities Act I am pleased that subsection 5(d) gives the President broad discretion to determine what measures are `appropriate' to achieve the objectives of section 5. 
The bill should not frustrate negotiations by the President to privatize successfully the commercial activities of INTELSAT and Inmarsat in a fashion that eliminates all privileges and immunities for such activities; this being the best means of satisfying the objective of fair and open commercial competition. 
I further understand that all efforts of INTELSAT and Inmarsat to restructure into private business organizations constitute core functions of these organizations, not commercial functions, within the meaning of subsection (c)(1) of Section 5. 
I understand that Section (5) of S. 2375 is not intended to overturn or disturb any judicial decision interpreting the privileges and immunities of signatories of INTELSAT and Inmarsat, especially Alpha Lyracom (PanAmSat) v. COMSAT, 946 F.2d 168 (2d Cir. 1991). 
It is my understanding that subsection (d) of Section (5) is intended to become effective on May 1, 1999 when subsection (c) becomes effective, since the two subsections are intended to operate in concert. 
I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the scope and intent of this legislation. At this time, I would like to ask the distinguished Senator from Arizona, the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation if he concurs?

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his remarks and want to confirm that I plan to introduce this legislation next year. Also, I want to congratulate Senator Ford on his efforts on this legislation. Due to his persistence, much of the preliminary work on this bill has been done. While we will miss his presence on the Commerce Committee next year, we will continue to benefit from his work as a member of this body.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the intent of Congress regarding tax incentives for alternative fuels. These incentives are important tools for our nation's long-term energy policy. 
Starting with the energy crisis in the 1970s, Congress has acted on numerous occasions to provide tax credits intended to develop alternative fuels. Prior Congresses took these steps in recognition of the need to encourage the development and use of alternative fuels which promise that we as a nation will never be dependent on others for our energy resources. For example, Section 29, which expired earlier this year, and Section 45, which is due to expire next June, were both intended to encourage the development of nonconventional fuels. 
Today, our nation not only needs to continue its efforts to develop alternative fuel resources, but given our ever growing energy requirements, we must consider the environmental impact that conventional and nonconventional fuels have on our environment, particularly in light of the Clean Air Act. 
In order to maximize the most efficient use of our nation's resources, Congress needs to commit to the development of clean alternative fuels. We need also to use our nation's technologies to develop environmentally clean alternative liquid fuels from coal. 
In Montana, we have vast coal reserves. There are technologies that can upgrade the coal from these reserves and reduce current difficulties associated with the development of these fields. However, these technologies are not likely to be developed, and therefore these vast natural resources are not likely to be used, unless Congress provides incentives to develop clean alternative fuels. 
I am concerned that we have not been able to fully discuss the merits of such incentives in our budget debate this past month. For example, an extension of Section 29 was included in the Senate version of the tax extenders, but that provision was not included in the final package. 
I would urge my colleagues to bring this debate to the floor in the 106th Congress to ensure that the issue of encouraging the development of clean alternative fuels is a priority in our nation's energy policy.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, one does not have to reiterate the complexity of going through this process of appropriations. I rise on this floor of the Senate with mixed emotions this afternoon as we consider the omnibus appropriations bill for 1999. I, as the speaker before me, know and understand what the chairman of the Appropriations Committee has gone through to bring this process to this point. I shall vote yea on this bill, but anybody who tells me that they have a handle on this bill would be just like their local weather forecaster--they are either a fool or a newcomer. 
The framers of our Constitution did not envision the process which was the design of an administration that was irresponsible and reckless in both actions and words with the Congress and the people of this country. Being forced into a situation where the will of Americans is denied in the spending of their hard-earned money, that is not my idea of representative government. The same Americans were even denied debate on issues that would become the law of the land. I think it was Thomas Jefferson who said that the Constitution should be flexible; it should be subject to change with the times to reflect the will of the people and not to the master politician. I believe the American people have fallen prey to those who have mastered their craft very well. 
The process, as all appropriations processes, started as it should have; subcommittees, working with the administration, held hearings with the different Departments of the Federal Government, which is the administration. After being completed at that level, the consideration moved to the full Appropriations Committee. All members of that committee debated and passed on to the full Senate the appropriations bill that was started at the subcommittee level some 6 or 7 months ago. 
Where were all the voices that we hear now when the work was being done at the grassroots level? Now we hear them as we come to the close of the 105th Congress. Did we not know then that a well-orchestrated delaying action was taking shape? The answer is a resounding yes. There was not one, not one who as a Member of Congress representing their respective States, was not aware, did not know where we were heading. Attempts by this administration were made to shortcut or shortcircuit the process. So when the 105th Congress closes its work, it will be the responsibility of the 106th Congress to ensure that this will never happen again. The American people deserve no less. 
Now, as to the bill itself, to those critics who say there is not good in this bill, I say you are wrong. To those who say there is no tax relief in this bill, I say you are wrong--small as is might seem. And to say that tax relief is not for the proper segment of our Nation's economy, I say you are also wrong. To those who would say we have saved, saved I say, Social Security and the financial foundation of our Nation, I say you are wrong again. 
It is disingenuous to ask that money be spent from the Nation's Treasury for domestic social programs under emergency conditions knowing of the surplus of funds that now exists and knowing the appropriations would not be subject to budget caps that were agreed to over a year ago. The only absolute condition--Social Security can be saved and reformed--is when Congress has created and saved, saved those surplus funds to ensure its solvency. Spending some of the surplus weakens our ability to reform and ensure the solvency of any entitlement deemed by this Congress or the administration. 
The most important ingredient to make our system work for all Americans is trust and integrity. The framers of the Constitution warned us that there are weaknesses and pitfalls and certain dangers in self-government. 
In fact, the self-governed, who have the power to vote themselves bread with not one drop of sweat falling from their brows, are not absolved from the responsibility that they have at the ballot box. We, every American, all share this duty. 
For this system to survive depends on the degree of national responsibility that is found in their elected Representatives. This 105th Congress has addressed crises that fell on our ability to produce food and fiber for this Nation. We addressed the crisis that has befallen our rural communities as a result. 
We have attempted to address education by using money alone. Again, I fear that we will be disappointed with the results. In this body, we make most of our decisions based on history. The key has always been the past. Communities of this Nation should have, and have had, the power and the wisdom to say `what, why, and how' they should educate the next generation. 
The stakes are high, as the very freedoms we all hold dear and above all else are at issue. The price of freedom is too dear to change the very basic foundation. The Nation has always drawn its power from local communities and their ability to solve not just local problems, but most of the problems of the Nation's interests. To abandon that premise would be dangerous and unwise. 
It is unfortunate that we have to pass a measure of this magnitude, of this size, but that is the way it was forced upon this Congress this year. Were bad decisions made early on? Yes. But we can make some good decisions now. We must always keep in mind: We only have a surplus in our Nation's Treasury as a result of a strong economy. You could say the taxpayer really overpaid us. If they did, they are also telling us that we should not keep the change. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as we started to hear this debate this morning, and talking about different ways of accomplishing things here on a nonpartisan basis, it started off a little on the partisan side. Education is very dear to the hearts of all of us because all of us, probably, have had a connection with kids and so have been involved in education. I still have one going to school. But to hear the other side talk, we have done nothing about that. 
You know, we have increased the funds for special education since the Republicans took over in 1994. 
We passed education savings accounts that would empower parents to make choices for their own children with regard to books and computers and this type stuff. That was a bad idea to the President. He vetoed it. I guess he wants to empower bureaucracy rather than empower parents. 
We passed the opportunity scholarships, a highly popular program here in Washington, DC, that would allow parents more choice of where to send their kids to school. That was vetoed. 
We passed a $2.74 billion education bill for classrooms, and we guaranteed that 95 percent of it would get to kids. That met with stiff opposition from the President. 
Encouraging States to implement teacher testing and merit pay, what is wrong with that? That got vetoed by the President. 
Strengthening safe schools, the antigun program--that was vetoed. 
Tax relief to employers who provide workers education assistance, folks we are retraining in this rapidly changing world of technology? Vetoed by the President. 
I have to look and say all at once: 2 plus 2 is not making 5, when we start talking about education and who wants to do what for whom. 
I just noticed here, earlier this year my good friend from Massachusetts said we have `a relationship with Federal, State, and local community levels in terms of education; it is a partnership.' Tell me how good this partnership is. The Federal Government only provides 7 percent of the money but 50 percent of the paperwork. That should not surprise you a lot if you have been around government at any time. 
In 1969, our expenditure was $68 billion; in 1996, it was $564 billion; and yet even by their own admission, education continues to struggle and go down. That is the point I wanted to make here. I would say whenever we start looking at education, the answer lies in the realization that you cannot kill or do away with an idea. Ideas rule the world. The only way you get rid of a bad idea is with a better one. I think we have come up with some awfully good ideas. 
I yield to my friend from Texas.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, five Senators will move on at the closing of this session of the 105th Congress. And they are Senators that have, with the exception of one, been here ever since I joined this body back in 1989. 
Dirk Kempthorne from Idaho was elected after I was. And now after one term he has elected to go back to his home State of Idaho. 
It seems like it becomes more and more difficult, as time goes by, to attract men and women to public service, and especially to public service when there are elections. 
He brought a certain quality to this Senate. On his work on the Environment and Public Works Committee, he was sensitive to the environment and all the public infrastructure that we enjoy across this country. It just seemed to fit, because he had come here after being the mayor of Boise, ID. And his very first objective was to tackle this business of unfunded mandates. He took that issue on and provided the leadership, and finally we passed a law that unfunded mandates must be adhered to whenever we tell local government, State government that it is going to take some of your money to comply with the laws as passed by the Federal Government. 
He, like me, had come out of local government. He knew the stresses and the pains of city councilmen and mayors and county commissioners every time they struggle with their budget in order to provide the services for their people, when it comes to schools and roads and public safety--all the demands that we enjoy down to our neighborhoods. 
We shall miss him in this body. 
To my friend, John Glenn of Ohio, who has already made his mark in history that shall live forever, he has left his tracks in this body. And not many know--and maybe not even him--but I was a lowly corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps when he was flying in the Marine Corps. So my memory of John Glenn goes back more than 40 years to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in Santa Anna, CA. 
As he goes into space again at the end of this month, we wish him Godspeed. He gave this country pride as he lifted off and became the first American to orbit the Earth. And he carried with him all of the wishes of the American people. 
To Dan Coats of Indiana, a classmate, we came to this body together in 1989. Our routes were a little different, but yet almost the same--he coming from the House of Representatives and me coming from local government. 
He is a living example of a person dedicated to public service. But it never affected his solid core values. 
He has not changed one iota since I first met him back in 1989. 
The other principal is on the floor today. It is Wendell Ford of Kentucky. I was fortunate to serve on two of the most fascinating and hard-working committees in the U.S. Senate with Senator Ford: The Commerce Committee and the Energy Committee. Those committees, folks, touch every life in America every day. 
We flip on our lights at home or in our businesses. We pick up the telephone, listen to our radio, watch our televisions, move ourselves from point A to point B, no matter what the mode --whether it is auto, train or plane. Yes, all of the great scientific advances this country has made, and research and the improvement of everyday life and, yes, even our venture into space comes under the auspices of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and the Energy Committee. Those two committees play such a major role in the everyday workings of America. 
Wendell Ford was one great champion and one of the true principals in formulating policies that we enjoy today. He played a major role in each and every one of them. 
Again, it was my good fortune to work with Senator Bumpers on two committees: The Small Business Committee and the Energy Committee. There is no one in this body that has been more true to his deeply held beliefs than Senator Bumpers. Our views did not always mesh--and that is true with Senator Ford. It was their wisdom and the way they dealt with their fellow Senators that we worked our way through difficult issues and hard times with a sense of humor. I always say if you come from Arkansas you have to have a pretty good sense of humor. My roots go back to Missouri; I know we had to develop humor very early. Nonetheless, it was the integrity and the honesty that allowed us to settle our differences, even though we were 180 degrees off plumb. 
I think I have taken from them much more than I have given back to them. This body has gained more than it can repay. This Nation is a better Nation for all of them serving in the U.S. Senate. 
In our country we don't say goodbye, we just say so long. But we say so long to these Senators from our everyday activities on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am sure our trails will cross many times in the future. Should they not, I will be the most disappointed of all. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, if my friend from Indiana and my friend from Connecticut will yield, I am not going to oppose this amendment. I congratulate both of them, as they have been dedicated to raising the awareness of the garbage that we have on the Internet. No technology that we can devise, that stays in place very long, is going to actually protect our young children from the pitfalls of the stuff that we find on there. The only thing that we can do, and I think both of them have done this very well, is to raise the awareness of the need for adult supervision whenever young people go on the Internet. That is the only way. That is the only way we are going to get protection and also a public awareness and a public feeling that we are not going to do business with Internet providers who offer this stuff. 
We cannot protect and use this great tool called the glass highway and bring any integrity to it unless, No. 1, we secure it when I send a message to you. Of course, that is the encryption issue, and that is an issue we have to fight another day, as far as law enforcement surveillance and this type of thing is concerned. But we cannot be lulled or rocked into a position of where we are in a basket of comfort, thinking we have done the job and protected our children from the pedophiles and the garbage that we find on the Internet, because the Internet is going to reflect what we have in society. No matter where you go, you will find what you are looking for. It is going to be there, too, just like it is downtown or any place in America. 
So, I am not going to oppose this amendment. I do have some reservations about it because, No. 1, I think it is overreaching a little bit into industrial policy, as far as what we should be doing. But I tell Americans, don't get comfortable in this basket of security because we have this amendment or that we have this legislation, that we are still going to be susceptible to the people who prey on the Internet with garbage. We will never solve that problem. The only place it will be solved is through parents and us talking about it and raising the awareness that it is there. Parental supervision, supervision in our schools and our libraries, that is the only way we defeat this. Because basically we are decent people, that is what will defeat it. That is what will finally crowd it off of there, and also secure it, so maybe there will not be any room for it. I hope that would be the case, also. 
I congratulate the Senator from Indiana. I will miss him and his service in the next U.S. Senate. But nobody has a more stellar record than Senator Coats on these issues of family and decency in the public place. I appreciate that. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, Governor Marc Racicot of my home State of Montana recently wrote an op-ed on community service which appeared in the Washington Times and The Hill newspapers. For the benefit of those who haven't seen it, I ask to have the op-ed inserted into the Congressional Record. 
From The Washington, Times, Aug. 31, 1998  
Community Service That Works  
Governors meet together and routinely stake out areas of broad bipartisan agreement that transcend the partisan struggles that have become synonymous with election-year politics. One issue that enjoys strong support from governors of both parties is national and community service. The support for service is based on a simple conviction that I share with many other governors: that every generation of young people needs to accept responsibility for its country and its community. 
As a first-term Republican governor in January, 1993, I asked, and our legislature approved, a proposal to create a Governor's Office of Community Service intended to enhance the ethic of service and elevate the importance of `community,' particularly among our young people. Meaningful service, we believed, would nurture productive young citizens committed to the future of our state because they had invested their sweat and labor in that future. Here in Montana, we sought to encourage service as a life-long `habit of the heart.' 
When the National Community Service Act of 1993 was passed, Montana was in an ideal position to move forward with the opportunity offered through AmeriCorps. The Office of Community Service's mission and the mission of AmeriCorps was one and the same: to develop opportunities for young people to provide meaningful, direct and demonstrable service to their communities. It was our hope that AmeriCorps would help us to build unique partnerships with public and private agencies by engaging young people in productive and meaningful service to their communities. These partnerships would serve as clear examples of how we could work together in Montana to improve how we, as fellow citizens, respond to pressing needs. 
Now in its fourth year, AmeriCorps offers a creative, effective, and non-bureaucratic means of addressing the unmet education, human, public safety and environmental needs of our state-- and our country. Indeed, AmeriCorps has become a model of devolution, where real authority and ownership for a federal initiative is delegated to the states. Through governor-appointed bipartisan state commissions, priorities are established and projects are selected to receive AmeriCorps funding. 
The results are impressive. Last year alone, our locally-run AmeriCorps programs generated nearly $1,000 hours of service to Montana communities. Their service directly benefits 50,000 children and families in Montana, and indirectly almost one-third of our state population. Nationally, similar results abound. This year, some 40,000 AmeriCorps members will get things done for more than 1,200 communities across the country. 
When AmeriCorps was created, some feared it might replay the worst of the welfare state--an entrenched, expensive, Washington run program. Many feared, even more, that it would undermine traditional volunteers with yet another federal program. I can say from experience that the fears were misplaced. As a governor who tries very hard to be careful with tax dollars, I have witnessed time and again the fruits of this prudent investment in Montana. 
Now, after more than five years, we have seen a tremendous rekindling of a sense of public service and civic duty, in many ways, through the programs and opportunities generated through the National Community Service Act. I am convinced national and community service promotes core values--hard work, self-discipline, civic duty, personal responsibility, the cherishing of human life--that we too often sadly find lacking. If the era of big government is finally over, certainly the era of big citizenship must begin. 
I have joined twelve of my fellow governors in urging not only continued federal funding of AmeriCorps, but also reauthorization of the Act, increasing the partnership with states and the authority of directing these programs at the state level. We join with our peers from the New England Governors' Conference in urging Congress to support reauthorizing the National Community Service Amendments Act, in order to improve the laws's current language. As their resolution notes, we support the bill's `devolution provisions that add authority and flexibility to states . . . [to] provide Governor-appointed state commissions more control over program selection.' 
Community service is a vital element in the chemistry of our existence as a society, renewing our sense of community and civic initiative. It is the glue that bonds free peoples together. We in Montana have seen how vitally important this is, recently having completed our state Governors' Summit on Youth, and witnessing the real necessity of promoting opportunities for young people to give back to others. Through community service they learn what it's like to belong to something good and solid and decent. AmeriCorps helps provide that opportunity and truly puts the states in the driver's seat, which translates into meaningful ownership, and impact, at the state and local level.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as we move into the final week of the 105th Congress, I am reminded by everything that is going on around us of the importance of our work here. Most Senators would agree that this will be a closing unlike what the majority of Senators have ever seen. It will test each and every one of us and will remind Members just why we are here. 
It will test our patience and stamina regarding each and every piece of legislation that we have toiled on throughout the 105th Congress in the last 2 years. We have worked on legislation that has been in the pipeline, and now we are coming down to the small end of the funnel. Just as air, when compressed, picks up velocity, legislation picks up movement in the last week of a session. 
The agenda of this Congress has been and should be simple. I gather it has been a simple one. We responded to emergencies all across the land and, yes, beyond the shores of our great land. We responded to the needs of people within our borders, attended to the needs that were a part of circumstances beyond anybody's choosing or control. Basically, that is what we do best. 
There is a quality of statesmanship that is a part of each and every one of us who serve here. It will be tested as reality sets in. Some highly important issues to us all will need to be laid aside for another day. Believe me, there will be another day. There will be another battleground. 
The decisions that are now before the Senate, should government be placed above all else in the average lives of all Americans? My answer is, hardly. I think it is during these times that we must reassess the role of the Federal Government and the role each of us must fill. Competition is keen among all who serve the American people at each level of government. Can we forget that we are not a true democracy and remember that we are a Republic? Each State of this great Union plays their important role in the day-to-day business of public service. 
The agenda for this week is appropriations, funding the important part of our Government, which could include national security, our relations with the world community, and the economic well-being of our citizens. In other words, ensuring each and every American is not denied the American dream. 
As we close the Senate and the 105th Congress, it may be asking something out of the ordinary, but it is not impossible that we lay aside the issues that cloud and delay and wait for another day. This Nation has survived for the past 200 years and will survive another 200 years. Yesterday, we heard announcements coming from both sides of the aisle and many other sources that the other side would risk shutting down the Government should we not fulfill the agenda of appropriations. 
If the Government is shut down because of a lack of funding, it will be the fault of the other person or party. That was the message this weekend and all day yesterday. 
It is time that we reassess what has happened to get us where we are. We have been using delaying tactics either to block or slow progress of the appropriations process--nothing but delaying tactics, pure and simple. Now that we are at this point, someone must be to blame. Do we blame somebody else, or do we blame ourselves? Is there a mindset that the responsibility or the lack of responsibility does not fall on each and every one of us, whether we serve in the legislative arm of this Government or the administrative arm? Are we really saying we don't have the courage to accept the responsibility and suffer the consequences of our own actions? How can we ask our younger Americans to develop a sense of responsibility if we do not do it? Are we a nation of laws or a nation of self-satisfaction and the impulses or emotions of the day? 
What we do here matters. It matters more than any one of us can imagine. Now is not the time for posturing. It is time to let the statesmanship that lives in each and every one of us come out and complete the Nation's business. I think the folks who sent us here will appreciate that, the Nation would be better off for it, and so will you as an individual. Then you will have earned and deserve the title of U.S. Senator, serving the people of the greatest nation ever established on this planet. 
Mr. President, that is just a reminder, as we move into the closing days, of some problems that we have to deal with before we all go home. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a great American patriot and fellow Montanan, Colonel Sam Roberts, U.S. Air Force, retired. 
Colonel Roberts is a true American hero, who exemplifies the meaning of duty, honor and country. Today, in my home state of Montana, Colonel Roberts will be honored at the University of Montana during an 80th anniversary ceremony for the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). 
Colonel Roberts received many honors during his career. These awards include the Bronze Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, two Air Medals and Commendation Awards from both the Army and the Air Force. In the 1960's, Colonel Roberts, who was assigned to the Strategic Air Command, briefed our Nation's leaders about the threats to our country and potential targets for the United States during the cold war. 
Sam Roberts was a great leader of those under his command. His motto: `Don't ask any of your men to do anything that you wouldn't do yourself or that you wouldn't show them how to do yourself,' is a cornerstone that we should look for in the future leaders of our military. 
I salute Colonel Sam Roberts, and his lovely wife, Kathleen, for the sacrifices they made during Sam's career and thank them for a job well done. I consider it an honor and privilege to call Sam and Kathleen Roberts my friends.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand here today to recognize the beginning of a new era for the Montana Army National Guard. Activation of the Montana Guard Cavalry Troop, also known as the Blackhorse unit, will commence on October 3, 1998. This will be an integrated cavalry troop that is part of a regiment whose distinguished history dates back to the turn of the century. 
The Blackhorse is currently one of only three armored cavalry regiments in the United States Army. The mission of this regiment is to train Army units for the next possible war and does so by challenging those units in real life scenarios to meet the test of active warfare. The Blackhorse unit is considered the most highly trained unit in the United States Army. The Montana Army National Guard is both honored and privileged to join the Blackhorse unit as an equal partner. 
The Montana Army National Guard must be prepared to meet the challenges of what the future may hold. Now affiliated with the Blackhorse unit, the men and the women of Montana who serve to protect our nation, will be ready.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Montana's newest and brightest stars. Summit Design and Manufacturing, a Montana-based company located in Helena, Montana, recently took a giant leap on the stepping stones of success. 
It is both an honor and a great pleasure to announce that Summit Design and Manufacturing was recently awarded the `Outstanding Team Player Award' by Lockheed Martin for work they have performed on the F-22 fighter aircraft. This award is given to only 5 Lockheed Martin suppliers selected from a pool of around 4,500 suppliers program wide. Even more impressive is that Summit's selection is the first time this type of supplier has received such an award. 
Since their start-up in June 1997, Summit has grown from four employees to 15 and now boasts deliveries for the F-22 program at approximately $2 million is sales for the past 12 months. In less than a year, this company has become one of Montana's technological advantages over the rest of the nation. 
Besides performing design and manufacturing work on the F-22 in Montana, other involvement with Lockheed Martin has included producing parts and tools for the X-33 Spacecraft, Joint Strike Fighter and the C-130J aircraft programs. 
I often say that folks in Montana are very special people and I commend Tom Hottman and Summit Design and Manufacturing for their perseverance and commitment in today's small business society.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about some good news for a change. I want to talk about the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1998 that Senator McCain is introducing, and I am cosponsoring. The purpose of this legislation is to link some of the amazing innovations in wireless technology to 9-1-1 and emergency response professionals. 
All kinds of technologies exist today that can greatly reduce response time to emergencies and help victims get the right kind of medical attention quickly. But right now these technologies are not connected in ways that we can use them for emergencies. That's why this effort to upgrade our 9-1-1 systems across the nation is to so important and necessary. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted studies showing that crash-to-care time for fatal accidents is about a half hour in urban areas. In rural areas, which covers most of my home state of Montana, that crash-to-care time almost doubles. On average, it takes just shy of an hour to get emergency attention to crash victims in rural areas. Almost half of the serious crash victims who do not receive care in that first hour die at the scene of the accident. That's a scary statistic. But it doesn't have to continue that way. 
Drew Dawson, who is the Director of the Montana Emergency Medical Services Bureau and president of the National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Directors, strongly supports this legislation. He tells me that the bill will help bring better wireless 9-1-1 coverage to Montana and will enhance our statewide Trauma Care System. Mr. Dawson believes this legislation will help him and his emergency folks do their job better, which means it will help them save more lives than they already do. 
Montana unfortunately has a high motor vehicle crash death rate. Part of this bill promotes research on something called Automatic Crash Notification technology or ACN as Mr. Dawson and the trauma and emergency professionals call it. ACN technology takes the sensors in cars, such as airbag sensors and speed sensors, and links them to a wireless phone and a location device. When an ACN-equipped car in a remote area of Montana crashes, the car automatically dials 9-1-1. Not only does the car dial 9-1-1 but it transmits data telling the emergency operator where exactly the crash victim is and the likelihood of the victim's injuries. This ACN system also opens up a voice channel enabling the emergency operator to speak to the crash victim. 
ACN technology comes into effect only seconds after the crash. It can be rigged so that the emergency operator gets the crash information as well as the nearest trauma center. ACN would eliminate many drawn out search and rescues that usually have to take place. 
In these crash situations, time is of the essence. The emergency medical professionals refer to the first hour after a crash as the `Golden Hour.' They say if they can get to victims in that first hour, then they have a good chance of limiting the severity of the injuries. Once the clock ticks over an hour, the chances of medical miracles lessen more and more. Reducing response time means the difference between life and death. 
I have to say a word about all of the good work that folks like Drew Dawson in Montana and other emergency professionals do all over the country. The United States has the most skilled and dedicated group of medical and emergency professionals in the world. We just need to give them better tools. There is technology out there that can help these professionals and that can help all of us citizens, if, God forbid, we ever find ourselves in an emergency situation needing this kind of help. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1998 will help all of us and will make our emergency services even better than they are today. 
Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will join me and help pass this important legislation.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to salute DOW Stereo/Video of San Diego, and its Director, Tom Campbell, for successfully introducing HDTV to the consuming public. As co-chair of the Internet Caucus I am particularly pleased with this accomplishment, given Mr. Campbell's hard work as a member of the Advisory Board to the Caucus. 
Following years of development, which has enjoyed substantial support from Congress, HDTV is now a reality. The technology for the first commercial units was largely developed by Panasonic/USA in the San Diego area. It once again proves what can happen when American ingenuity and talent are combined with commitment and perserverance.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, there are some of us who do not have the eloquent speech of those who have spoken on this issue, but I think that I have a pretty good advisor in this issue. 
I am wondering if I am listening to the same America in which I grew up. In rural America, life was simple but life was precious. We were fortunate enough in our family to have a couple of outstanding young folks blessed to our family, one of whom is now a medical doctor in family medicine. 
A couple of years ago when this issue came up, she was the first one to call me, she being a new graduate of the University of Washington at the Seattle medical school and now doing her residency in Tennessee. She is blessed with a deeply faithful heart and motivated to doing the good things for humanity, taking her oath that she took upon graduation from medical school very, very seriously. If you have not heard that oath, maybe one should read it one time and see what the medical doctors take upon themselves, those who really do dedicate themselves to humanity. She, plain and simply, told her father that there is no reason for this procedure at all, none.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is the eve of the second Senate vote to override the President's veto of the Partial Abortion Ban Act. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to listen to their consciences and vote to override the veto and enact the ban. 
Contray to the assertions of some, this bill is not about a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. It's not about Roe v. Wade. Regardless of one's views on abortion in general, the partial birth abortion procedures should be abhorrent in a civilized society. It is a gruesome procedure, performed late in the term, which most physicians believe is never medically necessary. Most Americans agree it should be banned. 
The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban has passed the Congress twice now with my support, first in 1996 and again last year. However, the President has twice vetoed this legislation against the will of the American people. I hope the Senate does the right thing by overriding the veto.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Karl Ohs, who will receive the Federal Bureau of Investigation's highest honor later this month for his part in ending the 1996 Freemen standoff in Montana. A quiet, unassuming rancher from Harrison, Montana, Karl has displayed uncommon courage and leadership not only during the Freemen incident, but throughout his life as a public servant and community leader. 
Born and raised in the farming town of Malta on Montana's Hi-Line, Karl was surrounded by agriculture from his birth. After graduating from Montana State University with a degree in agriculture, he began farming and ranching in Harrison. Karl quickly became an active member in the community, serving on the board of the local hospital and on the Harrison School Board. 
Karl's dedication to his community and agriculture led him to run for the Montana House of Representatives in 1994. After only one term, his peers selected Karl to serve as the majority whip for the 1997 legislative session. In this capacity, Karl led fights to cut administrative costs, increase investment in Montana for our long-term growth, and save the historical sites of Virginia City and Nevada City, which otherwise would have been lost, destroying important reminders of our great state's heritage. 
Unlike some of today's political leaders who preach virtues publicly while defying them privately, Karl has shown great courage and morality while not standing in front of a microphone or television camera. When Karl was approached by a friend to intervene in the Freemen standoff, he did so without a second thought. As a mediator during the standoff, Karl repeatedly put himself into dangerous situations because of his concern for human life, both of the Freemen and law enforcement officers. In the end, he was able to gain the trust of the Freemen and jumpstart negotiations that led to the end of the standoff. Without his invaluable service, a violent end to the situation would have been inevitable. 
In a nation that is suffering from a lack of moral leadership, I am happy to know that we have people like Karl taking an active role in their communities. Karl serves as an example for all of us. 
Again, Karl, congratulations on your award. We can all learn a lot from your model of courage and service, and I want you to know that you have my gratitude and that of the Nation.

Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from New Mexico. I will not be long, I say to my friend and neighbor from North Dakota. 
I want to put some things in perspective. Yes, the lands belong to the United States of America and are held in trust for the citizens of this country. But the citizens of this country and the taxpayers in this country do not participate in the expense of drilling the well. There is no argument on the eighth that is the royalty that goes to the surface owner. After all, the oil companies did buy the leases. They paid hard money for those leases. If there is a resource--in this case, oil--under the ground, they go and find it. 
That is not to say that every well they put in the ground is successful. We have more dry wells than we have wells producing. The American people did not make any investment in drilling that so-called dry hole, and they didn't even participate in footing the bill; the expense of putting the well down is a producer's. 
There is no argument with the eighth. I can simplify this very easily. `In kind' would be right. If you want to participate in the value added to compute your royalty, as the chairman of the Energy Committee said is being attempted by MMS, then MMS should participate in the transportation and the cost of the value added. That is only fair. 
Now, if that is not fair, then I suggest that the Interior Department go out to the well site, take their truck, and every eight buckets of oil that come out of the ground, they get the eighth one, put it in their truck, and do with it whatever they want to do with it--go on open markets, like the independents or even the big companies do. It doesn't make any difference. That is their eighth. They have been paid. The market goes up, the market goes down; the risk is the same for the surface owner as it is for the one who is bringing it up. That is very simple. No argument with the eighth. 
What we are saying is: Fair is fair. If you want to collect the royalty on the value-added product, then there has to be expense incurred by those who want to participate in that part of the process of getting oil to gasoline and the energy that we need in this country. 
Senator Domenici brought up the point a while ago that people are paying more for their bottled water in the grocery store than they are for their gasoline. There is another aspect of this--and I think Senator Dorgan from North Dakota will agree with this--in this economy today, nobody who produces a raw product is making any money. Our farmers understand that. I will give my old `F-U' line here, old farmers union line they call it: Go and price Wheaties at the grocery store at $3.75 a pound and the farmer can't even get $1.75 for a 60-pound bushel of wheat. 
Something is out of whack here. So we are not arguing about the eighth. We are arguing where do you take the eighth and what our investment or our part of the expense should be. You can't let everybody else pay all the expenses and you just participate in the harvest of those dollars. It is a very, very simple thing. There is nothing difficult about understanding that. But I think that is what we ought to do. Yes, we are worried about children in schools. I sure am. I am worrying about the children of those folks who work awfully hard in the oil patch to feed their families, participate in their communities, and take care of the obligations they have as citizens of the United States of America. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President. I am very pleased to bring before the Senate the military construction conference report for fiscal year 1999. 
This conference report was adopted by the House of Representatives by a vote of 417 to 1. It was sent to the Senate and now waits our final passage. 
We have worked hard with our House colleagues to bring the military construction conference to a successful conclusion. Both bodies took a different perspective on the allocation of military construction funding for the Department of Defense. In the final conference report, we met our goals of promoting quality of life initiatives and enhancing mission readiness. 
This bill has some points I want to highlight. It provides a total of $8.4 billion for military construction. Even though this is an increase of $665 million over the President's budget for fiscal year 1998, it is still a reduction of $759 million from what was appropriated last year--an overall reduction of 8.8 percent. 
Some 42 percent of the bill is allocated to 
family housing--a total of $3.5 billion. This includes new construction, improvements to existing units and funding for operation and maintenance of that housing. 
The base realignment and closure part of the bill account for 19 percent of our total funding--about $1.6 billion. This encompasses funding for environmental clean-up of the closing bases and construction of new BRAC-related facilities. 
I continue to be concerned about the growing costs of environmental clean-up at our BRAC installations. These costs frequently continue long after we have closed these bases. 
We strongly protected quality of life initiatives. We provided $716 million for barracks, $34 million for child development centers and $184 million for hospital and medical facilities. 
We provided a total of $480 million for the Guard and Reserve components. Overall, this represents an increase of $300 million from the President's budget request. Many of those projects will enhance the readiness and mission capabilities of our Reserve and Guard forces, vital to our national defense. 
I thank my ranking member, Senator Murray, for her assistance and support throughout this process. She and her staff were extremely cooperative. 
I commend this product to the Senate and recommend that it be signed by the President without delay. 
It is nice to see everybody back from vacation and the August break. I think most of us had time to travel around our States and talk with our folks at home and to bring back maybe some new ideas. I remind this body that for the first time in the history of this country, better than 50 percent of our military forces are found in our National Guard and our Reserves. If we continue to trend that way, then the infrastructure that it will take for those folks to be properly trained--and let's face it, those who serve in the Guard and the Reserves are as dedicated men and women to the national security of this country as anybody else, but they will need the infrastructure in which to operate. 
This administration did not really fully fund our infrastructure for our Guard and our Reserves, but this Congress did. I congratulate this Congress for doing so, because it becomes more and more important every day that these dedicated Americans who wish to serve their country as citizens, soldiers, airmen, marines, and sailors have the infrastructure in which to keep them trained and to keep their dedication and their morale as high as we can possibly make it. 
I heartily recommend this conference report.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to strengthen America's tourism and travel related industry--the Value In Supporting International Tourism Act of 1998 (Visit USA Act). This legislation is a follow-on to the National Tourism Act, Public Law 104-288, enacted two years ago. 
In the National Tourism Act, Congress created the U.S. National Tourism Organization (USNTO) in order to re-establish the United States as the premiere destination for tourists throughout the world. While international travel and tourism remains the United States largest service export, its third largest industry, and a major producer of jobs and tax revenue for federal, state and local governments, our share of the international tourism market is threatened unless action is taken now. 
Public Law 104-288 authorized a public-private partnership, including a broad cross-section of the U.S. travel and tourism industry, charged with working with government to (1) promote and increase the U.S. share of the international tourism market, (2) develop and implement a national travel and tourism strategy, (3) advise the President and Congress on how to implement this strategy and on other critical matters affecting the travel and tourism industry, (4) conduct travel and tourism market research, and (5) promote the interests of the U.S. travel and tourism industry at international trade shows. The USNTO was authorized to conduct activities necessary to advance these national interests. 
The USNTO was also charged with developing a long-term financing plan for the organization. On January 14, 1998, the Board of the USNTO fulfilled its statutory mandate by submitting a report to Congress outlining, among other things, a long-term marketing plan to promote the United States as the premiere international travel destination. The Board is firmly committed to work with Congress to secure appropriate funding for an international marketing effort. 
Private sector and state support for the promotion of the United States as an international tourist destination exceeds $1 billion annually. This support, together with the commitment of the USNTO Board of Directors to use only non-governmental sources of funding for all USNTO general and administrative costs, provides a substantial commitment from the `private' side of the partnership and a foundation for a successful public-private partnership. 
The Visit USA Act establishes an international visitor assistance task force. This interagency body will support the creation of a toll-free telephone line to assist foreign tourists visiting the United States. It will also work to improve signage at airports and other key travel facilities, and facilitate distribution of multilingual travel and tourism materials. Each of these activities is intended to be conducted at minimal or zero cost to the federal government. 
This legislation also requires the Secretary of Commerce to report to Congress on how federal lands are used and on how they may have influenced the tourism market, on any changes in the international tourist commerce, on the impact tourism has on the U.S. economy, and on our balance of trade. 
The facts concerning the increasingly competitive international tourism justify this legislative approach. While competition for the international tourism dollar has become one among national governments, the U.S. government is the only major industrialized nation that does not promote its tourism market abroad. Other governments spend millions on tourism marketing. In 1995, for example, Australia spent $88 million, the UK and Spain each spent $79 million, and France spent $73 million to promote tourism. 
Tourism is a significant element of the U.S. economy. The industry that depends on spending by foreign tourists is diverse, and includes restaurants, hotels, travel agencies, shops, tour bus services, rental car agencies, theaters, airlines, and theme parks. In particular, small businesses depend on revenues from international tourism. 
I encourage all Senators to join in supporting this important effort to strengthen our tourism-related economy. The dividends to be realized as a result of this modest investment will benefit every state and every congressional district.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I 
introduce a companion bill to one recently introduced in the House by Congressman Rick Hill, of Montana. This is a bill that will authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to convey certain properties around Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana to leaseholders. This bill has the support of a number of organizations, groups and communities in the area of Canyon Ferry and in Montana in general. 
The purpose of my bill today, is to get the ball rolling on this legislation. I am aware that currently there is legislation in the Environment and Public Works Committee of a similar nature. But it appears stalled, and does not address the concerns of a number of the groups and communities in the area around Canyon Ferry. The bills basically address the conveyance of this land in the same way, but it is the disposal of the funds received that changes these two bills. So I come here today to propose this legislation to accelerate the process and get Congress involved and moving on this very issue. 
I have made a pledge to the people in this area of Montana that I will do all I can to assist them in getting something done on this bill this session before we leave for the year. These people have attempted to work with the Bureau of Reclamation to clear up a number of issues which have come up over the past five or more years. The result of their work has been continued stalling by the Bureau of Reclamation in working with the citizens. As a result then we have been forced to work on legislation that will remove the stumbling blocks and rectify and clarify the situation. 
Senator Baucus, Congressman Hill and I have worked for the past year developing legislation to address the concerns of these people. We have come ninety percent of the way and now it is necessary for us to move that extra ten percent and get something done to the benefit of the general public and the citizens of Montana. 
Canyon Ferry is a man-made reservoir on the Missouri River in Central Montana right outside of our capital Helena. It is a wonderful area for outdoor recreation and draws people from all over the state and in many cases all across the nation. There are a number of people who have built cabin sites on the lake both for the purpose of weekend living but also there are a number of year around residences. 
This legislation will work to continue to provide opportunities for all people to enjoy the splendor of Canyon Ferry. In addition there will be ample opportunity for the surrounding communities to develop new ways for the public to enjoy the lake and the various recreational facilities around the lake. The citizens of Montana expect and deserve an opportunity to enjoy this wonderful area. The funds derived from the conveyance of these properties will allow for the continued construction of facilities that will allow more Montanans a chance to enjoy Canyon Ferry. 
I give my pledge to the people of Montana that I will continue to work this issue with the members of the Montana delegation, Senator Baucus and Congressman Hill to clear this bill and get something done. I know the majority of people in the area want to see something done, and this is the vehicle to do that. I look forward to working with the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to get this done and out as soon as possible.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Lott, Craig, Grassley, Hagel, Roberts, Sessions, Shelby, and Thomas to introduce the Family Investment and Rural Savings Tax (FIRST) Act of 1998. 
Mr. President, today's family farms are in jeopardy. This bill will help all Americans as well as our nation's farming families. 
The bill consists of two titles--the first will reduce the top individual capital gains tax rate from 20% to 15% and reduces the capital gains tax rate for individuals with lower incomes from 10% to 7.5%. 
Title two of the bill consists of two separate measures which work hand in hand: First, the bill will allow farmers to open their own tax deferred savings accounts. These accounts would provide farmers and ranchers an opportunity to set aside income in high-income years and withdraw the money in low-income years. The money is taxed only when it is withdrawn and can be deferred for up to five years. 
In 1995, 2.2 million taxpayers, qualified as farmers under IRS definitions, would have been eligible to use these accounts. Only 725,000 of those filed a net income while 1.5 million filed a net loss. 
Now that could mean one of two things: (1) fewer and fewer farmers are able to stay in the black or; (2) more and more farmers are going out of business. We cannot continue to treat our farmers and ranchers as second class citizens in our tax code. 
The second part of this title contains language that I introduced earlier this year. This language would allow farmers to use average their income over three years and make that tool permanent in the tax code. This bill will give American farmers a fair tool to offset the unpredictable nature of their business. 
The question is who will benefit most from income averaging and farm savings accounts. This is the best part--this legislation will allow farmers to delay payment of their taxes by reducing their overall income and spreading it out over a number of years. 
However, based on the tax rate schedule, this bill would favor farmers in the lower tax bracket. If a farmer could use these tools to reduce their tax burden from one year to the next, it is very conceivable that taxpayer would pay only 15% on his income compared to 28%. That is a significant savings. 
This bill leaves the business decisions in the hands of farmers, not the government. Farmers can decide whether to defer income and when to withdraw funds to supplement operations. 
Farmers and ranchers labor seven days a week, from dawn until dusk, to provide our nation with the world's best produce, dairy products and meats. Farming is a difficult business requiring calloused hands and rarely a profitable financial reward. This profession is not getting any easier. Today, we are seeing more and more of our family farms swallowed up by the corporate farms. 
Farming has always been a family affair. Rural communities rely on the family farm for their own economic sustenance. Although family farms are traditionally passed on from father to son--it is becoming more and more difficult as the economics of farming are becoming more and more complicated. Further tightening of the belt on these folks can only mean the eventual loss of the family farm. 
Montana's farmers take pride in their harvests. You could call 
 today's farmer the ultimate environmentalist. They know how to take care of the land and ensure that future harvests will be plentiful. As land managers, farmers understand the importance of proper land stewardship. 
Those colleagues of mine who grew up on a farm or ranch would certainly understand the frustration of this business. Farmers and ranchers don't receive an annual salary. They cannot rely on income that may not be there at the end of the year and they certainly cannot count on a monthly paycheck. This is a crucial time for family farms and tax relief can mean the difference between keeping the family farm for future generations or losing it. 
With the recent passage of the Farm Bill, farmers are more than ever impacted by market forces and in the farming business, those market forces can be very unpredictable. 
Market forces in farming are very unique--drought, flooding, infestation and disease all play a vital role in a farmer's bottom line. And it's not often when the elements of mother nature allow for a profitable harvest. 
At best, most farmers are lucky to break even more than two years in a row. One year may be a windfall, while the next may mean bankruptcy. Farmers and ranchers are forced to make large capital investments in machinery, livestock and improvements to their properties. 
Agricultural markets are rarely predictable. Farmers, more than any other sector of our economy are likely to experience substantial fluctuations in income. 
We also need to address the issue of the estate tax. This is a death blow to a family farm that has been passed down through the generations. A family farm in Montana is not really referred to as an estate. We call it home, we call it work, and we call it our lives, but we don't call it an estate. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill and urge you also to support future bills such as estate tax relief legislation to encourage America's farming family of a safe and secure future.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `International Satellite Communications Reform Act of 1998,' a bill to update our nation's policies regarding the provision of international satellite services. 
During the final days of the First Session of the 105th Congress, I announced that I would engage in an effort to eliminate outdated regulations and foster competition in the global satellite market. Since that time, I have met with industry representatives and officials from the Administration, and my office has conducted a series of open briefings intended to fully educate Members and their staff on the competing interests and opposing views surrounding this complicated debate. The `International Satellite Communications Reform Act of 1998' represents the culmination of a great deal of hard work, and I would like to thank the Members and staff, industry representatives, and Administration officials who worked with me to develop a consensus bill for their efforts. It is my intention to hold a hearing on this legislation when the Senate returns in early September. 
Currently, the satellite policies of the United States are based upon the Communications Satellite Act of 1962, a bill drafted in the midst of the Cold War, when the United States was engaged in the `Space Race' with the Soviet Union. At that time, America wanted to demonstrate to the rest of the world its commitment to the peaceful uses of outer space and to bring the benefits of space technology to all the people of the world. 
In that effort, we have succeeded magnificently. The 1962 Act led to the formation of Comsat Corporation, and then later of INTELSAT, which today provides global connectivity from the United States to virtually every point on the globe. The 1962 Act has paid the United States enormous dividends, to the point where the policy framework established by Congress in 1962 has been eclipsed by the success of these ventures, and by the development of healthy marketplace competition. 
The `International Satellite Communications Reform Act of 1998' is designed to establish a new policy framework for international satellite communications for the 21st Century. It is designed to build on the success of the 1962 Act in a manner that preserves the benefits of that Act, while unleashing the power of private enterprise to provide new and innovative services to the people of the world. 
The `International Satellite Communications Reform Act of 1998' will help to bring about the privatization of INTELSAT and Inmarsat, so that market forces may shape the services and prices available to American consumers. This bill is also designed to open foreign markets to competition--but to do so in a way that does not harm consumers nor reduce the number of competitors in the marketplace. It requires that all satellite service providers be subject to the same regulatory requirements while preserving lifeline services to those countries that do not generate enough revenues to entice the entrepreneurs to offer service. This will ensure that universal service and global connectivity will always be available to U.S. consumers. 
Achieving the goal of drafting a thoughtful, balanced bill was not easy. I have worked with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee to draft a bill that is fair in its approach, consistent with our international obligations, and which maintains universal service. At the same time the bill relies upon free enterprise, market forces, and competition. 
In my view, the `International Satellite Communications Reform Act of 1998' builds upon the successes of the 1962 Act, while recognizing that satellite technology has been successfully commercialized and that the old policy framework is no longer appropriate. 
I hope that my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this legislation, in which I have tried to balance competing policy objectives. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to enact this legislation, and update our international satellite policy for the 21st Century.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the Committee's intent on a couple of different issues in the Transportation Appropriations bill. Under the Federal Lands Highway Program account, two separate highway issues are addressed. I would like to ensure the Secretary is aware of the importance of both of these highway issues. 
The first, is in Northeastern Montana. Highway 93 is the primary route from Interstate 90 to the Flathead Valley and Glacier National Park. This area is growing in recreational popularity. This beautiful valley is home to Flathead Lake. Located between Kalispell and Polson, this is the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi. 
Glacier National Park receives numerous visitors by air and train. But the most popular means to reach the park is by Highway 93. 
Big Mountain recreational ski area is located to the north of the Valley. This resort area is a year-round attraction for outdoor enthusaiasts--many of whom drive to the area by way of Highway 93. 
I often travel this highway to visit my constituents on the Salish and Kootenai Indian reservation as well as my constituents in Kalispell, and Northwest Montana. Recently on this highway, I noticed I was literally traveling in bumper to bumper traffic. This is not a common phenomenon in Montana but the increased summer traffic in this area has many of the local users concerned about their safety and the safety of their passengers. 
For nearly thirty years, Montana's American Legion has taken on the responsibility to remind drivers of the dangers of highway travel by placing a white cross along the roadside. The roadside along Highway 93 is littered with these white crosses. 
As a result of the public outcry to help reduce the number of accidents on this highway, I, on behalf of the Montana Department of Transportation, would like to ask the Committee to direct the Secretary to authorize and release all funds designated for the four-lane expansion of Highway 93. I would also like to ask the Committee to direct the Secretary to withdraw the Federal Highway Administration's record of decision requiring resolution at the State, local and tribal levels.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to put more equality into the Medicare payment system for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). The Skilled Nursing Facility Payment Fairness Act of 1998 will allow certain SNFs--those which will suffer a real cut in Medicare payments--to use a more equitable payment formula that more closely reflects their actual costs. 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required HCFA to develop a prospective payment system (PPS) for Medicare-covered services provided by skilled nursing facilities. Under the PPS, SNFs will be paid a single federal per diem rate for all routine, ancillary, and capital-related Part A costs. For SNFs that participated in Medicare before October 1, 1995, there is a three-year transition period to the PPS. During this transition period, facilities will be paid a blended rate based on a facility-specific rate and a federal rate. In the first year of the transition, the blended rate will be 75% of the facility-specific rate and 25% of the federal rate; in the second year the split will be 50%-50%; and in the third year 25%-75%. 
For facilities that have had a substantial change in the level of services they provide since 1995, the transitional blended payment rate will have a severe impact. And of those facilities adversely affected, a significant number are low-utilization SNFs is rural areas. For example, facilities in Montana provide fewer services as measured by Medicare patient days than the national average. They are hit in two ways: first, their utilization levels (length of stay, level of acuity), though still low, are higher today than they were in 1995, so the facility-specific rate which is based on 1995 cost reports does not reflect today's costs; second, the low-utilization facilities are less able to absorb Medicare payment reductions and are more likely to drop out of Medicare altogether. As a result, rural communities with few providers may have no post-hospital services. Patients will then have to leave their communities to seek services elsewhere or go without these services. 
The bill I'm introducing today will allow facilities to skip the transition period and go directly to the more equitable federal rate if (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that the facility's level of services has changed substantially since 1995, or (2) the facility had fewer than 1500 Medicare patient days in its last cost reporting period. By receiving payments based on the federal rate, which is adjusted for case-mix, geographic variations in wages, and inflation, facilities will be compensated in an amount closer to their actual costs. On the other hand, the facility-specific portion of the current blended rate bases costs in part on 1995 expenses, which does not reflect current costs. 
Rural areas will suffer under the current prospective payment system. In Montana alone, cuts in Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities are estimated at $5.6 million in the first year of the prospective payment system, which began on July 1, 1998. It will result in decreased access to care for Medicare patients as fewer services are offered and fewer facilities participate in Medicare. This bill provides a straightforward, workable solution and is supported by the Montana Health Care Association and the American Health Care Association. It will correct the unintended negative consequences of the transition to a prospective payment system and restore fairness to the process.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am concerned that the Feingold amendment is an inappropriate attempt to continue excessive government regulation of the cable industry. I believe that additional reports on the industry by the Federal Communications Commission would be an unnecessary waster of taxpayer money. Furthermore, any efforts to deal with cable rates should be dealt with in the upcoming hearing we have scheduled before the Commerce Committee this Tuesday. 
The Cable Bureau is largely a product of the 1992 Cable Act. I opposed that Act because I believed it was overly regulatory and heavy handed. I believe that my concerns were proven to be correct. However, in 1996, Congress responded to some of the excesses of the 1992 Act and to the growing competitiveness of the marketplace by adopting several Cable Act reform provisions as part of the Telecommunications Act. 
The aim of the Telecommunications Act as it related to cable services was to provide increased choices at lower cost by opening up historically monopolistic, regulated markets to new entrants. In return, cable operators would be allowed to enter new communications markets such as telephone and information services. As we move beyond traditional models of monopolies and excessive regulation to a climate of open competition, exciting new educational and commercial opportunities are beginning to appear. 
I am also very concerned about the recent spate of increases in cable rates. However, the answer to increasing rates is not found in ever-increasing government regulation but in providing for increased consumer choice. Rather than engaging in micromanaging the rate-structure of the cable systems, government should create a level playing field where new entrants can compete effectively with incumbent providers. 
It was for this reason that I must oppose further misguided efforts to engage the government in regulating cable rates. 
Mr. President, this issue has been studied to death. When this Congress decided to deregulate the cable industry, it was to expand services and enhance services of the cable industry. That has happened. If you look at the services and the expanded television coverage that we have now on cable as compared to as near as 5 years ago, you would see a big difference in the services that you receive today. 
There is a hearing on next Tuesday. We invite the Senator from Wisconsin to testify. This is no place to deal with this situation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to state for the record that I continue to have serious reservations about the federal government mandating the use of specific technologies to solve the problem of schoolchildren's access to inappropriate material on the Internet. I believe that school boards are much more effective in making decisions about appropriate policy or technology when dealing with Internet access for students than Washington. Advances in technology have brought wonderful opportunities, but we must not rely on technology to deal with complex public policy questions. Congress sets a dangerous precedent by stamping its `seal of approval' on software that may be obsolete next year or even next week. 
I initially expressed my reservations about a bill which would require mandated filtering systems, S. 1619, during the Commerce Committee markup that was held this past March. I considered offering an amendment during the markup that would have required schools and libraries to certify that they had appropriate Internet Acceptable Use Policies in place in order to receive universal service funding. The Chairman of the Commerce Committee assured me that if I were to pull my amendment he would be open to working with me to reach a compromise on the issue. Upon receiving this assurance, I withdrew my amendment. 
Over the last several months, I have held numerous meetings among all of the parties involved in the markup in an effort to reach consensus. My office has had an open door policy and had significantly altered the original language to expand its scope to reflect the concerns of my colleagues. The draft compromise amendment I was prepared to offer required that schools have Internet use policies in place that address not only access to the World Wide Web, but also the security of schoolchildren when using E-mail and chat rooms. These policies would have to be public, widely distributed and effective. Furthermore, the compromise amendment would significantly expand criminal penalties on `cyberstalkers'--criminals who use computers to exploit or abuse children. 
The compromise amendment has achieved significant support because of its inclusion of these vital matters and its reliance on local communities rather than federal mandates. 
I am deeply disappointed that the Chairman of the Commerce Committee chose not to compromise on this very important issue. I had anticipated that this issue would be dealt with in its own right and that we would have several hours of debate to deal with S. 1619 and the amendment I had planned to offer along with several of my colleagues. Instead, it was attached to the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill today. I did not express my opposition to the inclusion of S. 1619 because I did not want to hold up the passage of crucial Commerce-State-Justice appropriations. However, I want to make it very clear that I remain steadfastly opposed to big government mandates on the filtering issue and I will work closely with my colleagues as S. 2260 heads to conference to perfect the bill to reflect these concerns. 
I continue to believe that local communities acting through their school and library boards, rather than software programs that are at best questionable or the federal government, are in the best position to make decisions on this critical issue.

Mr. BURNS. That's absolutely correct. As you know, Wildlife Services provides a broad range of services across the country and the aerial operations program is a key component of these services. In fact, distribution of rabies vaccine baits by Wildlife Services occurred earlier this year in Texas, Ohio, New Hampshire and other states. These activities help protect pets, children and others from the spread of rabies.

Mr. BURNS. That's right. The aerial program helps researchers track radio-collared wolves so we learn about wolf movements, habitat needs and feeding patterns. Without the aerial program it would be much more difficult to tranquilize and relocate wolves preying on domestic livestock. And, in the event of a wolf persists on killing livestock, it enables the program to efficiently remove the specific problem animal.

Mr. BURNS. The review found that not enough resources are being devoted to maintaining the safety of the program. Because of increasing demand for their aerial services, the program directs most of their resources into program delivery. This, coupled with ongoing budget constraints have limited the ability of the program to keep pace with developing technology and training in aircraft operations. 
It is my understanding that the House has provided funds to address this situation. I hope the Senate conferees on this bill will review the findings of this study in the conference to assess whether additional funding is justified.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I just want to make one point. You have three packers that are handling 85 percent of the national cattle that are killed today. And they don't want to report the prices so that the people who produce calves and replacement cattle and feed cattle in the feed lots, the individual producers, or a small packer, can compete with them. It doesn't make sense. We have always reported those prices. And now, with a lot of packer-owned cattle moving in there, we get no information at all. 
Let's look at this pilot program. Let's work with the postmarketing surveillance. We can come up with some way to report these prices so that we know what these cattle are worth all the way back to the ranch. 
I urge the adoption of the amendment. 
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mr. BURNS. Industry's plan to allow law enforcement access to the plaintext of some encrypted communications demonstrates that market solutions can truly address many areas of law enforcement's concerns with encryption. At the same time, we should not forget that there is a continuing need for legislative privacy protections governing how and when law enforcement should have access to encrypted data.

Mr. BURNS. Yes, these recent developments continue to highlight the desperate need for a change in U.S. encryption policy. Last week the Administration announced it would make exceptions in encryption export policy allowing banks and certain financial institutions to export strong encryption, without vulnerable key recovery systems, to their subsidiaries in a select group of 40 countries. This is a welcome development for those companies that will qualify for this narrow exception but it does not provide the same protection of online privacy for everyday Americans.

Mr. BURNS. Encryption is also an essential part of new `digital signature' techniques used to identify parties and authenticate transactions online. These techniques are widely viewed as an essential feature of electronic commerce. The use of digital signatures raises complex business and privacy issues, but these issues are completely separate from the questions raised by encryption used for confidentiality. There is a great deal of ongoing activity in the private sector and at the state level attempting to sort out these complex issues of business use and consumer protection. Federal digital signature legislation is clearly needed, but should be dealt with separately from encryption reform legislation.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of discussion here today about agriculture and the fix that it finds itself in, most of it caused by forces not under the control of the folks who live on our farms and ranches in this country, and in particular about our good friends who live in North Dakota along the northern high plains that stretch across the northern reaches of Minnesota, from Grand Forks to Williston, and yes, even over into my home State of Montana. I went through the 1980s as an auctioneer. I sold out some awfully good friends in that era. And, there again, that was caused by forces that were not under the control of those who make a living from our farms and ranches across this country. 
You know, we, some of us, might take this lightly. But we are talking about something that involves every American. Every American has a stake in this, because the second thing you do every day after you get up is eat. I don't know what the first thing is because we have a lot of choices, I guess, but the second thing is that we eat. 
We understand the pain on the northern high plains because I have experienced the same kind of situations and been around agriculture a long time, in the business of ag business and, yes, on the land, too. We understand that. We cannot write anything into legislation in the way of farm policy of a one-size-fits-all. Each State is different. Each county is different. Each region of this country is different, producing different crops under different circumstances, under different growing seasons, different soils, and that makes it a real challenge to try to develop any kind of farm policy as far as this Government is concerned from this place here in Washington, which I refer to every now and again as 17 square miles of logic-free environment. 
What we did in the FAIR Act was to try to put agriculture into a position where farmers can enjoy as much versatility and flexibility in their cropping and making their decisions on how to market as each individual producer or operator could have. Risk management--that was part of it, part of it, making decisions on what to grow and when to grow it, how to market it, and, yes, even having some say in transportation. 
We have heard a lot of people say this act is still a work in progress, that there were some things that we should really do that would facilitate the final policy of the FAIR: Farm savings accounts. Do something about estate taxes. We don't need estate taxes. Something has to be inherently wrong when you have to sell the farm to save the farm. Capital gains--a reduction in capital gains has already proven that, yes, it is an economic enhancer. We got income averaging for 3 years; now we need to put it in permanent law. And, yes, the sanctions reform, of which we have heard a lot in the past week and during this week --do that reform. And also reg reform. 
Now, reg reform doesn't sound very big, but just this morning, in the full Committee on Appropriations, there was a memorandum of the Department of Transportation to deal with hazardous material with regard to agriculture, the hauling of hazardous materials from the city to the farm and from farm to farm with limited space and no reason that this Federal Government should preempt State regulations on handling those materials. Agriculture had enjoyed an exemption, when it comes to production agriculture, in providing the services that are needed on the farm and getting the crop back to the farm. Yet this Department of Transportation wants to change all of that. 
They want to preempt the States on how they handle hazardous material. It is just a little thing, the requirement of a CDL, just to do farm work--commercial driver's license, just to do farm work, not only putting the crop in but getting it out and getting it where it can be transported to the markets. 
That is reg reform--the ability to use some pesticides and herbicides on growing new crops that have been introduced into the northern high plains, where we have competition from our friends in Canada where they have 15 to 20 different kinds of herbicides and pesticides to grow 1 crop while we are limited to 5 and cannot get FDA approval to go on and take care of the crop the way it has to be done. 
One could also look at the situation, the terrible situation in North Dakota, where they have the disease scab. There is regulation on plant growth health. 
We could also put together that same package of trade, trade, and trade. We know the effect of the financial crisis in the Pacific rim. Last January, we visited Australia. In talking to the Australians, they didn't think it would affect their GDP at all. When I walked out of that meeting in Canberra, Australia, I knew that these folks had really misread the crisis in the Pacific rim. They had underestimated exactly what was going to happen, when you have four major economies absolutely go in the tank, and then the economy that was to ride in and help them out can't do anything about it--and that is Japan. Those forces are completely out of the control of the American farmer and the American rancher. 
So, fast track, normal trade relations to move our product into those markets and have a shot at that market. Right now, with sanctions, we are getting no shot at all. That is not right, and it is not fair. 
I would probably say that sanctions have very little effect, if any at all, on any kind of product. What happens when you put sanctions on anything is, they will find the foodstuffs; they will find the grain. They might pay a little more for it, a couple of pennies a bushel more, and then we have to compete against the lower end of that market? That is not fair either. So, sanctions very seldom work. 
There is also another end of this that I haven't heard anybody talk about in this country, and I do not know how to deal with this problem, but I know there is a problem. The percentage of the consumer dollar going back to the farm is the smallest it has been in the history of agriculture. 
What do I mean by that? If some of you go to the grocery store and do your shopping, go down the cereal line and see what Wheaties are worth per pound. I think you will find they are around $3.75 a pound. Cereal is not cheap--$3.75 a pound. I want America to know--do you realize that we cannot even get $2.50 for a bushel of wheat that weighs 60 pounds? There is more money in the box than there is in the wheat that is the basis of the product. Something is a little out of whack. Yet, we have some of our great agricultural processors and purveyors and buyers calling themselves a supermarket to the world. 
What we are saying though is: If you are such a good supermarket, then give us more of the consumer dollar. You have an obligation, like anybody else, to make sure the producer gets at least his cost of production. That would help them stay in business, but it also helps the processor to stay in business. 
I noticed, there was a little letter that came this way from one of the great processors in this country wanting to go back to the old way of doing business. It makes sense to me. If I am out here buying corn and soybeans and wheat, I can buy it very cheaply, yet the taxpayer pays the profitable margin in this country to the farmer. 
That is not right either. That should be paid at the marketplace, and a percentage of that should go to production agriculture. 
We are still a work in progress, and, yes, we have a situation on the northern high plains with which we are going to have to deal and for which we have an obligation to deal. 
NAFTA, has it been good? Maybe for all America, but it sure hasn't worked for us on the northern high plains. When you have 300 loads of cattle a day coming across the wheat grass in northern Montana, and yet we have a cattle market and you have $60 steers--I have a good friend who lives over in Miles City, MT. Of course, he has a great sense of humor, and it is a great thing. You have to have a good sense of humor when you farm a ranch. He said $60 fat cattle, $40 hogs, and $2.50 wheat, and $9 oil. Remember, oil only costs about $9 a barrel at the wellhead. That would tell me anybody who is in the business of producing a raw product is not getting paid very much for their product, but the price hasn't been reflected at the pump or at the grocery store. If they go down for the consumer, I guess all of us can live pretty good. But I said, `Well, that doesn't sound too good.' He said, `Yeah, but there's a silver lining--we've got a lot of it.' And that is the kind of attitude you have to carry into this business. 
How do we deal with the northern high plains, victims of flood and drought and those farm families that really just eke it out every year? They are land rich, but they are cash poor. That has been the story of agriculture for a long, long time. I am afraid that story is not going to end with any action taken in the Congress. 
Do we want the Government back in the grain business? Do we want those huge stocks that cost the taxpayer a lot of money in storage? Do we want those stocks to overshadow the market? This man who wrote this letter saying we should go back to the old way of doing business thinks it is all right, because he is going to get his supply from stocks that didn't cost very much money. Yet, his end product is not going to go down a great amount. In fact, it won't go down at all. They will always say `inflation.' The percentage of the consumer dollar we don't have any control over either. 
Just remember that little illustration that there is more money in the box that contains the Wheaties than there is in the wheat that is the base ingredient of that great food, a percentage of the consumer dollar. Going back to the old way will not cure the ills of what is happening in the northern high plains. 
I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and those of us who have been meeting every day to open up markets and to deal with sanctions, because it is trade, trade, trade. Just like in the business of the real estate, when you buy, there are three main things: Location, location, location. 
We must continue to do that. This administration must use every tool they have to open those markets and to move the product, whether it be through Public Law 480, through EEP, or export credits. We must get in the world market, and we must compete and move the products. 
I thank the chairman, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that would eliminate the outdated broadcast ownership restrictions in place at the Federal Communications Commission. I am pleased to note that I am introducing this legislation with the co-sponsorship of the Chairman of the Commerce Committee. I welcome Senator McCain's support on this issue and look forward to working with him to make sure that these impractical restrictions are eliminated. 
Currently, the FCC disallows ownership of stations in separate markets if the broadcast signals overlap. For example, a broadcaster may not now own a station in each of the Washington, DC, and Baltimore markets. I believe that ownership of stations with overlapping signals should be allowed if the stations are licensed to communities in different markets. Practical ownership policies will encourage the construction of new television stations and broadcast networks that will promote increased consumer choice. 
In the Senate Communications Subcommittee, I have recently held numerous FCC oversight hearings on how best to create a regulatory framework for the age of competition. I believe this bill will help to move in the direction of deregulation and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its passage.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the important issue of private property rights and to support the Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998, S. 2271. 
Private property rights have been the cornerstone of our free society. The fifth amendment of our Constitution states, `private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.' Currently, too many Americans are being denied fair access to Federal courts in order to uphold their fifth amendment constitutional rights.

Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Kentucky. I also want to thank the Senator in a couple of other areas, because responding to what we have in the Northwest is, in my regard, an emergency. 
Let's back up a little bit and talk about what has happened to farm export, and especially to the Northwest. Last January, we sat down with officials, including the Prime Minister of Australia, and talked about what has been commonly referred to as the Asian flu, 
the financial crisis in the Pacific rim--the complete, or almost complete collapse of financial conditions in four countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea. And then we talked a little bit about the financial situation that Japan finds herself in, not being able to ride to the rescue of her neighbors in the rim. At that time, there was a consensus that maybe those countries that found themselves in financial difficulty would not impact the GDP of Australia, and little was regarded here in this country. I thought at the time that you cannot let the economies in four major importing countries of agricultural products cave in and it not affect this country. Sadly, I was correct. 
So our exports to that part of the world have gone to zero. Now we come along with sanctions. Let me tell you a little bit about sanctions. I have never been convinced that sanctions on food really work. I will tell you in an instant that if we unilaterally sanction a country on American agricultural exports, here is what happens: That country is still capable of buying a supply from somebody else in the world. But the market knows of these sanctions; therefore, the rest of the world maybe puts 1 or 2 cents a bushel on wheat. Now, 1 or 2 cents doesn't sound like a lot for a bushel of wheat that weighs 60 pounds. That is in a short ton anyway. But when you are buying 300,000 metric tons, it is a lot of money. Even to a farmer, it is the difference between making the land payment this year and not making the land payment--that 2 cents a bushel. 
Once that sale is made to the country that we have had sanctions on, then the country that did the selling pours the rest of their crop on the world market. So what do we do and what do our farmers do? They compete at a lower level. That is not right. It hasn't worked, as far as denying the country that had the sanctions on it. It didn't deny them of food supply for the people who live there. But it has denied our farmers entry into the marketplace, a place to compete. 
To give you an idea, in the last 4 years the United States has imposed 61 unilateral economic sanctions on 35 countries containing 40 percent of the world's population. Now, what does that country do when that sanction is placed? It retaliates: I am not going to buy American products at any price. I am not going to do that. 
So, in essence, we have denied our grain producers access to that market to even be considered to compete. I realize that we are talking about food here. I realize that to some folks that is not very important--until it comes suppertime. But to a farmer who only gets one or two paychecks a year, that is how he makes his payment on his operation, his fertilizer, his machinery, his land payment. It contributes to his schools, his community, his church. But under the conditions right now, they cannot do this. 
So I ask my colleagues to strongly support this amendment. Yes, I know there are far-reaching implications of sanctions and, yes, there are folks who really understand that maybe national security may be at stake.

Mr. BURNS. Thank you. Mr. President, you tell me where they have worked when it comes to the supply of food. That is the very basic of all of our necessities every day. The Senator from Idaho is exactly right. We have developed export markets by using two methods--it is quality, it is quantity, and it is reliability. We are a reliable customer, and to deny our producers--and you can go all over the world. Our producers compete on an individual basis. We don't pool our wheat like Canada. We don't sell wheat on the international market by a decision made by Government. We do it by individual producers who want to sell their crop at a given time. Given the proper tools of risk management, they could take advantage of the international market. 
I urge support of this amendment. I thank my friend from Kentucky for championing it.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today and introduce legislation which will amend the boundaries of the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site in the State of Montana. 
Congress authorized the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site on August 25, 1972 to preserve the Grant-Kohrs Ranch that operated from 1860-1972. Preserving the ranch also preserved a historic reminder of our Nation's frontier cattle era. The ranch's intact 120-year archive, 26,000 artifacts, and 88 historic structures capture the heritage of the American cowboy and cattlemen. 
Today the area is the hub of a thriving tourism industry and also provides unique educational opportunities. Tourists are constantly in search of a feel for the true American West. The Grant-Kohrs Ranch offers a vivid recollection of life on the frontier while providing a great experience for visitors and jobs for local residents. The ranch has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is a true asset to Montana. 
The legislation that I am proposing will incorporate an additional 120 acres of land into the authorized boundary of the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site. The 120 acres that will be included in the new boundary of the ranch are already owned by the National Park Service and their inclusion in the ranch's boundary is recommended as a means of conserving the property of the original ranch from future development.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the military construction appropriation bill and report for fiscal year 1999. 
This bill reflects the bipartisan approach that the ranking Member, Senator Murray of Washington, and I have tried to maintain regarding military construction and this subcommittee. It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Murray, her staff and the members of the subcommittee throughout this process. I very much appreciate all of their support. 
Mr. President, this bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee on June 11, by a unanimous vote of 27 to 0. The bill recommended by the full Committee on Appropriations is for $8,480,574,000. This is $696.5 million over the budget request. 
However, this bill provides $702 million less than what was appropriated last year--a reduction of 8.2 percent overall spending authority for the committee from the amount appropriated in fiscal year 1998. 
Further, more importantly, the bill reflects a reduction of 23 percent since fiscal year 1997--almost $2 billion less from just two years ago. 
We have sought to recommend a balanced bill to the Senate, and we believe it addresses key, military construction requirements for readiness, family housing, barracks, quality of life and the Guard & Reserve components. 
This bill honors the commitment we have to our Armed Forces. It helps ensure that the housing and infrastructure needs of the military are given proper recognition. 
Also, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the bill is within the committee's 302(b) budget allocation for both budget authority and outlays. 
Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to mention. We added $98 million above the budget request to provide better and more modern family housing for our service personnel and their families. 
On another quality of life measure, we have added substantially to the budget request for medical and hospital facilities. We have provided $708 million for some 46 barracks construction projects to provide single service members a more favorable living environment. 
The committee also fully funds the budget request of $97 million for funding 15 class I violation environmental projects. 
We also addressed the shortfalls that continue to plague our Reserve components. The Department continues to walk away from the total force concept. Recognizing this, we have again lent support by adding $267 million to the Guard and Reserve accounts. In each case, the funds will help satisfy essential mission, quality of life or readiness requirements. 
22 percent of the bill, or $1.731 billion, is for downsizing defense infrastructure, or better known as the Base Closure and Realignment Program. This includes funding for the last two rounds of BRAC. 
Almost a quarter of all military construction dollars goes toward the base closure and realignment process. 
All of the projects that we have recommended are included in the Senate-passed version of the defense authorization bill. We will work very closely with the Armed Services Committee, as we put together a conference package for military construction. 
We have tried to accommodate the sizeable administration request for overseas projects in such places as Korea, Germany and the Middle East. 18 percent of the administration's budget request for military construction projects is for overseas areas. We have funded only the essential of those projects. 
There are many other issues that I could speak about at this time. I urge the Members of the Senate to support this bill and move it forward expeditiously. 
I would like to yield to my ranking member, Senator Murray.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this calls for an additional 27 quality-of-life military construction projects throughout the Department of Defense. These projects are located in 22 States, and some overseas. And it is focused entirely on quality of life. 
If we have learned anything from our visitations to military installations, it is that we have not focused on such as health care centers, child care centers, recreation, and also housing for our enlisted, and barracks for our enlisted. It encompasses projects such as child care, dining facilities, modernization, replacement of barracks, and family housing. 
We did not focus on any particular State, geographic region or committee membership, but rather we tried to find worthy and meritorious projects that the services wanted and requested but we could not afford in the near term. The majority of these projects were not asked for by Members of the Senate. Rather, they are projects requested by the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps. Every single one of these projects is contained in the Department of Defense Future Year Defense Plan or FYDP. Further, over half are in the early years of that plan. 
Mr. President, we offer this amendment, and I yield the floor to my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray. 
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

Mr. BURNS. We have to understand that in this fiscal year we are about $700 million under what we allocated and appropriated for military construction a year ago. Compared to 2 years ago, this expenditure is down $2 billion. And I think this committee has done a good job in trying to seek out those projects that are necessary. We have done it, and we have cut some of the fat out of this appropriations and put the money where we really think it is needed and did it in a way that stays within our budget and our allocation. 
So we are $2 billion less in expenditures than we were 2 years ago. So I think this committee has done a commendable job. 
I yield the floor.

We could not have done that. 
So, there are a lot of people to thank for developing those criteria, for working with us, and for having the discipline to stay within those criteria, whenever we recommend these projects. So I thank my good friend from Michigan.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we offered this amendment earlier in the evening, and we gave our points as to why this addition of 22 new projects is being put on the defense authorization. 
These are quality-of-life projects. All of them stood the criteria of being added and requested by the Defense Department, and so we added them, because if there is one thing that we are noticing as we visit our bases around this country and around the world, it is a deteriorating quality of life and also the retention--keeping some of our most skilled military people in place. 
So in this bill, all these projects have passed the criteria. They are for child care centers and health care centers, living quarters, and dining facilities and recreation facilities that have been requested by our military. 
I thank the managers for accepting this, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Don Peoples, Sr. of Butte, Montana for being recognized as the 1998 recipient of the Distinguished Leadership Award by the Montana Tech Foundation. 
I have known Don for many years and his commitment to the city of Butte is certainly a reflection of his love for the All-America City! While serving as Butte's Chief Executive, Don lead a team of dedicated folks that revived Butte's economy after the loss of a major mining company in 1982. 
After serving ten years in that role, Don left local government to become a leading voice for the private sector. Today, he is President and Chief Executive Officer of MSE, Inc. MSE is now one of Butte's top employers. 
His company is currently working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on a variety of projects that will help launch the next generation space shuttle and other research projects. The United States Defense Department is also working with MSE to develop technologies for use in pollution control and cleanup. The company is also researching new methods for heavy metal and mine waste remediation projects. 
I believe that because of Don's tenacity, this kind of cutting edge technology is being tested in Butte, Montana. 
I also applaud Don's commitment to many other organizations and committees in the mining city. He continues to make a difference through his affiliations with the United Way, Carroll College, St. James Community Hospital, Butte Central Schools, and so many other worthwhile causes. 
I must also acknowledge Don's wife Cathy and their four grown children--Don, Jr., Tracey, Doug, and Kevin--as they celebrate this honor. I am convinced that their love and support have helped Don achieve so many goals throughout the years. 
I always say Montanans have very special qualities. Mr. Don Peoples, Sr. is truly a special Montanan and for that I congratulate him.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, to introduce the Water Conservation and Quality Incentives Act, a bill to revise the state revolving fund in the Clean Water Act. This is language that Senator Wyden and I have collaborated on to bring some sense of additional conservation of water resources to the many irrigation districts in the nation. 
In the west, irrigators are by far the largest water users. These are folks who need the water because of the various crops that they have on the ground in the states out west. Unfortunately a large portion of the water that is used in irrigation is by nature displaced due to seepage within the canals and ditches in which the water flows. Although the water is not lost, since it seeps into the soil and assists in the overall soil moisture, it is not immediately available to the irrigator. However, it is water which could be more effectively used to provide additional water to the producer. 
In most irrigation districts, irrigators pay for water that is released to them, and any displacement of this water does not help that producer on the bottom line. At a time when prices are low and markets are questionable, it is important that we give tools to the producer to make sure that they have every opportunity to stay in business. 
A key underlying feature of the legislation, is that the water saved under the proposal in this bill will not only assist the producer in water and cost savings, but also will assist the future of water in the many rivers and streams in the west. At a time when the federal government seems to be taking steps to reduce state involvement in water rights this is extremely important. 
The proposal put forth in this bill, will authorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to provide loans to irrigation districts to construct pipelines and develop additional conservation measures. The states would have an option in this measure, they would not have to involve their funds in this matter, but would allow them to do so if they so elected. In addition, those districts who did so elect to involve themselves would be able to add to their supply of water the difference between what they were using prior to the plan and what they were able to save. 
This bill creates a win/win situation both for water users and for the multiple users of water in our states, particularly Oregon and Montana. We have an opportunity here to do something useful and worthwhile for the irrigators and the fishing, boating and those who use instream water. I would like to thank Senator Wyden for his work on this measure and I am pleased to work with him today on this issue of great importance.

Mr. BURNS. I would like to point out that the government's plan for encryption--whether they call it `key escrow' or `key recovery' or `plaintext access'--simply won't work. Eleven of the world's most prominent computer security experts have told us government mandated key recovery won't work because it won't be secure, as explained in a study published this week by the Center for Democracy and Technology. Key escrow also won't work because it will cost billions, as revealed in a recent study published by the Business Software Alliance. We have also been told that the kind of system the Administration wants is not technically feasible. Additionally, constitutional scholars testified that government mandated key escrow, third party recovery probably violates the Bill of Rights.

All that is needed is a little common sense to understand that no one will buy systems with backdoor access. Criminals will not escrow their keys and terrorists will find keyless systems from America's foreign competitors. There is nothing we can do to stop undesirables from using strong, unescrowed encryption.

Mr. BURNS. We can readily see that the current U.S. policy on encryption jeopardizes the privacy of individuals, the security of the Internet, and the competitiveness of U.S. industry. We have been debating this issue since the Administration's introduction of the ill-fated Clipper chip proposal over five years ago. Yet no substantial change in Administration policy has taken place. It is time for us to take action. 
I first introduced comprehensive encryption reform legislation in the form of the Pro-CODE bill over two years ago, then reintroduced it in this Congress with the cosponsorship of the Majority Leader, Senators Ashcroft, Leahy, Wyden, and others. Along with Senators Ashcroft, Leahy, and others, I am also an original cosponsor of the E-PRIVACY bill, which would foster the use of strong encryption and global competitiveness. We have held numerous hearings on the issue. Yet despite the increasingly desperate drumbeat of criticism from industry, individuals, and privacy groups, from across the political spectrum, the Administration's policy has remained fundamentally unchanged.

Mr. BURNS. The basic facts remain the same. People need strong, unescrowed encryption to protect themselves online in the information age. Law enforcement has legitimate concerns about the spread of this technology, and we must work to provide them the tools and expertise they need to keep up with advances in encryption technology. We cannot stop time, however. The genie is out of the bottle. As Bill Gates, the CEO of Microsoft, recently said, `Encryption technology is widely available outside the United States and inside the United States, and that's just a fact of life.'

I commend the Majority Leader, Senators Ashcroft, Leahy, Craig, Wyden, and Murray for their vision and bipartisan leadership on this issue. I hope that Congress will be able to move forward with real encryption reform legislation that protects the privacy and security of Americans in the Information Age, before it is too late.

She has the wonderful distinction of being the oldest state employee for my home state of Montana. I join Grace's family, friends, and co-workers in thanking her for a job well done! 
Grace was born on July 29, 1910 in Deer Lodge, Montana. She was one of nine children. Early on, here family moved to the Canton Valley outside of Townsend, Montana. She married Carter Babcock in 1930. They became the proud parents of two girls, Marilyn and Joyce. In 1941, the family moved to Helena. Although Carter died in 1970, Grace kept the family going. She now dots on her seven grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. 
Grace worked for the accounting firm of Galusha, Higgins, & Galusha until her retirement in 1976. Then, in 1980, it was the beginning of here career with the State of Montana. Grace is certainly a role model not only for active seniors but also for so many young people across our state. She has been blessed with good health and uses her talents to help others. 
On behalf of all Montanans, I would like to congratulate you, Grace, for your help in making our state truly the `last best place!' Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am proud to announce that Semitool, Inc., of Kalispell, Montana, has been awarded the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 1998 Entrepreneurial Success Award. 
The state of Montana has rapidly entered the high-tech field in recent years, and Semitool illustrates the best of what can be done in our state. I nominated Semitool, which designs and manufactures equipment used in the production of semiconductors and other electronic devices, for the award last December because of their great success in the high-tech industry. 
As you may know, Mr. President, the SBA grants the Entrepreneurial Success Award to companies launched as `small" businesses that received SBA assistance and have since grown. The criteria include growth in the number of employees, increase in sales, comparisons between current and past financial reports, innovativeness of product or service offered, and evidence of contributions to the local community. 
With good ideas, hard work, and an initial boost by the SBA, Semitool has become a major source for employment in Kalispell, employing roughly 1,100 people. It's this kind of entrepreneurial spirit that will keep Montana, and our nation, strong. 
Again, I congratulate Semitool on their success, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. On August 8, 1997, Ms. Linda G. Sundro, Inspector General for the National Science Foundation (NSF) recommended that NSF reduce their SBIR set-aside by approximately $2.5 million by excluding certain education and training costs, as well as program support overhead costs from their total extramural R&D budget. Although funded by the Congress as part of their overall R&D budget, the Inspector General concluded that these costs could be excluded because they do not fit the statutory definition of R&D as set forth in the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992, (Public Law No. 102.564, 15 U.S.C. Part 638(e)(5)). 
The Inspector General's recommendation does not take into consideration the guidance provided by the Congress in determining the calculation. The legislation requires each agency `which has an extramural budget for research or research and development' (15 U.S.C. Part 638(f)(1)) to set-aside a percentage for the SBIR program. The legislation clearly defines extramural budget as `the sum of the total obligations minus amounts obligated for such activities by employees of the agency in or through Government-owned, Government-operated facilities * * *' (15 U.S.C. Part 638 (e)(1)). Under existing law, the only exclusion from the calculation is for funds dedicated to intramural R&D efforts. 
In its April 17, 1998 report on the SBIR program, the General Accounting Office identified the calculation of the extramural budget as an issue for the SBIR program. Their analysis found that each participating agency was utilizing different methodologies in the calculation. The GAO recommended that the SBA issue guidance to the participating agencies to ensure consistency across the program. The SBA agreed with this recommendation. 
Accordingly, I believe the NSF Inspector General's recommendation is inconsistent with the current law and would ask that the Director of the National Science Foundation hold the recommendation in abeyance until such time as the SBA issues guidance to the participating SBIR agencies.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the National Science Foundation (NSF) authorization bill, which is before us today. Prior to this Congress, when I became chairman of the Communications Subcommittee, I served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space, which has jurisdiction over the authorizations for the NSF. I conducted several hearings on NSF during that time. I am also a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD Independent Agencies, which funds the NSF. As a result, I have had the opportunity to get to know this agency and its program as well. 
I will have to tell you that when I came to the U.S. Senate, I did not expect to become a champion for the National Science Foundation and for scientific research, education and technology. But, I quickly became a strong supporter. 
I have seen what this agency can do, and its importance to the people in our states. NSF is about seeking new scientific knowledge and using that knowledge. It is about helping the researchers and teachers in our colleges and universities and helping them to make certain that their students receive a good education, with scientific, mathematical, engineering and technological opportunities. It is about offering better training and materials for our K-12 teachers. And, it is about developing infrastructure, such as advanced telecommunication and computing opportunities. Such infrastructure is particularly important for rural states, such as Montana. 
NSF has funded research which led to Montana State University's Jack Horner's now famous work on dinosaurs. It has helped us start new program in computational biology. It has funded an Engineering Research Center, which has undertaken cutting edge research in networking connection and supported other networking and telecommunications programs. There is interest in new research opportunities on life in extreme environments, which could include the Yellowstone area, and in the plant genome initiative. 
I also want to say a few words about a program that is of particular importance to my state--the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). EPSCoR was created to assist states such as Montana become more competitive in the federal R&D arena. Unfortunately, federal R&D funds are highly concentrated in a few universities in a few states. That is not justifiable. Today's global economy requires that all parts of our nation share in scientific and technology development if we are to keep our entire nation and its industries and workforce competitive. Today, we know that scientific and technological problems and issues in one area of the country are likely to affect people in other areas. And, we know that we cannot have a healthy national science and technology system unless there is widespread support throughout our country for it. 
The EPSCoR program is the base for much of our rural states' scientific and technological activities. It helps Montana and 17 other states develop infrastructure. It helps us develop new programs and take advantage of special opportunities. It has recently been assisting our states on participating more fully in other NSF programs. And, it was instrumental in ensuring that the EPSCoR states participate in the vBNS connections program and the Next Generation Internet initiative. I believe in the EPSCoR program, and would like to see the program expanded in terms of financial assistance, especially when NSF funding overall is increasing and also since the co-founding, which is scheduled to increase in this budget year, should be matched by a similar increase in the base EPSCoR program. 
I know that the report prepared last fall by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee endorsed by EPSCoR program, and we on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee are equally supportive.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to support the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act, as it addresses a severe problem that has arisen as an unintended consequence of additional competition in the telecommunications marketplace: the unauthorized switching of customers' telephone service providers. I also understand that the managers' amendment of the bill includes language that addresses another serious, unintended problem posed by the growth of information technology: the explosion of junk e-mail, or `spamming.' 
I congratulate Senators Murkowski and Torricelli for their hard work on dealing with the issue of spamming. S. 1618 as amended includes language that would require commercial e-mailers to identify themselves. This language is simply a `Truth in Advertising Amendment.' As any of us who use e-mail are finding out, millions of junk e-mails are sent out with fake e-mail addresses which prevent citizens from requesting that they not be sent any further clutter from the same sources. The amendment also requires that a junk e-mailer must honor requests from individuals to be deleted from mailing lists. 
I should add that the problem of junk e-mail is particularly important to customers in rural areas such as Montana. Often, rural residents must pay long distance charges to receive these unwanted solicitations, many of which contain fraudulent messages. `Spamming' is truly the bane of the information age. This problem has become so pervasive that entire new networks have had to be constructed to deal with it, when resources would be far better spent on educational or commercial needs. I welcome the inclusion of this language as a much-needed step forward in dealing with this increasingly serious problem. 
I would now like to speak on an issue involving more traditional communications, that of slamming. I have held two field hearings in the Communications Subcommittee on this important topic, one in Billings last August and one in Denver last October. 
During the field hearing in Billings, I heard from consumers, industry representatives and regulators on a variety of slamming issues. I learned in Billings that slamming is not confined to big cities. It is reaching every part of our country. Consumers are falling prey every day to companies that intentionally mislead and deceive. Today, I look forward to building on the record we started in Montana. 
I should also recognize that Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell has shown real leadership on this issue through his introduction of an anti-slamming bill, particularly at the field hearing in Denver, which he attended. The bill before the Chamber today, S. 1618, incorporates language from S. 1051, Senator Campbell's slamming bill. The amendment including Senator Campbell's language was passed unanimously out of the Commerce Committee on March 12 of this year. 
This language requires that the FCC will annually report to Congress the `Top Ten' slammers for that year, as well as carriers assessed fines or penalties during the same period. The `Top Ten' list would identify those carriers subject to the highest number of subscriber slamming complaints compared to the total number of subscribers they serve. This ratio approach ensures that large companies are not automatically singled out by virtue of having a large customer base. The focus is on those companies with the highest percentage of slamming complaints relative to their total customer base. 
This `Top Ten' list represents the core of Senator Campbell's anti-slamming bill. Having held two field hearings in the Communications Subcommittee on this important topic, I am convinced that Senator Campbell's approach will prove very valuable in deterring carriers from engaging in illegal tactics. 
As competition develops in new communications markets, we could see slamming migrate to new areas and become an even bigger problem. Clearly, something must be done soon to protect consumers and to protect good, clean competition. 
I am confident that the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act as amended will accomplish this goal and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand before the chamber today in support of the e-Privacy Act because the very future of electronic commerce on the Internet is being held hostage to cold-war era export controls. These outdated regulations tie the hands of the U.S. high technology industry and pose a threat to privacy and security of all Americans who use the Internet. Despite some small concessions by the Administration, the competitive advantage of the U.S. high technology industries and the privacy and security of our citizens remain trapped by the Clinton Administration's outdated policy. 
The e-Privacy Act will relax current export controls on encryption technologies so that U.S. companies can effectively compete in the global marketplace. The bill will also prevent the government from mandating risky and expensive `key-recovery' or `key-escrow' encryption systems domestically. It's a good bill, it has broad support from the computer and communications industry, Internet users, and privacy advocates from both the left and right of the political spectrum. 
The Clinton Administration has expressed concerns about the impact the e-Privacy Act would have on the legitimate needs of law enforcement and national security. My colleagues and I do not take their concerns lightly. Several provisions in the e-Privacy Act address the Administration's valid concerns while at the same time freeing U.S. companies to effectively compete in the global marketplace, and ensuring that the American people can trust the Internet as a secure means of commerce, education, and free expression of ideas. 
The e-Privacy Act would create a National Electronic Technology Center (`NET Center') to serve as a central point for information and assistance to federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities to address the technical difficulties of obtaining electronic information because of encryption. National security and law enforcement would be given seats at the table in making these determinations. Once again, I am very sensitive to the legitimate needs of national security and law enforcement, and I think the provisions made in the e-Privacy Act address them. 
The e-Privacy Act also extends to citizens that same privacy rights that they have in their homes to their digital property in cyberspace. The bill would require a court order or subpoena to obtain either the plaintext or decryption key from their parties. I believe that this is the correct approach. 
Citizens are also specifically given the right to use whatever kind of encryption software at whatever strength they choose. The bill recognizes the folly of requiring the government to create procedures to license `key certificate authorities' and `key-recovery agents,' as well as require the development of a massive and complicated infrastructure to ensure that the government could recover the right key out of the hundreds of millions of keys in real time. 
On many occasions, the world's leading cryptographers concluded that building such a key recovery infrastructure would be prohibitively expensive and would create a less secure network. The bill recognizes that mandatory key escrow will never work, no one will use it and certainly no criminals or other bad actors will use a system that is immediately accessible by the government. 
I urge my colleagues to support the e-Privacy Act, which I feel is the true compromise package. We all have the same goals in mind--allowing for the continued growth of high tech industries while not harming national security. If we move forward with the compromise bill being offered today, I am confident we can do both.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to withdraw an amendment that I had on this bill, but I want to make a short statement. Although this amendment will be ruled as not relevant to this piece of legislation, it is very relevant to the field of agriculture. 
I have submitted S. 1879, which would make income averaging for farmers permanent in the Tax Code. 
Last year, I offered an amendment to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997 which extended to farmers the ability to average their income over a 3-year period. That amendment was included and made part of the U.S. Tax Code, but only after further negotiations will we have to extend it beyond 2001 because it sunsets in the year 2001. 
I don't think many of my colleagues really understand what is going on in agriculture today. There are a few. If there is one way we can affect change regarding farm income, it would be through how we treat it regarding taxes. We will consider the agriculture research, and we will consider crop insurance later on this month. It is really in the best interest of this Government to pass that piece of legislation so that it is enforced with this year's crop. It won't be long until we are coming into harvest time. 
This business of farming and ranching is difficult at best; we know that. There are no monthly checks. There is not much reward in the financial field for those who participate in it. And it is not getting any easier. Today we are seeing more and more family farms fade from the landscape of middle-income America, where this country has been. Corporate farms become more and more of a factor every day. Those of us who grew up in the farming communities understand the frustrations of the business. Of course, we are trying to do something right now at a time when just about all parts of agriculture, if you are in the business of producing a raw product, are in trouble. We cannot make it selling our farm commodities below what they were selling for in 1948 and still expect to provide the abundance of food that we provide for this country. 
I will make one point. It is hard for me to understand, and it is hard for our farmers to understand why if you go into a grocery store and you look down and find out you are paying $2.75 for a pound of Wheaties, and we can't get $2.75 for a 60-pound bushel of wheat. America must understand that. And if this is allowed to happen, there will be no wheat, because it will just be beyond the cost of production to produce it. 
Market forces are funny. Right now, we have a situation in the Pacific rim where you have four, maybe five economies that are in desperate trouble and could not buy even if they wanted to. When you live in a State where the biggest share of your production goes to the Pacific rim, that means we are in big trouble. 
Last fall, we had the fiasco in the rail business in Houston. A lot of grain didn't get moved, or they took advantage of a higher market that cost us a lot of money--out of the control of the farmers. Yet, they are the ones that pay the costs. 
So we are going to consider this. And I hope that this will be made part of the permanent law of the Tax Code. I would like to get some kind of commitment from this committee and the Finance Committee that it will be considered because it is very, very important. We had income averaging at one time, and we lost it in 1986. 
The bill, last year, received overwhelming support in the U.S. Senate, and I understand that it will be ruled irrelevant now by the Parliamentarian, so I plan to withdraw the amendment. Before I do, I want to emphasize to this body that we have a situation not only in the grain industry, but the livestock industry, and it is in areas where the producer has little or no control. They are at the end of the line. They sell wholesale, 
they buy retail, they pay the transportation and the taxes both ways. We have to do something in the middle to at least give them some relief. 
This bill has very little impact on our Federal budget. The American people would look at this as an insurance policy. We must pay to insure our cars or our lives. How much would you pay to ensure that the grocery store is full every time you go there? There are a lot of us that know about the front end of the grocery store; very few of us know anything about the back end. So I think America has a stake in this--all the citizens that live in this country. 
I will agree to withdraw the amendment, but I want to reaffirm my commitment to the American farmer that this Congress will act, and this will become a permanent part of the Tax Code before we end the 105th Congress. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be withdrawn from consideration. I thank the managers of the bill and yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I congratulate my colleagues, Senator Ashcroft and Senator Leahy. Senator Leahy and I have been on many issues with regard to the Internet. I think Senator Leahy, whenever we talk about this issue, what we want to do with it, also understands another issue called encryption and how important security is. We have been around to see this thing grow and blossom. They go hand in hand, basically, as we use this technology more. 
My friend from Missouri being very interested in this, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications, we will continue to work on these kind of issues. This should be an easy amendment for this body to support--in fact, for this Congress to support. If you want to continue to use the same burdensome and bureaucratic methods that we have used in the past, then don't support this amendment. Don't support this amendment if you like the status quo. If we, as a voice of our constituents, are truly interested in IRS reform for taxpayers, then we need to support it. More and more Americans are becoming Internet savvy, and the day is not far off when most of the business and personal transactions will take place on the Internet. We are already banking; we are handling financial transactions on the Internet. So why should this not be one that we can use, at least once a year? 
The Internet is just not for surfing anymore. If you want to surf, I guess you can go to California. But in Montana and rural areas, our connection to these kinds of services is going to come through that medium. 
We need electronic commerce. It is going to be the future of the new way, and we have to accept that and learn to use it. 
Adopting this amendment will encourage the American taxpayer that we are interested in reforming the way the IRS does business. There is no reason to treat electronic tax filers any different than taxpayers using the traditional filing methods. 
The deployment of electronic commerce will ultimately save American taxpayers not only time, but it will save them money. Such discriminating treatment makes no sense and has a far-reaching negative impact in delaying the benefits to both the U.S. Government and citizens in conducting business electronically. 
The amendment at issue is a perfect example of that. What possible justification is there in placing the presumption upon the taxpayer improving a case simply because he chose to file his tax return electronically instead of putting it in an envelope? It is just unproductive. 
If we are not supposed to look to the future, then what are we supposed to be doing around here? Are we not supposed to make our Federal Government friendlier and more accessible to the taxpayer? I would say yes, we are. Are we not supposed to have a visionary agenda regarding the IRS? I say we should. 
We in Congress should strive for a consistent treatment for functionally equivalent transactions, and I believe this will be one of our most significant challenges as we move into the next century. 
More and more businesses, and communications generally, will be transacted over the Internet. That is why I am a cosponsor of this amendment. It will level the playing field for all taxpayers, regardless of the method they choose in filing their taxes. 
The Internet offers unlimited opportunity to both business and personal transactions. We need to foster those opportunities. We need to make it easier for taxpayers to file their taxes. 
Our antiquated understanding of how transactions have to be treated historically is not the way we can do things in the future. This is why I am an advocate of a variety of different measures that would foster and encourage commerce and communication over the Internet, including the Internet Tax Freedom Act. And the use of encryption comes into this also, because the technology itself will never bloom until we can have some confidence in the security of the information that we send over the Internet. We have to work on that just as much. The continuing buildout of broadband infrastructure is very important. We will continue to develop that to make sure that it is accessible to every American and not just a chosen few, regardless of geographic location. 
Madam President, I ask support of this amendment because I think it is very important if we are really serious about changing the way the IRS does business. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand today to recognize a very special Montanan. Penny Abegglen has received the Secretary's Award for Excellence in Nursing from the Department of Veterans Affairs. I am very proud that Penny's hard work and dedication to veterans is being recognized with this award. 
The Secretary's Award for Excellence in Nursing is one of the highest honors for nursing, and Penny competed with 172 nurses from around the country for this award. Her work in opening a sleep lab at Fort Harrison, Montana, demonstrates initiative above and beyond the call of duty. It has saved Montana's veterans with sleep disorders from making long trips out-of-state to receive treatment. 
Penny has worked hard to provide better care to patients and to make herself a better nurse. She should be very proud of her accomplishments and of their well-deserved recognition by the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is a pleasure to let my colleagues and the American people know of the fine service Penny Abegglen has provided to Montana's veterans.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Baucus and 48 other of our fellow colleagues, to a resolution to designate April 30 as `National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day.' As you know, we introduced a similar resolution last year, which the Senate passed through unanimous consent. In order to continue eliminating racism and hate crimes, we must again recognize April 30 as a day to stop racism and hate crime. Through recognition of such a day, we as citizens can stand together in order to prevent future crimes from occurring. 
According to the United States Department of Justice, there were over 8,000 racially and biased crimes committed last year. Because of this high number, my colleagues and I have stood up to recognize, for a second year, the importance of preventing such crimes from continuing. We must work together, as adults and children, to bring our Nation back to its origin, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of press and freedom of thought. 
We as an elected body must promote this recognition by passing this resolution again this year. We must remember that diversity has been a cornerstone of our Nation's heritage and should continue to be. An understanding of individual differences promotes unity throughout our communities and States. We must take it upon ourselves to promote these diversities and pass this Senate resolution. 
I would like to thank the YWCA and many organizations throughout the United States for their assistance in supporting diversity throughout this year and every year. I would also like to thank all of my colleagues that have joined and will join us in recognizing a way to eradicate the forces that divide our country.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act. Joining me as co-sponsors of this legislation are Senators Dorgan, Chafee, Leahy, Kerrey, D'Amato, Murkowski, Roberts, and Helms. 
Complying with complex and overlapping federal regulations is time-consuming and costly for any business, but small businesses bear a disproportionate burden. Given their limited resources, small businesses need all the help they can get when it comes to complying with environmental, tax, and workplace safety regulations. Yet small businesses rarely turn to the regulatory agencies for assistance, either out of fear of punishment or because help isn't available. 
This legislation would use the existing network of Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs)--over 950 nationwide and serving 600,000 businesses annually--to provide small businesses with non-punitive, confidential regulatory information and assistance. The SBDC network currently offers business expertise to growing firms, yet information and assistance needed to comply with EPA, OSHA, and IRS rules is often unavailable to these small firms. 
The legislation authorizes SBDCs to develop compliance guidelines in conjunction with these federal agencies and then use that information to educate small businesses on regulatory compliance. With this information, businesses will be able to follow important environmental, safety, and tax laws, and the government will spend fewer resources on costly enforcement measures. 
This bill is pro-small business and pro-compliance. It will help small firms develop practical business solutions to regulatory compliance problems.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand today to recognize one of Montana's next generation jewels--Positive Systems in Whitefish, Montana. As a result of the dedication and commitment to their industry, Positive Systems has been recognized by the 1998 Governor's Excellence in Exporting Award Certificate of Appreciation. 
Incorporated in 1991, Positive Systems provides a technical service in a rather unique and young industry. Dale Johnson, Cody Benkelman and Ron Behrendt designed a digital aerial photography service that will benefit many sectors of our economy. Positive Systems is the only business using such methods in the rapidly growing aerial mapping industry. These three men from different backgrounds combined their skills to launch this new enterprise. 
Positive Systems has mapped landscapes throughout the world working for everyone from farmers to NASA. The four cameras mounted in a small aircraft take pictures in the visible spectrum as well as in the near infrared. Although the human eye is capable of sensing just a portion of the entire light spectrum, the cameras can see much more. The camera lenses pick up the nearest infrared which has several remarkable attributes including the fact that it interacts with chlorophyll, reflecting very well off of healthy plants. 
By designating a color to the near infrared the cameras can detect the amount of light bouncing off of a given plant--the more reflective the plant, the healthier it is. In an age of high-tech, precision agriculture, every advantage helps. An acre of farmland, for instance, can support upward of 11,000 heads of lettuce; so to lose even a few acres on a corporate farm can mean a huge financial impact. 
Understanding the whole system is a primary focus at NASA, where the Earth sciences program is providing government funds for private sector research into global change over time. In addition, Positive System teams with NASA for standard education and land use projects. They have recently been awarded a contract with NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center to map 1,000 square miles of Mississippi's coastal region. 
The system engineered by the Whitefish company, in fact, is so far out on the cutting edge that Positive Systems has had to wait for the rest of the world to catch up. 
I would like to congratulate Positive Systems on the Certificate of Appreciation. This kind of growth and opportunity for a small Montana business is impressive. As a member of the U.S. Senate Small Business Committee, it is becoming increasingly clear that business owners can effectively reach a global market regardless of where they live. Positive Systems has demonstrated they can compete and succeed. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, during the final days of the first session of the 105th Congress, I announced that I would engage in an effort to eliminate outdated regulations and foster competition in the global satellite market. Since that time, I have held several meetings with representatives from the industry. In addition, my staff has conducted a series of open briefings with the various parties currently competing in the market, as well as representatives from the White House, the State Department and the International Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission. These meetings have recently concluded, and I now plan to move forward legislatively on this critical issue. 
The international satellite market is poised for phenomenal growth as it looks to the 21st century. A mere 10 years ago there was only one service in place: Intelsat. Today a breathtaking array of services are either already in existence or planned to be launched in the near future. With this rapid transformation, it becomes clear that one day people everywhere from Bozeman, Montana, to Beijing, China, will send and receive telephone, video and data transmissions via satellite. The future of satellite communications is a future where opportunities are no longer limited by geography. 
Unfortunately, while the industry hopes to reach a new orbit, U.S. policy in this area is still being left on the launching pad. Not since Ronald Reagan deregulated the satellite market in 1984 have we taken steps to bring our policy more in line with the competitive pressures of today. As a result, many consumers both here and abroad have not been able to benefit from the increase in services or the lowering of prices that have resulted from President Reagan's vision. 
This is why I am going to use the upcoming recess to begin putting together a bill that will move U.S. satellite policy from the Stone Age to the Space Age. I intend to incorporate the views of all interested parties and I urge my colleagues to come to me with their ideas. I expect to have a bill completed and ready for introduction when we return later this month. I will hold a hearing in the Communications Subcommittee on the bill shortly after the Senate returns from the Easter recess. While I had originally planned to hold the hearing on April 22, I am moving the hearing date to April 29 to ensure that members have adequate time to give their insights and suggestions on this most important issue. 
As I indicated when I first took on this issue, there will be several principles that will help guide me along the way. Competition, deregulation, privatization and competitive neutrality are all principles that have helped drive past industries toward success. While the global satellite industry is somewhat different because we are dealing with sovereign nations around the world, there is no reason that the United States cannot take a strong position and lead by example. It was our leadership under the 1962 Satellite Act that gave this industry its beginning and it can be our leadership today that brings the industry firmly into the 21st century. In fact, Mr. President, we recently witnessed such U.S. leadership. Last week, the Intelsat assembly of parties approved the creation of a spinoff company. This effort was achieved through the hard work of the U.S. delegation and the 141 member nations of Intelsat. I believe this is a positive first step on the path to bringing boundless opportunities to folks all over the globe. 
I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in crafting legislation with the ultimate goal of encouraging competition in this industry. The rapid changes in technology and consumer behavior dictate that we act expeditiously. Market forces simply will not wait. I intend to work closely with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee to make sure that consumer interests are protected as we move forward on this vital issue.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with my colleagues from Montana, Senator Baucus, to introduce the The Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act of 1998, a bill to settle the claims and quantify the water rights of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation. This bill is the culmination of many years of work and negotiations in our state and will result in the federal government sanctioning the water rights compact that has been adopted by the Montana State Legislature. This settlement may represent a textbook example of how state and tribal governments, together with off-reservation local representatives, can sit down and resolve their differences. I am pleased that local ranchers were involved in every step of the discussions. 
The Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation, the present homeland of the Chippewa Cree Tribe, is located in area of scarce water supply. The region is arid with an average annual precipitation of 12 inches suitable for growing hay. However, an average annual precipitation of 30 inches of snowpack in the Bearpaw Mountains contributes to a significant spring runoff. A more efficient and effective utilization of that runoff is a critical part of this package. The state legislation authorized funding for efficiency improvements that mitigate the impact of tribal water development on off-reservation water use. 
By reaching an out of court settlement, the parties will--once this package is implemented--go to the state water court and ask that all pending litigation involving claims by the Tribe, and by the United States on behalf of the Tribe, be dropped. The quantification of the Tribe's water right will also clearly benefit upstream and downstream users of water in the effected drainage, including the Big Sandy and Beaver Creek as well as the Milk River. These other users will be able to plan for their future because they will know precisely how much water the Chippewa Cree Tribe is entitled to. One of the progressive components of this settlement is a Water Compact Board made up of three members, a tribal representative, an off-reservation representative and a third person mutually agreed to by the state and tribe. This Board will be tasked with resolving disputes between users of the tribal water right and users of water rights recognized under state law. 
The bill set ups a Chippewa Cree Fund that will include funds for the administration of the compact, a tribal economic development account and a future water supply facilities account. The bill allows for increased on reservation storage at existing dams and two feasibility studies for alternative sources and methods of delivery for MR&I water supplies for both the reservation and the region. Finally, all parties to this settlement agree that the Tribe will need more water in the future for drinking purposes. While the settlement reserves 10,000 acre feet of water in Tiber Reservoir, it does not propose a method of delivery. We are all committed to revisiting the on-reservation drinking water matter in the near future either through a pipeline or other methods that will be part of the authorized studies. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a letter from our state's Governor, Marc Racicot, endorsing this legislation. Senator Baucus and I will soon be asking the Indian Affairs Committee to hold hearings and then to act favorable on this bill as expeditiously as the Committee's schedule will allow.

Mr. BURNS. Madam President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. Every year, we have authorized and we have appropriated moneys for programs sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help market grain abroad; in other words, to beef up our exports and to be able to compete in the international market. 
We are going through times now where prices are very, very stressed and depressed, I would say. We need all the help we can get to move the supply that we have into foreign hands after the collapse of the financial markets in the Pacific rim that have been major buyers of our agricultural commodities. Of course, the actions of the IMF and what this country has undertaken to help those countries out of that financial condition will help those of us who depend heavily on agricultural exports. 
This is just a sense of the Senate to tell the USDA and the International Trade Representative that we need help. It does no good to put the loaded pistol in the holster if the USDA doesn't pull it in times when we really need it. The time is now. This is just a sense of the Senate to say that we have authorized it, we have funded it, and we hope the USDA will use it.

Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Wyoming. 
Mr. President, the 45th parallel up there is the only thing that keeps us apart, and we get arguments over that. Nonetheless, we get along pretty well as neighbors. A lot of what I am going to talk about today is what we have in common. Our agriculture is similar, and a few other things that one might not recognize at first. Montana and Wyoming are watershed states, Wyoming is the only State in the country where the water runs from it from all four directions. There may be a reason for that, maybe not. 
My colleague talked about dealing with a $5 trillion national debt. I would take that another step forward and remind the American people and my colleagues who make decisions based on history that we have almost double that number in a little fund, an unfunded liability, when we talk about Social Security. So in our dealings with doing something about the national debt, we are in essence dealing with the problem that we have in Social Security. 
I thank my friend from Wyoming for allowing me to edge in on his time here.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I introduced an amendment to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997 back in 1997. It extended to our agriculture producers--farmers and ranchers--the ability to average their income over a 3-year period. The amendment was included and made part of the U.S. Tax Code, but only after further negotiations, sunset the provision after 3 year which would make it run out in 2001. 
Today, I would like to introduce a bill that would make income averaging for our agriculture producers permanent in the U.S. Tax Code. This bill will give our agriculture producers--farmers and ranchers--a fair tool to offset the unpredictable nature of their business. 
Our man in the chair this morning from the great agricultural State of Nebraska, and the rest of us in the breadbasket of this country understand what farmers and ranchers go through. It has always been a good business and at times it is a great business. But we are going through some times now that are very stressful. As a friend of mine said the other day, there is nothing wrong down on the farm except the price. That is what we have now. 
There are not very many segments of the American economy that are taking in the same amount of money for their commodity today as they were taking when World War II ended, some 50 years ago. However, they are expected to keep producing food not only in generous proportions but also the safest, the best quality and nutritious food in the world. 
What makes this Nation unique is, we not only produce it, but we have the infrastructure that allows distribution--our processors, purveyors, transportation, grocery stores, everything from the breakfast table of America all the way back to the first seed that goes into the ground is unmatched anywhere in the world. It is something of a great marvel in this country. And it is also true that every one of us alive today in this country goes about our daily business of feeding the Nation. Somewhere along the line, we are participants in this great infrastructure to deal with our own subsistence. 
But basically, I want to talk about--the production level, I don't think there is a commodity today that is not hurting when it comes to the marketplace and to the whims of Mother Nature's elements that she rains down on agriculture. Agriculture production is a 7-day-a-week job as anybody that has ever worked on a dairy farm knows. I assumed that most Americans knew that, but I am finding out that I was wrong. They think milk cows take off the weekend, too, but they don't. Farming is an ongoing situation--7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. Farmers and ranchers take pride in their work. They produce as economically as they possibly can, knowing that they fall under the old philosophy that they although they sell wholesale, they have to buy retail, and they pay the freight both ways, knowing that agriculture has always been in that kind of a predicament. 
Not only do they take great pride in what they produce, but probably no other segment of the American public has a greater understanding of land stewardship and the environmental problems that face our country today. Yet, very few of them are ever asked their advice on how to deal with an environmental problem. Several colleagues that serve in this body, who grew up on a farm or a ranch, certainly understand the frustration of the business. They only get paid about two, maybe three times a year. So it is a crucial time for the farm families across this country when we take a look at the situation we find ourselves in now. With the financial collapse of many Asian markets in the Pacific rim, we see wheat at an all-time low. Our corn and soybeans will suffer. As far as export trade is concerned, we export a lot more than we receive. We also see a time when we fall whim to the psychology of the market more than the market itself. 
With the recent passage of the freedom to farm bill, we told farmers that subsidies were going to go away, that they were going to have to stand on their own. We also said that we would give them the tools with which to operate their farms. 
Market forces are unique. We still fall victim to flood and drought, disease, new infestations which are far, far beyond the control of the producer himself. Farmers make money one year, but may break even the next year, and then lose money the next two years. If you take market elements and Mother Nature into consideration, farmers fall outside of the business of control. So, at best, they are lucky to break even 2 years in a row, and if they have done that, they think they are really ahead. 
The business is capital intensive, and labor intensive. To give you an idea just why this is an important thing, many young people right now due to death taxes--in other words, estate taxes--agriculture producers usually find themselves in the situation where they are land rich but they are cash poor. Passing the farm and ranch on to the next generation is hard when the tax situation is where they cannot do it. They may have exceeded the limit and heavy estate taxes prevent that. With increases in the top marginal tax and with a record of high commodity taxes, it is time to allow some of that income that goes back to the farm to be retained and to allow them to average their income over 3 years at those marginal tax rates. 
We made a deal with agriculture when we passed the Freedom to Farm Act. We made a deal with them that there would be no more subsidies, but we would give them income averaging and all the tools that it would take to hang on to their money so that they could invest in next year's crop. If you want to really measure a man's faith, have him take his money, his time, his efforts, and his investment and have him put a seed in the ground in hopes that it will just sprout, let alone harvesting a crop. 
That is faith, we have always had it in agriculture, and it has always been the backbone of every State economy and it still is. When things are good in agriculture, they are usually good for the rest of the country. But I would say this economy right now, the one we are experiencing that everybody raves about is still riding the backs of those who are in the business of producing a raw commodity. 
So, Mr. President, I offer this bill to put in a permanent place for income averaging for agriculture producers. 
Mr. President, there will be letters coming out to my colleagues explaining what we have done here. I think it is very important. It is important to my State. It is important to all of us. It is important to the smaller communities of America, because if agriculture is not healthy, those communities suffer also. That is why we work very hard on communications infrastructure, and that is why we work awfully hard on power infrastructure. Smaller communities that rely so heavily on agricultural income must find ways to attract other economic opportunities and those two other parts are very important to their infrastructure in the future. 
I appreciate the time from my friend from Wyoming. I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I appreciate the courtesy. It won't take me very long to sum up why we think this is important. 
I agree with everything that the chairman of the Ag Committee has said. The problem is, we have not gotten the administration to implement those tools they have at hand to help us out. They have not confronted our Canadian neighbors to live within their quotas. When you start talking about putting together a farm bill--and I think the Senator from Indiana would agree--it is hard to write farm legislation that is not flawed. Because of the diversification in our agriculture, that is tough to do. 
Flexibility in crops in Montana has not come, for the simple reason that we have a short growing season and soil that is unlike that in Indiana or Missouri or Iowa or Nebraska or wherever. 
A fellow walked up to me a while ago and said, `The President is in Africa, and he is making a lot of friends.' 
If I had his checkbook, I could be making a lot of friends. I think he ought to be offering food--wheat, principally--and those things that help people most in nations where they are suffering from malnutrition and hunger. I hope this doesn't set a precedent, that this stays with us this year. 
But I will tell you what it does. It allows a small group of farmers from North Dakota and from Montana to gain financing so they can get a crop in, because we have some who will not be refinanced on their operational loans. That is what it does. That is who we are speaking for today, those people who are caught between a Canadian situation and a total collapse of the financial situation in the Pacific rim, which takes most of our crops. I speak in favor of it. I appreciate the leadership of my colleague, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Indiana, the chairman of the Ag Committee. I remind folks that in the appropriations, and through the leadership of my friend from Mississippi, the EEP is funded. 
We have appropriated that money every year to be used as a tool in the market, so it is not that we have not done our work here in this Senate as far as the agriculture producers are concerned. I think the administration, both through the International Trade Representative and the Ag Department, has to start taking a look at the tools or the weapons they have in their arsenal in order to help these folks. 
This is not going to help our farmers who need money to get back in the field to plant their spring crops, but I will tell you that we are going to work very, very hard to make sure it is there next year and this administration uses the tools it has at its disposal. 
I appreciate the time, and I yield the floor. And noting no other Senator choosing to use time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations to the INTELSAT Working Party, which recently met here in Washington, DC, and finalized its recommendations concerning the spin-off of a private entity from this inter-governmental treaty organization to compete in the global satellite communications marketplace. These recommendations, which must be ratified by the 142 Member-Nations of INTELSAT in the coming weeks, were made in consultation with the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission, and the White House. With that many cooks in the kitchen, it's astounding that any agreement was reached. This is a landmark achievement which deserves our applause. 
I view this agreement as a significant and positive first step in the process of this intergovernmental treaty organization. As many of my colleagues are probably aware, I am presently working with Members of the Commerce Committee to craft legislation that will foster a competitive environment in the vibrant industry of satellite communications. I have already conducted a hearing on this matter before the Subcommittee on Communications and have another scheduled to take place in April. Furthermore, over the past several months, I, along with my colleagues in the Senate, have met with a wide range of domestic and international satellite communications companies, including representatives from several Member Nations of INTELSAT. Sometime prior to the upcoming hearing, we will introduce legislation which will create a more competitive marketplace where consumers worldwide will reap the benefits of enhanced communications services at reduced costs. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House, specifically, Chairman Bliley, Representative Markey, Chairman Tauzin and others, to arrive at the most constructive legislation. 
Until that time, I encourage my colleagues to keep an open mind as we move forward to resolving this very difficult issue. Once again, I want to offer my congratulations to INTELSAT for taking this important first step toward privatization. I will be watching the discussion in Brazil with great interest, and I hope that the Working Party's recommendation with respect to the spin-off are adopted, so that we will soon see the consumer benefits from another competitor in the private marketplace.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today and join with my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, to introduce an amendment to the current farm program. The amendment will assist our farmers in Montana. I think we have sort of an isolated circumstance in Montana. But I think it will also help others, too, because of the depressed price in wheat. 
This bill is not a fix. It doesn't do everything maybe that we want to do. But it will assist many of our farmers in getting back in the fields this season, and it will also allow a little time to deal with some of the pressures that we are experiencing along the Canadian border. 
As we enter a week commemorating agriculture and celebrate what agriculture provides for us, I am glad to come to the floor and help in the introduction of this bill. 
America and the general public need to learn more about this great industry. It is the largest industry in our country--and again, with insight into the role that agriculture plays in our everyday lives--not only from an economic standpoint, but at least three times a day for most of us, and some of us more, for the role that it also plays. 
Two years ago we passed the freedom-to-farm bill--the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act. We anticipated at that time that it would give us the flexibility on the farm to do some things that we want to do. That was only a year ago. Now, with that flexibility, of course, farmers operate on a big calendar called a year. Sometimes that flexibility takes a little bit longer than planned. We have some circumstances that are beyond the control of our grain farmers. Everything that we had hoped would occur has not happened. One is the Canadian situation. Prices have continued to drop, making it very difficult for our operators to meet their commitments on time. 
So this amendment would not give them anything extra. It will just give them a chance to make those payments in a timely manner. 
Today, Senator Baucus and I, with our colleague in the House, Representative Hill, are moving forward to correct a portion of that contract we made with our agricultural producers. We are seeking a minor adjustment in the law that passed Congress and was signed by this President. The portion that we seek to correct is the timeframe for repayment on marketing loans. We are not seeking a major change in that portion of the contract--just a minor adjustment. This adjustment will provide farmers with a slightly larger window in which to repay their marketing loans--an extension of only 6 months; nothing major; just enough for the producers to contract with purchasers to move their grain into the market. 
A large number of our producers have not yet priced their 1997 wheat crop--the one harvested last fall. Many have taken out loans with the Commodity Credit Corporation and USDA-sponsored programs to assist farmers with marketing their wheat. A large number of these loans are coming due in May and June of this year. With the world wheat market already being depressed due to additional grain on the domestic market, it will do nothing but really compound the whole problem. The farmer deserves just this little bit of assistance. They will provide us with a reliable, safe, and inexpensive food supply all around this country, and now I think they need just a little relief. 
This is a minor step that we are making today with the introduction of this bill. The legislation will help a little, but it will not solve the major problem that we face in agriculture. The plain and simple fact is we need to move our grain into world markets. 
Unfortunately, the Department of Agriculture seems determined not to assist our producers in this endeavor. In 1996 Congress made a contract with the farmer in exchange for reducing the amount of money they receive from the Government for their crops. We contracted with them to move grain into the market--namely, the world market. 
So the farmer in Montana and across the Nation accepted this contract. They have done their part. Now it is time for Congress and the Department of Agriculture and this administration to live up to their end of the deal. 
As a member of the Subcommittee on Agriculture Appropriations, I have made my thoughts known to the committee and to the administration. However, this past week, while I visited with the wheatgrowers in Montana, I learned one thing that would ease the burden. Today, we stand before the Senate, and I call for the administration to move at least 100 million tons of grain as soon as possible. This will not solve the problem we face on the farm. But it will ease the pressure and allow farmers to think about the future. Today they think only about the future and about how it would be like without the farm. 
So, I call on President Clinton, the Secretary of Agriculture Glickman, and the U.S. Trade Representative to make an effort to assist the man and woman on the ground, to do something to show that you are concerned about them. 
We had a situation last fall that was not the making of our producers. In the railroad industry, Houston was tied up so badly that it left us without any way to ship grain. We still received tons and tons of grain from Canada in this country. We have to deal with these measures. 
The legislation will allow us some time to do that and also will allow our farmers to get back in the fields. It is my hope that the legislation that we introduce today will assist in some little measure to give the farmer the hope to continue. I also hope that the administration will see their role in this and move forward in providing what they can to make life a little more bearable for our agricultural producers in our country. 
There is also another situation that was not created by us or the farmers; that is, we are not allowed to access about 11 percent of the world market due to embargoes--by governments and countries that probably have some problems in the area which the State Department usually handles. And, denied that market, there are other producers in other nations taking advantage of that. They get a premium for their grain and then dump the rest of theirs onto the world market for which we have to compete at a lower price. We have to address that problem also. 
Mr. President, I join with my colleague in introducing this legislation.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Office of Surgeon General Sunset Act, along with Senators Helms, Thomas, and Kyl. This legislation has the same purpose as my bill from the 104th Congress, but has a different enactment provision. This bill will sunset the Office of Surgeon General only after Dr. Satcher vacates the office; this bill would not remove him from that position. 
Every recent Surgeon General nomination, including that of Dr. Koop, has resulted in a political battle which has detracted from important health issues. The position has been used by both parties as a political advocate as much as a public health advocate. In the wake of the recent nomination process, I am more persuaded than ever that the office is a lightning rod for controversy which provides no public benefit. 
The Surgeon General and his staff of six serve no compelling purpose. It is often said that the Surgeon General occupies a bully pulpit from which to address the nation on important health issues. But we've been without a surgeon general since the end of 1994, and there was no shortage of voices on major health issues. The president, the first lady, the secretary of health and human services, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and the former surgeon general all spoke on public health issues. 
What's more, the Surgeon General and his office are duplicative. The office performs no crucial function that is not handled by a different bureaucracy. In fact, the budget for the office has already been folded into the Office of Public Health and Science, headed by Dr. Satcher in his role as Assistant Secretary for Health. This office has a staff of 300 and a current budget of over $80 million. My bill will merely complete the transition to the Assistant Secretary for Health, eliminating a redundant federal office. 
This legislation is not about Dr. Satcher, or about any previous Surgeon General. Dr. Satcher will continue to be Surgeon General and the office would sunset immediately after he vacates it. This legislation will sunset an office that has become a political football and has long since outlived its usefulness.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce with my colleague, Senator Baucus, the Gallatin Consolidation Act completion phase, know as Gallatin II (two). Our colleague, Congressman Hill, is introducing identical legislation today in the House. 
The bill we have jointly introduced today is the result of much cooperation and communication among the citizens of the state of Montana, the Forest Service, the partners of Big Sky Lumber and the Montana Congressional Delegation. Ranchers, property owners, outfitters, environmentalists, county commissioners, sportsmens groups, wildlife associations and other groups have sat at the table attempting to find consensus on the difficult aspects of the exchange. 
That process will continue. The introduction of this bill today does not end the public involvement. In fact, it just opens a different facet of public input. Committee hearings are next in line as we consider this legislation. 
The lands the U.S. Forest Service will acquire under this act are some of the richest wildlife habitat areas in the state of Montana. Today the lands in the Gallatin National Forest are still held in a mostly checkerboard land-ownership pattern. Add into this mix a dramatic increase in residential development in rural areas near the National Forests and you have further complicated the resource problems for multiple use in our National Forests. 
With this bill we are attempting to consolidate the National Forest System ownership pattern and preserve some of these corridors for wildlife, resource protection, and future generations who are fortunate enough to visit these forests. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Hill and Senator Baucus for their participation and cooperation in formulating a delegation approach to this complex land exchange. I look forward to moving this bill forward in an efficient and timely manner so that the deadline for accomplishing the exchange can be met. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate Community Hospital and Nursing Home of Anaconda, Montana, for being listed among the top 100 hospitals in the nation in 1997. The entire staff of Community Hospital, from CEO Sam Allen on down, should be very proud of their hard work and success in caring for the Anaconda community. 
This distinction is based on an annual performance measurement including patient care, operations, and financial management conducted by HCIA and William M. Mercer, Inc. The study, 100 Top Hospitals--Benchmarks for Success, looked at 1,300 hospitals with fewer than 99 acute-care beds, and Community was one of 20 that made the Top 100 from that size category. 
The performance measures of the Benchmarks for Success are objective--such as risk-adjusted mortality index and expense per adjusted discharge (case mix and wage adjusted)--which means that Community Hospital's success is documented by experts in the field. I know that Community's patients and staff knew this without the performance study, but I point this out because this isn't a typical award. Community has built itself into a national model, and for that I congratulate them.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have a logistics problem here, myself being the cause of most of it. This is the first time that the U.S. Senate has considered a veto message from the President under the line-item veto law. This has already been taken up in the House. There were 38 projects in the military construction appropriations bill that were lined out by the President, and those vetoes were overridden in the House by a strong bipartisan vote of 347-69. 
The line-item veto provides a mechanism that allows the President to veto items that he doesn't think necessary or which do not meet his approval. We have been asked many times, `Do you still support it?' after we have worked so hard with the ranking member, Senator Murray of Washington, and then it came back with 38 projects lined out--and probably with a very, very weak argument. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this override of the President's veto of H.R. 2631, a bill disapproving the President's line-item vetoes for the fiscal year 1998 military construction bill. I will go back and say that this money should be in the pipeline. Here we are halfway through the year, or better, and if you come from a northern tier of States, especially Montana, we only have two seasons, winter and the construction season. So these projects need to be on line. I will have more to say about this particular issue. I have to take the Presiding Officer's chair this morning between 12 and 1. First, I would like to say that this is a pretty nonpartisan piece of legislation, the appropriations on military construction, and even this project of the Presidential veto override. 
The cooperation between the ranking member of our committee and the work that we do on this for the good of families, and also keeping our military infrastructure in pace with the times, sometimes takes lots of work, and decisions have to be made, sometimes tough decisions, especially if we have less money to work with--and we are going to have less money to work with in the next year--it is going to be even more difficult. 
I want to state publicly what a pleasure it was to work with Senator Murray and her staff in putting together what we think are the priorities that should be taken care of to ensure that the infrastructure, especially military construction and support of our fighting men and women, whenever it is needed. Senator Murray has an opening statement, and I will have more to say on this later on.

Mr. BURNS. Madam President, we didn't make our opening statement a while ago because we had sort of a logistics problem. But we have most of that ironed out. 
There are a couple of points that I would like to make on which the support for the override of this veto is very important. I assure my good friend from Nebraska that I will not take long. 
We have worked with Senator McCain, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, in developing parameters and guidelines on what we should do when making determinations of spending that money on military construction. I am beholden to him, and I thank him for his leadership, because not only did it help us develop our guidelines but also it helps us to at least coordinate the activities of military construction with Armed Services. 
There are two different entities here. I agree that it is alarming whenever we see the attrition, especially an accelerated attrition and losing people who are essential to make our fighting forces really effective--in other words those pilots, those specialized people, who are highly technical and necessary to operate in today's modern Army, Air Force, Navy, or Marine Corps. 
There has been some attention given to Guard facilities. There is a very good reason for that. This administration since it came to town has been integrating Guard and Reserve units with regulars wherever they can because the force structure and our cutback in defense spending has required them to do that. In each one of those places where you have Guard or Reserves, it takes facilities that at least come up to the standard that you would find in any regular unit. 
So there is a new way of looking on how we build facilities and what facilities are going to be needed. I also say that losing through attrition these people that we depend on in technical positions concerns me. But it also concerns me that if they do not accept advancement or more money to fly 5 or 6 more years, then there is another reason why they are leaving the military. You say they are away from their families. I would say quality of life has a lot to do with that. And the emphasis of the last 3 years or 4 years or so has been on quality of life--not only quality of life for the person that is serving in uniform, or serving in our particular services, but also the spouses of those men and women because that is just as important, too, when we take a look at family life on any base, post, or operation. 
It might surprise a lot of Senators that the biggest share of appropriations--the lion's share--goes to environmental cleanup caused by BRAC, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The ranking Member and I have looked at some figures, and fully a third of next year's appropriations will be in environmental cleanup. It does nothing to add to the quality of life nor to build facilities nor to integrate anything that has to do with the security and the defense of this country. 
There we ought to make some changes, because I think sometimes when we go into environmental cleanup when a base is closed and all of these requirements we are putting on, a lot of these bases are not going to end up being day care centers. Maybe we ought to find out what they are going to be used for and go to that degree as far as environmental cleanup. I am not against environmental cleanup. I do not want to go as far as I can to eat off the floor of barracks. But that is what we are talking about here. All of these so-called add-ons were authorized by the committee. Those are the guidelines. Those are the guidelines and the parameters that were set down. 
We will continue as long as I am chairman of this committee to press for quality of life, and also the new thrust of how we are going to prepare our young men and women for the defense of this country. And if we are going to integrate what we would call regulars with the Reserves or with the National Guard, then it is going to take a new thrust in the way we allocate money to maintain the infrastructure for that to happen. That is the thrust we have used today. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments about at least one amendment that has been offered here this afternoon. 
As we work our way through the debate on campaign finance reform and you listen to Senators express themselves in the legal areas, the more one thinks that maybe we have got enough laws in place, maybe it is a matter of enforcing them. 
I remind Senators that it was in 1996 when one major party failed to file their FEC report on the date it was supposed to be filed. In fact, it never was filed until after the election was over. 
So I would argue that law enforcement probably has as much to do with the problems we see in political campaigns more than anything else. All through this process, we try to pass legislation that would maybe bring political campaigns into the light of public scrutiny. We would try to cap contributions, how 
much an individual or an organization can contribute to a particular campaign. We would try to cap spending. We would try to establish and make permanent filing dates. 
Yet all of them would be to no purpose if we do not enforce them. In fact, we have gone into some approach of asking for free advertising from radio and television based on a faulty assumption, an assumption, if we do something, get something for nothing, we can limit the expenses, thus making it easier for everybody to run for political office. 
I would ask those who would advocate such a regulation to offer free television and free radio time, I would ask them, the newspapers and publications, will they be made to offer free space? Will printers lay out people, graphic artists? Will they donate their labor for direct mail and fliers and stickers and, yes, those things that we mail direct to our constituency? 
While we are talking about that, would we also write into the same regulation that they may be sent postage free? Should the laborers of the post office, or whoever, be made to do it for nothing? And my answer to that is, of course not. 
Radio and television is a unique medium. Some would say it operates on the public airwaves. How public are they? If a radio station or a television station owns a chunk of frequency, do they not own it? They are only given so many hours in a day--like 24--that they can sell time. Once that time has passed, it cannot be recovered or made up later on. Are we asking them to give away their inventory? Are we asking them to pay their production people to dub and to produce? Why are not their expenses the same as any other segment of the American media? 
The amendment is nothing more than that the FCC should not advocate or use funds to regulate radio and television stations for free time or free access. It just does not make a lot of sense, especially when broadcasters lead this country in public service, in news and weather and services to a community. Yes, they get paid for the advertising for some of those programs, but basically they are there 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. 
Of course, they are being asked to do something for nothing. So I hope in any kind of reform that passes this body, that this amendment to prevent the FCC from requiring radio and television stations to give free advertising space would be a part of that reform. 
But bottom line--and I am not a lawyer; never been hinged with that handle--as I listen to the argument, it boils down to, bottom line, the integrity of the folks that are supporting an issue or an individual for political office. It all comes down to that. For if lawyers write this law, it will be lawyers that will figure a way around it. It is a matter merely of enforcing the law.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand today to recognize an Olympian from the great state of Montana. Eric Bergoust, a Western Montana native from Missoula, will represent our nation next week in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. 
Eric, 28, is a freestyle aerialist skier--a sport that requires athletes to launch themselves off a snow ski ramp, twist and turn their body in mid-air and land on the slope below. You certainly cannot appreciate the physical requirements of this sport until you are able to see it. And the landings don't always end up feet down. Watch the sport long enough and you are bound to see an unplanned landing. 
But Eric is not new to the challenges of freestyle aerial skiing. Eric was profiled on network television earlier this week during a look at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The profile included photos of Eric diving off the roof of his parents' Missoula home into mattresses on the ground below. Mr. President, I am happy to see that Eric's adventurous spirit is now compensated and insured. 
When I was a kid, we also had to be creative to fill our time, but my feet stayed on the ground and rarely reached a height higher than the stirrups of a tall horse. 
Although he has claimed his share of injuries from the physically demanding sport, I am proud to claim Eric as a native Montanan. He has represented our state well in world class events. 
Eric is participating in his second Olympic games and has matured into one of the sport's premiere athletes. Last month, Eric won a World Cup event in British Columbia and is at the top of the World Cup standing entering the Olympics. 
I've sent Eric a telegram wishing him well next week in the freestyle aerial events. I wanted to make sure my colleagues and the American people are aware of Eric's roots and the Montana spirit that drives him to be the world's best in his sport.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today, Tuesday, February 3, 1998, has been declared Teen Day throughout the State of Montana. This celebration is an opportunity to honor and recognize Montana's outstanding teens for their accomplishments and contributions. 
On this special day, events and activities across Montana are being held to acknowledge these young individuals for their achievements and contributions to their community. Teen Day is also an opportunity to congratulate teens for continuing to choose healthy lifestyles, such as not smoking, not taking drugs, and not drinking. 
Montana's youth are more likely to be enrolled in school, graduate and attend college than the national trend. For our future business owners, professionals and community leaders, Teen Day 1998 is a time for all Montanans to recognize its young citizens and continue to acknowledge and encourage their scholastic, social and community pursuits.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend two Montana artists for their dedication and talent. 
In the West, we are accustomed to western art whether in the form of a Charlie Russell painting or a Frederick Remington bronze. But today I would like to recognize the future of Western bronze sculpture art defining our nation's roots and the hardy souls who lived off the land and gave us the rich history that will always be a part of our nation's beginning. 
Bruce and Kathy Contway of Whitehall, Montana, have helped to preserve that history as well as to find their own place in history as American artists. These two artists are becoming well-known internationally for their abilities and their works celebrating a colorful Native American and Old West past. Their art has helped to make accessible to all of us the distinctive culture and customs of this nation's first inhabitants. 
The Contways, have certainly earned the honors they have received. Their dedication and hard work were recently rewarded when they each received the admiration of their peers and fans alike. 
1997 was a year of recognition for the Contways. Bruce was named the Indian Arts and Crafts Association (IACA) Artist of the Year and was also awarded the steer wrestling and bareback riding bronze commissions during the 1997 Calgary Stampede Trophy Bronze Competition. Kathy was awarded the envy of all artists participating in the Stampede competition--the Chuckwagon Race Outriders bronze. Mr. President, bronze artists everywhere understand the significance of these honors. 
The work of Bruce and Kathy indicates a strong pride in their Native American heritage. Their remarkable talent combined with modest self-recognition is an inspiration to young artists across our country. And their desire to pass on their legacy and pride is a tribute to all Montanans. 
Among their peers, Bruce and Kathy are considered world-class artists. Among their neighbors, Bruce and Kathy are considered friends. The Contways are very involved in the local community. Accomplished high school and college rodeo stars, they enjoy working with local students in the high school's rodeo club. 
Last December, the front page headline of the Whitehall Ledger read, `Contway art `Stampedes' to great year'. The article was a fitting tribute to two of Montana's best. Artists with this kind of talent are difficult to find, and you can bet that a Contway bronze will be a treasured work of art on any lucky owner's mantel.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my grave disappointment in the statement that Sara Lister, the Army's Assistant Secretary for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, made in reference to the U.S. Marine Corps. We just finished Veterans Day, and November 10 is traditionally the Marine Corps' birthday. So I guess her sense of timing is unbelievable. But, basically, this is what the Assistant Secretary said: `The Marines are extremists' and `wherever you have extremists, you've got some risks of total disconnection with society.' 
For whatever I have done with my life personally, I attribute some of what I learned in the U.S. Marine Corps. I think the statement that she made is grossly unjust, and is an affront to every person who has ever worn the uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps, or to any person who has worn any uniform of the Armed Forces of this country, and those who have died for the very freedoms that we Americans, even Ms. Lister, enjoy today and every day. 
Mr. President, back in 1955, we were taught that the code of the corps is honor, courage, and commitment--honor in the defense of freedom, courage in the face of adversity and commitment to the members of your unit but, more important, to those folks at home. 
I am very proud to say that these principles have guided my life, and I hope that these would be the principles that our society could emulate, not values that should be considered `disconnected' with the norm. I am wondering who is really disconnected here. 
The corps has always presented to its new members a challenge for higher standards and higher achievements. In its 222-year history, they are incomparable and, yes, they are the guiding light of all services and something of which every American can be proud. 
I understand Ms. Lister has sent an apology to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Krulak. That might be enough for him, but it is not enough for me. She claims that she was quoted out of context. I don't accept that either. No one service should be placed over another. Nobody has a corner on bravery or valor or commitment to this country. But you must remember that it was these men and women who fought and died for the blessings of liberty for our Nation, and no one should forget that their words still reflect today. 
So I am saying Secretary Lister should resign her post, because I personally think that she is unfit to serve in a leadership position in the military of this Nation. I am very sad about this day.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we just introduced a placeholder in a bill on the Gallatin exchange to preserve that option. It expires December 31. It is a land exchange in the Gallatin National Forest. I support that land exchange. I did not want to get into an adjournment situation and let the time run out and not have a placeholder, because I am concerned about one area in particular, as is everybody. I heard the concerns of my constituents in the Bridger Bang Tail area of the Gallatin National Forest and in the Taylor Creek area. This area has to be kept in the condition that it is now because it is probably the most important migration area for wildlife we have from Yellowstone Park into Montana and out of Montana. This is a migration corridor that must be protected. 
We have an obligation to complete this land exchange. It is a good land exchange. It is the right thing to do for that particular part of our country, and I will support it. Of course, the delegation from Montana will get together and work out the details. But I wanted to put that in there to make sure that our options are left open when Congress comes back into session, 
because I feel very strongly about this area, about the preservation of this area in the management of forests, especially in very fragile areas and in areas that are very, very important to the migration of wildlife, in particular elk and deer. We have introduced that placeholder for those reasons today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I am introducing draft legislation to complete the third phase of the Gallatin Land Consolidation Act. As Congress winds down to the final hours of this session it has become increasingly important to show Montanans that we are committed to completing this act. 
In Montana there are many folks who have small problems with the details of the proposed agreement between Big Sky Lumber and the U.S. Forest Service. Also at stake are the exceptional natural resources of the Taylors Fork lands. These lands are privately owned and face an uncertain future. By showing the private landowners that Congress is, in fact, committed to completing this exchange, the environmental value of Taylors Fork will be preserved. 
Taylors Fork is a migration corridor for wildlife which leave Yellowstone National Park for winter range in Montana. With legislation I am committed to preserving Taylors Fork as close to a natural state as possible. 
I am confident that by working together, the Montana congressional delegation will be able to resolve the outstanding land use issues in the Bridger-Bangtail area. I also believe we can resolve the concerns of the timber small business set-aside. 
This bill is a placeholder. There are many details that need to be included. The deadline for ensuring the Taylors Fork lands remain included in the agreement is December 31 of this year. My intent with this bill is to satisfy the deadline to preserve our option on Taylors Fork and to provide a forum for Montanans to begin to comment on the details of the package. I look forward to moving ahead with Senator Baucus and Congressman Hill and completing the original act of 1993 in the next session of Congress.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in recent days, Chairman McCain and I have addressed the Commerce Committee's communications agenda for next year. I expect the Communications Subcommittee, which I chair, to have an active and full slate of issues as we approach the second session of the 105th Congress. 
Chairman McCain and I have agreed that the Communications Subcommittee will hold a series of oversight hearings on the implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. We will examine the degree to which the act has met its objectives of promoting competition and deregulation. We will examine the level of competition in the local and long-distance markets, between cable companies and alternative video providers, competition in the wireless industry and other important issues. We will devote considerable attention to interconnection issues and universal service. 
I would like to address in some depth an issue that will be one of the most important issues before the Communications Subcommittee, that of international satellite reform. 
The Communications Subcommittee has already begun to examine the international satellite communications market. On July 25 of this year, the subcommittee held a very informative hearing on this vital issue. We learned of the need for further changes in the regulation of the international market. We need to promote greater competition internationally while lifting unneeded regulations domestically. The issues in this debate are complex--they involve trade policy, fair treatment for those with existing investments, allocations of spectrum and orbital slots, market access, and elimination of outdated regulations. 
Recently, my colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, introduced S. 1328, which is virtually identical to a bill introduced earlier this year in the House by Chairman Bliley. Senator Inouye has stated that he hopes his bill will help `spur debate on this important issue.' I share this hope. Senator Inouye's bill has been referred to the Commerce Committee. I look forward to working with him and others next year to develop an appropriate international satellite policy for the future, and also to address other domestic satellite issues. 
As we move forward, I am going to be guided by the principles of former President Ronald Reagan. In 1984, President Reagan signed an Executive order that effectively eliminated outdated regulations and allowed U.S.-licensed satellite companies to compete around the world. That competition has resulted in greater consumer choices, lower prices, and the ability to reach anyone anywhere in the world. 
Now as we approach the turn of the century, we need to complete President Reagan's vision. The Satellite Act, which was enacted in 1962 at a time when satellites were still experimental, has become outdated. This country cannot afford to have an industry guided by rules that were created in the days of Sputnik. We need to look forward at ways to roll back unwarranted regulations and fully unleash the potential that 
this industry holds. 
I share the goals of increasing competition, privatizing intergovernmental organizations, and enhancing market access abroad for American satellite companies. Any legislative action should be designed to promote opportunities for American businesses, while making sure they are not harmed by the very effort that seeks to enhance their ability to succeed in the international marketplace. These are extremely complex issues and there may be different paths that lead to the same goals. The approach the subcommittee will take in further exploring these issues will be balanced. We will examine in detail how best to eliminate outdated regulations, address universal service concerns and provide for the needed flexibility to achieve an international agreement on satellite policy. 
I will continue to work with the Communications Subcommittee on this critical issue. I look forward to holding further hearings, and intend to develop legislation with Chairman McCain, ranking member Hollings, Senator Inouye, and other committee members to establish fair rules that are competitively neutral for the international market.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Snowe in introducing the Prostate Cancer Research Stamp Act of 1997 and urge the support of my colleagues. S. 1389 is a companion bill to Representative Sherrod Brown's bill, H.R. 2545, which has 41 cosponsors. 
The Prostate Cancer Research Stamp Act would authorize a new first-class stamp priced at up to 8 cents above a regular first-class stamp. Postal patrons who choose to purchase the prostate cancer stamp will be contributing to prostate cancer research at the National Cancer Institute. As important, a special prostate cancer stamp will help to raise awareness of this disease, promote screening, and save lives. 
Prostate cancer, the most common form of cancer in American men, will take 41,000 lives this year, nearly approaching the breast cancer death toll of 44,300. One of every eight is at risk of getting prostate cancer. Unfortunately, as the number of prostate cancer cases rises dramatically, research funding lags far behind what is needed to fight this disease. Although prostate cancer accounts for nearly 25 percent of diagnosed non-skin cancer, only 3.7 percent of Federal cancer research dollars are devoted to fighting it. 
Apart from the important contribution to prostate cancer research, the prostate cancer stamp will raise awareness of this disease and help to persuade men over age 40 to have annual prostate exams. Prostate cancer is detectable, and when found early is often fully treatable through several different methods, including surgical removal of the prostate and radiation treatment. Men must demand both a PSA blood test and a digital-rectal exam as part of their annual medical exam. At the recent Senate Aging Committee hearing on prostate cancer, I commented that we men are such crybabies that we go out of our way to avoid medical tests. The women at the hearing erupted in laughter, but the men were pretty quiet. The fact is that prostate cancer can only be treated early if it's detected early, and the long list of survivors all say that early detection made the difference. 
The sooner we enact this bill and make a postage stamp available, the greater the number of men who will get tested; and more testing means more men will survive prostate cancer.

Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Yellowstone National Park Community Participation Act. This is a bill to require the National Park Service to work in conjunction and consult with the communities surrounding Yellowstone National Park in both Montana and Wyoming. 
The communities surrounding Yellowstone National Park, are as directly affected by actions within the park, as anything in the park itself. These communities' stability and economic viability are in a large part dependent on the actions within the park. Their future is dependent upon the actions taken both by local park management, and the management of the National Park Service in Washington, DC. 
The Department of the Interior and the Director of the National Park Service have stated that the management of the parks and the Park Service itself should work in a cooperative effort to make sure that the local communities, affected by actions in the parks, are consulted before action occurs. Well unfortunately this is not always the case. 
Last year in the 104th Congress, authority was given to the National Park Service to provide for a demonstration project as it relates to fees charged to enter our national park. This was done with the understanding that this would assist the parks in coming up with additional funding for the backlog of construction and maintenance in each individual parks. Dollars which are sorely needed in the parks and which it is hoped would be put to good use. 
Communities surrounding our parks, especially Yellowstone, understand the need for the repairs to the infrastructure in the parks. They are all very willing to work with park management to do what they can to assist in maintaining the parks and assisting management in working on a means for caring for the parks. 
Yet, when the Park Service asked for input and provided each individual park with an opportunity to use and develop a new fee structure for the parks not all the communities were asked or informed of the increases in the fees. This was the case in Yellowstone National Park. 
While the management of Grand Teton, just a few miles south of Yellowstone, worked with and notified the communities affected by the future fee changes. Providing these communities an opportunity to prepare for the effects these changes would have on their business and economic vitality. 
An announcement was made by the management in Yellowstone to address the upcoming changes without very much, if any interaction with the surrounding communities. This then affected their ability to provide the information necessary to people who use their communities as a staging site for their visit to Yellowstone. It put them in the unenviable position of either subjecting their businesses to a loss, due to the fact that they either accepted the additional cost for operating their park tours, or charging the difference to those consumers who were there on the spur of the moment. This is not what any of us would like to do to our customers, nor anything that the Government should require of taxpayers who are either living at the gates of our national parks or visiting them for recreation. 
Had a consultation occurred in this instance, it is possible that relations between the communities and the park management could have developed to find a way to work through this process. However no consultation occurred and as a result, relations between park management and the local communities have been strained. 
Another telling facet of this dissolution of relations between local communities and the park management, is what occurred just last winter. Due to what the park management called reduced funding, they changed the winter opening dates for the entrances to Yellowstone. This had a dramatic effect on the economic stability of the communities which are located at the entrances to Yellowstone. 
The basis for business in those communities at the entrances to Yellowstone, is not just the traffic they see during the summer, but rests in large part on winter tourism in and around Yellowstone. As beautiful and magnificent, as Yellowstone can be during the summer, the visual experiences a person can enjoy during the winter are multiplied. Many of the businesses in these local communities look upon winter tourism as a means of keeping them in business for the next year. 
When any change is announced, without suitable notification or adequate consultation, these communities suffer greatly. Last winter visitors arrived at Yellowstone with the understanding that the park would be open, to allow them to experience the beauty of the Nation's `Crown Jewel' as it lay under a winter coating of snow. However, when they arrived at the entrance to the park, they were greeted not with a welcome, but with a barrier which kept them from enjoying their park. 
This delayed opening had a devastating effect on the communities at the gateways to Yellowstone. Many tours were canceled and groups which had planned future winter events in the area, have since canceled those plans. Although it was not true, many of these tour and business groups were of the understanding that Yellowstone was closed to winter travel and activity. 
The language in this bill would assure stability for the future of those communities located at the gateways to Yellowstone National Park. The legislation would provide for an opening and closing date, which the people of the community of West Yellowstone, MT, could count on in planning for tour groups and the hiring of personnel to make the visitors' stays a memorable experience. 
I have attempted to work with the Park Service and the local communities to see if some means of consultation could be worked out among all the parties involved. Last January a series of meetings occurred, between members of the local community the Park Service and my staff, to discuss the problems which the local communities were facing due to the actions taken last winter. As a result of these meetings, it was hoped that the management of the park would be more receptive to the working with the local communities in the development of changes affecting their lives. So far this has not been the case. 
I am offering this legislation today, in an attempt to open dialog to find suitable arrangements for consultation between the park and the gateway communities of Yellowstone National Park. I will request a hearing on this matter to open that dialog and to seek a means by which all parties are comfortable in a process of exchange and consultation on the future of the business related to Yellowstone. I look forward to working with the Park Service and the local communities to find a means of keeping Yellowstone a treasure for all America and the world to enjoy, during all seasons of the year. 
Thank you, Madam President.

Mr. BURNS. 
Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill to transfer the operation of an irrigation project in Montana from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the local irrigators. This is a bill, which has been before Congress before, but has been changed to address the concerns expressed by the BIA and groups which have opposed this legislation in the past. 
Years of management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs has led to a project in poor physical condition. Rather than being an asset for the government and the users, the Flathead Irrigation is rapidly becoming a liability. Using current estimates, the project is in need of $15 to $20 million worth of repair and conditioning. Government managers admit that costs associated with rehabilation of this project could be as much as 40 percent higher than if the project were under local control. 
The irony of this project however, is the fact that studies on locally owned irrigation projects in Montana and Wyoming show that the costs of operation and maintenance of the Flathead project are some of the highest in the Rocky Mountain Region the condition of the project may be worst in that same region. What do these people, and for that matter the taxpayer, get for the higher costs associated with the current management? Not much if anything at all. 
Let's take a moment here to see what local control of this irrigation project would mean to the irrigators and to the taxpayer. First of all, local control will mean increased accountability of the monies collected by and used in the operation of the Flathead Irrigation Project. At the current time the BIA is unable, or unwilling, to provide basic financial information to the local irrigation districts. This despite the fact that the local farmers and ranchers pay 100% of the costs to operate and maintain the project. At the same time, the current management cannot even deliver a year-end balance of funds paid by the local irrigation users. 
Local control will also create savings over the current operation management. By using these savings the local management could be used to restore the Flathead Irrigation Project to a fully functioning, efficiently operating unit. 
Without the transfer to local control, the residents of the Flathead face an uncertain future. This irrigation project is located in one of the most beautiful valleys in western Montana. Current trends in agriculture have put farmers and ranchers in a difficult position. Montana farmers and ranchers have always been land rich and cash poor. In the case of this valley in Montana, this is the rule and not the exception. They live in an area that is being changed daily due to the number of summer home construction, because of the beauty and a temperate climate for Montana. 
The family farmers and ranchers in this area continue to face economic pressures from outside. Which has led to a number of folks packing up and subdividing their land for residential home sites. Those who have packed up and left the area, have taken their land and subdivided it for the residential development, removing the land from agricultural production. 
The subdivision of the land has a number of negative impacts on this valley and Montana and the Nation. The landscape is dotted with magnificent homes which impacts on the landscape and open spaces, and of course wildlife. Another of the major impacts sin on the local and state economies and governments. Agriculture land in Montana pays approximately $1.29 in property taxes for every dollar invested by the local government for services. Residential subdivisions only pay approximately $0.89 for every dollar they receive in local government services. 
Preservation of the small family farm and ranch in the Mission, Jocko and Camas valleys in Montana is dependent upon local control. As local control of the Flathead Irrigation Project will provide these hard working Americans an opportunity to control and have input on the costs associated with the operation of this vital water source. 
The local control of this project is supported by a wide cross section of Montanan's. Governor Marc Racicot, the Lake County Commissioners and local irrigation districts are among the local government officials in support of this bill. Organizations which have voiced their support for the measure include the Montana Stockgrowers Association, Montana Water Resources Association and the National Water Resources Association. The support of this measure in bipartisan in nature as well. 
Madam President. I am pleased to introduce this measure today, and I look forward to moving this bill forward through committee and to the floor in an attempt to give local control back to the people who depend on the Flathead Irrigation Project for their way of living.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to support my colleague from Michigan, Senator Abraham, in the introduction of the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997. This legislation will clarify a small provision of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, specifically section 110. Section 110 requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop, by September 30, 1998, an automated entry and exit control system to document the entry and departure of `every alien' arriving in and leaving the United States. 
This section, if not amended, would pose great hardship to Montana, and to most border States. The current procedure allows Canadians to cross the United States-Canadian border without requiring them to present a passport, visa, or border-crossing identification card. This assists our communities, on both sides of the border, to expand their economic growth. A large portion of our economic life is derived from the business we have that comes from Canada, whether it be from travel, tourism, or regular trade. The free flow of goods and services that are exchanged every day through the United States and Canada has provided both countries with enormous economic benefits. If not amended, this could drop dramatically. 
Congress did not intend to cause such a disruption of service when it passed the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Section 110 was principally designed to make the current entry-exist control system automated--so that the system would function better; it was not intended to expand documentary requirements and bureaucracy. This legislation will take the steps needed to insure that the law is read properly. This bill would require that the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop an automated entry-exit control system would not apply at the land borders, to U.S. lawful permanent residents or to any nationals of foreign contiguous territory from whom the Attorney General and the Secretary of State have already waived visa requirements. 
Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will review this bill and understand the merits that it provides, not only for our border States, but also for the Nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its swift passage.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of S. 224, to allow Medicare--eligible military retirees to join the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 1334, introduced by Senator Bond. S. 1334 will create a demonstration project to evaluate the concept of increasing access to health care for military retirees by allowing them to enroll in the Federal employees plan. 
After hearing from military retirees in Montana, I am convinced that FEHBP + 65, as it's called, is a necessary step to help ensure that military retirees have access to quality health care. When military retirees turn 65, they no longer have guaranteed access to health care. The lucky ones can get services from military treatment facilities [MTFs] on a space-available basis, but the rest do not have access to MTF's. They must rely on Medicare, which has less generous benefits and significant out-of-pocket costs, despite the commitment they received for lifetime health benefits by virtue of their service to this country. They are the only group of Federal employees to have their health benefits cut off at age 65. That just not right. 
The Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan is a popular program which provides good benefits at a reasonable cost. It will serve military retirees well and uphold the Government's commitment to provide quality health benefits. Our military retirees deserve no less.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, not to take away from the seriousness of the moment or the debate that we heard about the line-item veto and the debate we are hearing today, I will say about my chairman and ranking member of the full committee, since this circumstance has happened, it has sure picked up the most colorful debate in committees. That had been absent for quite a while. 
I want to congratulate my friend from West Virginia on laying out the situation as it really is. But we are here and we have to deal with the moment as it is, and given the President's desire to improve the quality of life for the men and women in uniform, and given the President's dedication to a balanced budget as reflected in the real world, and the real world is appropriations--that is where we actually spend the money. We can debate on the budget all we want to but accounting time is when we start appropriating dollars for the real world. 
The ranking member on military construction appropriations, Senator Murray, has worked hard with our colleagues in the House and also with the administration before we finally passed a conference report and sent it to the White House for the President's signature. We worked very hard to take out those items that would have been objectionable, and it reflected the intent of Congress, both through the budget statement and through the appropriations statement and the charge that was given us when appropriating the money. I believe we did a responsible job in working with everyone. 
Of course, of all the projects that are in this, we had to single out 38. Now we are offering some back. We have to remember that we are charged with covering the most basic defense requirements. After hearing from the military services, the Congress did add back $800 million to the President's budget, with the agreement from the President to fund those meritorious requirements that, as articulated to us, are essential to the services' operations. 
I guess since I've been working in this committee, we have tried to shift the focus in military construction to quality of life. We have a professional military now. It is not like it used to be. We have made those shifts primarily into the quality of life--the building of health care centers, the building of child care centers, new barracks for enlisted people--because everywhere that I have traveled, looked at our men and women in uniform, and especially with the rollbacks and 
the downsizing in the force structure, I am concerned, now more than ever, about the morale of our fighting men and women. 
I have visited the installations around the country. I have seen soldiers, marines, airmen and sailors sleeping on floors, airmen working in substandard facilities, and families forced to go on--would you believe it--on food stamps. They actually qualified for food stamps. 
Even though we have a professional military, we still ask them to defend our country on a moment's notice. I, for one, think they deserve better. That is why I question the veto of this President. I guess I'm even more familiar with the facilities in Montana. I had one of those lines that was vetoed, a dining facility at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, MT. I just wish the President had accepted my invitation to have lunch there. It didn't look much like the north side of the White House last night, I can tell you. He would see a facility that is in bad need of repair and renovation. I'm not real sure if the food preparation areas or where they serve the food would pass health inspection in the civilian sector. There is lack of ventilation and food storage space. It was an old commissary. The facility would sure flunk the most basic of all inspections. 
It is my strong view that the President used the line-item on this bill not as the Congress intended, or even his own stated intent. I would not feel so bad, I really wouldn't, had we gone over the budget agreement or had we gone over what we spent a year ago or even 2 years ago. The ranking member knows that we are almost $2 billion out of an $11 billion appropriation lower than we were 2 years ago in providing necessary items of need in the military construction for these projects. If we had gone over and had we just thrown money hand over fist and wasted it, I wouldn't feel bad about this line-item veto, but we did not do that. We did not approach this bill in that manner. We knew the line-item veto was out there. We knew that everything in this bill, No. 1, had to be authorized by the authorizers, and we knew the amount of money that we were expected to save in order to comply with the balanced budget and still get the job done for our military people. 
Every project on this list was carefully screened. It was authorized by the Armed Services Committee. It was included in the final Defense authorization conference for fiscal year 1998. Had we not gone through that process, had we not taken each item individually, had we not been sensitive to the need of our lifestyle and the quality of life, had we not done any of that--yet in consultation with the President and with the representatives of each one of the military services--had we not done that, I wouldn't feel so bad today. But we did that. We did it in the most conscientious way that we know, and that is human contact, actually talking to people through the whole process, keeping them informed about what was in there and what was not in there. 
Everybody was not happy with it, but it was a pretty big vote, 97-3. I think that is pretty overwhelming. It tells the story of the work that we did on this legislation. 
So I appreciate my ranking member and both sides of the aisle. I appreciate all the folks that worked on this piece of legislation. And, yes, I appreciate the people who represented the military services and the people who represented the White House as we were working on it. I appreciate them, too. But maybe some things I don't appreciate: Once you agree on something, then you walk away from it some 6 weeks later. That is not the way we do business in Montana, and I don't think that is the way we do business in Washington, Arizona, Georgia, or Kansas. 
I ask for your support on this. We will probably have more to say with regard to this piece of legislation. 
I yield the floor.

I think the Senator from Idaho has brought up a good point making the case for his facility because I think we found this throughout this whole message from the administration, that, again, they don't give us the criteria before we finally pass the conference report and send it down there. All at once, then the criteria change. I guess that should not surprise me. We ought to get used to dealing with folks who have goalposts on wheels; they sort of change every now and again. 
I hope we could make it through this thing and the Members realize that every project has been through the screens, two or three of them. The ranking member on this subcommittee, the chairman, and the ranking member of the full committee have set their satchel down, set certain standards, and we tried to meet those standards.

Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Disabled Sportsmen's Access Act. This legislation will provide new opportunities for sportsmen with disabilities to hunt and fish on the numerous Department of Defense facilities across this Nation. This legislation will also allow the Department of Defense to work with private sector groups to build facilities and operate programs for the benefit of sportsmen with disabilities. 
The beginnings of this legislation originate from a program developed at the Marine Corps Base at Quantico, VA. The program, run by Lt. Col. Lewis Deal, is a prime example of the work that can be done to provide new opportunities for people with disabilities. Lieutenant Colonel Deal has combined private sector volunteers work with donations from other people to build permanent disabled accessible blinds for deer hunting, which are used during both gun and bow seasons. These blinds provide people living with disabilities many of the same opportunities for outdoor recreation that we all enjoy. 
There are plans underway at this time to construct a fishing pier on the Potomac River for access by people with disabilities. This pier is to be built with lower railings, and stops to provide access and security for disabled persons. 
This legislation, uses the current program at Quantico, to allow the Department of the Defense to provide access to it's 30 million acres of wildlands by disabled individuals, as long as it does not interfere with the primary mission of the military, that of our Nation's defense. The military installations around the Nation offer a number of recreational and outdoor activities for both military and civilian personnel. 
This legislation, will encourage the Department of Defense to give access to individuals with disabilities and allow the Department to accept donations or money and materials as well as use volunteers for the construction of facilities accessible to sportsmen with disabilities. The bill would allow this voluntary work to be done without cost to the Federal Government or the taxpayer. 
Madam President, this legislation has the support of numerous organizations, including the bipartisan Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans. Among sportsmen's groups the bill has the endorsement of the Wheeling Sportsmen of America, Safari Club International, Wildlife Management Institute, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation. I join today with my friend Congressman Duke Cunningham to bring this important legislation to the attention of my colleagues. 
I hope that all my colleagues in Congress would join Congressman Cunningham and myself in supporting this legislation for disabled sportsmen in our country.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of William Kennard as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. 
Throughout the confirmation process, I have taken a particular interest in universal service. The ruling earlier this year by the FCC to structure a universal service fund from a 25-percent Federal contribution and a 75-percent State contribution has caused me a lot of concern, along with many of my colleagues from rural States. 
I do not believe that this ruling is consistent with the intent of Congress in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Such a rule could have severe impacts on Montana and other rural States that are asked to make this contribution. 
In the process of determining the attitudes of the nominees, I have heard statements about a reliance on the historical split between States and the Federal Government in the structure of this fund. However, in the case of Montana, which has not even had a universal service fund until it was enacted this year by the State legislature, we are on new territory, and history may be different from present circumstances. 
In rural States like Montana,the universal service fund is absolutely critical to the provision of basic telephone service. It should further be noted that maintaining the universal availability of telephone service at reasonable and affordable prices is not just a vague goal but an explicit statutory mandate. 
I ask how well has the FCC done in fulfilling this mandate? To answer this question, it is helpful to look at the record of the hearings which the Commerce Committee held in September 1993, on the nomination of Reed Hundt to be FCC Chairman. 
In response to a question which I posed on universal service, Mr. Hundt said--  
Universal service is, and should be, one of the paramount goals of the Government and specifically the FCC. 
Mr. Hundt also characterized the appropriate role of the FCC in response to another question. He said the FCC's mandate was, 
[T]o implement the will of Congress, as expressed in legislation, [and that] to that end, the Commission's policymaking activities should take into account incentives and disincentives for private investment in the network, and the creation and offering of service. 
Mr. President, after reviewing the activities of the FCC during the past 4 years, it is clear that Reed Hundt has been unable to fully carry out the promises which he made to this committee and to the Senate during his confirmation. I should also note that Mr. Kennard served as general counsel to the FCC during this time and bears substantial responsibility for its record. 
It should be clear from the record that by focusing on the expansion of the definition of universal service to include broad-ranging social programs, the FCC's progress toward maintaining universal service has been delayed. While such goals as providing internet access to schools and libraries may be laudable, they were never meant to be part of universal service as it has traditionally been known. Indeed, a huge additional burden has been placed on rural States such as mine, in Montana, in meeting these newfound definitions. The FCC has addressed those goals in a fashion which many believe is detrimental to maintaining universal telephone service--which is so important to me and other Members of rural States. 
As I have noted before, there are some 55 million Americans who live outside metropolitan areas today--which is about the same as the total population of Great Britain, Italy, or France. The largest single element of the U.S. population today is Americans aged 50 or older--a group that represents almost 40 percent of the total population. Ensuring that these people have access to affordable, quality telephone service is especially important to all of us. 
Coming from Montana, I have an appreciation for the unique character and the difficulties of rural life. In a State with 148,000 square miles and only about 850,000 people, we do not always have the luxury of face-to-face communication that people have in highly populated areas, nor do we have the ability to shoulder the disproportionate burden that would be placed on us by taking on 75 percent of the cost of universal service. It is the people of States like mine for whom universal service is intended, and I do not want to see it dismantled. 
In view of all of these facts, I must oppose Mr. Kennard's nomination.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this week one of the most important events since the end of World War II will take place here in Washington. It is the State visit of the National Leader of the Peoples Republic of China. The future of United States-China relations will somewhat be forged on the occasion of the visit of the President of People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin. This summit will, hopefully, define our challenges and opportunities and could and should serve as a model for future discussions for both nations. 
Let me say that I continue to be disturbed by some of the actions embarked upon by the PRC. The militaristic actions toward Taiwan, the sale of weapons to Iran, Pakistan, Syria, and other nations, and the internal human rights violations that continue to occur to name the main ones. 
However, policy of isolation has never proven successful in international relations. In fact, a detriment to all this nation has to offer and the very doctrines we abide by and stand for. 
An example: I have not been totally convinced the need for the expansion of NATO--I can hear it now--what does China and NATO have to do with one another and it there a relationship. 
Well, as a Western State Senator, I have a tendency to view our foreign policy from the Pacific, rather than the Atlantic. In my opinion, looking from the standpoint of NATO, Europe, Russia continues to have difficulties with the fact that NATO enlargement is under consideration. Russia is a cash poor nation with an overabundance of military weapons, a silent industry base, and a unmanageable bureaucracy. On the other hand, the PRC, their neighbor, is a cash rich nation searching for ways to expand investments throughout the world. 
For the moment China, has not been allowed access to Western military technology. The West has not allowed and for good reason. I wholly agree with a nonaccess policy given obvious actions taken by the PRC. 
Therefore, China's defense industry does not have the command, control, computer, and communication systems, known collectively as `C4'. 
Even with these limitations, China continues its work on advanced cruise missiles, a satellite positioning system, and airborne early-warning radar. 
To facilitate this continued work, China's government has now turned to Russia as the best available source of military foreign technology from foreign sources. 
It has brought 72 SU-27 fighters--and plans to build more under license--as well as Russian kilo submarines. There is good news. With a limited procurement budget, it cannot splash out on imports. The only good news is that Russia is still unwilling to sell China its best equipment. 
From these facts, one is able to determine that a China that is alienated by the United States will continue to invest their funds for modern military technology wherever, even with their neighbor, and possible ally, Russia to `divide and conquer' any perceived threats to their borders, whether it be their Eastern or Western border. 
However, if the United States commits to an open dialog--tries in the most earnest way to work out the differences that exist, it is my hope the PRC will become an integrated member of the international community and begin to act as responsible member of that community. This can only further peace and stability for both nations and the world. 
Besides its recent economic advancements, it is incumbent that the United States have a constructive working relationship with China. The reasons are obvious: 
The People's Republic of China [PRC] plays a major role in the post-cold-war world; 
It is the world's most populous nation, about 1.2 billion people, and the third-largest in land mass after Russia and Canada; 
It has nuclear weapons, is a growing military power, and plays a key role in regional stability while emerging as a regional leader in Asia; and 
As one of the five permanent Members of the U.N. Security Council, China has veto power over security council resolutions dealing with key multilateral issues, including international peacekeeping and the resolution of regional conflicts. 
Finally, Mr. President, the upcoming summit is an important opportunity to address many issues that will be of importance to all Americans especially 
Mountains. Agriculture cannot be left out in these discussions. 
Our Nation was founded on hard work, innovative technologies in agricultural production. U.S. farmer and ranchers have supplied our Nation and the world with clean, safe and affordable food since our humble beginnings. 
We are a leader in agriculture exports. This fact is sometimes transparent in the eyes of those who would rather consider the United States as a nation of fiber optics rather than food and fiber. But, I say we can do both. 
In 1996, China's farmers produced a bumper wheat crop. That along with a dispute over unfounded accusations and over reaction over alleged infected wheat contributed to a severe decrease in the United States grain exports to China. 
China's ban on United States imports of wheat is based on scientifically unfounded trade evidence linked to insignificant disease commonly known as tck smut. This diseases is present in Canada, as well as Europe. Such barriers-to-entry are and will be a barrier to China's entry into the WTO. 
We've seen this type of attack on U.S. agriculture before. Recently, the European Union objected to United States beef imports based on scientifically unfounded evidence; eventually, the United States prevailed in a WTO challenge but not before the United States cattle industry was damaged and European markets found their beef exports elsewhere. 
Mr. President, U.S. farmers and ranchers produce the healthiest and best food commodities in the world. If we are truly supposed to be a global economy, we need to put our great American agriculture on an equal basis with semiconductors and automobiles. Agriculture has always been dealt away first in all of the trade agreements in the last 50 years. It is not fair or right that the great machine of food and fiber production be left picking up the scraps. 
I think that the United States is following the same course as our relations with Russia in the late 1980's. An establishment of ties with China does not necessarily imply an endorsement of their policies. I believe that the freedom that the United States embraces can only serve as an example to the Chinese people. The summits between President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev brought about the fall of the Berlin wall--there were naysayers then so maybe the talks that the we begin now, will lead to the opening of the Great Wall of China.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, I rise today to pay tribute to our Nation's veterans, their families, and to those who died in defense of our great land. 
On November 11, 1997, we will again pay tribute to our Nation's veterans. There will be parades, ceremonies, and in my home State of Montana, where I served as Yellowstone County commissioner, a dedication of a veterans wall will take place in Billings. 
One must stop and wonder on Veterans Day 1997, if our Government is doing all we can for our country's veterans. For the many men and women who rely on Uncle Sam to provide the benefits they earned by putting their lives on the line, the answer is a resounding `No.' We must do more to ensure that veterans and their families are looked after and afforded every opportunity to receive the health care and the benefits they so rightly deserve. The veteran stepped forward when the Nation called; it is time the Government stepped up to the plate and delivered the benefits the veterans deserve. 
Today, I would like to say `thank you' to the veterans for the sacrifices you made defending our country. Thank you for the time you spent away from your home and families to heed the call of our great Nation. 
Mr. President, we must never forget those brave men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives for the United States of America. 
As the saying goes, `If you love your freedom, thank a vet.' I urge our Nation to reach out and shake the hand of a veteran today and say `thank you' for a job well done.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on the issue of campaign reform, the words I speak here might not climb to the intellectual level of constitutional dialog as others who are more versed in the subject. I don't think it has to go that high. I think the simpler we keep it, the easier it will be for the American people to understand what we are trying to do. 
I want to premise this by saying that I believe, and strongly believe, in four basic principles: 
We should abide by current law. 
We should have full and timely disclosure. 
All contributions to campaigns must be voluntary contributions. 
And, yes, we have to abide by the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 
Through this debate, a debate, I might add, whose time has come, a lot will be said of the good and not so good points of the pending legislation, which, basically, right now is the new McCain-Feingold legislation. It does address some of the concerns that I have had from the beginning. However, I am still bewildered by one basic question in this whole process that we have been through since Christmas a year ago: Why is it, no matter what law we have, that it has become common practice to ignore the law? 
I suggest to my colleagues, after all is said and done--and maybe more will be said than done--but to change our existing campaign finance law, one important question remains to be answered: Why do we reform or rewrite? Why don't we just abide by current law? 
It is only logical to me that the best campaign reform is to enforce current law. If one or a series of campaign laws have been broken, it is clear to me that the enforcement of such laws should take center stage in every case. Indicting the breakers of the law, the alleged violators, would do more to reform campaign finance practices than any proposed legislation that we could ever pass through this body. 
Think about that a little bit. Indicting the alleged violators of present law to make them stand for their practices would do more than any reform we could do for campaign practices that is before us today. It is very simple. 
Volume 18, United States Code, section 607 clearly prohibits soliciting and receiving contributions in a Federal building. I quote:  
It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or receive any contribution in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties. 
No one has ever been prosecuted under this statute. 
To reiterate what many others have stated as a matter of fact, in the 1996 election cycle, that law was allegedly broken. In fact, Mr. President, it was clearly established during Senator Thompson's hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee that that was the case. The offending parties have not been brought to the altar of justice. Yet, the alleged violators contend that they have sent millions of dollars back to their original donors after the election. 
What does that say? What does that tell us? How is it that we, as a nation, became a nation where we do not enforce the law? It seems that a patrolman in Montana today was in town enforcing the law. What is the difference? 
It plainly states--and I quote--`any person who violates this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.' 
Now, if it has been broken, it should be enforced. If we would enforce the law, if we would indict the alleged violators, arrest, present them to a judge and a jury, I think that would do more than anything we can do in changing the law before us. 
You know, Mr. President, I spent a long time refereeing football. We are in football season. It catches everybody's imagination--the Super Bowl, everything. I am wondering why that game can hold the order that it does. 
Let me tell you, I thought about that a long time. In order to capture the imagination of the American people, there has to be some order to it, it has to be competitive, it has to be fair. 
So the first thing that happens is there is only one rule book. The rules for high school or college or professional football is the same in Kentucky as it is in California as it is in Colorado--one federation. 
And why is it on Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon four old men in striped shirts can go down on a field of 22 of the most mobile, hostile, heavily armored people intent on doing each other in and they have very few problems? No. 1, the rules are enforced on both sides of the ball. And, No. 2, that old man in a striped shirt is the arresting officer, he is the judge and the jury, he is the penal officer, and he does it all in 30 seconds. 
A young man can haul off and slug his opponent. The referee sees it, throws the flag. That is the arrest. The judge and jury--you are guilty. `So, 15 yards against your team and, you, young man, are out of the football game.' He can say, `I come from a broken family.' It doesn't say anything in that rule book about that. The rule book says, `Thou shalt not hit thy opponent with the open hand. If thou doest, your team will be penalized 15 yards and you will get to watch the rest of the football game.' It does not make any difference who you are, what you are; you are out of there. 
So everybody understands the rules, everybody understands the penalties. It is all done in 30 seconds. And they are enforced immediately. And after an hour of play on the field, we have very few problems. 
What are we missing in real life when we start talking about that? No doubt that the White House made phone calls from the White House. They claim the law doesn't apply to them. It has never been tested in court. Somebody has to file charges. 
Here in the Senate there is one simple rule, one simple rule here in the U.S. Senate: Do not make fundraising calls from your office. It is not acceptable in any form, not by phone, not in person, not in letters, and not by hosting events. And basically common sense would tell you, do not put the taxpayers' property at the disposal of your campaign. 
We keep hearing about that we need to change the laws. What I am saying here basically is, just obey the laws we have now. We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that 938 people stayed overnight in the White House between 1992 and 1996 and they raised over $10 million, and that 103 coffees raised $26 million over 18 months. All of these activities are clearly established by the hearings. The law is very clear. To misunderstand or to refer to loopholes, I think, is just absurd. 
To comment on the newly revised McCain-Feingold 
legislation, I am pleased to see that some of those steps have been made in the right direction on this piece of legislation. The authors certainly have improved it from its original version. Unfortunately, however, it is not in a comprehensive form. 
That is why I commend the leader for what he has done because a major tenet to campaign finance reform should be that all Montanans, all Americans, who desire to give money or to participate in any way in a political campaign, do it voluntary. That is all we are asking. I do not want anybody to tell me where I have to give my money. If you do not want to contribute, you should not have to. 
No one should be forced to do that, no political party, nobody, whatever, no organization should have the power to collect dues or any other form of payment for political uses without receiving consent. 
The McCain-Feingold bill contains the Beck language, but that leaves a lot to be desired. And in some cases it is not as fair as it could be or should be. It allows union members to receive a refund upon request. But that union member must give up his union privileges at that moment. You are not allowed both. You cannot choose whether or not to make political contributions and still be a member of the organization. 
So the Paycheck Protection Act is not a poison pill. It is a right. It is a basic right. It is a basic right for every man and woman and child in this country, whether to give funds or your services or your labors for a candidate, for a political party, or a ballot issue. It makes no difference. You should do it voluntarily. It is just a basic American freedom. 
So this provision, the Paycheck Protection Act, I think we can all agree on that, that all contributions should be voluntary. That is the reason that is important, for no one person, no one group, no association should be able to spend your hard-earned dollars without your consent. 
There are troubling provisions. They still remain in this legislation. Clearly, as it exists today, it runs afoul of the first amendment. That has been already taken to a plain that I am sorry I cannot attain. 
Political spending is equated with speech. The courts are clear and consistent on that point. We cannot say, on the one hand, we are protecting speech and, on the other hand, restrict the means by which that speech is carried out. 
Under the revised bill, corporations and other organizations would be prohibited year-round from issuing communications to the public that fall under the bill's much broader definition of `express advocacy,' which includes `words that in context can have no reasonable meaning other than to advocate the election or defeat of 1 or more clearly identified candidates' or `expressing unmistakable and unambiguous support for or opposition to 1 or more clearly identified candidates when taken as a whole and with limited reference to external events, such as proximity to an election.' 
With respect to that restriction, it is my belief it would not withstand constitutional scrutiny. The Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo--that is all going to be talked about--in striking down the $1,000 limit on independent expenditures enacted by Congress in 1974 as a violation of the first amendment, noted that such limitation `would appear to exclude all citizens and groups except candidates, political parties, and institutional press from any significant use of the most effective modes of communication.' In other words, we don't want to take away the power of the people and place it in the hands of politicians, the Government and the press. 
So I suggest to my colleagues there is an answer and it is a better answer. It is simple, it is understandable, easily complied with, even easier to monitor--full and timely disclosure. Full and timely disclosure should be the core, the core of all finance practices. We always thought we need to enhance public disclosure measures that will allow the voters to know where every single penny comes from and where every single penny is spent, no matter what the organization. 
You want to do something about soft money? I will tell you how to do away with soft money, just report it. This would give a full picture of the situation and allow the Sun to shine in the dark corners of the current campaign practices. 
Mr. President, let me end by saying we are getting closer to the reform package. Some of the changes, visions, are true steps in the right direction. I support Senator Lott's amendment. It is a good and necessary addition to this legislation. We should take a look at soft money and where it goes and how it is raised. The only way you do away with soft money is that everybody files, everybody reports, because you have to remember it didn't start just last week. I think there was a little failure to disclose in October of 1996, and before this discussion is all over, I am going to give this Senate an opportunity to vote on a little amendment that may put some teeth in that. They are not going to like the teeth. But I guarantee you they will file. They will file their FEC report, and that is what has to happen. 
We all look at ourselves here as being part of this reform package. There are other things and other people that are also involved that will be affected by this. So before it is all over, we will see how far they really want to go in campaign finance reform, on what is right and wrong. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the NASA authorization bill for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, introduced by Senator Frist, chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space and Senator Rockefeller, the ranking minority member. I would like to take this opportunity to thank both Senator Frist and Senator Rockefeller for helping to craft a bipartisan bill which balances the goals and missions of our space agency within fiscal responsibility. 
This bill authorizes the full $1.4 billion requested by NASA for Mission to Planet Earth. As many of you know, I'm a strong supporter of this program because it is about using satellite technology to help average citizens in their everyday activities. The goal of this program is to provide farmers, land planners, foresters, scientists and others with cost-effective tools to help them do their work. This program provides the scientific foundation for weather forecasting on a year-to-year basis, land-use management, and to protect people, property, and the environment from natural disasters. To accomplish this goal, Mission to Planet Earth supports scientists in Montana and in other U.S. States, to carry out the experiments necessary to expand our frontier of understanding Earth. 
This bill also provides authorization for $10 million for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCoR] Program. This funding will allow NASA to carry out a new competition to help NASA develop a stronger presence in the vital academic research programs in institutions in rural States like Montana. 
Finally, I would like to note that the bill contains a new provision, section 317, which provides insurance, indemnification and liability for coverage for the X-33 and X-34 experimental aerospace vehicle tests. It draws upon provisions in the Space Act as well as the commercial Space Launch Act to provide the necessary coverage to continue innovative research and technology development in aerospace. It also provides the infrastructure needed to allow NASA to work with industry to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The X-33 program partners NASA with industry to develop a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle. The goal is to decrease the cost of getting to space while making it safer and more accessible. I'm proud that Montana is part of this program. Malmstrom Air Force Base near Great Falls has been selected as one of the preferred landing sites for the X-33 prototype. Landing at Malmstrom will be the longest flight for this 136-ton wedge-shaped prototype. Knowledge from these tests will be used to create the next generation launch vehicle. 
I believe that we have a bill that provides NASA with the funding authorization and policy direction it will need to maintain our world leadership in space and aeronautics.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about some oversight hearings that have been going on here in the Senate. Also, I hope that the American people are seeing some things happen now that should have happened a long time ago. It wasn't very long ago that the suggestion was made to the Senate that we should go to a 2-year appropriation and a 2-year budget, because it seems like the time is eaten up here in the first part of the year to deal with budget and budget reconciliation, which is very, very important, and then the next part is taken up with the appropriations process. 
I have contended all along that our role here is not only to deal with budgets and appropriations, but to also deal with legislation and reform that, in some areas, is needed to stay up with the times, and also in the area of oversight. We have absolutely taken and extended the work day, more or less, to accommodate oversight. I think what the American people are seeing now is the result of that, as there are many hearings going on not only in Energy, but Governmental Affairs and, of course, in the Finance Committee. I want to compliment the chairman of the Finance Committee for this oversight hearing on the IRS. 
It is something that has been ongoing out there, I think, since probably we started this business of tax collection. Maybe there is no right way to collect taxes. I don't know that for sure. Even some activities and actions taken by the Congress have made their job a little more complicated, and maybe in some cases a little bit tough. But it does not give the IRS the right to do this job in the way that has been enlightened for us through these hearings of oversight of the IRS. It has shown a lack of compassion--exhibited by IRS employees beyond my comprehension, and I think beyond the comprehension of those in this country, and I imagine those people who have been watching those hearings. Yes. It happened to me too. Because we maybe are just talking about the tip of the iceberg. 
But some abusive IRS employees have expanded their scope of enforcement activities to include business men and women who are just trying to make a living; trying to stay in compliance with all Federal, State, and local revenue collecting and regulating laws. 
At the source of this evil we can level our sights in on some mismanagement by some IRS employees. IRS management needs to recognize that they have a difficult job promoting customer service as an IRS attribute. It is not an easy task considering the historic attitude toward not the IRS, but taxes. The founding of this great Nation and history tells us that it kind of started with the Boston Tea Party--a revolt against the tyrannical rule of unfair taxation. 
Taxes are a necessary evil. But if kept in check, it is important at all levels of government. It is a must. Taxes have created the world's greatest highway infrastructure, contributed to the protection of our borders, and has created the most successful democratic government in history. But waste and abuse of those dollars have burdened the American taxpayer with one of the highest levels of taxation in the history of this country. 
Tax collecting needs to reflect its controversial history. The IRS does not have the right to use harassment, and, yes--as has been brought out in these hearings--even extortion as a method of collecting taxes. 
Major changes are overdue. The IRS needs to improve its education and services to taxpayers. Taxpayers must have, at least, a comfort level when they approach the IRS for help so that they feel with some degree of reliability that the IRS will be sensitive to their needs and to their questions. 
We need to modernize the computers. Let's face it, the IRS can't do that. They spent some $5 billion to buy new computers. They don't work. They have never worked. We tried to simplify things. What do we do? We made them more complicated. 
So the general public loses its confidence to go to the IRS and ask questions that they will get answers for; so that they will try to do the right thing for the right reason. 
I think this is a very serious wake-up call to the IRS. Customer service will never be considered as one of their great attributes. But that is what IRS needs to pound into their employees: We work for the American public; it does not work for us. We are a service organization. We try to accommodate folks trying to get through a very difficult situation, a situation that some do not understand. 
Perhaps some of that blame lies with Congress. This is not the first time Congress has held oversight hearings. The IRS has a littered history of abuse, and, yes--I hate to say--even a little corruption. 
I think these hearings may pave the way for Senator Domenici's 2-year budget appropriations bill. I think that will lend credence to it. And Congress could spend more than 1 year on budgetary and spending matters and another year on tough-minded oversight of Government agencies, and maybe the future of such abuse can be averted. But it just does not happen in the IRS. We have other 
agencies in this Government that are just as abusive. 
I have contacted numerous of Montana constituents hearing complaints about the IRS. And I will tell my Senators beware. With these hearings I think our casework is going to go up a little bit. 
During the length of the bureaucratic process, debts grow fantastically high with interest and penalties. 
But I have been contacted by a few taxpayers in Montana that have similar stories as those that we heard about this week during these Finance Committee hearings. In one of those cases a Montana constituent had a pending case with the IRS that still today is unresolved. The small business was audited in the 1980's. And every time there was an offer, or attempt to make settlement, the IRS denies the offer, and the interest and the penalties continue to compound. In the meantime, he has been forced to sell all of his assets. He has lost everything that he has worked his whole life for, and is now facing retirement with only his residence and darned little capital. Even if the IRS could accept his recent offer he would be left with a mortgage that he will not be able to pay off in his lifetime. 
So as a result of these hearings we can certainly expect to hear from more constituents who realize that they are not the problem; that this problem goes way beyond them as individuals, and the problem goes way beyond them as a nation. 
Prior to the August recess Congress passed the Tax Relief Act of 1997. The 105th Congress has the opportunity not only to reduce the tax burden on the American public but also simplify a system that is badly in need of reform. A far less complicated tax system may help to clear up some of the IRS abuses. But simplifying the tax system, one can only think, would simplify our revenue collection system. 
I realize that tax collection is a thankless job. There are employees of the IRS that try to do a good job. I happen to know a few of those. They do a good job, and they do it with pride. I commend them for not letting the arrogance, uncaring attitude that we have seen emerge out of the hearings earlier this week pollute their work ethic. I want to compliment those folks who do a good job. 
Tax collectors have a long history of public persecution. Today my colleagues and I stand here not to tar and feather the tax collector, but to put an end to the abusive culture that has crept into the agency--this business of a situation arising and becoming a personal thing. So when they personalize things then it becomes `me against you, and I have the power of the U.S. Government to destroy you.' When they personalize things, that is when they get out of hand. 
I ask the American public, if we, who are elected, when we debate personalize everything, nobody would speak to anybody around here. Nobody. We have to bring that back into our service organizations. Basically the IRS is a service organization. They must accommodate. They must feel some compassion. And they must try to help people out of this almost bottomless abyss of trying to do the right thing for the right reason. We cannot let this abusive culture spread like a bacteria through an agency and let it live. We just cannot do that. 
Again, I say to my colleagues, rethink your position on a 2-year budget and 2-year appropriations because with all the hearings, as controversial as they may be in an open and free Government, oversight is still the best way to put problems on the table and deal with them. It is the only way in a free self-government that people can deal with them. 
I thank our secretary of the conference for setting this time aside to bring this about. And to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for this oversight because I think he has done a great service for the American people. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to add my name to the list of cosponsors of S. 1133, the Parent and Student Savings Account PLUS Act, introduced by Senator Coverdell, and ask unanimous consent that my name be added. This bill will allow families to invest in education savings accounts, or A-Plus accounts, for their kids' K through 12 expenses. 
Mr. President, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 provides several education-related tax provisions for students and their families. Yet these provisions are mainly aimed at making higher education more affordable. While I am all for student loan interest deductions and tax credits for 2- and 4-year degrees, K through 12 education is not cheap either, and families could greatly benefit by saving up through A-Plus accounts. But for a last minute veto threat of the entire balanced budget act, families would have the option of savings accounts for their kids' future. 
Why are education savings accounts a good idea? For the same reason tax credits for college expenses are a good idea: They help families afford a quality education for their kids. These A-Plus accounts can be used for public, private, and home schooling education expenses. Qualified expenses include tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs services, books, supplies, equipment, and transportation. This will mean a lot to hard-working families trying to make ends meet. 
Opponents like to equate education savings accounts with vouchers, and they consistently use the terms interchangeably as if they are one and the same. This is a red herring. Unlike vouchers, education savings accounts would not redirect State or local funds otherwise available for public education. To the contrary, I believe public school students will greatly benefit by saving money for general school expenses. And from what I'm hearing, families across the country agree with me. Let me reiterate: We are talking here about using one's own hard-earned money for education expenses, not diverting public funds that would otherwise be spent on public schools. 
Now, I do not support the use of vouchers in Montana because I believe they would disrupt public school financing and the costs to our public schools would outweigh the benefits to our students. But this is a separate issue, and one better left to the Montana Legislature. 
Opponents have also claimed that education savings accounts would violate the establishment clause of the Constitution because Federal dollars would indirectly benefit religious schools. I'll simply respond by saying that under that reasoning, any federal financial aid to students attending Marquette, Georgetown, or Brigham Young would also violate the Constitution. We all know that is not the case. 
Although we were blocked from including education savings accounts in the Taxpayer Relief Act, thanks to the efforts of Senator Coverdell we will have another chance to send this bill to the President. At that time we will have the chance to show our support for America's families by making education more affordable.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Employee Information Protection Act of 1997. This bill will correct a serious problem with the 1996 welfare reform law that threatens the privacy of every American. 
I do not know how many of my colleagues are aware of the fact that the new welfare reform law created a national new hire directory, which requires States to collect the name, address, and Social Security number of all newly hired employees and send this information to Washington, DC. This new hire directory will be housed at the Social Security Administration, under agreement with the Office of Child Support Enforcement, and the data will be checked against a registry of child support cases to detect overdue payments. 
Concerns with this new hire directory nearly killed the welfare reform bill in the Montana Legislature and in several other State legislatures, but folks inside the Beltway do not seem too concerned. But I am concerned, and I will tell you why. 
I am all for tracking down deadbeat parents and recovering overdue child support. But this new directory covers every new hire in every State and does not distinguish between deadbeats and nondeadbeats. What's more, the new law puts no limits on how long employee data may remain in the national new hire directory, and the Office of Child Support Enforcement has not developed any limits. It is especially alarming to me that in addition to the Office of Child Support Enforcement and the Social Security Administration, the Treasury Department has access to the directory and the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the discretion to provide researchers access to the directory. With the revelations this week at the Finance Committee hearings of abuse of taxpayer information at the IRS, it is urgent that we take measures to protect personal information from abuse. 
The Employee Information Protection Act is simple--in fact it is only one sentence long, not counting the findings. That sentence reads: `Information entered into such database shall be deleted 6 months after the date of entry.' That is it. This 6-month limit on retention of new hire data would give the Child Support Office sufficient time to check employee data against the child support case registry and start collection efforts on the deadbeats. At the same time, it will provide some protection for the personal information of the vast majority of Americans who do not owe child support. 
I urge my colleagues to take a good look at this situation and if you have concerns as I do, join me in sponsoring the Employee Information Protection Act of 1997. I ask unanimous consent that Monday's New York Times article on the new hire directory be inserted into the Record.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the KSEN radio station in Shelby, MT, for 50 years of service to the Golden Triangle area in north central Montana. 
As a former broadcaster, I applaud KSEN for the valuable service they provide to the Shelby area, especially to the agricultural community. KSEN works hard to provide the area with farm and market reports, weather, local news, and sports broadcasting as well as national programs. KSEN radio is a very important tool for the area's farmers and ranchers. 
KSEN radio has won more broadcasting awards than any other station in Montana and is the smallest market in the United States to receive the Crystal Award from the National Association of Broadcasters for its outstanding public service. 
Congratulations to Mr. Jerry Black and the staff at KSEN radio in Shelby, MT, for a fabulous 50 years of service to our great State.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleague Senator Gorton for the position he has taken in this Interior appropriations bill on the proposed buy-out of the Crown Butte mine in my State of Montana. I am very supportive of the position and the language he has in this bill to address a very complicated and unfortunate issue. 
A little over a year ago, while on vacation in Yellowstone National Park, the President took an action that still has me shaking my head. Using an administrative decision, the President circumvented the process that Congress enacted to provide for the protection of our natural resources in this country. The National Environmental Protection Act [NEPA] was designed to provide an indepth analysis prior to any action taking place on public lands throughout the Nation. The effect of this analysis is to make sure that any project being contemplated is safe for the public and takes into account the welfare of the natural resources. 
This administrative action which the President took, provides for a cash buy-out of the Crown Butte mine and entirely circumvented the NEPA process. The State of Montana, the mining company, and others had spent unlimited amounts of time and a great deal of money to go through the NEPA process. However, this work was completely undone by the actions of the President and the Council on Environmental Quality. With the NEPA process eliminated, to this day we still do not know what the results of the environmental impact statement would have been. The administration, overrode good, sound, scientific processes for a policy based on a feel good mentality. 
During the past year, several attempts have been made to come up with either property or money to fulfill the commitment made by this administration to the mining company. The first of these attempts, the Montana initiative, a plan which the State of Montana developed with the approval of the White House and would have swapped property in Montana for the Crown Butte property also located in Montana. This attempt failed, which would have provided compensation to the State of Montana for lost revenue, when the administration failed to bring the parties to the table to complete the negotiations. Later in the year, the Council on Environmental Quality decided they could take funds from one of the most successful environmental programs, the Conservation Reserve Program, to pay off the company. This, of course, proved unacceptable to numerous Members of Congress, the farmers of this Nation and several conservation and wildlife organizations. The administration's attempts to complete this deal have shown little regard for the public and their involvement in the process. 
Finally, as congressional leadership and the administration negotiated the Balanced Budget Act, an outline for coming up with funding was completed. I reiterate here, that this was just an outline, not an agreement for specific projects. This agreement provided for $700 million to be placed into the Land and Water Conservation Fund [LWCF], for priority land acquisitions. No specific projects were detailed in this agreement. Senator Domenici, who assisted in the negotiations as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, came to the floor earlier this week to spell out what exactly was detailed in the agreement reached in the Balanced Budget Act. Senator Domenici read from the agreement which proves that no specific projects were included in the agreement. 
The Chairman of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee was then placed in a position of deciding exactly how those funds would be expended. I congratulate the Chairman for the work that he did to come up with a reasonable approach to this issue. In dealing with this expenditure of funds, the Chairman has placed Congress back into the loop where they belong. The language in this bill provides that the funds will be set aside until Congress has the opportunity to authorize the spending on particular projects. Congress has a responsibility to the public to review any and all expenditures of this magnitude. I have been elected to address the concerns of all the people including the citizens of Montana who have been ignored by this Presidential directive. In this particular arrangement, the administration seemed to have overlooked one very important and vital person in this whole scenario. Ms. Margaret Reeb, the owner of the property on which the mine itself would have been located. 
What the chairman has done with this language is provide Ms. Reeb, Park County, and the State of Montana a chance to voice their concerns with the administrative action he has taken. They are the biggest losers in the action proposed by the President. In the case of Ms. Reeb, the property owner, her private property rights have been violated, as well as has her devotion to the heritage from which she came. As for the State of Montana and Park County, well in an area where mining provides some of the best paying jobs in the State, income and economic development have been thwarted without even the slightest consideration provided for this loss. 
Mr. President, I commend the chairman for the work and the position he has taken on this issue. He has shown great insight and provided leadership in the development of a solution that will provide Margaret Reeb and others an opportunity to voice their say on this matter. I thank the chairman and appreciate his hard work.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I do not think there is a Senator in this body who is not sensitive to families, is not sensitive to the working men and women of this country. 
Who do you think is employed by the mines? Do we just disregard the job opportunities? Do we deny America of a resource that is used in just about everything that we pick up, from pencils to what we tie our shoes with? Doesn't that involve families, children, and schools, and roads, 
and public safety? It is a resource. Families and people are involved. 
There is a basic fairness here. There is a human factor. All of this just doesn't jump out of the ground into the truck and then a faceless person drives a truck and a faceless person goes home to feed his family and pay his taxes, payroll taxes, insurance, workmen's comp. All of this is created out of commercial activity. 
Now, if none of that is there, then you have even taken away the opportunity for upward mobility for the greatest number of people in this country. 
There is not anybody here that is not sensitive to people and to the working men and women of this country or to families or even communities and all it takes to operate the communities, because to many of them, this is a commercial opportunity. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. I make that request because we are going to go over the time when we are supposed to be back on that amendment. 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the amendment from the junior senator from Nevada. I urge my colleagues to oppose a drastically reduced forest road budget, an end of purchaser road credits, and a change in the county payments formula. This amendment is unworkable and unnecessary in the face of a road construction budget that is already declining. 
The amendment offered by Senator Bryan would reduce the proposed budget for new timber road construction by $10 million. This amendment does nothing more than carry out the extreme agenda of certain radical environmental groups. As they have acknowledged, their objective is to shut down the Forest Service Timber Program. 
Mr. President, Forest Service timber sales are sold using an open, competitive auction system process. All sales are sold at fair market value, with costs associated with the timber sales, including road work, apportioned and built into a minimum bid price, which sets the floor. There is no subsidy associated with timber sales or road construction. 
According to a recent economic analysis released by the Price Waterhouse accounting firm, `the forest roads program does not contain a subsidy for timber purchasers--it provides an efficient and effective mechanism for financing road construction and reconstruction.' 
Owners of private lands often provide access to their lands to purchasers of their timber. They can either construct the roads themselves and then charge more for the timber, or they can require the timber purchaser to construct roads and thereby receive less money for their timber. Landowners who require the timber purchaser to construct roads have developed many systems to compensate the purchaser for road construction activities. 
Purchaser road credits are a fairly common method for building roads. Many private landowners, as well as the State forestry agencies of Idaho and Oregon, have similar systems to build roads on their lands. No matter which system is chosen, the value of the timber sold will be reduced by the cost incurred by the purchasing party. 
The Bryan amendment, however, calls for the elimination of the Forest Service purchaser road credits program. Eliminating purchaser road credits would have serious implications. 
Under the purchaser credit program, timber sale contracts require the purchaser to reconstruct or construct roads and bridges. Purchaser credit is an off-budget means for the Forest Service to rebuild and repair 
existing roads and occasionally to build new roads at a significant savings to the taxpayer when compared with appropriated funds. 
There are many costs associated with the purchase and harvest of a timber sale, including bonding, road construction, road maintenance, logging, and trucking. When a company analyzes what it can bid for a particular timber sale, it considers all the costs and values associated with manufacturing forest products from the trees to be purchased. If the company is given credits for the road work, the bids will be higher because it is not a cost. 
As with the regular forest road program which uses appropriated funds, the purchaser road credit program primarily supports the reconstruction of existing roads. Of the total number of miles of the timber sales roads built or rebuilt nationwide in fiscal year 1995, about 90 percent were done with purchaser road credits. 
As funds for road construction have been reduced in recent years, purchaser credit has become a vital tool to accomplish road work in all regions of the country, especially reconstruction. About 80 percent of the program used each year for reconstruction on roads, especially for safety and environmental improvements. Congress and the administration must reject all efforts to eliminate or reduce purchaser road credits. 
Mr. President, Federal timber sales have declined precipitously, primarily from limitations placed on the Forest Service by environmental considerations and species protection efforts for spotted owls, marbled murrelets, and various species of salmon. In 1987, the timber sales program provided nearly 12 billion board feet of timber. Ten years later, less than 4 billion board feet were sold. 
It does not take rocket science to understand the dangerous consequences the Bryan amendment has for local communities. Small businesses account for two-thirds of all timber harvested in national forests. Those small operations are located in the rural areas, providing jobs and stability to their communities. 
The Bryan amendment would dramatically limit the forest road program, putting additional pressures on the timber sale program. Most supporters of the Bryan amendment are unaware that the Forest Service will spend many times more on reconstruction and repair of existing roads as they will on the construction of new forest roads. 
Most of the roads in the national forests are single-lane, dirt roads which are open to all forest users. Each year these roads allow millions of Americans to visit the national forests. Access is provided to wild and scenic rivers, national scenic byways, wilderness areas, and 
recreational facilities, including campgrounds, boat ramps, and picnic areas. These roads provide access for cutting firewood and Christmas trees, berry picking, hunting, fishing, and camping. 
The primary use of the national forest road system is recreation. All told, about 97 percent of the road system in any given national forest is open to recreational use. Ten years ago, recreation use on the national forests was less than 250 million visits. Today, recreation use is approaching 350 million visits, an increase of 40 percent. 
The Bryan amendment would also reduce the construction of roads in roadless areas. Road construction in roadless areas of the national forests is for the most part limited to emergency situations. Indeed, few if any miles of roads have been built in roadless areas of the national forests in recent years. However, building some roads in roadless areas is necessary on occasion to allow access to treat insect and disease outbreaks, to monitor forest health, or for wildfire management. 
Mr. President, the Bryan amendment would have a debilitating effect on the management of the national forest. I urge my colleagues to defeat this effort to further limit logging in roadless areas, to terminate the purchaser credit program, and to cut an already reduced forest road budget. This amendment is simply bad forest policy. 
The environmental groups who have drafted this amendment have only one purpose. It is to shut down the Forest Service Timber Program. I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment. 
Before I yield to my friend from Oregon--we are running down on time here--I just want to put my little plug in here. 
Mr. President, we have set records on recycling in this Senate. This old debate has been recycled every year since I have been here. We tend to forget in this country that we are dealing with a renewable resource. It is just like corn flakes on your table or the shirt on your back. All of these come from renewable resources. 
There has been one group of persons who have been left out of this debate, and it is the consumers of America. Has anybody priced any lumber lately, what it costs to build a house? Does anybody deal with the homeless in their States on how do we find housing and what it costs for affordable housing? 
There are people in this country who are in charge of producing not only food and fiber but also the shelter for America. That is what we are talking about here. You can mask it any way you want, but the way that we make a sale is pretty much time tested. It has worked, and it works every day, not only for the harvesting or the growing of a renewable resource. We see that great miracle of renewal every spring and every year. 
However, we also see the economic backbone of the economy of rural America being eroded by people who have forgotten what it takes to produce food, fiber and shelter. I tell you, you can go out there and look at that mountain all you want and, if it is a religious experience and you do not want it touched, that is fine and dandy. But at the end of the day you are going to go get a hamburger because you are hungry. It is the basic of life in this country. That is the first thing, or the second thing, we do every day when we get up. 
So I ask my colleagues just one question. In promoting what some think of as a `green world,' is that going to feed us and sustain us? Probably for a lot of us around here it fed us a little too good. Maybe we are caring a little too much. But I ask those who are not hands-on natural resource providers to just pay heed to what you are doing here, because everything we enjoy --our standard of living, our quality of life--starts with a little seed in the ground. That is where it starts. Every one of us goes about our way every day in feeding and in clothing--every one of us without exception. Yet we want to make that tougher because we do not think it is important. So after housing and shelter, I think we are talking about a bona fide serious problem here, and it is not fair to change the rules. It is not even right to those who grow and those who are in charge of the harvest. It is not fair to those who have to take a raw product and add value to it so that it serves all of us in this great country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. I am pleased to bring before the Senate the military construction conference report for fiscal year 1998. 
Mr. President, this conference report was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday by a vote of 413 to 12 and sent to the Senate last night. Now it awaits final passage here. 
Mr. President, we worked very hard with our House colleagues to bring this military construction conference to a successful conclusion. Both sides did take a little bit different perspective on the allocation of military construction funding for the Department of Defense, but in the final conference report we met our goals of promoting the quality of life, other initiatives, and enhancing the mission for readiness. 
Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to highlight. It provides a total of $9.2 billion for military construction. Even though this is an increase of $800 million over the President's budget for fiscal year 1998, it is still a reduction of $600 million from what was appropriated just a year ago. That is an overall reduction of 6 percent. 
Some 42 percent of this bill is allocated to family housing, for a total of $3.9 billion, so this includes new construction, improvement in existing housing, and funding for operation and maintenance of housing. 
The base realignment and closure part of the bill accounts for 23 percent of our total funding, about $2.1 billion. Yes, there is talk of another round of BRAC, and I want to tell my colleagues that base closure does take up a lot of funds. This encompasses funding for environmental cleanup of the closing of those bases and for the construction of new BRAC-related facilities. 
Mr. President, I continue to be concerned about the growing cost of the environmental cleanup of our BRAC installations. These costs frequently continue long after the base is closed. In some way or another we have to get a handle on that cost. But right now it seems like it is almost impossible to do. 
We strongly protect the quality-of-life initiatives. We provide $724 million for barracks, $32 million for child development centers, $163 million for hospital and medical facilities. 
We provide a total of $640 million for guard and reserve components, a reduction of $100 million from the Senate-passed bill. Overall, this represents an increase of $290 million from the President's budget request. Many of those projects will enhance our readiness and mission capabilities of our reserve and guard forces. I have to say, they are vital in the overall national defense scheme. It seems like every year when the budget comes down from the administration, those two parts of our military complex are forgotten about. 
I thank my ranking member, Senator Murray of Washington State, for her assistance and support through this process. She and her staff have been extremely cooperative. I also want to commend our colleagues in the House, because we went through the conference, and I think it is a good lesson on get your work done before you go and it makes it a lot easier when coming to an understanding and bringing all the minds together. 
I commend this product to the Senate. I recommend that it be signed by the President without modification. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of S. 1153, introduced by my colleague Senator Baucus, which will continue the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank [FARAD] Program. 
Although the recent E. coli scares are unfortunate, they present a good opportunity for the Senate to act on the issue of food safety. Public interest in the safety of our food supply is high, and the call for consumer awareness has never been greater. The FARAD Program stores and disseminates information on drug, pesticide, and environmental contaminant residue. This information allows veterinarians and producers to avoid problems with contaminated meat and helps ensure the integrity of our Nation's food supply. Producers and veterinarians can access FARAD information over the telephone, through e-mail, or even through two sites on the Internet, putting valuable data at everyone's fingertips. Information is also available in print material, such as FARAD's compendium on available drugs and the FARAD Digest column in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Unfortunately, a lack of funding has prevented FARAD's directors and employees from updating the databank. FARAD must contain complete and current data in order to continue protecting American consumers. And that's the bottom line. The public must be confident that the food on their plate is safe. I hope that my colleagues will support consumer awareness and support the FARAD Program.

Mr. BURNS. I would like to clarify the intent of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, and the full Appropriations Committee, with respect to the Rural Health Transition Grant Program. This program provides small, 3-year grants to assist financially troubled small rural hospitals as they attempt to adjust to changes brought on by new medical technology, changing practice patterns, and replacement of cost-based reimbursement with prospective, or fixed, payments. Last year Congress discontinued funding for rural health transition grants, but several facilities around the country were already in their grant cycle, having received their first or second year grants. These small hospitals were promised 3-year grants, and had relied on those grants, when the funds were cut off. 
Is it the intention of the Appropriations Committee to urge the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide, from the funds appropriated for program management, continuation grants to those rural hospitals which have received first or second year grants?

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Delaware. 
I rise today in support of this package. I guess every now and again we get into a situation where we have a big bill in front of us. I know that there is a good friend of mine on the floor now. I call him one of the greatest American slaves to his labor than anybody, and that is Senator Domenici from New Mexico on Budget, now with Senator Roth at the helm on Finance. 
A lot of things that we have tried to do in the last 6 or 7 or 10 years we get in this bill. 
We had a problem one time in the caucus. I can remember my good friend from Wyoming. It got kind of quiet. Nobody was coming up with any answers. He said, `Our biggest problem is we are overthinking this thing.' And we could be doing just that. 
But I want to remind America what it is all about. And that is middle America and what it means to young men and women who are starting out in agriculture on their farms. This is income averaging, because we are going to phase out subsidies, folks. We have to allow those who are starting off in the farming business, and those who want to sell a farm, to have capital gains relief--those who inherit farms. We are giving them some way that we can pass our farms and ranches on to the next generation. In other words, we don't have to sell the farm to save the farm, and income averaging, allowing a young man and a young woman on a farm to accumulate cash and save it in the good years so that they can make it through the bad years. That is basically what we want to do. And I call them farm friendly provisions of this budget deal. 
In small business, the ability and just a short time to write off 100 percent of your premiums for a tax credit on your health care insurance; you get your home office tax credit back; the alternative minimum tax for small businesses and farming operations. Yes, on that same farm or ranch they have children; and the $500-per-child tax credit, which, in my State, means that $200 million a year stays in that State. And the decision on who spends that money is left to the parents. That decision will be made around a breakfast table rather than around a conference table here in Washington, DC. 
So let us take a look at the big picture. Let us take a look at the people who really pull the wagon. They have been looking for relief a long time. It is in this package. 
I congratulate my good friend from New York and my good friend from Delaware because they have worked a long, long time. And, yes, you can find something in here that you do not like. But let us not let perfection stand in the way of progress. Let us at least take that one giant step in the right direction and let people control those dollars that they have worked so hard to earn. 
Across my State of Montana, we are agriculture and we are small business. So this package is just like a rifle shot; it is pointed right at those people who really are the heart and soul of any community, and, yes, the working men and women of this country. I am going to support it. I hope that all of my colleagues will support it. And then if there is something wrong, this body is not encased in stone. There is plenty of time to put some fixes in that maybe should be put in. But nonetheless, right now let us take that one giant step in the right direction. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. BURNS. I would like to pay tribute to a man who has given the American business community and millions of hard-working Americans over 2 decades of dedicated service. Dr. Richard Lesher, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, will be retiring in mid-August of this year. Dr. Lesher has successfully steered the world's largest business federation during this era of global competition. 
After nearly a quarter of a century with Dr. Lesher at the helm, the chamber's membership has grown to over 215,000 business members, 3,000 State and local chambers of commerce and over 1,200 trade and professional associations. In addition to the national membership, the U.S. chamber works closely with international members from over 60 countries. 
Dr. Lesher has worked tirelessly to improve the chamber and to continually champion the goals of the free enterprise system. In order to give his members a stronger voice in Congress, Dr. Lesher has established the Grassroots Action Information Network, or GAIN. He has overseen the creation of the National Chamber Litigation Center in 1977, the only public policy law firm that represents American business interests before regulatory agencies and the courts. 
Dr. Lesher has been a constant source of inspiration and dedication in Washington, across the Nation, and throughout the world. His innovative ideas, superb leadership and knowledge of issues have made the U.S. Chamber of Commerce the Nation's leading business advocacy group. Dr. Lesher, thanks for your unfailing commitment to Americans and American business throughout your tenure. I wish you the very best in your retirement.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Federal Government should not manipulate the universal service fund to balance the Federal budget. I believe this for several reasons. 
The provision in the conference reconciliation package which manipulates the Federal universal service fund and allows the Federal Government to use this fund to balance the Federal budget is outrageously bad policy, and is, I believe, an unconstitutional takings. 
In States like Montana, the universal service fund is absolutely critical to the provision of basic telephone service at reasonable and affordable rates. However, lately it seems that this fund is becoming the `ox that gets gored' to resolve a variety of high profile problems or issues. Universal telephone service is a privately funded support system that works without Federal monetary aid. Unfortunately, due to its present on-budget status, this privately financed program is subject to the whims of the budgeteers. A couple of months ago, the FCC, at the urging of the Vice President, decided to add a further burden of $2.25 billion a year on the contributions to the fund to pay for linking schools, libraries, and rural health care facilities to the Internet. Now the Congress, by this reconciliation package, is seeking to balance the budget at the cost of universal telephone service. This will have extremely negative impacts upon basic telephone service in rural and remote areas of the country which depend upon the fund to keep prices for telephone service reasonable; consequently, here we are, in the name of balancing the Federal budget, effectively raising rates for telephone service for all customers who happen to live in states like mine. This effectively targets the rural customers and is simply unacceptable. Sound telecommunications policy must not be manipulated to comport with fleeting budgetary concerns. Rural Americans--and those others who receive affordable service as a result of universal telephone service--must not be subjected to the uncertainty of this process. 
Furthermore, I believe that, even if this provision were not such outrageously bad policy, we should not adopt it because it will likely be struck down by the courts as an unconstitutional taking of private property. Contributions to the Federal universal service fund are made by telephone companies and wireless telephone providers and, as such, are not the property of the Federal Government. The Telecommunications Act clearly establishes the manner in which universal telephone service funds are to be collected and disbursed. Pursuant to the act, universal telephone service moneys logically should not be classified as either Federal receipts or Federal disbursements and thus should not be associated with the Federal budget, as the administration has insisted, and as some in Congress have allowed. Clearly these are not Federal funds. 
Thus, the Federal Government's use of these funds interest free is, in effect, a governmental taking of that interest. Consequently, I believe that a constitutional challenge to this provision will likely be successful. Regardless, there is one thing of which we can be absolutely certain: this provision will end up in the court system, thus wasting phone company, and by extension phone company customer, and taxpayer money. Folks, this provision is a bad idea for any of a number of reasons, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing any efforts by either the administration or Congress to use the universal service fund to balance the Federal budget. 
Additionally, this ill-advised raiding of the universal service fund sets an absolutely terrible precedent. While I am confident that the budget agreement is based on sound numbers, what will happen if the economy takes a turn for the worse and the economic assumptions on which the balanced budget plan is based come up short? Will the budgeteers not look to increase the amount of money that is borrowed from the universal service fund? Even if that's not the case, and even if the money borrowed from the fund will be repaid, this amounts to a back-door tax increase levied on every American through his or her telephone bill. I don't believe that we need to raise taxes in order to balance the budget--that's why I joined every other Republicans member of Congress in voting against the ill-conceived Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993--but if we're going to raise taxes, we ought to be forthright about it. This scheme to raid the universal service fund is anything but forthright.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise to correct an unintentional Federal burden that has been placed on a sector of our Nation's agricultural community. 
The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 subjected operators of large trucks and buses to new regulations including the requirement that States devise a commercial driver's license [CDL] program by April 1, 1992. 
The intent of this act was to improve highway safety by requiring a higher level of qualification and knowledge for those engaged in commercial trucking activities and was primarily aimed at addressing the safety issue of over-the-road, long-haul truckers. 
In 1988, the Federal Highway Administration [FHwA] granted States the authority to waive the CDL requirements for farmers and others who operate large vehicles incidental to their occupations. States retained the right to impose restrictions and conditions on those for whom the waiver was applied. 
Unfortunately, the CDL requirement continues to apply to many vehicle operators who are neither a highway safety hazard or engaged in commercial trucking enterprises. Such is the case of those engaged in the unique, seasonal business of harvesting the Nation's crops. 
Custom harvesting is a service industry which, for a fee, provides farmers the personnel and equipment necessary to harvest their crops; relieving them of the need to invest, operate and maintain the costly, specialized equipment which can only be utilized on a limited seasonal basis. 
Incidental to this service is providing the transportation equipment and drivers necessary to deliver those crops to on-farm or local storage or processing facilities. 
This service harvests nearly 60 percent of the Nation's entire wheat crop from my State of Montana to Texas and many wheat growing States in between. 
The vast majority of miles driven in providing this service are off-road or on low traffic density rural roads and highways. Because of the unique nature of this business and the substantial investment in equipment, the owner-operator of these predominantly small, family-owned businesses devote a significant amount of time and resources to employee training and safety education which is relevant to the service they provide, rather than simply accepting the generally inappropriate standards based on the urban-suburban driving needs requires for a CDL. 
In addition, close supervision of the harvesting and transport activities is provided both during the actual harvesting operations and the movement of equipment from site to site. 
Given the failure of the FHwA to acknowledge the unique characteristics of the custom harvesting business and to provide a reasonable waiver to States to determine an appropriate level of regulation for this industry, we are introducing legislation to provide States the authority to grant an exemption from the CDL requirements. 
This legislation does not mandate that those engaged in activities such as custom harvesting will be unregulated. It does provide those States, who wish to do so, the opportunity to provide regulatory relief to an industry which is critical to the production of food and fiber in this country.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the $1,675,000 request for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology [EPSCoT] Program reported in the Senate appropriations bill, S. 1022. EPSCoT, which is part of the Commerce Department's Technology Administration, is an important program for our Nation's rural States. Its aim is to help foster regional technology-based economic growth in the 18 States that are traditionally underrepresented in Federal research and development funding. 
EPSCoT evolved during the 104th Congress from a series of discussions between the Technology Administration and the Senate Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space which I chaired along with Senator Rockefeller, the ranking minority member. Dr. Mary Good, who retired as the Undersecretary of Technology in June, recognized the importance of initiating, maintaining, and enhancing research development and technology in all States of this Nation. Using the highly successful National Science Foundation Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCoR] as its model, EPSCoT was originated to serve as its technology counterpart. The States are ready to proceed since they can use their existing EPSCoR State network to now help build a strong technology infrastructure throughout this country. 
This program receives bipartisan support. While EPSCoT will be a competitive, cost-shared, merit-based grants program, the actual details are now being worked out through a series of public meetings with representatives from State and local government, regional organizations, small businesses, and universities. In June, we held one of three regional policy forums in Billings, MT. We heard from the people that will be participating in this program. They provided the feedback and advice about how EPSCoT should be designed to meet their unique needs to develop and sustain a long-term technology-based economic infrastructure in the region. 
A successful EPSCoT program could also provide a mechanism to relieve some of the concerns raised in opposition to the Advanced Technology Program [ATP]. I believe that ATP plays an important role in the development of emerging and enabling technologies critical for sustaining a strong economy. However, it has been viewed as providing too much support to large companies and, as a result of the way industry is now clustered, limiting the support to a few specific regions within the country. There is a strong call for wider participation and greater diversity of partnerships in the Department of Commerce. 
In Montana, 98 percent of the businesses are considered small businesses. Generally, small businesses do not have the capacity or the resources necessary to undertake or maintain the research and support activities which larger businesses and industries maintain as part of their on-going activities. To the extent that such support exists in these States, it usually comes from local universities. EPSCoT is a vehicle to assist the largely rural States to develop regional clusters, spin-off companies, and other small high technology companies. It will help small businesses and industries which are emerging in Montana and other rural States to be successful and globally competitive. This program, with sufficient support, will be successful in stimulating technology development and transfer. EPSCoT will foster the scientific and technological infrastructure necessary for job creation and economic growth. 
Mr. President, for these reasons, I strongly support the funds provided to launch EPSCoT. This is an investment to spur economic growth in rural areas that are key to an overall healthy American economy. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment that would strike the provision from the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill to divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We have heard so much said today about how the bar associations oppose it, the judges oppose it, and nobody has said anything about the people. Are they secondary in our justice system? We are supposed to be serving the people, and I think the bar associations do, too. I happen to believe that they believe very strongly in the kind of service that they deliver to their clientele. But we haven't heard that today. 
If there were a judicial equivalent of baseball's famous `Mendoza line,' marking the mediocre batting average of .200 below which players dread dropping, then the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would be laboring in the farm leagues. 
In terms of the rate at which its decisions are reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, the ninth circuit's record for failure is practically unblemished. In recent years, on average, more than 80 percent of rulings by the ninth have been overturned. This past term, the Supreme Court reviewed 29 cases from the ninth circuit--it reversed, in part or in whole, an astonishing 28 of them. 
The ninth circuit in 1996-97 alone was reversed, often 9 to 0, on decisions asserting the right to die, requiring sheriffs to conduct federally required but unfunded background checks on people who buy guns, and denying the right of groups who were economically harmed by the Endangered Species Act to sue even though the law gives legal standing to any person. 
While the high court undoubtedly chooses many cases with the express intent of reversing them, the ninth circuit this past year has wrecked the curve. For instance, the eighth circuit, which had the second-most cases reviewed, had a reversal-and-affirmance record of only 4 to 4. 
But `this isn't baseball,' says Judge Stephen S. Trott of Boise, ID, according to a recent Los Angeles Times article. 
Agreed. The jurisprudence of our Federal appellate court system is far more serious than a game. In my view, the fact that the ninth circuit is undeniably out of step with the rest of the Nation is perhaps the least of the multitude of reasons to consider 
splitting this giant court. 
First, the ninth circuit outstrips the other circuits in all measures of size, both physically and legally. The ninth circuit encompasses a land mass the size of Western Europe. Its nine States and two territories--Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands--stretch from the Arctic Circle south to the United States-Mexico border and west across the international dateline. It has a population of nearly 50 million people, about 1 in 5 Americans, and is expected to grow by 43 percent over just the next 13 years. 
Second, the ninth's caseload is the largest. More than 8,500 appeals were filed last year, and that number is expected to jump by nearly 700 percent in the next 25 years, making the ninth less than a model of fair and speedy justice. In fact, of the 11 regional circuits and the District of Columbia circuit, it ranks next-to-worst in the duration of pending appeals--an average of 429 days, usually more for criminal cases, compared to the national average of 315 days. 
These delays are costly. Appeals take time and money, and they're putting the squeeze on my State. Litigants and attorneys who must make frequent and expensive trips to San Francisco are pleading for reform. 
Third, the problems of geography and population are two factors that contribute to judicial inconsistency on the ninth. Because the 28 judgeships of the ninth--nearly twice the maximum number recommended by the U.S. Judicial Conference--are scattered so far and wide, the court has experimented with limited en banc proceedings in which a panel of 11 judges decides the most important cases. By relaying on this approach, conflicting court decisions are common. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. As a result, decisions by the ninth are often narrow and set few precedents for use by judges in other cases. 
In fact, several of the Supreme Court Justices criticized the Ninth Circuit's en banc decision in Washington versus Glucksberg that the due process clause of the 14th amendment guarantees critically ill individuals a limited right to assisted suicide. Even some liberal members of the Court, such as Justice Ginsburg, expressed concern that the Ninth Circuit opinion seemed to give Federal courts a `dangerous power.' 
Size was a factor leading a congressional commission in 1973 to urge splitting the fifth and ninth circuits. Congress chose to split the fifth, while the ninth has become bogged down in political squabbles and has had to make due with its enormous size. 
One cannot make the argument this has not been heard, or that it has not been studied when in actuality it has. 
Some press accounts have portrayed the debate as a clash of party ideologies, of conservatives who favor the split versus liberals who do not. But such a view is short-sighted. These press accounts overlook the bipartisan support behind dividing the ninth. For many of us, it is just as simple as wanting a court that is closer in every sense to the people it serves. 
Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has publicly noted the merit of division. The U.S. Department of Justice has recently said `the sheer size of the Ninth Circuit, even without its attendant management difficulties, argues for its division.' Montana Governor Marc Racicot, a former State attorney general, favors the idea. And I would now like to submit a letter from Governor Racicot supporting this split.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to read one part of the Governor's letter. He states `the Ninth Circuit is simply too large to effectively respond to the needs of those it serves.' State legislatures of the Northwest consistently and overwhelmingly call on Congress to split the ninth circuit. 
On the other hand, the bill is opposed by judges and lawyers in the ninth circuit who would lose control over their fiefdoms. It is also opposed by special-interest groups that apparently care little about the troubles that are caused by the ninth circuit. 
Mr. President, as you may know, since I came to the Senate in 1989, I have sponsored numerous bills and amendments that would achieve a split of the ninth circuit and I commend the Commerce, State Justice, Subcommittee on their willingness to again take up the fight in the 105th Congress. It's an old axiom that justice delayed is justice denied. For too long the people of the ninth circuit have been caught in the cogs of the wheels of justice. I want to put a stop to this inequity by dividing this court before its growth overwhelms us all. 
Mr. President, in looking at what has been said by some, that it has not been heard, that it has not been studied, let's just take a look and see what has been done since. 
In 1974, the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on S. 729 to realign the fifth and ninth. It was reported out of committee. Nothing happened. 
On March 7, 1984, the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts held hearings on S. 1156, the Ninth Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1983. No action was taken. 
On March 6, 1990, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Administrative Practices held hearings on S. 948, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1989. And there was no action taken. 
In 1990, the Intellectual Property and Administration of Justice Committee held hearings on H.R. 4900, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1990. Still no action was taken. 
H.R. 3654 died in committee without hearings. 
In 1995, the full Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on S. 956, the Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1995. An amended version passed the Senate by voice vote, but it died in the House Judiciary Committee. 
So it is not that this has not been looked at and studied. It has always gotten bogged down. 
Basically that is what we are talking about here. We continue to talk about the bar association doesn't want it, the judges of the ninth don't want it. When do we start listening to the people who have to use it? 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce a bill that will provide further regulatory relief for our farmers and ranchers. 
Let me give you some background on this issue. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Transportation published a rule under the HM-200 docket which severely restricts the transportation of agricultural products classified as hazardous materials. 
This aspect of the HM-200 rule could cost the agricultural retail industry and the farm economy millions of dollars every year. 
Currently, States model their regulations concerning the transport of hazardous materials on Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations [HMR's]. However, some States with 
large farm economies provide exceptions from the State HMR's to the agricultural industry for the short-haul, intrastate, retail-to-farm transport of agricultural inputs. 
HM-200 would supersede all State HMR's, eliminate these exceptions, and apply Federal regulations to the short-haul, seasonal and mostly rural transport of farm products. 
The cost of this regulatory burden is estimated to be in excess of $12,300 a year for each agricultural retailer. Industrywide, it is estimated that it could cost the agricultural economy nearly $62 million annually. 
We all want safe highways, safe food production, and a safe workplace, but when DOT, OSHA, and EPA regulations are stirred together in a pot, the stew can turn out to be quite rancid. Placing these Federal burdens on the backs of farmers and ranchers in Montana's rural communities, can mean the difference between flying or dying. 
HM-200 will require agricultural retailers to comply with time consuming and costly regulations that will not make our rural roads safer, but only increase the cost of doing business, cause confusion, and require unnecessary paperwork. These expenses will be passed on to farmers who already are burdened with slimming margins and ever higher cost of production. 
States and the agricultural community have an excellent track record for protecting the environment and keeping the public safe. The agricultural retail industry complies with numerous safety measures such as requiring all drivers to have Commercial Drivers Licenses [CDL's] drug and alcohol testing for drivers, HAZMAT handling experience, and so forth. 
Additionally, States which do not provide exceptions to their own HMR's for the agricultural community will face a new regulatory burden since these States rarely enforce the regulations that they have in place. The U.S. DOT has made it abundantly clear that they will expect all States to actively enforce HM-200, thereby making it an unfunded mandate. 
Despite petitions for reconsideration from the agricultural community--all of which have gone unanswered by DOT--HM-200 is due to be implemented on October 1, 1997--it was published in February of this year. 
This legislation seeks to delay implementation of HM-200 with respect to agricultural transports, until October 1, 1999, or until the reauthorization of Federal Hazardous Materials legislation. By allowing for a delay in HM-200 implementation, I believe we can properly address and examine the facts as they stand with regard to the need for this new regulation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation, and help keep our agricultural community from having to bear a needless expense which has little safety value to the public.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on July 14, 1997 Mary Frances Burns died in Gallatin, MO. She was born there, a daughter of a farmer and stockman and a sister to four brothers and two sisters. She married Russell Burns in 1931 and they farmed just northwest of Gallatin all of their lives. 
Mom was so typical of the farm women of the American prairies. She was wife, partner, mother, homemaker, field hand, and gardener. She could coach younger girls in 4H, teach a Sunday School class, attend a school board meeting, cook all three of the daily meals, keep an old gas powered Maytag wash machine going, and still have time to play an active role in Democratic Party politics. 
She and her husband were married 61 years until dad died in 1992. They navigated this family through the droughts of the 1930's and the Great Depression. Yet through it all, she maintained a great sense of faith and humor. The times were hard in the Depression as anybody who lived in that era could attest. The actions and conversations of mom and dad were always of hope and optimism in the American dream, of the American system, and their dream of a better life. 
It was the time when America was being tested again and again was about to cast into a great world war. They witnessed husbands, sons, brothers, and a few daughters leave for war and they were there to welcome them home. As a family, we cried and prayed with the families who lost loved ones to that terrible war and we celebrated with the ones who came home heroes. We helped them to put their lives back together again and America was whole again. 
They skimped and saved and worked. Mom never had much but was never denied. She made a very happy home. Christmas was an orange, home made toy, and home made clothes. All holidays meant good cooking with a special little twist for her family and relation in times of unbelievable stress and uncertainty. 
Memories will always remain of the wonderful smells and aromas emanating from mother's kitchen. It was there she cooked for harvest and hay hands over an old wood range during the hot humid days of summer. Those same smells were even better after chores on a cold winter day. 
The badge of authority to the woman of the prairies and a true symbol of womanhood was the apron. It was worn everyday. It was made of anything from feed sacks to the finest cotton. There were those for everyday and those for Sunday or welcoming unexpected callers. Company was always welcome if at meal time, never left unfed. 
Mom could gather the eggs, pick the garden, move baby chicks and kittens. The apron was used to haze milk cows to the barn, run wandering livestock out of her garden--along with some colorful language--wipe the tears from a crying child, dust from a husband's eye, and sweat from a working brow. 
It was spotted and stained from ripe strawberries, black berries, an overly excited pup, and grease from a spark plug out of the old wash machine. It had the smells of newly picked sweet corn, fresh baked bread, lye soap, and once in a while, the light scent of perfume. 
She was the center of our home and was a part of a generation that understood love, life, and death. She understood the value of honesty and openness, a healthy fear and love of God, and the core values of the American Midwest. 
She was the daughter of this land. The soil that she loved and sustained her has now received her back. We are the benefactors of her qualities and teachings. We, as a nation, are what we are because of her and the millions of women like her of the American prairies. She was one of the silent builders of the United States of America.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I watched the news last night with a great deal of distress. Our Nation is in a situation that is intolerable with our long and faithful friend to our North. I don't quite understand the crux of the situation but I will become familiar with it and the history that has brought us to this inexcusable and terrible confrontation, that now exists on the west coast of British Columbia. 
I have been occupied with the death of my mother and have been somewhat out of the loop of events and the deterioration of the relationship on our west coast. I knew there were circumstances which was causing friction among the fishing fleets of both the United States and Canada. The salmon runs have been of historic proportions in our Alaskan waters but as one works to the south toward the coast of Canada and the lower west coast of the United States, the runs are not as good. 
A year ago, when the American-Canadian Inner-Parliamentary Meeting was held on the Alaskan coast while traveling from Prince Rupert, British Columbia, to Skagway, Alaska, there were discussions of the situation but there was no resolution. Both the Members of the Canadian Parliament and the Members of the American Congress were reluctant to dig deeper into the situation. Now we have a full-fledged crisis on our hands and it is separated from this Nation or Canada by an ocean. It is here and it is serious. 
Canadian subjects held an American flag ship by barricading it. That is a vessel that sails a regular schedule from Seattle to the coastal ports of Canada and Alaska. It was held along with all passengers, cargo, and United States mail aboard. I am outraged any action of this kind was allowed to exist in this hemisphere. If it were any other place on this planet, this Government and all Americans would have been outraged. No other place would this Nation allow this kind of action to happen. 
I was outraged when I saw the American flag burned by one, I assume, barricading the vessel. I, for one in this body, demand the Government of Canada deal with this situation and with those who would have a complete disrespect for the flag of this Nation. It is the single most powerful symbol of the free world. I would hope no citizen in this country would ever do any repulsive act to the national colors of our friends in Canada. We should not nor shall not retaliate in such fashion. We should, however, focus on this situation and get it settled as honorable nations do. 
I cannot believe this administration has not taken action earlier to defuse this confrontation. I live in Montana and the relationship between Alberta and Montana has been one of great respect and friendship. Yes, that relationship is strained from time to time. But, that is to be expected among neighbors. But, never has our respect for each other ever been reduced to the actions now being displayed at Port Rupert, British Columbia, as we speak. 
I plead with the President to get personally involved with the leaders of Canada and work it out and not let this wound fester and become uncontrollable. Our long and deep friendship with Canada is at stake and it is serious. 
I plan to appeal to the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate to look into this and would hope there is resolve within this body to deal with it and find a solution acceptable to Canada and the United States. 
I appeal to both the Foreign Relations Committee and the President. Please do not stand idly by while someone burns my flag and barricades my ship. I do not plan to take this lightly and I also appeal strongly to the leaders of Canada to take actions that would defuse the confrontation and deal harshly with those who show no respect for either their own country or the United States of America.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the military construction appropriation bill and report for fiscal year 1998. This bill reflects the bipartisan approach that the ranking member, Senator Murray of Washington, and I have tried to maintain regarding military construction and this subcommittee. It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Murray, her staff, and the members of the subcommittee throughout this process. I very much appreciate all of their support. 
Mr. President, this bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee last Thursday by a unanimous vote of 28 to 0. The bill recommended by the full Committee on Appropriations is for $9,182,900,000. This is $799 million over the budget request and almost equal to the corresponding House bill. The bill provides $610 million less than what was appropriated last year--a reduction of 6 percent in overall spending authority for the committee from fiscal year 1997. Further, the bill reflects a reduction of 21 percent since fiscal year 1996--almost $2 billion less from just 2 years ago. 
We have sought to recommend a balanced bill to the Senate, and we believe it addresses key, military construction requirements for readiness, family housing, barracks, quality of life and the Guard and Reserve components. This bill honors the commitment we have to our Armed Forces. It helps ensure that the housing and infrastructure needs of the military are given proper recognition. Also, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the bill is within the committee's 602(b) budget allocation for both budget authority and outlays. 
Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to mention. We added $152 million to provide better and more modern family housing for our service personnel and their families. On another quality of life measure, we have added substantially to the budget request for medical and hospital facilities, increasing the request by almost 50 percent. We have provided $660 million for barracks construction to provide single service members a more favorable living environment. The committee also fully funds the budget request of $104 million for funding 24 class I violation environmental 
projects. 
We also addressed the shortfalls that continue to plaque our Reserve components. The Department continues to walk away from the total force concept. Recognizing this, we have again lent support by adding $395 million to the Guard and Reserve accounts. In each case, the funds will help satisfy essential mission, quality of life or readiness requirements. 
Mr. President, 22 percent of the bill, or $2.1 billion, is for downsizing defense infrastructure, or better known as the Base Realignment and Closure Program. This includes funding for the last three rounds of BRAC. Almost a quarter of all military construction dollars goes toward the base closure and realignment process. 
All of the projects that we have recommended are included in either the Senate- or House-passed versions of the defense authorization bills. We will work very closely with the Armed Services Committee, as we put together a conference package for military construction. 
We have tried to accommodate the sizable administration request for overseas projects in such places as Korea, Germany, and the Middle East. Mr. President, 24 percent of the administration's budget request for military construction projects is for overseas areas. This seems out of proportion when only about 16 percent of our total force is actually stationed overseas. We have funded only the essential of those projects. 
We are also concerned about the recent decision made at Madrid to expand NATO and the additional costs required to implement that decision. With future defense spending constrained, this expansion has the potential to degrade the U.S. military construction and defense program seriously. I have requested a detailed report that lays out the additional funding requirements associated with the expansion, including logistical, communications, construction and other needs anticipated for the NATO infrastructure account. This will help us understand the potential costs to the U.S. taxpayer of NATO expansion. 
There are many other issues that I could speak about at this time. I urge the Members of the Senate to support this bill and move it forward expeditiously. 
I would say, also, we are finding in the BRAC, or base closures, that we are spending dollars that were unexpected just in environmental cleanup. The environmental cost of cleanup of these bases so they could be moved into either contract hands or private hands has been very, very high. 
So I appreciate my ranking member, the work she has done, and now I yield to my ranking member, Senator Murray.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in response to Senator McCain, there are over 891,000 men and women in uniform who serve in one of the six Reserve organizations. They represent 38 percent of the total force. 
For these Reserve forces, the President's budget request contained a total of $173 million--less than 2 percent of the total military construction bill allocated to the Reserve components. 
More specifically, the National Guard military construction program supports over 474,673 soldiers and airmen in communities throughout the Nation. They constitute approximately 20 percent of our total Armed Forces and represent all 50 States and 4 territories. 
The units and the missions of the Reserve components have changed significantly in the last 30 to 40 years. The mission and the equipment is much more complex and requires larger working bays and parking areas. The increased lethality and range of modern weapons restrict indirect firing ranges and training areas and creates new requirements necessary to ensure safety. 
The Army Guard alone has more than 23,360 facilities, with a current plant replacement value of $17.3 billion. Over 50 percent of these facilities are inadequate by current Army criteria. There is a construction backlog of $2.3 billion, which as a direct impact on modernization and readiness. 
The Pentagon requested only $45 million for the Army National Guard for military construction in the fiscal year 1998 budget. There are 367,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard--$45 million does not go very far in meeting their mission and quality of life requirements. 
If the Congress did not act to provide additional military construction funding to the Reserve components each year, these forces would be severely handicapped as far as their ability to achieve full operational capability and their objective readiness level. Just because a project is for the Guard or Reserve does not mean it is not meritorious, it signifies that the Pentagon has decided to let the Congress foot the bill for building and maintaining the Reserve components' infrastructure.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Bumpers amendment. As previous chairman and present member of the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space that provides the authorization for NASA, I would like to state my support for the space station program and the Senate appropriations bill, S. 1034. The Bumpers amendment is not new. This is an annual event here in the Senate like the first day of summer in Montana. We always know it is coming but it just never happens. 
Let me start by saying that I support the missions performed by NASA. Just like the pioneers that came to Montana and settled the West, exploration in unchartered territories of space is a way to achieve our dreams of new beginnings, and visions of a better life. This is clearly illustrated by the excitement generated around the world by the Mars Pathfinder and its Sojourner rover. Every day Americans wake up to learn more information about the Mars' rocks named Scooby-Doo, Yogi, and Barnacle Bill. Record numbers of hits on the NASA website have been registered. Why? Because the Mars Pathfinder opens the door to our imagination and a new period of exploration. 
This is not the only accomplishment by NASA within the past year. A rock has been found in Antarctica which excited the world with the possibility of life on the planet of Mars. The Galileo spacecraft has beamed back the intriguing photos of existence of seas on Jupiter's moon, Europa, again raising speculations of life-related chemicals. Technology is developing, like the X-33 prototype for a new generation of reusable launch vehicles, which will increase reliability and lower the costs of putting payloads in space. These endeavors inspire and expand the horizons of the pioneer spirit of all Americans and the space station is part of that endeavor. 
NASA was created by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to undertake civilian research, development, and flight activities in aeronautics and space. Since its creation, NASA has undertaken a wide variety of successful programs and projects. The idea of a space station is not new. In the 1970's, Skylab provided a station to carry out experiments in astronomy, space physics, materials processing, and biomedical research. 
After its success, NASA began its plans to develop a permanent orbiting laboratory for conducting life science and microgravity research and to conduct human exploration of space. 
Since its original authorization in 1984, the program continues to evolve to achieve its admirable goals. Today, it is a partnership between Canada, Japan, 10 European nations, as well as Russia. 
I cannot stand here before you today and say that the space station is not without problems. We are all aware of these problems and I have personally addressed them over the past several years during oversight hearings. We are aware of the risks and problems resulting from the Russian participation, the increased costs, and the technical challenges in the space station design. And we will continue to have hearings to address these issues and hold NASA accountable. 
NASA is also aware of these problems and are actively seeking solutions. Mr. Goldin and NASA have been successful in streamlining and restructuring NASA's operations and facilities without compromising safety, productivity, or the goals and missions of the space program. Mr. Goldin and NASA have been successful in reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and living up to his motto of a faster, better, cheaper agency. Today, NASA is doing more for less. 
So today, Mr. President, we again hear the arguments for the elimination of the space station. These are arguments to eliminate our dreams. Let's retire these arguments once and for all and begin working together to overcome these difficulties to ensure our future presence in space. 
Mr. President, again, I thank my friend from Missouri. Mr. President, this is an annual thing. It kind of comes like Christmas and every other holiday that comes around. We hear from those folks who really think probably this is a great waste of money. We have all stood and marveled at the expedition to Mars. It came in under budget and was done in less time. But that is 300 million miles from where we stand today. When America does not dream, or fails to reach out, then we become a stagnant people. 
Right now, as we speak, there is a reenactment of the Mormon Trail that was blazed from Omaha, NE, to the great Salt Lake Valley. Using the same mentality, we would still be driving the same vehicles now that carried those folks westbound across Nebraska and Wyoming and into Utah. 
Let me start off by saying that I support the missions performed by NASA. I am from Montana, so I don't have a big stake in what NASA does, from the standpoint of my home State of Montana. But I will tell you that when we reach out and explore the unknown--where we are going now is a little more than just a wagon train from Omaha to Salt Lake City. We have seen it clearly illustrated this week and the excitement generated around the world by the Mars Pathfinder and its Sojourner recovery. Every day Americans wake up to learn more information about the Mars rocks named `Scooby-Doo' and `Yogi' and `Barnacle Bill.' 
More than anything else, when we talk about NASA, there is another little program that catches the eye and support of the American people called Mission Planet Earth. With our new technologies in sensoring, we know more about this piece of mud that we are whipping through space on called Earth. We have done it because somebody dared to dream and somebody dared to do it. 
I do not think the American people, this society should back off from the challenges of exploring space. And, yes, the space station is a part of that. 
Now, I chaired the authorizing committee on science, technology and space--NASA. We changed this a little bit differently. We went out to seek partnerships, and we got some commitments, but maybe it is kind of like the chicken and the egg. Maybe we are also put to the test. Can we do it? Can we captain it? I think we can. It is American know-how, it is American technology that has put us where we are. And we do not know what the benefits are. I would guess there are probably a lot of digital wristwatches around here on a lot of people's arms that were the result of the space program--new composites. We know more about Earth. We know a lot more about everything that is not written up in newspapers every day because newspapers would rather print those negative kinds of things, I guess. 
We changed the way we were going to complete the challenge of a space station because we have a lot of things to learn before we go the extra step--not back to the Moon but before we go into deeper space, and so that is why we have a little rover up there on Mars telling us a lot about that planet, the red planet. 
We changed our tactics because we had one primary contractor, and now we have the hardware that is ready to go to start building this so that we may take the next step into space. 
So I tell my colleagues on this floor that we have changed the whole mission of NASA, and, yes, we have brought the costs down at NASA almost a third just in the time that I have been in this Senate, so we are getting there quicker, under budget and using less money and collecting more knowledge and technology as we move along. 
Dan Goldin, who is the Administrator of NASA, has done a wonderful job in repairing----

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to offer may support for nomination of Joel Klein to assume the position of Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
There has been much debate here this evening over my letter to Mr. Klein dated May 15, 1997, and his subsequent letter in response dated May 20, 1997. I'd like to take this opportunity to offer my two cents. 
When Mr. Klein's nomination was first reported out of the Judiciary Committee, I was concerned for three primary reasons. First, I had recently read Mr. Klein's paper entitled `Preparing for Competition in a Deregulated Telecommunications Market,' which he presented at the Willard Inter-Continental Hotel in Washington, DC, on March 11, 1997, and his interpretation in that paper of Section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 troubled me. Because I chair the Subcommittee on Communications, I felt that I could not, in good conscience, allow his nomination to move forward; consequently, I placed a hold upon his nomination and sent a letter to him asking him to explain his statements concerning 271 applications. He promptly responded with a comprehensive explanation of his statements, and, while I did not at that time nor do I now, necessarily agree with his assessment of the DoJ's role in the 271 application process, I understood the basis of his convictions. 
Second, in addition to the questions raised in my letter, I also telephoned him and expressed concern over what had been reported to me--both by press accounts and by a wide range of industry representatives--as a total failure on the part of the Antitrust Division to investigate allegations that Microsoft Corporation was in violation of the Consent Decree entered into with the Department of Justice on August 21, 1995. I have here one of several newspaper articles detailing these allegations and seek unanimous consent for its introduction into the Record. Subsequently, I met with Mr. Klein and he assured me that he would investigate these allegations. 
Finally, I had been contacted by a number of radio broadcasters who had complained that the Antitrust Division was misinterpreting the radio ownership provisions of the Telecommunications Act, but, after meeting with Mr. Klein, and discussing the issue at length, I was satisfied with his approach in this matter. 
Consequently, based upon both his written and verbal responses to my concerns. I am satisfied that he will be a fine Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, and I support his nomination.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, yesterday the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee began his hearings on the alleged political campaign finance irregularities of 1996. After all that has been written and reported in the press and elsewhere, it is time. Even before these hearings, a lot of facts are already known and how much more these hearings will reveal yet has to be seen. Knowing all the roadblocks that could be posed in these hearings and these investigations, they may reveal very little, or we may be surprised at some of the findings. Nonetheless, the hearings must move forward. This body and the other body, the House of Representatives, has the unsavory duty to investigate, reveal and inform the American people. I know no one in either Chamber relishes this assignment. To some it tends to polarize, and to some it confirms what they have already known. 
John Quincy Adams, who returned to the House of Representatives after serving as President of the United States, in a heated debate over slavery, of which he was an ardent opponent, said, `Duty is ours; results are God's.' 
The nature of these hearings is different, especially when we talk about campaign financing. This one involves foreign entities attempting to politically infiltrate the American system. That is the concern of all Americans and in particular those of us who have taken the oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States in face of foreign and domestic assault. To do otherwise is just not accepting our sworn duty and our obligation to the American people. 
Alexis de Tocqueville, author of `Democracy in America,' way back in the early 1800's, wrote that America is great because America is good. When America ceases to be good, it will cease to be great. That is as true today as it was then. 
The alleged violations of the 1996 campaign did not start just in 1997. One must remember, back in the fall of 1996, about mid-October, when the Democratic National Committee failed to file its campaign report with the Federal Election 
Commission--some excuse that the accountants did not have it ready or it was not ready to go. In fact, I don't recall whether it was filed at all until the elections were over in 1996. The point is, could full disclosure be working if there were obvious irregularities? If there were, did they take the attitude, `Why should we file?' Were there campaign activities that could prove embarrassing right before the election? And I would ask, is that not the main purpose of the present laws, full disclosure--full and timely disclosure of campaign activities? Maybe the present law is working. Maybe, under the present law, we know what we know today. We must ponder that. 
The China connection has lots of us concerned. In fact, Americans should be outraged at such an allegation, let alone proof. What was going on when John Huang received top security clearance without even a background check, 5 months before he began working at the Commerce Department? Why did this person still have a security clearance when he began working at the DNC? Why did John Huang attend over 100 classified briefings, hold 95 meetings at the White House, have frequent access to the President of the United States? I want to know that. I want to know why it was allowed to happen. The American people deserve to know. And we have the duty to inform them. 
It is apparent that inquiry is necessary because it seems to me that this administration was willing to do whatever it took to win an election. The facts that we know now--not allegations but facts--tell us that they broke current and existing laws. Are they above the law? I don't believe so--as none of us are. They inadvertently allowed our national security to be compromised? One has to question that. 
So, the Governmental Affairs Committee is fulfilling a constitutional responsibility by conducting oversight to find out whether the current laws have been adhered to, of which we know some of them were not. 
It is their duty to discover what laws were broken, and then we can decide what can be done to improve enforcement of those laws. 
This is about money laundering, illegal foreign contributions and unlawful receipts of campaign funds within Federal buildings. There is credible evidence out there that indicates this administration was engaged in all of these violations. 
It is my hope, Mr. President, that these hearings will get all the facts out in the open for the American people. I commend Senator Thompson and committee members for assuming that responsibility. It is an awesome responsibility and one that is not taken lightly by any Member of the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House of Representatives. It is time that we proceed to get this out in the open and let the American people judge what is right and what is wrong.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I recently added my name to the list of cosponsors of S. 224, introduced by Senator Warner, which will allow Medicare-eligible military retirees to join the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. After hearing from military retirees in Montana, I am convinced that this is a necessary step to help ensure that military retirees have access to quality health care. 
When military retirees turn 65, they no longer have guaranteed access to military health care. The lucky ones can get services from military treatment facilities [MTF's] on a space-available basis, but the rest do not have access to MTF's. They must rely on Medicare, which has less generous benefits, despite the commitment they received for lifetime health benefits by virtue of their service to this country. They are the only group of Federal employees to have their health benefits cut off at age 65. That's just not right. 
This bill offers a simple solution by allowing military retirees who are eligible for Medicare to join the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. This is a popular program which provides good benefits at a reasonable cost. It will serve military retirees well and uphold the Government's commitment to provide quality health benefits. Our military retirees deserve no less.

Mr. BURNS. Would the esteemed chairman of the Finance Committee be willing to enter a colloquy on the rail deficit reduction fuel tax? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-burns-mt-2-19970627</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BURNS. As the chairman is aware, the 1990 and 1993 Budget Reconciliation Acts imposed a 2.5-cent-per-gallon and a 4.3-cent-per-gallon diesel fuel tax for deficit reduction on railroads and highway users. Beginning October 1995, 2.5 cents of the trucking industry's deficit reduction tax was directed to the Highway Trust Fund. The remaining highway 4.3 cents remained in place for deficit reduction purposes, while the rail rate was set at 5.55 cents per gallon, also effective October 1995. As a result of these acts, the freight rail industry currently pays 1.25 cents per gallon more for deficit reduction than its primary competitors.

Mr. BURNS. While the Highway Trust Fund provides the financing for construction and maintenance of public roads and bridges used by trucks and automobiles, the railroad industry realizes no similar return on its tax payments. Railroads currently expend more than $7 billion annually in capital to build and maintain their own `roads.' These private rights-of-ways are subject to more than $400 million annually in local property taxes. While few Senators are more dedicated to the goal of deficit reduction than I, it seems that the burden of reducing the Federal deficit must be shared equally among competing modes of transportation. 
The Senate Finance Committee adopted an amendment to the chairman's Mark which would transfer the 4.3-cent-per-gallon deficit reduction tax paid by highway users to the Highway Trust Fund--minus the new half-cent tax for the Intercity Rail Trust Fund--Amtrak. Additionally, the House Ways and Means Committee transferred the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax paid by aviation users to the Aviation Trust Fund. Assuming that these amendments remain in the bills, the rail industry will be paying 5.05 cents per gallon for deficit reduction while those in competing industries will be paying nothing for deficit reduction.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I will not take long. There are some folks I would like to extend my appreciation to. In the Senate today, when we passed the income averaging for our farmers and ranchers in Montana, we fulfilled a commitment that we made to those farmers and ranchers when we passed Freedom to Farm. We are in a transition; subsidies are going away, and now we are providing a vehicle, a tool with which we can maybe ride out the good years and prepare for the bad years without too much trouble. 
I express my appreciation to the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee for their help, also the efforts made by Senator Roberts of Kansas and Senator Bumpers of Arkansas, Senator Conrad of North Dakota and Senator Bond of Missouri and Senator Hagel of Nebraska and my friend and colleague, Senator Baucus from Montana. 
Without help from those Senators on this issue, I am afraid we would not have been as successful as we were in justifying and trying to pass income averaging. It is very important. Who is it important to? It is important to the young farmers and ranchers just starting. We know they will have good years and we know they will have bad years right behind them due to the elements of Mother Nature, to prices of commodities raised on our farms and ranches. This allows a way to hang on and spread that income out and survive in agriculture. After all, we produce the best food, the most of it, the cheapest of any country in the world. So this is a winner for all of America, not just American agriculture. 
I thank you and I yield the floor.

I too was opposed to the legislation approved by the committee last week, but know that we still have the opportunity to pass a meaningful bill that will allow American industry to compete with the rest of the world in the global information marketplace. I believe that we can pass a bill that will not compromise our national security or law enforcement interests. As I sat through the markup last week, it occurred to me that we had allowed the issue of encryption to be framed as the issue of child pornography or gambling. I want to be sure that all parties understand that the reform of encryption security standards is not related to these issues. 
I have often said that encryption is simply like putting a stamp on an envelope rather than sending a postcard because you don't want others to read your mail. Encryption is simply about people protecting their private information, about companies and governments protecting their information, from medical records to tax returns to intellectual property from unauthorized access. Hackers, espionage agents, and those just wanting to cause mischief must be restrained from access to private information over the Internet. 
When used correctly, encryption can enable citizens in remote locations to have access to the same information, the same technology, the same quality of health care, that citizens of our largest cities have. Perhaps most importantly, it is about ensuring that American companies have the tools they need to continue to develop and provide the leading technology in the global marketplace. Without this leadership, our national security and sovereignty will surely be threatened.

Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Delaware. 
Mr. President, no one on this floor makes his case with such passion as my friend from West Virginia. We have a couple of things in common that we will not go into here. But I also know from where he comes. And when you start talking about this issue of singling out something, then we have to look at probably the real facts. 
First, there is the presumption in this amendment that somehow the advertising is evil or bad, or that it wreaks health problems on the American people. There is no question in anybody's mind across this land that the abuse of alcohol is one of our greatest problems--no doubt. Yet, there is no scientific evidence that would even suggest the casual relationship between advertising and abuse. 
In order to get to the root of the problem of alcoholism and all of the problems that it brings, study after study after study has been made in the relationship of advertising. In fact, during the 1980's, when the advertising for alcohol products was increasing, actual consumption per capita actually was decreasing. So not only does advertising not impact abuse, it doesn't even impact the overall consumption. 
Singling out a product is not, I don't think, what fair tax law is about. 
So let's be upfront about it, because I am familiar with the broadcast industry. It has economic impacts on small business. It has economic impacts. And once we start singling out products, do we start talking about red meat, eggs, or sugar? Where do we draw the line? The impact it might have on the national pastime? We could say, `OK, we don't need it in the broadcasting industry. We can all pay for pay-per-view'--the impact on an industry within itself. And the list goes on and on trying to explain to our constituents why different things happen and cost more, because there is a decrease in advertising support in free television. That also brings us our weather, our farm reports, our news, our emergency conditions. All of these things that are supported by free over-the-air broadcasts will be impacted if this amendment is successful. 
The industry has taken steps to limit or try to curb the abuse that alcohol has on a person or individual. There is no doubt about it. And in some areas some would say it is even working. 
I know that all of us want a tax cut. All of us want a balanced budget. But to single out and start limiting an ad tax or deductibility for legal products is not the right approach. It is not the right approach--not on a legal product. 
So I urge my colleagues to oppose this. It is unwarranted. I think it is unwise. And I am not real sure, it might have some constitutional overtones because advertising is still freedom of speech. It cannot be treated differently than any other form. 
The Senator from West Virginia makes a point. It is the abuse of the product. The advertising has very little to do with the abuse of the product. 
Thank you, and I urge the defeat of this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair. 
Earlier this evening an amendment was offered to do away with the depletion allowance on mining. It seems every year we have to go through this process really explaining what the National Mining Act is all about. 
Yes, we have been awfully close to coming up with some kind of agreement for reform of the act. We have been so close that everybody agreed, but one would get the feeling--although it seemed like it fell apart, I get the distinct feeling that those who would reform the act or be the reformers want the issue rather than the results. I am always reminded of John Adams when he come back to the Congress and was asked about an issue. He said duty is ours; results are reserved to God. 
Let us look at the intent of the Mining Act. It is as true today as it was in the days it was written. This act has been around about 120 or 125 years. I would say to anybody who lives in this country and owns property, even though it may be his private home in an urban area, the ownership of his own home, which means land ownership or property ownership, which has been one of the cornerstones of America, the building of America and the freedom of us as a people, has been the result of a land tenure act. It was a way that we moved all the lands in this United States of America into private ownership. 
That is what the Mining Act was all about. We have had only two, I think, maybe three, major land tenure acts. One of them was the Homestead Act, and that was a result of the Louisiana Purchase, where you were deeded 160 acres of land, and if you proved it up to be viable, then they gave you ownership of that land. And ever since then, it has changed hands many times, but it has allowed us to own property, land, and real estate. It has been the cornerstone of our economy. 
In mining, it was a little bit different, but yet it was a land tenure act. It was a deal struck by this Government that owned millions of acres of land telling a miner that if you go out and you find a mineral, whether it be precious metals or trace minerals or whatever, and it has value and you prove it up to be a viable enterprise, we will guarantee you the surface of that land and access to that deposit. You invest your money, and if there is nothing there, we do not as a government owe you anything and you can go merrily on the way, and the land belongs and stays in the ownership of the Government of the United States of America. 
I think I would be laughed out of this building if I went down to appropriations and said I have a government agency that wants to explore for silver or gold or platinum or palladium or anything else and asked for an appropriation of $20 million to explore and to prove up a claim. That is risking a lot of taxpayers' money. I would be told, why, this is the craziest thing we have ever heard. Taxpayers didn't give us the money for such a cockamamy idea of going out and exploring for that mineral. 
So what did we do? We struck a deal. You invest, Mr. Miner, your money, your time, your equipment. If you find it, that's good. If you do not, then the Government is not out anything. But we guaranteed access and we guaranteed surface rights if a mineral or precious metal was found. 
The National Mining Act was never an environmental act. It does not exempt mining companies from the environmental laws that are in place both by the State and the Federal Government. 
They are not exempt of that--clean air, clean water. They are required to reclaim it after the mine has been mined out. All it was, was to guarantee Americans access to a precious metal or mineral. Yet, those who would want to change it say that is no longer important. 
We could have settled on royalties, could have settled on land price, could have settled on all of that. But the reformers refused to accept it. So I say, before we do too much changing, let's really understand what the law is all about, because it works today as it did whenever the law was made the law of the land. It seems like there are a lot of folks who do not understand that. They did not understand the Homestead Act either. This country eats, provides food for its families, cheaper than any other society in the world as a percentage of your paycheck going solely for food for your family. That was done because American agriculture owns the land. It is their farm. They make it produce. It is as competitive as selling shoes or watermelons. It does not make any difference. But all of that was the result of a land tenure act called the Homestead Act. 
Why do we have to turn around and explain this every time this issue comes up? Yet, there are those who would like to twist and turn and not really represent the act for what it really is and why it was designed that way. They say gold miners get rich on gold. Where is it used, for jewelry? No, not really. We wouldn't even have a space program if we didn't have gold and silver, because there is as much of it used in electronics as there is in jewelry. 
The only platinum or palladium mine is found in Montana. It is the only one in this country. It is one of three in the whole world. If you didn't have palladium, you wouldn't have catalytic converters to protect our air. Yet, there would be those who would say maybe it is not a necessity--until we look at the manufacturing and our science and our technologies, of what these trace minerals and these other minerals are really worth to this country. 
Do we want to get as dependent on our precious metals and minerals as we are on oil? We are almost 51 percent dependent on oil from offshore. Is that energy policy? Does that give us energy security? I don't think so. 
So we have to be very, very cautious whenever we start talking about a subject and a law that a lot of people say, `Well, they're ripping off the Government.' What's just the opposite is true. Because that mine provides jobs; it provides a tax base in many counties. In the West, that is the only thing they have. It provides public safety and roads and schools. It is the backbone of that county's economy. Yet, there are those who say tourism is growing and it is taking over and we don't need mining anymore. I don't know of anybody who wants to stand around and flip hamburgers for $4.25 an hour, or whatever it is, when you could probably get a better job producing something, producing wealth for this country. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. 
Those of us who come out of, let's say, natural resources or agriculture, I guess we look at it a little bit different. But you look at it different when you come up through those ranks, as some of us in this room have done, including the Presiding Officer who is in the chair tonight. It doesn't hurt to have a little dirt under your fingernails so you understand what makes things go in this country. All new wealth, all new wealth produced in this country comes from either the renewable resource of the Earth and, sometimes, some of it from the finite resources that are found in this Earth. That is where new wealth is produced. It is produced nowhere else. Every one of us chase the dollar around. But, especially in the renewables, that is the real worth of a nation. And those renewables were produced on private land ownership where people took care of it, managed their resources and made a community and a State and a nation grow. 
So, when we start talking about the national mining act and how it should be changed, let's be very cautious and remember why it was passed in the first place. Why it was passed in the first place--mining is very, very risky. I can't go to Appropriations and appropriate money just to go out and scratch around the hills and try to find a gold nugget, because it just will not happen. 
So I will oppose the Bumpers amendment tomorrow. I think there will be a point of order raised on it anyway. But, nonetheless, let's not forget just exactly the reason the mining act was passed and why it works today, just like it did when it was passed 120 years ago. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Madam President, today I introduce a bill that will ensure the Assiniboine and Sioux people of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana a safe and reliable water supply system. The Fort Peck Reservation is located in northeastern Montana. It is one of the largest reservations in the United States, and has a population of more than 10,000. The Fort Peck Reservation faces problems similar to all reservations in the country, that of remote rural areas. This reservation also suffers from a very high unemployment rate, 75 percent. Added to all this, the populations on the reservation suffer from high incidents of heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. A safe and reliable source of water is needed to both improve the health status of the residents and to encourage economic development and thereby self-sufficiency for this area. 
This legislation would authorize a reservation-wide municipal, rural, and industrial water system for the Fort Peck Reservation. It would provide a much needed boost to the future of the region and for economic development, and ultimately economic self-sufficiency for the entire area. My bill has the support of the residents of the reservation and the endorsement of the tribal council of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes. 
The residents of the Fort Peck Reservation are now plagued with major drinking water problems. In one of the communities, the sulfate levels in the water are four times the standard for safe drinking water. In four of the communities the iron levels are five times the standard. Sadly, some families were forced to abandon their homes as a result of substandard water quality. Basically, the present water supply system is inadequate and unreliable to supply a safe water supply to those people that live on the reservation. 
Several of the local water systems have had occurrences of biological contamination in recent years. As a result, the Indian Health Service has been forced to issue several health alerts for drinking water. In many cases, residents of reservation communities are forced to purchase bottled water. Not a big deal to those who can afford it, but difficult to a population that has the unemployment rate found on the Reservation. All this, despite the fact that within spitting distance is one of the largest man-made reservoirs in the United States, built on the Missouri River. 
Agriculture continues to maintain the No. 1 position in terms of economic impact in Montana. In a rural area like the Fort Peck Reservation agriculture plays the key role in the economy, more so than in many areas of the State. The water system authorized by the legislation will not only provide a good source of drinking water, but also a water supply necessary to protect and preserve the livestock operations on the reservation. A major constraint on the growth of the livestock industry around Fort Peck has been the lack of an adequate 
watering site for cattle. This water supply system would provide the necessary water taps to fill watering tanks for livestock, which in normal times would boost the local economy of the region and the State. An additional benefit of this system would be more effective use of water for both water and soil conservation and rangeland management. 
The future water needs of the reservation are expanding. Data shows that the reservation population is growing, as many tribal members are returning to the reservation. It is clear that the people that live on the reservation, both tribal and nontribal members, are in desperate need of a safe and reliable source of drinking water. 
The solutions to this need for an adequate and safe water supply is a reservation wide water pipeline that will deliver a safe and reliable source of water to the residents. In addition this water project will be constructed in size to allow communities off the reservation the future ability to tap into the system. A similar system for water distribution is currently in use on a reservation in South Dakota. 
The surrounding communities have also agreed with the importance of this system. Last year when I introduced this bill, there were no additional communities signed on to the system. Today, the surrounding communities have signed on and look at this system as a means of supplying clean, safe drinking water to their residents. 
The people of the Fort Peck Reservation, and the State of Montana are only asking for one basic life necessity. Good, clean, safe drinking water. This is something that the more developed regions of the Nation take for granted, but in rural America we still seek to develop. 
I realize the importance of getting this bill introduced and placed before the proper committee. This action will allow us to move forward and provide a basic necessity to the people of this region in Montana. Good, clean, safe drinking water.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Dean Folkvord of Wheat Montana Farms and Bakery of Three Forks on winning the Small Business Person of the Year Award. It is a real pleasure to recognize Dean and his family for his dedication and hard work. 
There is a fierce competition in Montana for Small Business Person of the Year since 98 percent of our businesses are classified as small, and that makes Dean's accomplishments special. I was amazed when I learned of it, but Wheat Montana mills more wheat in a year than is grown in Montana. It takes a truly successful operation to handle that much wheat. 
Mr. President, I am proud to say we have many small business success stories like Wheat Montana, and many folks like Dean keeping our economy growing and putting Montanans to work. There were two close runners-up for this award this year, and many other small businesses were awarded in other categories. Together, they are the engine that keeps Montana running. 
Congratulations again to Dean Folkvord and the Wheat Montana family, and to Montana's entire small business community for all you do.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S. 765 I want to stress the importance of this measure and urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
Mr. President, the Safety and Health Advancement Act is based on one simple premise: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] can be more effective at ensuring safe working environments by working with businesses than by waiting for violations to occur and then issuing fines. The purpose of this bill is to refocus OSHA's mission from enforcement to consultation, without putting a straightjacket on its ability to enforce when required.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I recently added my name to the list of 37 cosponsors of S. 127 on behalf of those hard-working folks who are trying to get ahead in their jobs by going back to school while they work. The Employee Educational Assistance Act will make permanent the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance under section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. By doing so, it will remove the penalty part-time students face in the form of higher taxes when their employers provide educational assistance. 
Mr. President, this bill's sponsor, Senator Moynihan, said it well: This is a very effective program which requires no bureaucracy and which administers itself. Employers and employees arrange for the educational assistance, and the Government's role is to stay out of the way. For example, MSE Technologies Inc. in Butte, MT, provides assistance to its employees who are working on undergraduate or graduate degrees. For MSE this is a wise investment in its employees and helps to keep the company competitive. With section 127 in place, employees can receive up to $5,250 annually in tuition reimbursements from their employer without paying additional taxes. Without section 127, employees are taxed on the educational assistance they receive. This tax is exactly the wrong message to send to businesses and their employees trying to stay ahead. 
Section 127, which first went into effect in 1979, will expire in 3 months. The provision has been extended numerous times, and it has widespread support. But the uncertainty of the provision's future has been disruptive to workers and made planning ahead difficult. The full potential of its benefits to workers and employers is not being met, and it won't be until we make it permanent. Let's make helping American workers stay competitive a top priority.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to express my gratitude to all the folks who made possible the passage of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act reauthorization bill. It's been a real struggle over the last 2 years, but a concerted effort led by David Hoppe of Majority Leader Lott's staff has resulted in a compromise bill that received near unanimous support in both the House and the Senate. I was among those voting for this bill. 
Mr. President, Montana's schools are breathing a sigh of relief that they will have more flexibility in dealing with disruptive students who pose a threat to teachers and other students. At the same time, the bill preserves the right of disabled students to a free appropriate public education. 
However, as with all compromises, there is something in this bill for everyone to dislike. I don't think the bill goes far enough in giving local educational agencies the ability to remove and expel dangerous students. I supported Senator Gorton's amendment to allow local agencies to develop their own policies on disciplining students. This amendment was defeated. 
I also have serious concerns about the costs of implementing this bill, costs which fall directly on the States and the school districts. Make no mistake: at current Federal funding levels, this bill is an unfunded mandate on the States. The Federal Government funds less than 10 percent of the bill's costs, though it has promised to pay 40 percent. This bill does not set funding levels--it is not an appropriations bill. We will have a separate debate on funding later in the year. But I want to point out that we are mandating that our local schools take specific actions which are very expensive and getting even more so every year. We must take more responsibility for our actions, and I hope we will do that when we debate funding later this year.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
History has to be recorded that this has probably been the most ever-changing and cloudy situation that we have faced here in the U.S. Senate. Some in this body have changed their minds as they have tried to read the public opinion polls, and even some of those who have served in the administration have done the same--the history, as it was articulated here by the majority leader, of getting caught up in Presidential politics in 1996. 
But basically what it was, it was most of us sitting down and reading the words and trying to make a decision based on what we think is best for our country. No matter the winds that blow in politics or in public opinion, this issue must be considered and decided on its merits. There is just too much at stake. The President has written a letter to the majority leader. If you will read the words real carefully, you could even say you could argue both sides of the issue on that letter alone. 
But I rise today to express my opposition to this Chemical Weapons Convention treaty. 
There are several reasons why I have chosen to oppose the treaty. Some would say that it is verifiable. I am not fully convinced of that, yet. Some would say that it does not hinder or break the Constitution. I think I would question that. When it comes to sovereignty of the United States, I would say that very much was in jeopardy. However, I will focus my concerns with article XI and my fears that this article will compromise both the United States and the citizens that live here. 
Article XI of the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty prohibits countries from denying others access to dual-use chemicals--that means chemicals that can be used in any manner--processes, and technology. In effect, mandating access to and sharing of materials and the methods of making chemical weapons. By legitimizing commerce in dangerous, dual-use chemicals and processes the CWC will increase, not reduce, the ability of countries to acquire chemical weapons. 
Second, Mr. President, article XI gives states the treaty right to: 
Facilitate and have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of chemicals, equipment, and scientific and technical information relating to the development and the application of chemistry for [peaceful] purposes . . . 
Have we not had enough experience over nuclear problems of this world, just with one country that is on this planet? 
Third, transferring chemical-related technologies and material to members of the CWC such as Cuba, Iran, India, Pakistan, and China will help them establish and/or improve their chemical weapons programs. This is because there is very little difference between the legitimate commercial chemical processes and those processes used to make chemical weapons. 
Article XI also legitimizes trade in dangerous dual-use chemicals. The treaty right will be used by countries such as China, India, and Russia to override Western objections to their provision of sensitive chemicals and production technologies to countries such as Iran. China and India already supply Iran with such chemicals, but the CWC will legitimize this trade and allow these countries to expand the volume of commerce conducted in dual-use chemicals. 
Mr. President, I take a moment to focus on the fact that by ratifying this treaty, Iran will be permitted to have access to our chemical secrets, to have the ability to obtain chemical information from other rogue nations. If ratified, we are allowing a nation that we have confirmed, we have confirmed as a terrorist nation, one that is the primary suspect in numerous terrorist attacks against the United States, and one that calls for the destruction of this country to get more information, not less, on deadly chemicals. 
How many in this body think that if allowed this information, Iran will, of its own accord, destroy these potentially deadly weapons and not use them against United States citizens around the world? I think that is a legitimate question. How many in this body really think that the United States will be in a more secure position? Finally, how can we in clear conscience give them this information when American men and women have been murdered by their actions? 
Mr. President, for this reason, I cannot vote for the passage of this treaty. 
I have heard all the reasons why we would be just a tiny bit better off being part of the convention. Well, this Senator thinks you have to be a bigger part. It falsely promises security to our Nation, and would betray those U.S. citizens who have died by the hand of terrorists. I urge my fellow colleagues to contemplate what I have stated here. I urge a `no' vote on ratification of this treaty. This is not an easy decision but is a decision where the majority of people who serve in this body have read and have made their decision on what is actually in it and not the emotion of the times. I urge them to read it and vote accordingly. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Baucus and 23 of our fellow colleagues, to submit a resolution to designate April 30 as `National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day.' We are submitting this measure because, as you may know, a few years ago a series of anti-semitic and racially biased crimes occurred in my home town of Billings, MT. However, instead of ignoring these events, I am proud to say that the community united and worked together to ban these acts of hatred. We are hoping that the American people will learn from Montanans that racism and hate crimes can be done away with if we work together. 
According to the United States Department of Justice, there are almost 8,000 racially and biased crimes each year--and unfortunately, this number is rising. Due to this disappointing fact, my colleagues and I have determined that a day should be set aside to bring groups together that will work to begin to heal our Nation from the sins of our past and present. 
This day would serve as a day for people in the United States, and throughout the world, to recognize the importance of using every day as an opportunity to take a stand against hate crimes and violence in their neighborhoods, communities, states and nations. 
Through this legislation, we hope to reinforce in the American people that our diversity is something to be proud of. A new understanding of our differences would help bring forth a new respect for each other, and this resolution should serve as the vehicle to educate Americans and promote unity throughout our communities and States. 
Now, I realize that passage of this measure will not immediately obliterate racism from our country. But it is our responsibility, as Members of this distinguished, elected, body to set an example for the American people by speaking up for what is right and encouraging others to do so. 
I would like to offer a special thanks to the YWCA and the Anti-Defamation League for their assistance in garnering support for this measure. Their continued service to the American people in supporting diversity serves as a means to open the doors between divergent groups. They should be acknowledged and praised by all. 
We welcome each of our colleagues to join with us to work to eradicate the forces that divide us. Finally, I hope that by April 30, the American people are made aware of our thoughts and that we will work for justice for all.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 228, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. I commend Senator McCain for his leadership in drafting this important legislation. 
We all lose when the Government shuts down. In Montana, as well as across the Nation, Federal workers were furloughed and national parks were closed; businesses and families were negatively affected when the Government shut down in December 1995 and January 1996. Consequently, millions of dollars were lost. 
President Clinton put Congress between a rock and a hard place in that he knew that we did not want to risk another Government shutdown. We were forced to pass a budget that added $6 billion back into Clinton's pet programs. The President was more interested in playing politics than he was in balancing the budget. 
Montanans are tired of political games. We can not let the administration replay its efforts to force Congress to spend billions of dollars just to avoid the threat of a shutdown because of gridlock. It is the responsibility of the Government to work for the people--not against them. 
Senator McCain's bill provides a safeguard against Government shutdowns. It establishes an automatic continuing resolution to provide the lowest spending levels for Federal agencies and programs in the event that the annual appropriations bills are not enacted by the start of the fiscal year. This provides an incentive to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner. 
This bill also addresses the concerns of those on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security as it specifically states that entitlements will be paid regardless of what appropriations are passed. 
I feel that the Government Shutdown Prevention Act protects Montanans. No longer will Montana's elderly and disabled have to fear not being able to pay medical bills because of a Government shutdown. Welfare recipients will not have to worry about going hungry because of the President's political gameplaying. Finally, Montana communities like West Yellowstone, Gardiner, and Columbia Falls--which serve as gateways to Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks--will not suffer because gridlock has forced the closure of national monuments and parks. The Government Prevention Shutdown Act ensures that the Government is working for the benefit of Montana. This is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it was with great pleasure that on April 15, Tax Day, I joined with Senators Grassley and Moseley-Braun in cosponsoring the Loan Interest Forgiveness for Education Act, S. 573. 
With Americans scrambling last week to get their tax returns filed, this bill offers a bit of relief for students who rely on loans to pay their higher education bills. This legislation will restore the tax deduction for student loan interest, with eligibility for the deduction phased out for taxpayers with incomes between $65,000 and $85,000 (single returns) and $85,000 and $105,000 (joint returns). This modest step will take some of the sting out of repaying student loans. 
A college degree is more important in today's job market than it has ever been. At the same time, education costs continue to rise and the average debt of graduates is at record levels. On top of that, the tax burden has increased, putting a serious strain on college graduates as they work to pay off their loans and interest and still get ahead in the job market. 
Let us give student loan recipients a tax break. Let us send a message about the importance of student loans and higher education. This is a sound investment in our Nation's future.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in order to offer my support for the Congressional Pension Disclosure Act of 1997. 
This bill will require that detailed information about the pension of every Member of Congress be published twice a year. These facts--how much has been contributed to a pension plan, how much is to be received in retirement, and acquired Federal retirement benefits--should be public information. 
Montanans, as well as those in every other State, deserve the right to know how public funds are being spent. The disclosure of pension contributions and benefits will allow Montanans to judge whether or not the amounts are fair and just. Taxpayers will be able to make fully informed decisions about the kind of job we representatives are doing in abiding the will of the people and keeping Government spending under control. 
The Congressional Pension Disclosure Act will make facts readily available to anyone who wants them. Perception that Congress operates in secrecy would be eliminated and the people of Montana would know that their representatives have nothing to hide. Simply said, by disclosing the size of our pensions, we in Congress will make a step in the right direction toward restoring faith in government by the American people. 
I commend Senator Abraham for drafting this meaningful legislation, and I am proud to have signed on as a cosponsor of S. 269.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to sponsor a bill being introduced by myself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Johnson on an issue of great importance to my State and the agricultural industry in Montana. The issue is that of labeling meat coming into America from other countries. 
We are offering today language, which will require all meat products that come from a foreign country to be labeled with the country of origin of that meat. This will allow all Americans to know and understand where the meat they are purchasing really comes from. This bill will protect the consumer as well as an industry which has had to face severe competition from foreign countries in recent years. 
Today when shopping at the local grocery market, the American consumer is buying meat products without all the information they need to make an informed decision on the product they are purchasing. Our consumers go to the market and purchase meat products with no idea of where the meat they are buying comes from. Recent events in foreign countries have made this issue important to the retail consumer. Outbreak of disease and problems with the quality of foreign products makes it necessary that we provide our consumers with all the information they should have when making an informed decision about the food they are buying. 
If we look at the vast majority of products that are imported into our country, we find that they are labeled with the country in which that product was produced. We have consumers that for numerous years have established a custom of purchasing only products with a Made in America label. It only seems right that we provide these same consumers with the information that will allow them to make the same intelligent decision when shopping for the food that they consume. 
Our consumers today go to the market and buy meat products under the assumption that if it carries a USDA inspection and graded label that the meat they are purchasing comes from the United States. This, we have recently found out, can be far from the truth. Just carrying that label does nothing to inform the consumer that the hamburger they are purchasing is from this country. 
As I stated earlier, recent outbreaks of disease in foreign countries has haunted our American meat producers. The public fears that the beef they are buying could be from a European country with a disease that has killed their citizens. Out breaks in meat and vegetable products leads Americans to fear the purchase of American meat and vegetables because they are under the assumption that the product is American in origin. This is not always the case. The recent outbreak of hepatitis found in strawberries is proof. 
American agriculture provides the American consumer with the safest most reliable source of food and fiber in the world. With this in mind we then should be informing the American consumer that they really are purchasing American product or if they so chose product raised in a foreign country. 
I am proud and very pleased to add my name to this bill and I look forward to moving this through the legislative process so we can give our consumers the information on meat that we have provided to them on other numerous consumer goods.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is likely the single most frustrating day of the year for many Americans. What self-respecting member of any legislative body would not take to the floor and talk about his or her favorite subject, taxes? We could all relate to the tension of the day and the frustration of working our way through the `simplified' tax forms, worrying about making an inadvertent mistake. But, also, how we are going to do what is expected of us? With April 15 now upon us, it is time to reflect on our system of taxation and the burden it places on each and every one of us who live in this country. 
I know at times the IRS finds itself as the brunt of many jokes. But to a lot of folks in Montana, tax day is no laughing matter. The fact is, families all across this Nation are forced to make some tough financial choices each year around this time. Serious questions are being asked. What can we do as a family to pay our fair share of taxes? By and large, Americans know, and they understand that some taxes are necessary to pay for the essential government services: For education, for the infrastructure of transportation and other services that we enjoy. But the question also surfaces on how to balance our family needs. 
All too often, the options given require sacrifices. And, you know what? They affect children and they affect relationships. Most times, it is not fair. And sometimes it is just not right. 
Unfortunately, it seems we are living in an age when only one wage earner cannot live financially secure and comfortable. Nowadays, in order to make ends meet both parents are working, even though one may prefer to remain home with their children. Families in which one parent chooses to remain at home often struggle financially, living paycheck to paycheck, while, on the other hand, dual-income families find a disproportionate share of the second check being melted away with added expenses of cost of child care, additional transportation needs and so on, and still no tax relief on the burden that is suffered on the second paycheck. Neither situation leaves families in a comfortable financial condition. Time and time again we have seen bad economic conditions lead to the demise of families and the family structure. Who suffers? Our children suffer. 
I believe it is important that we begin the process of reform, which will allow our families more options and, in the end, allow them to keep more of what they earn. Those decisions should be and could be made at home instead of some IRS office or, yes, an office here in Washington, DC. Let families decide, make the financial decision of what to do with their income. All the polls that I have seen taken on the attitudes of Americans tell us that our current system of taxation is in bad need of reform. I agree. Giving Montanans and all Americans the opportunity to be financially secure should be the goal. 
I might add at this point, the Nation's tax collection agency also needs to do something about its own image. That may be a feat that borders on the impossible, but it should be attempted. There are two taxes, in my estimation, that are destructive of the majority of families. They are death taxes--the estate taxes--and capital gains. Montana, my State, is a State made up of family-run farms and ranches and small businesses. With regard to the death taxes, upon the death of an owner of a small family business or a family farmer ranch, the family is required to pay more than 55 percent of the value of the farm or business value in excess of $600,000. The only thing the survivors want to do is simply continue operating the family business or farm. 
But in most cases, they are forced to sell it in order to pay those death taxes. No one--no one, Mr. President--should be forced to sell the farm to save the farm. 
Another equally burdensome tax is the capital gains tax, which punishes those who choose to save and invest for their future. This tax affects everybody who saves and invests to ensure they can take care of themselves and their loved ones. Like the estate tax, the capital gains tax is punitive. It is a voluntary tax. You do not have to pay capital gains tax because you do not have to sell. If you do not sell, you limit economic opportunity in the financial community. 
Like the estate tax, it is a form of double taxation, moneys taxed once it is earned as income and again upon the sale of an asset or investment, and Lord knows how many times in between, making it even more difficult for families to save for the future. 
The capital gains tax has a top rate of 28 percent, which is among the highest in the world. Many of the world's strongest economic powers, including Germany, Hong Kong and South Korea, have no capital gains tax at all. These countries recognize the importance of savings. They also recognize the importance of investments, and they know what it takes to create jobs, maintain an economic growth and stability and, let's face it, governments cannot take all the money and provide a stable financial future for anybody with the exception of those who choose to exploit their own government. 
There is no question in my mind, in order to strengthen the American family, we must make them economically secure. No matter what we say or how good it seems, Government cannot do that. With juvenile crime at an all-time high, there is no hope for young people if they cannot see a future that allows them to use their God-given talents to ensure economic and political freedom. 
We must put in place those policies that allow us to provide essential Government services, help those who cannot help themselves and build the infrastructure that provides us with opportunity and promise for the future. We must work to ease the excessive tax burden being shouldered by families. 
It would be a noble work, indeed, in this Senate, if we could provide for the time when decisions could be made by families at the kitchen table with regard to their economic and political future, when parents had more options. We must provide them. 
Through reform and reduction of our tax burden, this process can begin. The opportunity exists at this time, and the time is now. It ensures parents the opportunity to raise their children comfortably and provide for a stable, financially secure future. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the joint resolution that the majority leaders, my fellow Republican and Democratic colleagues, and the administration has concluded with relation to certification of Mexico. Even though I do not think that this resolution goes far enough, I realize that this agreement is a bipartisan effort that should be enacted for the good of the Nation. 
Frankly, I am disappointed that we consider a nation that supports drug cartels and warlords worthy of programs funded by the hard earned dollars of American tapayers. However, this resolution will make certain demands of Mexico and the administration to ensure that progress is made in Mexico. This resolution does not entirely burden Mexico with this responsibility; it will also create a partnership. This partnership will try to strengthen bilateral border enforcement, create a permanent working relationship between law enforcement agencies of both nations and actually assist Mexico to identify, remove and prosecute corrupt officials at all levels of Government. By creating this partnership, Mexico and the United States will closely study this situation and actually try to ensure that both of our efforts are being met. With such limited resources, our assistance to Mexico should make a difference. 
Mr. President, we must work toward ensuring that Mexico halts these destructive practices for our most precious national asset, our children. Over the past few years, there has been a marked increase in the levels of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana flowing into the United States through Mexico. This is hitting every urban and rural community in the United States. The protection of our most vulnerable possession, our children is the strongest argument for the passage of this legislation. 
Finally, we should not be saying to the American people that this law is only good if we can also pass the chemical weapons convention treaty. This is not to suggest my opposition or support for the treaty, but I believe that each issue should be kept separate so as to ensure that both are considered on their own merits. 
Thus, the most important issue for this Congress today--the only issue for Congress today--is to move forward on this resolution.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fair and Responsible Fund Use Act. It is a bill that will provide for the return of funds, rejected by a State, to the Treasury. These funds will then be used specifically to reduce the Federal deficit. 
Sometimes the Federal Government makes available to Montana, and other States, funds which are inconsistent with State priorities. Usually this money comes with strings attached. In other words, the Federal Government wants us to take X action to get Y dollars. Sometimes, out of fiscal conservatism, or philosophical differences, States will return that money to the Treasury. But what has been the reward for an individual State's refusal to grab the Federal carrot that has been dangled in front of it? That money is returned to the program for use by other States. 
That's just not right. California or New York should not be the beneficiaries of Montana's restraint and good judgment. The good people of Montana have asked me to take action to stop this from happening and that's why I am introducing this bill today. The Fair and Responsible Fund Use Act will require that we take those funds returned by the States and use them to pay down our national deficit. 
Montana and 48 other States are required by law to balance their budgets. While we came one vote short of making that the standard for this Nation, most of us here in Washington are still determine to balance our books. If a State has the courage and willingness to do without a quick Federal buck, then it's only right that the American people, as a whole, should benefit from that action. 
Whatever the States send back may seem like small potatoes to some people, but as the late Senator Everett Dirksen once said, `A billion here, and a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.' 
We face the very real danger of being crushed by our national deficit. Some of our mindless spending in the past years has left us with a debt of 5.34 trillion dollars-- `trillion' with a capital `T.' And it's only going to get worse if we don't do something to help out. 
This bill makes good common sense. We all must work together in order to pay off the huge national deficit and this is one step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the confirmation of Merrick Garland to the D.C. circuit. 
Even though the nominee has the character and is highly qualified for the position, there is a larger question that must be examined. Does this seat really need to be filled? Especially since it has remained empty for 1 1/2 years? 
The answer is that the D.C. circuit does not need another seat, especially when there are many other problems in the other district circuits that have not been focused on yet. I base my opinion on the fact that the D.C. circuit had 4,359 cases as of October 1996. The ninth circuit, the circuit in which Montana is housed, had 71,462 cases. That is almost 20 times the number of cases. The D.C. circuit ranked last in the total number of cases as compared to each of the other district circuits in the Nation. If we examine these numbers, it does not seem as if the D.C. judges are handling any cases at all. 
This is also a very expensive seat. It will cost the American taxpayers an extra $1 million to fill this seat. This will not be money well spent. 
There are adequate numbers of judges on the circuit, why are we confirming this seat? I urge my colleagues to examine the numbers and vote against the filling of this unneeded seat.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 75, the Family Heritage Preservation Act, I urge my colleagues to support the immediate passage of this measure before more family businesses and farms are lost. 
They say the only things that are certain in life are death and taxes. The Government has done a perverse job of combining the two in the Federal estate and gift taxes and the tax on generation-skipping transfers, known as the death taxes. These are the taxes assessed on assets passed from one generation to another, such as family businesses, ranches, and farms. The tax rate starts at 37 percent and quickly rises to a whopping 55 percent, often forcing the liquidation of assets just to pay the tax.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the Home-Based Business Fairness Act of 1997, introduced yesterday by Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Bond, I rise in strong support of this measure and urge the Senate to approve it as soon as possible. 
This legislation is composed of three vitally important provisions, and together they make this measure one of the most important the Senate will consider during this Congress. First, this legislation will increase the health insurance deduction for self-employed individuals to 100 percent from the current 40 percent. Second, it will restore the home-office tax deduction where a taxpayer performs essential business functions in a home office used exclusively for business purposes. Finally, it will clarify when a worker is an employee versus an independent contractor, removing the uncertainty of the IRS's current test which can hit small businesses retroactively with liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties. These measures are especially important in Montana, where 98 percent of our businesses are small businesses, accounting for 72.7 percent of all employment in our State. This 72 percent is considerably higher than the 53 percent for the United States as a whole. And we're growing: Montana leads the Nation in new business incorporations. So when we talk about small business issues such as the home-office tax deduction, the health insurance deduction for the self-employed, the independent contractor classification, and other issues, these are the issues affecting Montana businesses. 
Many of today's workers spend part of their time working at home, often performing administrative duties such as billing. These workers either have no permanent office or perform their main duties in an unconventional environment, such as an operating room. For them, the work performed in a home office is an essential part of their job, even though it may not be the main part of their job. Back in 1993, the Supreme Court in Commissioner versus Soliman created a restrictive test for determining eligible home-based functions. Functions such as billing, though essential, do not meet the Soliman test. The Court went well beyond congressional intent and even beyond the IRS's own interpretation of the law. 
Shortly after the Soliman decision, I introduced the Home Office Tax Deduction Bill, and I've been pushing for it ever since. We must allow a tax deduction for essential activities, such as billing, performed in the home when that is the only available place for such activities. As the law now stands, workers like Dr. Soliman who spend 15 hours per week doing billing in an exclusive home office are denied the deduction. That's not right. Home offices that are used regularly and solely for business purposes--whether it's by physicians, salespeople, or mothers working at home--should be an allowable deduction. I am proud to be a cosponsor of Sen. Hatch's bill which, like this bill, will restore the deduction for essential functions. 
I was very pleased that last Congress we enacted an increase in the health insurance tax deduction for the self-employed to 80 percent by 2006. This is a positive first step, but why should not small businesses receive a 100 percent deduction just like big businesses? Health care costs are one of the main barriers to successful self-run businesses, and this modest proposal will go a long way toward helping these businesses survive and thrive. 
Finally, the top priority of small businesses is clarification of the independent contractor definition. The current 20-part test used by the IRS to determine who is an employee, for which, of course, employers must pay Federal taxes, is confusing and imprecise. The law is tough to follow when it is unpredictable from case to case. This bill simply clarifies who is an independent contractor by applying a clear three-part test. Businesspeople need a simple rule to follow, and this will provide it. No business should be subject to the whim of the IRS. 
I thank Chairman Bond for his leadership on this bill and I look forward to working with him to get it to the President's desk.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to commend the majority leader for reintroducing the Older Americans Freedom to Work Act, S. 202, which I recently have cosponsored. This bill will repeal the Social Security earnings limitation, which punishes seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 for working. That's right--for working. 
The earnings limit, like so many other Government policies, is outdated. Back in the 1930's, it may have made sense to encourage older workers to leave the work force by reducing their Social Security benefits if they worked beyond age 65. But today, the opposite is true: With the baby boomers getting ready to retire, and with a higher life expectancy, we should be encouraging folks to work longer. Most important, workers should have the freedom to work longer if they want to. 
Last year, after a long-fought effort by Majority Leader Lott and many others, we enacted a gradual increase in the earnings limit from $13,500 today to $30,000 per year in 2002. That is, for seniors between the ages of 65 and 69, each $3 earned over $30,000 per year reduces the worker's Social Security benefits by $1. While this increase is certainly helpful, there is no sound reason for retaining any earnings limitation on seniors who continue to work. That's why this bill is so important. Let's not discourage seniors from working--let's guarantee their freedom to work.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the home office tax deduction bill introduced today by Senator Hatch, I rise in strong support of this measure and urge its expeditious passage in the Senate. 
Today, home-based business is the new workplace. The new workplace is interactive video, the Internet, and digital documents. Telecommuting is now common, saving travel costs and time. But it's not just a matter of cost, it's a matter of lifestyle. With technology, the new workplace means you can live anywhere you want and still make a living doing what you love. And spend a few extra hours with the kids. In my State of Montana, where there's a lot of dirt between light bulbs, those extra hours really add up. 
Back in 1993, shortly after the Supreme Court's Soliman decision, I introduced the home office tax deduction bill, and I've been pushing for it ever since. We must allow a tax deduction for essential activities, such as billing, performed in the home when that is the only available place for such activities. As the law now stands, workers like Dr. Soliman who spend 15 hours per week doing billing in an exclusive home office are denied the deduction. That's not right. Home offices that are used regularly and solely for business purposes--whether it's by physicians, salespeople, or mothers working at home--should be an allowable deduction. 
A few weeks ago the Senate Small Business Committee, of which I am a member, held a hearing on women-owned and home-based businesses. We heard from small businesspeople who expressed their frustration with Federal tax laws that hinder their ability to succeed. Some of today's largest companies started as home businesses, and the potential for job and economic growth is unlimited, provided the tax code is not a barrier to that growth. 
I thank Senator Hatch for introducing this measure today.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for S. 6, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997. As a cosponsor of this bill, I want to take a moment to discuss why it is so important that we act on it as soon as possible. 
Mr. President, as my voting record shows, I have always voted pro-life on issues concerning abortion. However, my support for S. 6 and my vote on the partial birth abortion ban during the 104th Congress was not simply a moral judgment on abortion. This debate is not about reproductive choice; it's not even about abortion. Partial birth abortion is a cruel procedure and is abhorrent to most Americans. In fact, most physicians believe it is never medically necessary. This procedure is far beyond human decency. 
Mr. President, it is shocking to me that the debate over partial birth abortion is even necessary. A procedure whereby a child is partly delivered and then its brains are suctioned out has no place in a civilized society. It certainly has no place in America. Let's join together, pro-life and pro-choice, and do the right thing. Let's put an end to this cruel procedure.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act of 1997, I rise to express my strong support for this legislation. 
Mr. President, Americans have always struggled to balance the conflicting demands of work and family, but today, more than ever, families, especially double earners, are finding the old, rigid workplace structure of a different era to be the main barrier to a family friendly schedule. This is ironic because today's technology makes telecommuting from home common through the Internet and interactive video, allowing the flexibility many workers need to spend more time with their families. 
The problem is that in the eyes of our Federal laws the workplace has not changed since the 1930's. Federal wage-and-hour laws were developed during the New Deal era, when about one mother in six with school-aged children worked. But the workplace is vastly different today. Over 70 percent of mothers with kids in school work, and the rigid 8-hour-per-day, 40-hour-per-week work schedule is less rational or justifiable. Simply put, the wage-and-hour laws belong in a different era--one that ended about 50 years ago. 
Federal Government workers have had a flexible work schedule option for three decades. Under a flextime arrangement, many Federal employees work 10-hour days, 4 days per week. For a mother with a young child, this means 1 less day per week she'll have to pay for daycare. You can bet that adds up. 
Flextime has been a tremendous benefit for Federal workers, especially women. Why shouldn't non-Federal workers have this benefit as well? The answer is that they should, and that's what S. 4 will do. Under this bill, an employee will have three options: First, flexible scheduling--to work additional hours 1 week for credit, up to 50 hours, toward a shorter work day or work week later at full pay; second, bi-weekly scheduling--to schedule 80 hours over a 2-week period in any combination; or third, compensatory time off--to choose time-and-a-half compensatory time off, up to 240 hours--160 hours at time-and-a-half, for overtime hours worked in lieu of time-and-a-half pay. No employee may be required to participate in these programs, and coercion or intimidation by the employer with respect to participation is prohibited. 
This is commonsense legislation endorsed by Working Women and Working Mother magazines. It's time to tear down the barriers to a family friendly workplace and give hardworking Americans the flexibility to spend time with their families.

Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from Delaware. 
I rise today with some concerns about the new trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky. But I also rise to support her nomination. She has proven herself to be a tough negotiator as the acting trade representative. She recently played a major role in the opening of foreign markets in telecommunications, an agreement which we hope will decrease the costs of international calls and likely to have similar impact on domestic rates as well as U.S. companies competing on a worldwide basis. 
But on the other hand, Ms. Barshefsky's bidding on the administration's behalf of NAFTA to expand into some South American countries has me somewhat concerned. 
There is nobody in this body who fights harder for his people than the Senator from South Carolina. And I think I know why, because I visited that State one time, and he walks among those people who have lost their jobs in textile mills and understands those people's pain. 
We are now suffering that kind of a pain because of the border wars with Canada in the State of Montana. Whenever you start talking about fast tracking authority to expand NAFTA, and you understand the effect NAFTA has had on us in the beef industry and the grain industry--and that is what I am; I am not anything else fancy--then I say we have to approach that very cautiously, 
because I am not going to lower the living standards of my farmers for the sake of so-called free trade unless it is fair trade. If left unchecked, it will also contribute to the devastation of other sectors in our Nation's economy as well, if we do not just look at some of these things. 
We live in a free economy, we live in a global economy. I admit while Canadian livestock producers reap the benefits of new profit markets, Montana producers are hit with a flood of imports at the same time that the cattle market is already at the bottom of its scale. So we cannot afford any more of this. To stem that, we will have to do it through enabling legislation. 
I say that the pending amendment is one that has to be discussed among the FCC, keeping in mind that the final rule of last year's telecom bill has not been written yet. So, I have some very strong concerns about the expansion that this President and this administration want to take. We see loaded trucks with cattle going through Montana, and we say, are they stopping here? And they say, no, they are going south. We lost the Mexican market, plus we lost some of our own markets through the last little deal. We got snookered a little bit talking about NAFTA. 
I oppose any kind of fast track as far as the expansion of NAFTA is concerned because I think it has to be done the right way. I voted against it the first time, understanding where the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Montana were coming from, and I will probably, unless we have a mechanism we can work out these troubles that we have, playing on a level playing field, I am saying right now that if you want to ship cattle into the United States, I want you to have the same rules and regulations, the same environmental laws as we have to comply with in this country. That is only fair. 
If Ms. Barshefsky is a tough negotiator, I will stand beside her, but do not use agriculture as a pawn and then sell it out like we have in times past. One has to remember that agriculture is still the largest contributor to the GDP in this country. I will support her in the upcoming confirmation vote and hope that she works with us in Congress whenever negotiations of expansion get under way. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Utah, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, the old words come back to haunt us almost during these times of debate, especially over the issue of a balanced budget. I quote the words of Thomas Jefferson when he was speaking to the Framers of the Constitution. He expressed these words of his concerns regarding debt: 
We, Congress, should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them ourselves. 
Why is it so hard to understand that the Federal Government should balance the budget when State governments and county governments and city governments do? Why is it that we cannot accumulate or mandate to carry reserves in each line for a rainy day? That is not too hard to understand, and that is what we are talking about here, responsibility and the integrity of Government to function. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, last month, the Secretary of Agriculture announced the new rules and regulations on the Conservation Reserve Program in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We find that we are starting to take a program that has been claimed as one of the great success programs, as far as soil conservation, watershed management, wildlife habitat, in our respective States. There is no doubt about it, that we have land that was taken out of production that was marginal land, should never have been in row crop or crop production, should have been grass all those years, and we have noticed an increase, a notable increase in upland bird populations, also in white tail deer and other wildlife that depend on a habitat that the CRP would afford. 
There has been a rule change, however. This was brought to our attention by our good friends and neighbors who are living and working on the grain farms of Montana, and especially in eastern Montana. The announcement by U.S. Department of Agriculture to start a sign up for an extension, or increased acreage received into the program going up to 220 million acres across this country. Now, it would look like the acreage is capped around 36.4 million acres, but there have been new rules made on about half of American cropland making it now eligible for CRP. It was brought up in this new announcement and the timing is flawed. 
The new rules give the worst lands the lowest rate, the best lands the highest rate. So right now we have figures coming in from the different counties and it could be on dirt farms as low as $17 an acre. What happens when you get a bid to take lands out of production at $17 an acre--I do not care what you do on that land, it will produce more than $17 an acre. So, what is happening is that the good land is going into the CRP--in other words, taken out of production--and we will farm our worst land, having the exact opposite effect that was desired in the first place. 
The process is a burden to participants if you have between now and this month of March to sign up. Just think, that has to go to the local level, whenever you make those arrangements, that application for CRP. It goes from the local board to the State board to the Federal board before it is approved back to the farmer. The farmer does not know what he will be planting or harvesting this year. 
It could be June or July. In fact, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, Philip McClain, testified before the House Forestry Resource and Conservation and Research Subcommittee and expressed his concern that the USDA will not decide which offers being made by the growers during that March CRP signup will be accepted into most areas until June. Now, if it is July in our country--in other words, the winter wheat people are really put at a disadvantage if you are in the southern climes. In the northern climes, it is too late to plant a spring crop. The delayed signup really puts a hardship on wheat growers, no matter in which part of the country you farm--whether it's Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, or going on north to the Canadian border. 
So the National Association of Wheat Growers, all at once over the weekend, has said, wait a minute here, we need immediate congressional action, maybe to recommend that we extend the present contracts, which expire this fall and which qualify for participation under the current eligibility criteria. I think that is a good recommendation. Even the USDA State staff feels that the problems that are associated with this program make a mockery of the intent of the program. It does not provide the original intent of why CRP was put in in the first place. 
So I recommend to the Department of Agriculture--and they have time, I think, to look at this, and, if not, I think Congress should take a very serious look at it, because it is just not fair if you have a program that will work exactly the opposite from what was intended and put all the grain producers at a disadvantage. I suggest that the Secretary extend the current program for 1 year. Let's give it some time and take a look at it and try to get the desired results and rewrite the rules to reflect the intent of the program. The intent of the program was to take marginal land out of production so that we can manage watershed, we can manage soil erosion, we can manage wetlands, potholes, all of the environmental concerns that this country has. We can take a look at this, given more time to do it. Of course, these recommendations are supported by the National Association of Wheat Growers. 
So with this in mind, with the good record of CRP, a program that has been highly successful in doing two things that were most desired in rural America, I think it is only right to extend those rules through the program this year. Let's look at it, and this time we might be able to get it right. Right now, we are extending some programs that would suggest exactly the opposite.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today there will be legislation that will be introduced in the Congress having to do with estate taxes. I know estate taxes and capital gains are viewed by many as tax relief for the rich. Last week, a week ago today, I was watching a television program and there was a financial organization, or a mutual fund, who had declared that they had been so successful that they have to declare a capital gain. The people who had investments in that mutual fund would be assessed a tax because of those capital gains. I didn't see one rich man in that line that came down to complain about that. So it is not just that. 
If you are really concerned about keeping farmers on the land and letting young farmers get started, we have to start taking a look at capital gains, because I think we have to lower the average age of the farmers today, and also estate taxes, so that we can pass these farms and ranches and small businesses on to the next generation. 
Mr. President, I see my time has expired. I yield the floor.

Mr. BURNS. 
Mr. President, when I want to communicate, sometimes I send a postcard. In that case, I know not to say anything that I don't want printed on the front page of the newspaper. Somebody, anybody, can read it. When I buy an envelope and put a stamp on it, I am taking a step toward securing that information. I have a reasonable expectation that people will not open my mail. 
When I talk on the telephone--at least on a landline telephone--I have a reasonable expectation that nobody is listening in. Today, we are in a world that is characterized by the fact that nearly everyone has a computer and that those computers are, for the most part, connected to one another. In light of that fact, it is becoming more and more important to ensure that our communications over these computer networks are conducted in a secure way. It is no longer possible to say that when we move into the information age, we'll secure these networks, because we are already there. We use computers in our homes and businesses in a way that couldn't have been imagined 10 years ago, and these computers are connected through networks, making it easier to communicate than ever before. This phenomenon holds the promise of transforming life in States like Montana, where health care and state-of-the-art education can be delivered over networks to people located away from population centers. These new technologies can improve the lives of real people, but only if the security of information that moves over these networks is safe and reliable. 
The problem today is that our computer networks are not as secure as they could be; it is fairly easy for amateur hackers to break into our networks. They can intercept information; they can steal trade secrets and intellectual property; they can alter medical records; the list is endless. Last Congress, FBI Director Freeh stated his profound concerns about the threat of economic espionage on a global basis. One solution to this, of course, is to let individuals and businesses alike to take steps to secure that information. Encryption is one technology that accomplishes that. Domestically, Americans are free to use strong encryption to secure their information--we are determined to make sure that that guarantee prevails. 
I rise today to introduce a bill, similar to one I introduced during the 104th Congress, which designed to promote electronic commerce, both domestically and globally, by facilitating the use of strong encryption. Last Congress, my bill was criticized for not acknowledging the legitimate law enforcement and national security interests raised by the widespread use of strong, or unbreakable encryption. In response to those criticisms, this Congress, working with Senator Leahy, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Lott, has modified this bill to address those concerns. Our approach, though, encourages Government officials to abandon the head-in-the-sand approach that they've taken for the past 7 years, hoping that strong encryption would not become available globally, and take a proactive approach to addressing this technology. Because everyone agrees that this technology will eventually be widely available globally--many of us believe that the technology is already widely available globally--now is the time to get industry working with Government officials to teach them how to execute their duties in a global communications network where strong encryption is ubiquitous. 
We believe that this bill lays the most responsible course for addressing this technology, and I am pleased to announce that the following Senators have signed onto this bill as original cosponsors: Majority Leader Lott, Assistant Majority Leader Nickles, Senator Dorgan, Senator Wyden, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Senator Craig, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Domenici, Senator Murray, Senator Brownback, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Inhofe, Senator Boxer, Senator Faircloth, Senator Thomas, Senator Grams, and Senator Allard. With such impressive bipartisan support, I am extremely optimistic that the bill will be reported out of the Commerce Committee quickly and will pass the Senate during this Congress. 
As I mentioned earlier, this legislation was drafted to not only address the concerns raised by industry but also to encourage law enforcement and national security officials to prepare themselves to do their job in an environment where strong, unbreakable encryption is everywhere. To date, the FBI/NSA/CIA have devoted their efforts in this area to maintaining the status quo and hoping that strong encryption does not become common worldwide. The evidence from a Commerce Department study conducted over a year ago, indicates that this has already taken place--the study identified 497 foreign-made products that were capable of offering encryption at a level in excess of that which domestic companies could export under the present export restrictions in 28 foreign countries. Therefore, this legislation encourages these officials to address this technology proactively. Essentially the bill was designed to accomplish the following: 
Ending the imposition of U.S. Government-designed encryption standards. This is accomplished by restricting the Department of Commerce [NIST] from imposing Government encryption standards intended for use by the private sector, and by prohibiting the Department of Commerce from setting de facto encryption standards through use of export controls. 
Promoting the use of commercial encryption. This is accomplished by prohibiting the restrictions on the sale of commercial encryption programs and products in interstate commerce; by prohibiting governmental imposition, expressly or in practice, of mandatory key escrow; and by permitting the export of, first, generally available software with encryption capabilities, and second, other software and hardware with encryption capabilities if exports of products with similar security have been exported for use by foreign financial institutions. 
Protecting the national security and public safety. This is accomplished by, first, imposing industry reporting requirements upon companies wishing to export products with strong encryption; second, creating an Information Security Board whose purpose is to get industry experts and law enforcement/national security officers to work together--both publicly and privately--to address the execution of law enforcement/national security functions in an environment where strong encryption has widely proliferated; and third, by prohibiting exports of particular encryption software and hardware to identified individuals or organizations in specific foreign countries if there is substantial evidence that it will be diverted to, or modified for, military or terrorist end-use. 
We believe that getting law enforcement and national security officials to address this technology proactively is a more responsible and defensible position than mandating a key escrow or other key recovery system upon industry. 
This legislation is vitally important to a wide range of domestic industries. The export restriction poses serious commercial threats to three distinct classes of industry: first, the industry that manufacturers and sells encryption software and hardware; second, industries that purchase encryption hardware and software and incorporate that technology into their products; and third, all industries that communicate with subsidiaries or customers over the global communications network.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, I rise in strong support of this bill. 
Mr. President, this bill simply prohibits Federal tax funds from being used to pay for or promote assisted suicide or euthanasia. Specifically, the bill will prevent Federal funding for items or services `the purpose of which is to cause, or assist in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual.' The prohibition will encompass Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employees Health Program, medical services for prisoners, and the military health care system. 
This bill does not create any limitation with regard to the withholding or withdrawing of medical treatment or of nutrition or hydration, or affect funding for abortion or for alleviating pain or discomfort for patients. 
The American people oppose taxpayer funding of assisted suicide by an overwhelming margin. In addition, the American Medical Association has endorsed this bill. Yet States are free to legalize assisted suicide, as Oregon has by referendum, and this raises the prospect of Federal Medicaid dollars being used to facilitate suicide. The Federal Government must not be in the business of promoting death. Let's listen to the American people and settle the question of publicly funding assisted suicide once and for all. I urge my colleague to join us in supporting the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the balanced budget amendment, the constitutional amendment. I think it is properly named Senate Joint Resolution 1 because it is one of the most important acts that this Congress, I think anyway, will achieve. 
My home State of Montana has had that balanced budget amendment law since its inception when it joined the Union in 1889. So, living with fiscal prudence has always been our way of life. Even though there are times when we strayed from this, and had our ups and downs, we always produced a little bit of a surplus, which we had this last time, and the State returned it to the taxpayers. The Federal Government could learn a lot just looking at the example of the States. 
For example, according to the Congressional Budget Office, if we do not pass this legislation and we stay with the present trend, it has been pointed out that the deficit will be over 2 1/2 times in 10 years what it was in the year of 1996. Using CBO's numbers, our national debt will rise from $3.7 trillion to over $6 trillion by the year 2007. Every day that goes by without a balanced budget is another step closer to financial calamity for the United States. Around 40 cents of every tax dollar you send to us goes to pay the interest on the national debt, $344 billion last year alone. That is as much as we have spent on law enforcement, education, environment, energy, transportation, agriculture, and technology combined. 
I guess in order to understand what we are doing here you have to boil it down to where the average American family can make sense of it and how it relates to them. Over the life of a 30-year mortgage on a $75,000 home, it means a savings of around $71,000; savings of $1,000 on the life of a 4-year loan on an automobile worth $15,000; savings of $1,800 over the life of a 10-year student loan at $11,000. By the way, I am experiencing some of that, and that means quite a lot to this Senator. The grand total of all the savings of these loans will be around $74,000 over the lifetime. I think that is something that we cannot just overlook or ignore as a consumer. 
A small State like Montana--we are small businesses, ranching, farming--uses these savings to expand our businesses, thus expanding the economy of Montana. 
That is one thing that we have to do in this country. We have to continually expand the economy. If you want to do something for people to ensure jobs, job opportunity, and work opportunity, we cannot stand at the same trough and at the same side of the pie. We have to grow the pie. 
In the legislative branch we have to enact this amendment because it seems that we can't rely on the current administration to furnish or enact policies that will provide for further deficit-reduction measures. Sometimes we can't even do it ourselves. The President vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which would have led to a balanced budget by the year 2002. All told, this year the omnibus appropriations for fiscal year 1997 added back $70 billion of Federal spending because of pressure from the White House. 
Finally, the President has publicly stated that he would like to see the legislation fail. In fact, the President, Secretary Rubin, and Members of this Chamber have been working overtime to ensure that this amendment does not pass. 
What is wrong with passing an amendment, sending it to the States, and letting the States decide, getting closer to the people? Unfortunately, some of these individuals have been trying to undermine the balanced budget constitutional amendment by suggesting that if we include Social Security in the equation, this would cause future harm to the Social Security trust fund and thereby the next generation of seniors. I would like to state flatly that that is exactly the opposite of what we are trying to do here. We are trying to save and strengthen Social Security. 
The President has even admitted that no one could balance the budget without the Social Security funds. The President said that. 
This is a false argument. It is a risky gimmick that causes undue anxiety among our people. 
So my fellow Members believe that Social Security will have to fight it out with other programs if tied to the amendment. This is not the case. Money has already been allocated, and it will remain in these trust funds. We should not be needlessly scaring people into believing that their futures are uncertain. We would never cut Social Security to balance this budget. 
So it is a risky business whenever you start talking about setting the Social Security trust fund off to the side and not being included in the budget process. 
If you do not include Social Security in this amendment, our deficit will immediately increase by an additional $465 billion during fiscal year 1998 through the year 2002, and by another $602 billion during fiscal year 2003 to the year 2007, for a total of $l.067 trillion over a 10-year period. Excluding this provision will actually make it more difficult to choose which programs will stay and which will be cut away. 
So why would anybody suggest anything different? As we know, the balanced budget constitutional amendment will force lawmakers to make some tough decisions. That is the way it should be. We have always lived in a life of priorities. 
If we are to save our Nation from future heavy debt and uncertainty, hopefully we will follow the course of what the States do every day. We would hope at least to have a surplus. 
I come out of county government. We maintain surpluses in every line item. We always maintain reserves. There is a reason for that because of the tax collection. It makes you maintain reserves. It is prudent to do it. 
Nobody knows what the future holds. The American people look to us to provide those funds in the event of emergencies. You cannot do it without maintaining reserves. 
So I maintain that to keep safe and secure the future programs like those which are meant to protect our senior citizens and our children, that we have to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It just makes good sense. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I introduce a bill which would establish a Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Court of Appeals. 
This commission would study the present division of the United States into the several judicial circuits, study the structure and alignment of the Federal Court of Appeals system, with particular reference to the ninth circuit, and report recommendations to the President and Congress on appropriate changes in circuit boundaries or structure for the expeditious and effective disposition of the caseload of the Federal Court of Appeals, consistent with fundamental conceptions of fairness and due process. 
As you may know, I have cosponsored legislation in the past that would have split the ninth circuit. I have not altered my opinion of the need for this, however, it seems that some of my colleagues need a little bit more convincing. That is why I believe having a well-formed commission, which examines this issue closely and delivers a nonpolitical response, will dispel the doubts that my colleagues have about a split. 
I believe that the commission will begin to answer some of the concerns that Montanans have voiced that they are not obtaining the same level of judicial consideration as others in the ninth circuit. Considering the size of the district, I have the same doubts. The ninth circuit is now comprised not only of Montana, but also, Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, the Northern Mariana Islands, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. That's nine States and two principalities. The ninth circuit is about twice the size of the next largest circuit, both in population and geography. 
Its caseload is among the fastest growing in the Nation, and the time to complete an average appeal, more than 14 months, is more than 4 months longer than the national average. Its 28 judges are about twice the recommended number for an appellate circuit. 
Any objective view of the ninth circuit is a case study in the phrase `Justice delayed is justice denied.' I am optimistic that a commission that studies the ninth will come to the same conclusion: This body will acknowledge this travesty and finally move for justice for all.

Mr. BURNS. At 12:30 the Senate will recess until 2:15 for the weekly policy conferences to meet. When the Senate reconvenes after the conferences, the majority leader would expect an additional period for morning business to accommodate a number of Senators who would like to speak this afternoon. 
As for the schedule for the remainder of the week, the majority leader understands that the Banking Committee will be taking action today on the nomination of Andrew Cuomo to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. It is his hope that the full Senate will consider this nomination either today or tomorrow. The majority leader will notify all colleagues accordingly when that becomes scheduled. 
It is also the majority leader's hope that this week the Senate will consider the nomination of William Daley to be Secretary of Commerce. It is believed the Commerce Committee will finish their work on that nomination tomorrow, Wednesday. 
Therefore the Senate may act on Mr. Daley on Wednesday or Thursday of this week. 
Once again, Senators should expect rollcall votes on these important nominations this week. The majority leader thanks all Members in advance for their cooperation.

We have just completed visits to countries where we have a very high investment in military, and let me tell my colleagues in the Senate that we still live in a pretty tough world. Our challenges are still there. 
Not only does she bring to her position experience from academia but also the administrative arm of our Government and the legislative side. So I am certain that she knows how this process works. Based on that knowledge, I think she knows how to work with this Congress and forms a solid foundation of trust and openness that is required of all of us. 
Considering Secretary Christopher's introduction at the Foreign Relations Committee hearing and Ambassador Albright's testimony in which she stated, `I can assure you that I am going to tell it like it is here and also when I go abroad,' I am hopeful that her relationship with the Congress will be an open one and an honest one. 
By her frankness, however, there are issues which concern those of us who live in the State of Montana. We may disagree with the Ambassador in some areas. Although she has promised that `one of the major goals of this administration is to make sure that the American economic lifeline is protected,' the Ambassador has also stated she is supportive of the fast track provision to include Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement. Treaties like NAFTA have not exactly been a windfall for my State of Montana. And the mere suggestion of expanding it does not sit well when you have been impacted like we have, being a border State. 
As legislators and leaders, we must ensure that free and fair trade is part of any treaty, and if it is not, then those treaties or agreements should not even be considered. I hope the Ambassador will remember this vital element when negotiating as a U.S. representative around the world. 
Also, in the past, I have had great concerns about what I have perceived as her overly enthusiastic willingness to use American troops abroad just from some of the statements she has made. 
I see she did in her testimony give a statement that would raise our comfort level a little more, and I think that statement is good enough for me. I have always believed that the United States should never forget that sending our troops into dangerous situations should only be done when our national security is in jeopardy. Ambassador Albright seems to understand the gravity of this concept, and I am now assured that she will not take such action when policies face that kind of situation. 
Based on that, and I know we are squeezed for time and there are many statements to be made about this wonderful lady, I hope that my colleagues will support her to be confirmed in this nomination. 
I thank my friend from New Hampshire. I yield the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.

Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, until the leader takes the floor of the U.S. Senate, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
